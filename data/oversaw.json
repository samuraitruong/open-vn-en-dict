Gala performances and celebratory television programmes have been taking place. An epic patriotic film featuring many of China's biggest stars has been released. A ceremony at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing is being attended by the country's top leaders. The CPC has more than 80 million members, making it the biggest political party in the world. Established in July 1921 in Shanghai by a small group of intellectuals, it took power in 1949 after defeating the Nationalist Party in a long civil war. Under Mao Zedong, China's first communist leader, the CPC began the Great Leap Forward in 1958, a campaign to increase industrial production during which millions starved. Millions more are estimated to have died during the Cultural Revolution, a crusade launched by Mao in 1966 to purify the CPC. But after Mao's death in 1976, his successor Deng Xiaoping introduced market reforms which helped turn China into the world's second-largest economy. The BBC's Michael Bristow in Beijing says hundreds of millions no longer battle poverty, and many are richer than they could ever have hoped. No dissent \"History has proved that only the CPC can save China,\" declared a commentary from the state-run Xinhua news agency on Thursday. Ultimately, the CPC continues to rule because it does not allow anyone else to, our correspondent adds. Ahead of Friday's anniversary, propaganda officials <em>oversaw</em> the production of a film on the founding of the CPC, Beginning of the Great Revival. There have also been a new official history book, and a large number of exhibitions. The government also launched a new $33bn high-speed rail link, while the country's first aircraft carrier may begin sea trials on Friday.

            "en": "Tech innovator had been battling pancreatic cancer for years Oct. 5, 2011 -- Steve Jobs, the visionary co-founder of Apple Inc. who revolutionized the way we use technology, died today after fighting advanced pancreatic cancer since 2004. The death was announced by the company he helped found. \"Apple has lost a visionary and creative genius, and the world has lost an amazing human being,\" Apple stated in a note on its web site. \"Those of us who have been fortunate enough to know and work with Steve have lost a dear friend and an inspiring mentor. Steve leaves behind a company that only he could have built, and his spirit will forever be the foundation of Apple.\" Unlike many famous people diagnosed with cancer or other fatal illnesses, Jobs revealed few details about his health after he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. That was also true when he resigned from the company in August 2011.\u00a0 Jobs\u2019 shed little insight on his condition in this excerpt from his letter to the Apple Board of Directors: \u201cI have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple\u2019s CEO, I would be the first to let you know. Unfortunately, that day has come. I hereby resign as CEO of Apple. I would like to serve, if the Board sees fit, as Chairman of the Board, director and Apple employee.\u201d He was, however, willing to talk about death, as he did in 2005 commencement speech at Stanford University. He shared his relief at the time that he was diagnosed with a rare form of pancreatic cancer -- one did not mean an immediate death sentence.\u00a0 Yet he was realistic about his future: \u201cRemembering that I\u2019ll be dead soon is the most important tool I\u2019ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything -- all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure -- these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.\u201d Legendary career In his nearly four-decade career, Jobs <em>oversaw</em> the development of some of the most iconic tech products of the past half century. He co-founded Apple Computer Inc. in 1976. Based in Cupertino, Calif., the company developed one of the first commercially successful personal computers, the Apple II. Less than 10 years after its founding, though, Apple\u2019s business had lost its momentum, and, in 1985, Jobs was forced to resign. A year later, Jobs helped found Pixar, the independent animation studio that produced Toy Story and its two sequels, Monsters Inc., Ratatouille, and a host of others Academy Award-winning computer-animated films. Jobs returned to Apple in 1996. The following year he was named CEO, a position he resigned in August 2011. Back to Apple During his second tenure at Apple, the company introduced the iPod, the iPhone, and, most recently, the iPad. The popularity of each propelled Apple into its current position as one of the world\u2019s most valuable technology companies. Meanwhile, its Macintosh line of personal computers has, over the past several years, transformed the company from an also-ran to a top seller in the PC market. But as Jobs was reviving Apple, his own health was suffering. Jobs' pancreatic cancer In 2004, Jobs was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer when a neuroendocrine tumor was discovered in his pancreas. This type of tumor accounts for 3% of all pancreatic tumors.  The distinction between types of pancreatic cancer is an important one. Whereas the most common form of pancreatic cancer is quite aggressive and deadly, neuroendocrine pancreatic cancer typically progresses slowly and is often treatable. \u201cNeuroendocrine cancer has a much better prognosis,\u201d says Rodney Pommier, MD, a surgeon at Oregon Health and Sciences University and an expert in neuroendocrine cancer. Pommier did not participate in Jobs\u2019s care. Jobs had surgery in 2004 to remove the tumor, after which he returned to work. Five years later, though, he took another medical leave of absence from Apple. This time, he underwent a liver transplant at Methodist University Hospital in Memphis. Throughout his illness, Jobs preferred privacy over public disclosure of the details of his condition, and the reason for the liver transplant was never disclosed. There was speculation at the time that it was done because his cancer had spread to his liver. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0",

            "en": "Obituary: Robert McNamara          Former American secretaries of defence seldom get such widespread obituaries as Robert S McNamara. Despite a distinguished career which saw him at the centre of power or influence at some of the most troubled times of the 20th Century, it was Errol Morris's 2003 film, The Fog of War, subtitled Eleven Lessons from the Life of Robert McNamara, which singled out this former defence secretary. In the film, McNamara spoke frankly about the Vietnam war, the Cuban missile crisis and World War II, giving a behind-the-scenes account of the context in which important decisions were taken, in so doing raising questions about the nature of war and human behaviour. Cuban Missile Crisis A brilliant statistician, he was drafted to help develop methods of statistical control for managing the strategic bombing campaigns against Germany and Japan. He worked with General Curtis LeMay on the firebombing of 67 Japanese cities that killed almost a million people, 100,000 on one night in wooden Tokyo. In The Fog of War, he agreed with LeMay's assertion that the pair \"were behaving as war criminals\" and would have been tried as such had their side lost. In 1946, McNamara was hired by the Ford Motor company to rejuvenate its flagging sales. He rose to become the first president of the company outside the Ford family. He was one of the first to introduce safety features in order to reduce the death rate in crashes. But in 1960, he was snapped up by President John F Kennedy to become his defence secretary. In this post, he reformed Pentagon practices, <em>oversaw</em> a huge military build-up and was centrally involved in the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, when Soviet nuclear missiles were discovered in Cuba and the world teetered on the brink of a nuclear war for 13 days. Hate figure In the film, he described Gen LeMay, at that time an adviser to Kennedy, and Fidel Castro, as the two most dangerous personalities of that crisis. Gen LeMay wanted to attack Cuba unilaterally, while Mr Castro, he said, told him that he had pressed Soviet leader Nikita Krushchev to attack the United States with nuclear weapons if the US invaded. During the Vietnam War, McNamara supported US efforts to prevent the victory of Communist insurgents over the government of South Vietnam. To anti-war protesters at the time, McNamara became something of a hate figure, an arrogant ultra-hawk responsible for escalating the war. Yet recently-released tapes of conversations between McNamara and President Lyndon Johnson, used in The Fog of War, reveal Johnson chiding his defence secretary for having advised Kennedy to pull American military advisers out of Vietnam. Instead, Johnson put ground troops into Vietnam following the Gulf of Tonkin incident in which, it was claimed, Vietnamese torpedo boats had attacked US warships. McNamara confirmed that these attacks never actually took place. Haunted by Vietnam By 1966, McNamara had begun to question the wisdom of US involvement in Vietnam and, a year later, was privately advising Johnson to end the war by negotiation. He initiated a full investigation of the American commitment to Vietnam. But Johnson escalated the war further by bombing North Vietnam. McNamara left the job in 1968. The war eventually claimed the lives of three million Vietnamese and 58,000 Americans. Almost immediately, he took up the presidency of the World Bank where he remained until 1981, focusing on the developing world. In later years, he became a prolific author and lecturer. His role in the Vietnam War continued to haunt him, though. It was his memoir, In Retrospect: The Tragedy and Lessons of Vietnam (1995), which inspired The Fog of War movie. He described the war as \"terribly wrong\" owing to a combination of the anti-communist climate of the times, mistaken assumptions of foreign policy and military misjudgements. Critics claimed his admission came 30 years too late. In 2004, at the age of 88, he married 70-year-old Diana Byfield. It was his second marriage - his first wife Margaret, to whom he was married for 40 years, died of cancer in 1981. Robert McNamara once said, \"I don't believe we should apply our power unilaterally. If we can't persuade nations with similar values, we'd better re-examine our reasoning.\"",
