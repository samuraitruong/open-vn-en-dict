            "en": "The worst shoes for your feet     Culprit: Ultra-high heels\u00a0  \"Heels are getting higher and higher,\" says Hillary Brenner, DPM. \"We podiatrists like to call it shoe-icide.\" Brenner, a spokeswoman for the american podiatric medical association, says ultra-high heels can lead to everything from ankle sprains to chronic pain. Let's take a closer look at the heights, styles, and woes of today's footwear. Problem: Pump bump  Whether they're sky-high or mid-heel, this style is notorious for causing a painful knot on the back of the heel. The rigid material presses on a bony deformity which some women have called a \"pump bump.\" The pressure leads to blisters, swelling, bursitis, even pain in the Achilles tendon. Ice, orthotics, and heel pads may provide pain relief \u2026along with better shoes. The bony protrusion is permanent.\u00a0  Problem: Unnatural foot position Ultra-high heels force the feet into a position that puts stress on the ball of the foot. At this critical joint, the long metatarsal bones meet the pea-shaped sesamoid bones, and the toe bones (phalanges). Too much pressure can inflame these bones or the nerves that surround them. Chronic stress to the foot bones can even lead to hairline fractures. Solution: Go low Switching to lower heels will help you avoid problems with the metatarsal bones. The lower you go, the more natural your foot position will be. Brenner recommends choosing heels that are no more than 2 inches high -- and even those should be worn in moderation. Problem: Ankle sprains All high heels boost the risk of an ankle sprain. The most common problem is a lateral sprain, which happens when you roll onto the outside of your foot. This stretches the ankle ligaments beyond their normal length. A severe sprain may tear the ligaments. A sprained ankle should be immobilized and may need physical therapy to heal properly. The risk of developing osteoarthritis rises with a severe sprain or fracture of the ankle. Culprit: Stilettos Although all high heels can cause problems, the ultra narrow heels of stilettos are particularly risky. \"The weight is pinpointed on one area,\" Brenner tells WebMD. \"That makes you <em>wobble</em> like you're walking on stilts.\" The result is that you're more likely to trip and sprain your ankle. Solution: Chunky Heels A chunky heel has more surface area and distributes your weight more evenly. This makes the feet much more stable when compared to stilettos or spindle heels. Although thick high heels can still put stress on the ball of your foot, they may reduce the tripping hazard by minimizing your <em>wobble</em>. Culprit: Ballet flats Brenner compares these dainty shoes to walking on cardboard. \"There's no arch support whatsoever,\" she tells WebMD. That keeps the feet from functioning optimally and can lead to knee, hip, and back problems. Poor arch support is also associated with a painful foot condition called plantar fasciitis. Solution: Orthotic inserts If you love the look of ballet flats, over-the-counter inserts (shown here) may help prevent mild foot pain. Heel pads can provide extra cushioning for achy heels. And custom orthotics can ease a whole range of foot pains and problems. Podiatrists prescribe these inserts to provide arch support and reduce pressure on sensitive areas. Prescription orthotics can be pricey, but are sometimes covered by insurance. Culprit: Flip-flops Flip-flops offer very little protection. The risk of getting splinters or other foot injuries is higher when the feet are so exposed. People with diabetes should not wear flip-flops, because simple cuts and scrapes can lead to serious complications. In addition, many flip-flops provide no arch support. Like ballet flats, they can aggravate plantar fasciitis and cause problems with the knees, hips, or back. Problem: Plantar fasciitis A band of tissue called the plantar fascia runs along the bottom of the foot. It pulls on the heel when you walk -- and it works best with the proper arch in your foot. Walking barefoot, or in flimsy shoes without sufficient arch support, can overstretch, tear, or inflame the plantar fascia. This common condition can cause intense heel pain, and resting the feet only provides temporary relief. Better: 'Fitted' Flops Sporty, fitted sandals and other \"toning shoes\" are designed for a more intense workout while walking. The American Council on Exercise says there's no evidence to support that claim, but they may have other benefits. The thick sole keeps your foot off the ground and away from debris. And Brenner points out, \"they do have really good arch support.\" Several have a seal of approval from the American podiatric medical association. Culprit: Platform shoes Platform shoes tend to have rigid foot beds. \"That throws off the biomechanics of walking,\" Brenner says. \"Your foot is trying to bend a certain way, but the shoe is fighting you because it's so rigid.\" If the heel of the platform is much higher than the toe area, the shoe also puts pressure on the metatarsal bones. Better: Flatter platforms Although still not recommended, a flatter platform shoe may put less strain on your feet than its peers. Look for a wide wedge or platform that is nearly parallel with the ground. This will lessen the pressure on the ball of the foot. However, the rigid sole remains a barrier to the natural walking motion. Culprit: Pointy toes They might be stylish, but shoes with pointy toes squeeze the entire front of your foot together. After time, this can cause nerve pain, bunions, blisters, and hammertoes. Some women even develop bruises under their toenails from the constant pressure.  Problem: Bunions A bunion is a painful lump at the base of the big toe, which may cause the toe to bend unnaturally. It forms when the tissue or bone at the base joint gets displaced. This may happen after years of abnormal pressure and movement. Pointy-toed shoes are a common factor, which explains the prevalence of bunions among women. Problem: Toe Deformities High heeled shoes push too much body weight toward the toes and then squeeze them together. Over time, the result can be hammertoe, abnormal bends in the toe joints that can gradually become rigid. Surgery is sometimes needed to relieve the pain of severe hammertoe. Crowding can cause other toe deformities, along with continuous shoe friction, leading to painful corns and calluses. Solution: Wide toe box You can avoid the pointy toe perils by selecting boxier shoes. If that style doesn't appeal to you, look for shoes that slope to a point beyond the edge of your toes. A healthy style won't pinch the tips or sides of your toes. Brenner also suggests choosing a softer material, rather than stiff leather. Culprit: Celebrity trendsetters  Lady Gaga is known for her eccentric style, but you may want to think twice before stepping into the heel-less shoes she favors. The 12-inch mega-heels seen in her \"Bad Romance\" video are equally risky. As we've seen, putting so much stress on the ball of your foot can cause bone and nerve damage and pain. Solution: Performance pumps Many women are unwilling to trade style for comfort, but you may not have to choose between the two. Performance pumps offer a sound compromise, taking both fashion and your health into consideration. They are typically made with reinforced heels, athletic shoe construction, and more wiggle room for your toes. Culprit: Wrong size shoes Nine out of 10 women are wearing shoes that are too small. The consequences aren't pretty \u2013 calluses, blisters, bunions, corns, and other problems. The constant rubbing can irritate the joints in the foot and lead to arthritis. Research suggests many kids are also wearing the wrong shoe size, which puts them at risk for foot deformities as they grow. Solution: Measure your feet Before buying new shoes, have a professional measure the length and width of your feet at the end of the day, while you're standing. For unusually flat feet or high arches, an exam by a podiatrist may be warranted. These conditions can increase the risk of osteoarthritis. Early treatment and use of proper footwear may help to avoid unnecessary wear and tear on the joints of the foot. Men's trends Pointy-toed shoes have crossed the gender line. This footwear fad carries the same risk in men as in women \u2013 including hammertoes, bunions, and pain. To avoid these problems, stick with a boxier toe. At the office, a classic pair of oxfords or loafers may not turn heads, but your feet will thank you. Fitness trends: Minimalist shoe  Newer additions to the shoe scene are minimalist shoes. They aim to mimic the natural feel and mechanics of walking barefoot. Brenner is not impressed. \"There's no support for your heel or arch and no shock absorption,\" she says. In addition, in some brands, the products interfere with the natural walking position.  Fitness trends: Rocker bottoms Rocker bottom shoes facilitate the push-off motion as you walk. This style can help with joint pain, according to Brenner. It's also good for people with mild foot deformities. However, she does not recommend the shoe for older people or people with medical conditions that affect balance or muscle strength. 3 Tips for better shoes If you're ready to do right by your feet, Brenner offers these three tips: * Make sure the shoe bends at the toe box, but is not too flexible.  * Make sure there is a sufficient arch support.  * Choose a chunky heel that is less than 2 inches high.",

            "en": "7 REPETITION        22 FLIGHT DEMETRI LEFT US IN THE CHEERFULLY OPULENT RECEPTION area, where the woman Gianna was still at her post behind the polished counter. Bright, harmless music tinkled from hidden speakers. \"Do not leave until dark,\" he warned us. Edward nodded, and Demetri hurried away. Gianna did not seem at all surprised by the exchange, though she did eye Edward's borrowed cloak with shrewd speculation. \"Are you all right?\" Edward asked under his breath, too low for the human woman to hear. His voice was rough\u2014if velvet can be rough\u2014with anxiety. Still stressed by our situation, I imagined. \"You'd better make her sit before she falls,\" Alice said. \"She's going to pieces.\" It was only then that I realize I was shaking, shaking hard, my entire frame vibrating until my teeth chattered and the room around me seemed to <em>wobble</em> and blur in my eyes. For one wild second, I wondered if this was how Jacob felt just before exploding into a werewolf.  I heard a sound that didn't make sense, a strange, ripping counterpart to the otherwise cheery background music. Distracted by the shaking, I couldn't tell where it was coming from. \"Shh, Bella, shh,\" Edward said as he pulled me to the sofa farthest away from the curious human at the desk. \"I think she's having hysterics. Maybe you should slap her,\" Alice suggested. Edward threw a frantic glance at her. Then I understood. Oh. The noise was me. The ripping sound was the sobs coming from my chest. That's what was shaking me. \"It's all right, you're safe, it's all right,\" he chanted again and again. He pulled me onto his lap and tucked the thick wool cloak around me, protecting me from his cold skin. I knew it was stupid to react like this. Who knew how much time I had to look at his face? He was saved, and I was saved, and he could leave me as soon as we were free. To have my eyes so filled with tears that I could not see his features clearly was wasteful\u2014\u00a0 insanity. But, behind my eyes where the tears could not wash the image away, I could still see the panicked face of the tiny woman with the rosary. \"All those people,\" I sobbed. \"I know,\" he whispered. \"It's so horrible.\" \"Yes, it is. I wish you hadn't had to see that.\" I rested my head against his cold chest, using the thick cloak to wipe my eyes. I took a few deep breaths, trying to calm myself. \"Is there anything I can get you?\" a voice asked politely. It was Gianna, leaning over Edward's shoulder with a look that was both concerned and yet still professional and detached at the same time. It didn't seem to bother her that her face was inches from a hostile vampire. She was either totally oblivious, or very good at her job. \"No,\" Edward answered coldly. She nodded, smiled at me, and then disappeared. I waited until she was out of hearing range. \"Does she know what's going on here?\" I demanded, my voice low and hoarse. I was getting control of myself, my breathing evening out. \"Yes. She knows everything,\" Edward told me. \"Does she know they're going to kill her someday?\" \"She's knows it's a possibility,\" he said. That surprised me. Edward's face was hard to read. \"She's hoping they'll decide to keep her.\" I felt the blood leave my face. \"She wants to be one of them?\" He nodded once, his eyes sharp on my face, watching my reaction. I shuddered. \"How can she want that?\" I whispered, more to myself than really looking for an answer. \"How can she watch those people file through to that hideous room and want to be a part of that?\" Edward didn't answer. His expression twisted in response to something I'd said. As I stared at his too beautiful face, trying to understand the change, it suddenly struck me that I was really here, in Edward's arms, however fleetingly, and that we were not\u2014at this exact moment\u2014about to be killed. \"Oh, Edward,\" I cried, and I was sobbing again. It was such a stupid reaction. The tears were too thick for me to see his face again, and that was inexcusable. I only had until sunset for sure. Like a fairy tale again, with deadlines that ended the magic. \"What's wrong?\" he asked, still anxious, rubbing my back with gentle pats. I wrapped my arms around his neck\u2014what was the worst he could do? Just push me away\u2014and hugged myself closer to him. \"Is it really sick for me to be happy right now?\" I asked. My voice broke twice. He didn't push me away. He pulled me tight against his ice-hard chest, so tight it was hard to breathe, even with my lungs securely intact. \"I know exactly what you mean,\" he whispered. \"But we have lots of reasons to be happy. For one, we're alive.\" \"Yes,\" I agreed. \"That's a good one.\" \"And together,\" he breathed. His breath was so sweet it made my head swim. I just nodded, sure that he did not place the same weight on that consideration as I did. \"And, with any luck, we'll still be alive tomorrow.\" \"Hopefully,\" I said uneasily. \"The outlook is quite good,\" Alice assured me. She'd been so quiet, I'd almost forgotten her presence. \"I'll see Jasper in less than twenty-four hours,\" she added in a satisfied tone. Lucky Alice. She could trust her future. I couldn't keep my eyes off of Edward's face for long. I stared at him, wishing more than anything that the future would never happen. That this moment would last forever, or, if it couldn't, that I would stop existing when it did. Edward stared right back at me, his dark eyes soft, and it was easy to pretend that he felt the same way. So that's what I did. I pretended, to make the moment sweeter. His fingertips traced the circles under my eyes. \"You look so tired.\" \"And you look thirsty,\" I whispered back, studying the purple bruises under his black irises. He shrugged. \"It's nothing.\" \"Are you sure? I could sit with Alice,\" I offered, unwilling; I'd rather he killed me now than move one inch from where I was.  \"Don't be ridiculous.\" He sighed; his sweet breath caressed my face. \"I've never been in better control of that side of my nature than right now.\" I had a million questions for him. One of them bubbled to my lips now, but I held my tongue. I didn't want to ruin the moment, as imperfect as it was, here in this room that made me sick, under the eyes of the would-be monster. Here in his arms, it was so easy to fantasize that he wanted me. I didn't want to think about his motivations now\u2014about whether he acted this way to keep me calm while we were still in danger, or if he just felt guilty for where we were and relieved that he wasn't responsible for my death. Maybe the time apart had been enough that I didn't bore him for the moment. But it didn't matter. I was so much happier pretending. I lay quiet in his arms, re-memorizing his face, pretending\u2026 He stared at my face like he was doing the same, while he and Alice discussed how to get home. Their voices were so quick and low that I knew Gianna couldn't understand. I missed half of it myself. It sounded like more theft would be involved, though. I wondered idly if the yellow Porsche had made it back to its owner yet. \"What was all that talk about singers?\" Alice asked at one point. \"La tua cantante,\" Edward said. His voice made the words into music. \"Yes, that,\" Alice said, and I concentrated for a moment. I'd wondered about that, too, at the time. I felt Edward shrug around me. \"They have a name for someone who smells the way Bella does to me.\u00a0 They call her my singer\u2014because her blood sings for me.\" Alice laughed. I was tired enough to sleep, but I fought against the weariness. I wasn't going to miss a second of the time I had with him. Now and then, as he talked with Alice, he would lean down suddenly and kiss me\u2014his glass-smooth lips brushing against my hair, my forehead, the tip of my nose. Each time it was like an electric shock to my long dormant heart. The sound of its beating seemed to fill the entire room. It was heaven\u2014right smack in the middle of hell. I lost track of the time completely. So when Edward's arms tightened around me, and both he and Alice looked to the back of the room with wary eyes, I panicked. I cringed into Edward's chest as Alec\u2014his eyes now a vivid ruby, but still spotless in his light gray suit despite the afternoon meal\u2014walked through the double doors. It was good news. \"You're free to leave now,\" Alec told us, his tone so warm you'd think we were all lifelong friends. \"We ask that you don't linger in the city.\" Edward made no answering pretence; his voice was ice cold. \"That won't be a problem.\" Alec smiled, nodded, and disappeared again.  \"Follow the right hallway around the corner to the first set of elevators,\" Gianna told us as Edward helped me to my feet. \"The lobby is two floors down, and exits to the street. Goodbye, now,\" she added pleasantly. I wondered if her competence would be enough to save her.  Alice shot her a dark look. I was relieved there was another way out; I wasn't sure if I could handle another tour through the underground. We left through a tastefully luxurious lobby. I was the only one who glanced back at the medieval castle that housed the elaborate business facade. \u00a0I couldn't see the turret from here, for which I was grateful. The party was still in full swing in the streets. The street lamps were just coming on as we walked swiftly through the narrow, cobbled lanes. The sky was a dull, fading gray overhead, but the buildings crowded the streets so closely that it felt darker. The party was darker, too. Edward's long, trailing cloak did not stand out in the way it might have on a normal evening in Volterra. There were others in black satin cloaks now, and the plastic fangs I'd seen on the child in the square today seemed to be very popular with the adults. \"Ridiculous,\" Edward muttered once. I didn't notice when Alice disappeared from beside me. I looked over to ask her a question, and she was gone. \"Where's Alice?\" I whispered in a panic. \"She went to retrieve your bags from where she stashed them this morning.\" I'd forgotten that I had access to a toothbrush. It brightened my outlook considerably. \"She's stealing a car, too, isn't she?\" I guessed. He grinned. \"Not till we're outside.\" It seemed like a very long way to the entryway. Edward could see that I was spent; he wound his arm around my waist and supported most of my weight as we walked. I shuddered as he pulled me through the dark stone archway. The huge, ancient portcullis above was like a cage door, threatening to drop on us, to lock us in. He led me toward a dark car, waiting in a pool of shadow to the right of the gate with the engine running. To my surprise, he slid into the backseat with me, instead of insisting on driving. Alice was apologetic. \"I'm sorry.\" She gestured vaguely toward the dashboard. \"There wasn't much to choose from.\" \"It's fine, Alice.\" He grinned. \"They can't all be 911 Turbos.\" She sighed. \"I may have to acquire one of those legally. It was fabulous.\" \"I'll get you one for Christmas,\" Edward promised. Alice turned to beam at him, which worried me, as she was already speeding down the dark and curvy hillside at the same time. \"Yellow,\" she told him. Edward kept me tight in his arms. Inside the gray cloak, I was warm and comfortable. More than comfortable. \"You can sleep now, Bella,\" he murmured. \"It's over.\" I knew he meant the danger, the nightmare in the ancient city, but I still had to swallow hard before I could answer. \"I don't want to sleep. I'm not tired.\" Just the second part was a lie. I wasn't about to close my eyes. The car was only dimly lit by the dashboard controls, but it was enough that I could see his face. He pressed his lips to the hollow under my ear. \"Try,\" he encouraged. I shook my head. He sighed. \"You're still just as stubborn.\" I was stubborn; I fought with my heavy lids, and I won. The dark road was the hardest part; the bright lights at the airport in Florence made it easier, as did the chance to brush my teeth and change into clean clothes; Alice bought Edward new clothes, too, and he left the dark cloak on a pile of trash in an alley. The plane trip to Rome was so short that there wasn't really a chance for the fatigue to drag me under. I knew the flight from Rome to Atlanta would be another matter entirely, so I asked the flight attendant if she could bring me a Coke. \"Bella,\" Edward said disapprovingly. He knew my low tolerance for caffeine. Alice was behind us. I could hear her murmuring to Jasper on the phone. \"I don't want to sleep,\" I reminded him. I gave him an excuse that was believable because it was true. \"If I close my eyes now, I'll see things I don't want to see. I'll have nightmares.\" He didn't argue with me after that. It would have been a very good time to talk, to get the answers I needed\u2014needed but not really wanted; I was already despairing at the thought of what I might hear. We had an uninterrupted block of time ahead of us, and he couldn't escape me on an airplane\u2014well, not easily, at least. No one would hear us except Alice; it was late, and most of the passengers were turning off lights and asking for pillows in muted voices. Talk would help me fight off the exhaustion. But, perversely, I bit my tongue against the flood of questions. My reasoning was probably flawed by exhaustion, but I hoped that by postponing the discussion, I could buy a few more hours with him at some later time\u2014spin this out for another night, Scheherazade-style. So I kept drinking soda, and resisting even the urge to blink. Edward seemed perfectly content to hold me in his arms, his fingers tracing my face again and again. I touched his face, too. I couldn't stop myself, though I was afraid it would hurt me later, when I was alone again. He continued to kiss my hair, my forehead, my wrists\u2026 but never my lips, and that was good. After all, how many ways can one heart be mangled and still be expected to keep beating? I'd lived through a lot that should have finished me in the last few days, but it didn't make me feel strong. Instead, I felt horribly fragile, like one word could shatter me. Edward didn't speak. Maybe he was hoping I would sleep. Maybe he had nothing to say. I won the fight against my heavy lids. I was awake when we reached the airport in Atlanta, and I even watched the sun beginning to rise over Seattle's cloud cover before Edward slid the window shut. I was proud of myself. I hadn't missed one minute. Neither Alice nor Edward was surprised by the reception that waited for us at Sea-Tac airport, but it caught me off guard. Jasper was the first one I saw\u2014he didn't seem to see me at all. His eyes were only for Alice. She went quickly to his side; they didn't embrace like other couples meeting there. They only stared into each other's faces, yet, somehow, the moment was so private that I still felt the need to look away. Carlisle and Esme waited in a quiet corner far from the line for the metal detectors, in the shadow of a wide pillar. Esme reached for me, hugging me fiercely, yet awkwardly, because Edward kept his arms around me, too. \"Thank you so much,\" she said in my ear. Then she threw her arms around Edward, and she looked like she would be crying if that were possible. \"You will never put me through that again,\" she nearly growled. Edward grinned, repentant. \"Sorry, Mom.\" \"Thank you, Bella,\" Carlisle said. \"We owe you.\" \"Hardly,\" I mumbled. The sleepless night was suddenly overpowering. My head felt disconnected from my body. \"She's dead on her feet,\" Esme scolded Edward. \"Let's get her home.\" Not sure if home was what I wanted at this point, I stumbled, half-blind, through the airport, Edward dragging me on one side and Esme on the other. I didn't know if Alice and Jasper were behind us or not, and I was too exhausted to look. I think I was mostly asleep, though I was still walking, when we reached their car. The surprise of seeing Emmett and Rosalie leaning against the black sedan under the dim lights of the parking garage revived me some. Edward stiffened. \"Don't,\" Esme whispered. \"She feels awful.\" \"She should,\" Edward said, making no attempt to keep his voice down. \"It's not her fault,\" I said, my words garbled with exhaustion. \"Let her make amends,\" Esme pleaded.  \"We'll ride with Alice and Jasper.\"\u00a0 Edward glowered at the absurdly lovely blond vampire waiting for us. \"Please, Edward,\" I said. I didn't want to ride with Rosalie any more than he seemed to, but I'd caused more than enough discord in his family. He sighed, and towed me toward the car. Emmett and Rosalie got in the front seat without speaking, while Edward pulled me in the back again. I knew I wasn't going to be able to fight my eyelids anymore, and I laid my head against his chest in defeat, letting them close. I felt the car purr to life. \"Edward,\" Rosalie began. \"I know.\" Edward's brusque tone was not generous. \"Bella?\" Rosalie asked softly. My eyelids fluttered open in shock. It was the first time she'd ever spoken directly to me. \"Yes, Rosalie?\" I asked, hesitant. \"I'm so very sorry, Bella. I feel wretched about every part of this, and so grateful that you were brave enough to go save my brother after what I did. Please say you'll forgive me.\" The words were awkward, stilted because of her embarrassment, but they seemed sincere. \"Of course, Rosalie,\" I mumbled, grasping at any chance to make her hate me a little less. \"It's not your fault at all. I'm the one who jumped off the damn cliff. Of course I forgive you.\" The words came out like mush. \"It doesn't count until she's conscious, Rose,\" Emmett chuckled. \"I'm conscious,\" I said; it just sounded like a garbled sigh. \"Let her sleep,\" Edward insisted, but his voice was a little warmer. It was quiet then, except for the gentle thrum of the engine. I must have fallen asleep, because it seemed like seconds later when the door opened and Edward was carrying me from the car. My eyes wouldn't open. At first I thought we were still at the airport. And then I heard Charlie. \"Bella!\" he shouted from some distance. \"Charlie,\" I mumbled, trying to shake off the stupor. \"Shh,\" Edward whispered. \"It's okay; you're home and safe. Just sleep.\" \"I can't believe you have the nerve to show your face here.\" Charlie bellowed at Edward, his voice much closer now. \"Stop it, Dad,\" I groaned. He didn't hear me. \"What's wrong with her?\" Charlie demanded. \"She's just very tired, Charlie,\" Edward assured him quietly. \"Please let her rest.\" \"Don't tell me what to do!\" Charlie yelled. \"Give her to me. Get your hands off her!\" Edward tried to pass me to Charlie, but I clung to him with locked, tenacious fingers. I could feel my dad yanking on my arm. \"Cut it out, Dad,\" I said with more volume. I managed to drag my lids back to stare at Charlie with bleary eyes. \"Be mad at me.\" We were in front of my house. The front door was standing open. The cloud cover overhead was too thick to guess at a time of day. \"You bet I will be,\" Charlie promised. \"Get inside.\" \u201cO\u2019Kay. Let me down,\" I sighed. Edward set me on my feet. I could see that I was upright, but I couldn't feel my legs. I trudged forward anyway, until the sidewalk swirled up toward my face. Edward's arms caught me before I hit the concrete. \"Just let me get her upstairs,\" Edward said. \"Then I'll leave.\" \"No,\" I cried, panicking. I hadn't got my answers yet. He had to stay for at least that much, didn't he? \"I won't be far,\" Edward promised, whispering so low in my ear that Charlie didn't have a hope of hearing. I didn't hear Charlie answer, but Edward headed into the house. My open eyes only made it till the stairs. The last thing I felt was Edward's cool hands prying my fingers loose from his shirt.",

            "en": "EPILOGUE:AN OCCASION        EPILOGUE:AN OCCASION Edward helped me into his car, being very careful of the wisps of silk and chiffon, the flowers he'd just pinned into my elaborately styled curls, and my bulky walking cast. He ignored the angry set of my mouth. When he had me settled, he got in the driver's seat and headed back out the long, narrow drive. \"At what point exactly are you going to tell me what's going on?\" I asked grumpily. I really hated surprises. And he knew that. I'm shocked that you haven't figured it out yet.\" He threw a mocking smile in my direction, and my breath caught in my throat. Would I ever get used to his perfection? \"I did mention that you looked very nice, didn't I?\" I verified. \"Yes.\" He grinned again. I'd never seen him dress in black before, and, with the contrast against his pale skin, his beauty was absolutely surreal. That much I couldn't deny, even if the fact that he was wearing a tuxedo made me very nervous. Not quite as nervous as the dress. Or the shoe. Only one shoe, as my other foot was still securely encased in plaster. But the stiletto heel, held on only by satin ribbons, certainly wasn't going to help me as I tried to hobble around. \"I'm not coming over anymore if Alice is going to treat me like Guinea Pig Barbie when I do,\" I griped. I'd spent the better part of the day in Alice's staggeringly vast bathroom, a helpless victim as she played hairdresser and cosmetician. Whenever I fidgeted or complained, she reminded me that she didn't have any memories of being human, and asked me not to ruin her vicarious fun. Then she'd dressed me in the most ridiculous dress \u2014 deep blue, frilly and off the shoulders, with French tags I couldn't read \u2014 a dress more suitable for a runway than Forks. Nothing good could come of our formal attire, of that I was sure. Unless\u2026 but I was afraid to put my suspicions into words, even in my own head.  I was distracted then by the sound of a phone ringing. Edward pulled his cell phone from a pocket inside his jacket, looking briefly at the caller ID before answering. \"Hello, Charlie,\" he said warily. \"Charlie?\" I frowned. Charlie had been\u2026 difficult since my return to Forks. He had compartmentalized my bad experience into two defined reactions. Toward Carlisle he was almost worshipfully grateful. On the other hand, he was stubbornly convinced that Edward was at fault \u2014 because, if not for him, I wouldn't have left home in the first place. And Edward was far from disagreeing with him. These days I had rules that hadn't existed before: curfews\u2026 visiting hours. Something Charlie was saying made Edward's eyes widen in disbelief, and then a grin spread across his face. \"You're kidding!\" He laughed. \"What is it?\" I demanded. He ignored me. \"Why don't you let me talk to him?\" Edward suggested with evident pleasure. He waited for a few seconds. \"Hello, Tyler, this is Edward Cullen.\" His voice was very friendly, on the surface. I knew it well enough to catch the soft edge of menace. What was Tyler doing at my house? The awful truth began to dawn on me. I looked again at the inappropriate dress Alice had forced me into. \"I'm sorry if there's been some kind of miscommunication, but Bella is unavailable tonight.\" Edward's tone changed, and the threat in his voice was suddenly much more evident as he continued. \"To be perfectly honest, she'll be unavailable every night, as far as anyone besides myself is concerned. No offense. And I'm sorry about your evening.\" He didn't sound sorry at all. And then he snapped the phone shut, a huge smirk on his face. My face and neck flushed crimson with anger. I could feel the rage-induced tears starting to fill my eyes. He looked at me in surprise. \"Was that last part a bit too much? I didn't mean to offend you.\" I ignored that.  \"You're taking me to the prom!\" I yelled. It was embarrassingly obvious now. If I'd been paying any attention at all, I'm sure I would have noticed the date on the posters that decorated the school buildings. But I'd never dreamed he was thinking of subjecting me to this. Didn't he know me at all? He wasn't expecting the force of my reaction, that was clear. He pressed his lips together and his eyes narrowed. \"Don't be difficult, Bella.\" My eyes flashed to the window; we were halfway to the school already. \"Why are you doing this to me?\" I demanded in horror. He gestured to his tuxedo. \"Honestly, Bella, what did you think we were doing?\" I was mortified. First, because I'd missed the obvious. And also because the vague suspicions \u2014 expectations, really \u2014 that I'd been forming all day, as Alice tried to transform me into a beauty queen, were so far wide of the mark. My half-fearful hopes seemed very silly now. I'd guessed there was some kind of occasion brewing. But prom! That was the furthest thing from my mind. The angry tears rolled over my cheeks. I remembered with dismay that I was very uncharacteristically wearing mascara. I wiped quickly under my eyes to prevent any smudges. My hand was unblackened when I pulled it away; maybe Alice had known I would need waterproof makeup. \"This is completely ridiculous. Why are you crying?\" he demanded in frustration. \"Because I'm mad!\" \"Bella.\" He turned the full force of his scorching golden eyes on me. \"What?\" I muttered, distracted. \"Humor me,\" he insisted. His eyes were melting all my fury. It was impossible to fight with him when he cheated like that. I gave in with poor grace. \"Fine,\" I pouted, unable to glare as effectively as I would have liked. \"I'll go quietly. But you'll see. I'm way overdue for more bad luck. I'll probably break my other leg. Look at this shoe! It's a death trap!\" I held out my good leg as evidence. \"Hmmm.\" He stared at my leg longer than was necessary. \"Remind me to thank Alice for that tonight.\" \"Alice is going to be there?\" That comforted me slightly. \"With Jasper, and Emmett\u2026 and Rosalie,\" he admitted. The feeling of comfort disappeared. There had been no progress with Rosalie, though I was on quite good terms with her sometimes-husband. Emmett enjoyed having me around \u2014 he thought my bizarre human reactions were hilarious\u2026 or maybe it was just the fact that I fell down a lot that he found so funny. Rosalie acted as if I didn't exist. While I shook my head to dispel the direction my thoughts had taken, I thought of something else. \"Is Charlie in on this?\" I asked, suddenly suspicious. \"Of course.\" He grinned, and then chuckled. \"Apparently Tyler wasn't, though.\" I gritted my teeth. How Tyler could be so delusional, I couldn't imagine. At school, where Charlie couldn't interfere, Edward and I were inseparable \u2014 except for those rare sunny days. We were at the school now; Rosalie's red convertible was conspicuous in the parking lot. The clouds were thin today, a few streaks of sunlight escaping through far away in the west. He got out and walked around the car to open my door. He held out his hand. I sat stubbornly in my seat, arms folded, feeling a secret twinge of smugness. The lot was crowded with people in formal dress: witnesses. He couldn't remove me forcibly from the car as he might have if we'd been alone. He sighed. \"When someone wants to kill you, you're brave as a lion \u2014 and then when someone mentions dancing\u2026\" He shook his head. I gulped. Dancing. \"Bella, I won't let anything hurt you \u2014 not even yourself. I won't let go of you once, I promise.\" I thought about that and suddenly felt much better. He could see that in my face. \"There, now,\" he said gently, \"it won't be so bad.\" He leaned down and wrapped one arm around my waist. I took his other hand and let him lift me from the car. He kept his arm tightly around me, supporting me as I limped toward the school. In Phoenix, they held proms in hotel ballrooms. This dance was in the gym, of course. It was probably the only room in town big enough for a dance. When we got inside, I giggled. There were actual balloon arches and twisted garlands of pastel crepe paper festooning the walls. \"This looks like a horror movie waiting to happen,\" I snickered. \"Well,\" he muttered as we slowly approached the ticket table \u2014 he was carrying most of my weight, but I still had to shuffle and <em>wobble</em> my feet forward \u2014 \"there are more than enough vampires present.\" I looked at the dance floor; a wide gap had formed in the center of the floor, where two couples whirled gracefully. The other dancers pressed to the sides of the room to give them space \u2014 no one wanted to stand in contrast with such radiance. Emmett and Jasper were intimidating and flawless in classic tuxedos. Alice was striking in a black satin dress with geometric cutouts that bared large triangles of her snowy white skin. And Rosalie was\u2026 well, Rosalie. She was beyond belief. Her vivid scarlet dress was backless, tight to her calves where it flared into a wide ruffled train, with a neckline that plunged to her waist. I pitied every girl in the room, myself included. \"Do you want me to bolt the doors so you can massacre the unsuspecting townsfolk?\" I whispered conspiratorially. \"And where do you fit into that scheme?\" He glared. \"Oh, I'm with the vampires, of course.\" He smiled reluctantly. \"Anything to get out of dancing.\" \"Anything.\" He bought our tickets, then turned me toward the dance floor. I cringed against his arm and dragged my feet. \"I've got all night,\" he warned. Eventually he towed me out to where his family was twirling elegantly \u2014 if in a style totally unsuitable to the present time and music. I watched in horror. \"Edward.\" My throat was so dry I could only manage a whisper. \"I honestly can't dance!\" I could feel the panic bubbling up inside my chest. \"Don't worry, silly,\" he whispered back. \"I can.\" He put my arms around his neck and lifted me to slide his feet under mine. And then we were whirling, too. \"I feel like I'm five years old,\" I laughed after a few minutes of effortless waltzing. \"You don't look five,\" he murmured, pulling me closer for a second, so that my feet were briefly a foot from the ground. Alice caught my eye on a turn and smiled in encouragement \u2014 I smiled back. I was surprised to realize that I was actually enjoying myself\u2026 a little. \"Okay, this isn't half bad,\" I admitted. But Edward was staring toward the doors, and his face was angry. \"What is it?\" I wondered aloud. I followed his gaze, disoriented by the spinning, but finally I could see what was bothering him. Jacob Black, not in a tux, but in a long-sleeved white shirt and tie, his hair smoothed back into his usual ponytail, was crossing the floor toward us. After the first shock of recognition, I couldn't help but feel bad for Jacob. He was clearly uncomfortable \u2014 excruciatingly so. His face was apologetic as his eyes met mine. Edward snarled very quietly. \"Behave!\" I hissed. Edward's voice was scathing. \"He wants to chat with you.\" Jacob reached us then, the embarrassment and apology even more evident on his face. \"Hey, Bella, I was hoping you would be here.\" Jacob sounded like he'd been hoping the exact opposite. But his smile was just as warm as ever.  \"Hi, Jacob.\" I smiled back. \"What's up?\" \"Can I cut in?\" he asked tentatively, glancing at Edward for the first time. I was shocked to notice that Jacob didn't have to look up. He must have grown half a foot since the first time I'd seen him. Edward's face was composed, his expression blank. His only answer was to set me carefully on my feet, and take a step back. \"Thanks,\" Jacob said amiably. Edward just nodded, looking at me intently before he turned to walk away. Jacob put his hands on my waist, and I reached up to put my hands on his shoulders. \"Wow, Jake, how tall are you now?\" He was smug. \"Six-two.\" We weren't really dancing \u2014 my leg made that impossible. Instead we swayed awkwardly from side to side without moving our feet. It was just as well; the recent growth spurt had left him looking gangly and uncoordinated, he was probably no better a dancer than I was. \"So, how did you end up here tonight?\" I asked without true curiosity. Considering Edward's reaction, I could guess. \"Can you believe my dad paid me twenty bucks to come to your prom?\" he admitted, slightly ashamed. \"Yes, I can,\" I muttered. \"Well, I hope you're enjoying yourself, at least. Seen anything you like?\" I teased, nodding toward a group of girls lined up against the wall like pastel confections. \"Yeah,\" he sighed. \"But she's taken.\" He glanced down to meet my curious gaze for just a second \u2014 then we both looked away, embarrassed. \"You look really pretty, by the way,\" he added shyly. \"Um, thanks. So why did Billy pay you to come here?\" I asked quickly, though I knew the answer. Jacob didn't seem grateful for the subject change; he looked away, uncomfortable again. \"He said it was a 'safe' place to talk to you. I swear the old man is losing his mind.\" I joined in his laughter weakly. \"Anyway, he said that if I told you something, he would get me that master cylinder I need,\" he confessed with a sheepish grin. \"Tell me, then. I want you to get your car finished.\" I grinned back. At least Jacob didn't believe any of this. It made the situation a bit easier. Against the wall, Edward was watching my face, his own face expressionless. I saw a sophomore in a pink dress eyeing him with timid speculation, but he didn't seem to be aware of her. Jacob looked away again, ashamed. \"Don't get mad, okay?\" \"There's no way I'll be mad at you, Jacob,\" I assured him. \"I won't even be mad at Billy. Just say what you have to.\" \"Well \u2014 this is so stupid, I'm sorry, Bella \u2014 he wants you to break up with your boyfriend. He asked me to tell you 'please.'\" He shook his head in disgust. \"He's still superstitious, eh?\" \"Yeah. He was\u2026 kind of over the top when you got hurt down in Phoenix. He didn't believe\u2026\"Jacob trailed off self-consciously. My eyes narrowed. \"I fell.\" \"I know that,\" Jacob said quickly. \"He thinks Edward had something to do with me getting hurt.\" It wasn't a question, and despite my promise, I was angry.  Jacob wouldn't meet my eyes. We weren't even bothering to sway to the music, though his hands were still on my waist, and mine around his neck. \"Look, Jacob, I know Billy probably won't believe this, but just so you know\" \u2014 he looked at me now, responding to the new earnestness in my voice \u2014 \"Edward really did save my life. If it weren't for Edward and his father, I'd be dead.\" \"I know,\" he claimed, but he sounded like my sincere words had affected him some. Maybe he'd be able to convince Billy of this much, at least. \"Hey, I'm sorry you had to come do this, Jacob,\" I apologized. \"At any rate, you get your parts, right?\" \"Yeah,\" he muttered. He was still looking awkward\u2026 upset. \"There's more?\" I asked in disbelief. \"Forget it,\" he mumbled, \"I'll get a job and save the money myself.\" I glared at him until he met my gaze. \"Just spit it out, Jacob.\" \"It's so bad.\" \"I don't care. Tell me,\" I insisted. \"Okay\u2026 but, geez, this sounds bad.\" He shook his head. \"He said to tell you, no, to warn you, that \u2014 and this is his plural, not mine\" \u2014 he lifted one hand from my waist and made little quotations marks in the air \u2014 '\"We'll be watching.'\" He watched warily for my reaction. It sounded like something from a mafia movie. I laughed out loud. \"Sorry you had to do this, Jake,\" I snickered. \"I don't mind that much.\" He grinned in relief. His eyes were appraising as they raked quickly over my dress. \"So, should I tell him you said to butt the hell out?\" he asked hopefully. \"No,\" I sighed. \"Tell him I said thanks. I know he means well.\" The song ended, and I dropped my arms. His hands hesitated at my waist, and he glanced at my bum leg. \"Do you want to dance again? Or can I help you get somewhere?\" Edward answered for me. \"That's all right, Jacob. I'll take it from here.\" Jacob flinched, and stared wide-eyed at Edward, who stood just beside us. \"Hey, I didn't see you there,\" he mumbled. \"I guess I'll see you around, Bella.\" He stepped back, waving halfheartedly. I smiled. \"Yeah, I'll see you later.\" \"Sorry,\" he said again before he turned for the door. Edward's arms wound around me as the next song started. It was a little up-tempo for slow dancing, but that didn't seem to concern him. I leaned my head against his chest, content. \"Feeling better?\" I teased. \"Not really,\" he said tersely. \"Don't be mad at Billy,\" I sighed. \"He just worries about me for Charlie's sake. It's nothing personal.\" \"I'm not mad at Billy,\" he corrected in a clipped voice. \"But his son is irritating me.\" I pulled back to look at him. His face was very serious. \"Why?\" \"First of all, he made me break my promise.\" I stared at him in confusion. He half-smiled. \"I promised I wouldn't let go of you tonight,\" he explained. \"Oh. Well, I forgive you.\" \"Thanks. But there's something else.\" Edward frowned. I waited patiently. \"He called you pretty,\" he finally continued, his frown deepening. \"That's practically an insult, the way you look right now. You're much more than beautiful.\" I laughed. \"You might be a little biased.\" \"I don't think that's it. Besides, I have excellent eyesight.\" We were twirling again, my feet on his as he held me close. \"So are you going to explain the reason for all of this?\" I wondered. He looked down at me, confused, and I glared meaningfully at the crepe paper. He considered for a moment, and then changed direction, spinning me through the crowd to the back door of the gym. I caught a glimpse of Jessica and Mike dancing, staring at me curiously. Jessica waved, and I smiled back quickly. Angela was there, too, looking blissfully happy in the arms of little Ben Cheney; she didn't look up from his eyes, a head lower than hers. Lee and Samantha, Lauren, glaring toward us, with Conner; I could name every face that spiraled past me. And then we were outdoors, in the cool, dim light of a fading sunset. As soon as we were alone, he swung me up into his arms, and carried me across the dark grounds till he reached the bench beneath the shadow of the madrone trees. He sat there, keeping me cradled against his chest. The moon was already up, visible through the gauzy clouds, and his face glowed pale in the white light. His mouth was hard, his eyes troubled. \"The point?\" I prompted softly. He ignored me, staring up at the moon. \"Twilight, again,\" he murmured. \"Another ending. No matter how perfect the day is, it always has to end.\" \"Some things don't have to end,\" I muttered through my teeth, instantly tense. He sighed. \"I brought you to the prom,\" he said slowly, finally answering my question, \"because I don't want you to miss anything. I don't want my presence to take anything away from you, if I can help it. I want you to be human. I want your life to continue as it would have if I'd died in nineteen-eighteen like I should have.\" I shuddered at his words, and then shook my head angrily. \"In what strange parallel dimension would I ever have gone to prom of my own free will? If you weren't a thousand times stronger than me, I would never have let you get away with this.\" He smiled briefly, but it didn't touch his eyes. \"It wasn't so bad, you said so yourself.\" \"That's because I was with you.\" We were quiet for a minute; he stared at the moon and I stared at him. I wished there was some way to explain how very uninterested I was in a normal human life. \"Will you tell me something?\" he asked, glancing down at me with a slight smile. \"Don't I always?\" \"Just promise you'll tell me,\" he insisted, grinning. I knew I was going to regret this almost instantly. \"Fine.\" \"You seemed honestly surprised when you figured out that I was taking you here,\" he began. \"I was,\" I interjected. \"Exactly,\" he agreed. \"But you must have had some other theory\u2026 I'm curious \u2014 what did you think I was dressing you up for?\" Yes, instant regret. I pursed my lips, hesitating. \"I don't want to tell you.\" \"You promised,\" he objected. \"I know.\" \"What's the problem?\" I knew he thought it was mere embarrassment holding me back. \"I think it will make you mad \u2014 or sad.\"  His brows pulled together over his eyes as he thought that through. \"I still want to know. Please?\" I sighed. He waited. \"Well\u2026 I assumed it was some kind of\u2026 occasion. But I didn't think it would be some trite human thing\u2026 prom!\" I scoffed. \"Human?\" he asked flatly. He'd picked up on the key word. I looked down at my dress, fidgeting with a stray piece of chiffon. He waited in silence. \"Okay,\" I confessed in a rush. \"So I was hoping that you might have changed your mind\u2026 that you were going to change me, after all.\" A dozen emotions played across his face. Some I recognized: anger\u2026 pain\u2026 and then he seemed to collect himself and his expression became amused. \"You thought that would be a black tie occasion, did you?\" he teased, touching the lapel of his tuxedo jacket. I scowled to hide my embarrassment. \"I don't know how these things work. To me, at least, it seems more rational than prom does.\" He was still grinning. \"It's not funny,\" I said. \"No, you're right, it's not,\" he agreed, his smile fading. \"I'd rather treat it like a joke, though, than believe you're serious.\" \"But I am serious.\" He sighed deeply. \"I know. And you're really that willing?\" The pain was back in his eyes. I bit my lip and nodded. \"So ready for this to be the end,\" he murmured, almost to himself, \"for this to be the twilight of your life, though your life has barely started. You're ready to give up everything.\" \"It's not the end, it's the beginning,\" I disagreed under my breath. \"I'm not worth it,\" he said sadly. \"Do you remember when you told me that I didn't see myself very clearly?\" I asked, raising my eyebrows. \"You obviously have the same blindness.\" \"I know what I am.\" I sighed. But his mercurial mood shifted on me. He pursed his lips, and his eyes were probing. He examined my face for a long moment.  \"You're ready now, then?\" he asked. \"Um.\" I gulped. \"Yes?\" He smiled, and inclined his head slowly until his cold lips brushed against the skin just under the corner of my jaw. \"Right now?\" he whispered, his breath blowing cool on my neck. I shivered involuntarily. \"Yes,\" I whispered, so my voice wouldn't have a chance to break. If he thought I was bluffing, he was going to be disappointed. I'd already made this decision, and I was sure. It didn't matter that my body was rigid as a plank, my hands balled into fists, my breathing erratic\u2026 He chuckled darkly, and leaned away. His face did look disappointed. \"You can't really believe that I would give in so easily,\" he said with a sour edge to his mocking tone. \"A girl can dream.\" His eyebrows rose. \"Is that what you dream about? Being a monster?\" \"Not exactly,\" I said, frowning at his word choice. Monster, indeed. \"Mostly I dream about being with you forever.\" His expression changed, softened and saddened by the subtle ache in my voice. \"Bella.\" His fingers lightly traced the shape of my lips. \"I will stay with you \u2014 isn't that enough?\" I smiled under his fingertips. \"Enough for now.\" He frowned at my tenacity. No one was going to surrender tonight. He exhaled, and the sound was practically a growl. I touched his face. \"Look,\" I said. \"I love you more than everything else in the world combined. Isn't that enough?\" \"Yes, it is enough,\" he answered, smiling. \"Enough for forever.\" And he leaned down to press his cold lips once more to my throat.",
