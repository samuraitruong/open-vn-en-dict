A BBC correspondent said Saif al-Islam seemed confident and full of adrenalin. On Monday the rebels met strong resistance from pro-Gaddafi forces as they continued their push. Both sides say they control most of Tripoli. Saif al-Islam Gaddafi turned up at Hotel Rixos in the early hours of Tuesday. He told the BBC's Matthew Price: \"We have broken the backbone of the rebels.\" He added that by moving into Tripoli, the rebels had fallen into \"a trap\". \"We gave them a hard time, so we're winning,\" he said. Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, 39, had been widely regarded as a likely successor to his father. On Sunday the rebels claimed they had captured him, along with other members of his family. Asked if Col Gaddafi was safe and in Tripoli, Saif al-Islam replied: \"Of course.\" The Libyan leader's whereabouts are still unclear. His sprawling Bab al-Azizia compound is being defended by loyalist troops A diplomatic source told AFP news agency that Col Gaddafi could still be there. He has not been seen in public for months, although he has broadcast audio messages from undisclosed locations.  In a broadcast late on Sunday, he urged residents to \"save Tripoli\" from the rebels. In other developments: \u009f Pro-Gaddafi forces fire a suspected Scud missile from near their stronghold city of Sirte, US defence officials tell Reuters news agency  \u009f Col Gaddafi's eldest son Muhammad reportedly escaped from rebel custody hours after being detained  \u009f China and Russia issue statements urging Gaddafi forces to stop fighting  \u009f UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon says leaders of regional blocs will meet in New York later this week  \u009f Egypt formally recognises the rebel National Transitional Council as the legitimate representative of the Libyan people Ambush  The rebels swept into Tripoli from several direction following an uprising in the capital at the weekend. They who were greeted by jubilant crowds in central Green Square when they arrived on Sunday. Rebel fighters have set up checkpoints in parts of the city, and say reinforcements are arriving by boat. But they have met stiff resistance in a number of areas. There was sustained gunfire near the Bab al-Azizia compound in western Tripoli throughout Monday. Gaddafi loyalists also remain in control of the area further south around the Rixos Hotel, where many Western journalists are based. A rebel convoy coming in from the west was ambushed by Gaddafi loyalists using anti-aircraft fire on Monday. The convoy forced to pull out of the city. As night fell the fighting appeared to die down in many areas. Both sides insist they have the upper hand. Government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim claimed late pro-Gaddafi had control of at least 75% of the city, while the rebels said they were holding about 80%. Our correspondents says it is impossible to determine who is telling the truth. World leaders have urged Col Gaddafi to step down. US President Barack Obama said elements of the Gaddafi regime continued to pose a threat. \"But this much is clear: the Gaddafi regime is coming to an end and the future of Libya is in the hands of its people,\" he said. He appealed to Col Gaddafi to reduce further bloodshed by \"explicitly <em>relinquishing</em> power to the people of Libya and calling on those forces that continue to fight to lay down their arms\".",

            "en": "When a nation becomes liberalized, the economic effects can be profound for the country and for investors. Economic liberalization refers to a country \"opening up\" to the rest of the world with regards to trade, regulations, taxation and other areas that generally affect business in the country. As a general rule, you can determine to what degree a country is liberalized economically by how easy it is to invest and do business in the country. All developed countries (First World) have already gone through this liberalization process, so the focus in this article is more on the developing and emerging countries.  \u00a0 Removing Barriers to International Investing  Investing in emerging market countries can sometimes be an impossible task if the country you're investing in has several barriers to entry. These barriers can include tax laws, foreign investment restrictions, legal issues and accounting regulations that can make it difficult or impossible to gain access to the country. The economic liberalization process begins by relaxing these barriers and <em>relinquishing</em> some control over the direction of the economy to the private sector. This often involves some form of deregulation and a privatization of companies.  \u00a0 Unrestricted Flow of Capital  The primary goals of economic liberalization are the free flow of capital between nations and the efficient allocation of resources and competitive advantages. This is usually done by reducing protectionist policies such as tariffs, trade laws and other trade barriers. One of the main effects of this increased flow of capital into the country is that it makes it cheaper for companies to access capital from investors. A lower cost of capital allows companies to undertake profitable projects that they may not have been able to with a higher cost of capital pre-liberalization, leading to higher growth rates.  \u00a0 We saw this type of growth scenario unfold in China in the late 1970s as the Chinese government set on a path of significant economic reform. With a massive amount of resources (both human and natural), they believed the country was not growing and prospering to its full potential. Thus, to try to spark faster economic growth, China began major economic reforms that included encouraging private ownership of businesses and property, relaxing international trade and foreign investment restrictions, and relaxing state control over many aspects of the economy. Subsequently, over the next several decades, China averaged a phenomenal real GDP growth rate of over 10%.  \u00a0 Stock Market Performance  In general, when a country becomes liberalized, the stock market values also rise. Fund managers and investors are always on the lookout for new opportunities for profit, and so a whole country that becomes available to be invested in will tend to cause a surge of capital to flow in. The situation is similar in nature to the anticipation and flow of money into an initial public offering (IPO). A private company that was previously unavailable to an investor that suddenly becomes available typically causes a similar valuation and cash flow pattern. However, like an IPO, the initial enthusiasm also eventually dies down and returns become more normal and more in line with fundamentals. \u00a0 Political Risks Reduced  In addition, liberalization reduces the political risks to investors. For the government to continue to attract more foreign investment, other areas beyond the ones mentioned earlier have to be strengthened as well. These are areas that support and foster a willingness to do business in the country such as a strong legal foundation to settle disputes, fair and enforceable contract laws, property laws, and others that allow businesses and investors to operate with confidence. Also, government bureaucracy is a common target area to be streamlined and improved in the liberalization process. All these changes together lower the political risks for investors, and this lower level of risk is also part of the reason the stock market in the liberalized country rises once the barriers are gone. \u00a0 Diversification for Investors  Investors can also benefit by being able to invest a portion of their portfolio into a diversifying asset class. In general, the correlation between developed countries such as the United States and undeveloped or emerging countries is relatively low. Although the overall risk of the emerging country by itself may be higher than average, adding a low correlation asset to your portfolio can reduce your portfolio's overall risk profile.  \u00a0 However, a distinction should be made that although the correlation may be low, when a country becomes liberalized, the correlation may actually rise over time. This happens because the country becomes more integrated with the rest of the world and has become more sensitive to events that happen outside the country. A high degree of integration can also lead to increased contagion risk \u2013 which is the risk that crises that occur in different countries cause crises in the domestic country. \u00a0 A prime example of this is the European Union (EU) and its unprecedented economic and political union. The countries in the EU are so integrated with regard to monetary policy and laws that a crisis in one country has a high probability of spreading to other countries in the EU. This is exactly what happened in the financial crisis that started in 2008-2009. Weaker countries within the EU (such as Greece) began to develop severe financial problems that quickly spread to other EU members. In this instance, investing in several different EU member countries would not have provided much of a diversification benefit as the high level of economic integration in the EU had increased correlations and increased contagion risks to the investor.  \u00a0 The Bottom Line Economic liberalization is generally thought of as a beneficial and desirable process for emerging and developing countries. The underlying goal is to have unrestricted capital flowing into and out of the country in order to boost growth and efficiencies within the home country. The effects following liberalization are what should interest investors as it can provide new opportunities for diversification and profit.  \u00a0",
