Others, though, are fascinated by the prospect that a computer might create something as original and\u00a0subtle as our best artists So far, only one has come close. Composer David Cope\u00a0invented a program called Experiments in Musical Intelligence, or EMI, Not only did\u00a0EMI create compositions in Cope s style, but also that of the most revered classical\u00a0composers, including Bach, Chopin and Mozart. Audiences were moved to tears, and\u00a0EMI even fooled classical music experts into thinking they were hearing genuine Bach.\u00a0Not everyone was impressed however. Some, such as Wiggins, have blasted Cope's\u00a0work as <em>pseudoscience</em>, and condemned him for his deliberately vague explanation of\u00a0how the software worked. Meanwhile. Douglas Hofstadter of Indiana University said\u00a0EMI created replicas which still rely completely on the original artist\u2019s creative impulses,\u00a0When audiences found out the truth they were often outraged with Cope, and one music\u00a0lover even tried to punch him.
