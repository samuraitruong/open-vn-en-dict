It has been used for hundreds of years in traditional Chinese medicine. Turmeric is packed with flavor so it adds a <em>zesty</em> taste to food and is typically found in curry. Its vibrant color comes from the curcumin it contains. Curcumin is a polyphenol, which is great at fighting the cold and flu. It is high in antioxidants and has anti-inflammatory properties.",
