            "en": "Constipation in infants and children    CONSTIPATION OVERVIEW Constipation is a common problem in children of all ages. A child with constipation may have bowel movements less frequently than normal, hard bowel movements, or large, difficult, and painful bowel movements. Most children with constipation do not have an underlying medical problem causing their symptoms. Constipation generally resolves with changes in diet, behavior, or sometimes with medicine. You can try some of these treatments at home. If home treatment is not helpful, talk to your child's healthcare provider. This article will focus on the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of constipation. More detailed information about constipation in infants and children is available by subscription. (See \"Prevention and treatment of acute constipation in infants and children\" and \"Treatment of chronic functional constipation and fecal incontinence in infants and children\".) NORMAL VERSUS ABNORMAL BOWEL HABITS The \"normal\" amount of time between bowel movements in an infant or child depends upon their age and what they eat. The look of the bowel movement can also vary. Normal bowel habits \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * During the first week of life, infants pass approximately four soft or liquid bowel movements per day (generally more in breast- compared with bottle-fed infants). (See \"Patient information: Deciding to breastfeed\".) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * During the first three months of life, breastfed infants have about three soft bowel movements per day. Some breastfed infants have a bowel movement after each feeding, whereas others have only one bowel movement per week. Infants who breastfeed are rarely constipated. (See \"Patient information: Common breastfeeding problems\".) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Most formula-fed infants have two to three bowel movements per day, although this depends on which formula is given; some soy and cow's milk-based formulas cause harder bowel movements, while other formulas (eg, Alimentum Advance\u00ae, Pregestimil\u00ae, GoodStart\u00ae, and Nutramigen LIPIL\u00ae) can cause looser bowel movements. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * By two years of age, a child typically has one to two formed bowel movements per day. \u00a0\u00a0 * By four years of age, a child usually has one or two formed bowel movements per day. Abnormal bowel habits \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * An infant who is constipated typically has bowel movements that look hard or pellet-like. The infant may cry while trying to move his or her bowels. The infant may have bowel movements less frequently than before. Fewer could mean that the infant has a bowel movement every one to two days rather than their previous normal of three to four per day. You may be worried that your infant is constipated if your child looks like he or she is straining. Because infants have weak abdominal muscles, they often strain during a bowel movement, causing their face to appear red. The infant is unlikely to be constipated if he or she passes a soft bowel movement within a few minutes of straining. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * If your child has fewer bowel movements than usual or complains of pain during a bowel movement, he or she may be constipated. For example, a child who normally has one to two bowel movements every day may be constipated if he or she has not had a bowel movement in two days. A child who normally has a bowel movement every two days is not constipated, as long as the bowel movement is reasonably soft and is not difficult or painful to pass. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Many children with constipation develop unusual habits when they feel the urge to have a bowel movement. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * - Infants may arch their back, tighten their buttocks, and cry. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * - Toddlers may rock back and forth while stiffening their buttocks and legs, arch their back, stand on their tiptoes, and wriggle or fidget, or they may squat or get into other unusual positions. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * - Children may hide in a corner or some other special place while doing this \"dance\". Although these movements may look like the child is trying to have a bowel movement, the child is actually trying NOT to have a bowel movement because they are frightened of the toilet or worry that having the bowel movement will be painful. WHY CONSTIPATION DEVELOPS Pain \u2014 A child may delay moving their bowels if they do not have a place where they feel comfortable having a bowel movement, or if they are busy and ignore the need to use the toilet. When the child does have a bowel movement, it can be painful and lead them to withhold (avoid going) in an effort to avoid more pain. On occasion, a child may develop a tear in the anus (called an anal fissure) after passing a large or hard bowel movement. The pain from the tear can lead to withholding. Even infants can learn to withhold because of pain. (See \"Patient information: Anal fissure\".) Treatment is recommended if your child has hard or painful stools. Treating pain early can help prevent your child from withholding, which can lead to chronic constipation and leakage of bowel movements. Medical problems \u2014 Medical problems cause constipation in less than 5 percent of all children.  The most common medical problems that cause constipation include Hirschsprung disease (an abnormality of nerves in the colon), abnormal development of the anus, problems absorbing nutrients, spinal cord abnormalities, and certain medicines. In most cases, a doctor can rule out these problems by asking questions and performing a physical examination.  CONSTIPATION AND DEVELOPMENT Constipation is particularly common at three times in an infant and child's life: after starting cereal and pur\u00e9ed foods, during toilet training, and after starting school. Parents can help by being aware of these high-risk times, working to prevent constipation, recognizing the problem if it develops, and acting quickly so that constipation does not become a bigger problem. Transition to solid diet \u2014 Infants who are transitioning from breast milk or formula to solid foods may experience constipation. An infant who develops constipation during this time can be treated with one of the measures described below.  Toilet training \u2014 Children are at risk for constipation during toilet training for several reasons.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * If a child is not ready or interested in using the toilet, he or she may try to avoid going to the bathroom (called withholding), which can lead to constipation. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Children who have experienced a hard or painful bowel movement are even more likely to withhold, and this only worsens the problem. If your child is withholding during the toilet training process, stop toilet training temporarily. Encourage your child to sit on the toilet as soon as they feel the urge to have a bowel movement and give positive reinforcement (a hug, kiss, or words of encouragement) for recognizing the urge and sitting, whether or not the child is successful. In addition, be sure the child has foot support, especially while using an adult-sized toilet. Foot support is important because it provides a place for the child to push against as he or she bears down to move their bowels. The stool also helps a child to feel more stable.  For all children, encourage a routine, <em>unhurried</em> time on the toilet. The best time is often after a meal because eating stimulates the bowels. Keeping the child company while in the bathroom can help to keep the child's calm. School entry \u2014 Once your child starts school, you may not be aware if he or she has problems going to the bathroom. Some children are reluctant to use the bathroom at school because it is unfamiliar or too \"public\", and this can lead to withholding. Continue to monitor your child's bowel movements when the child starts school for the first time (eg, kindergarten) and after long absences (eg, summer or winter breaks). You can do this by monitoring how often your child has a bowel movement while at home, particularly on weekends. Ask your child if he or she has any problems trying to have a bowel movement away from home; if limited time or embarrassment is an issue, you can work with your child and/or school to find a solution. HOME TREATMENTS FOR CONSTIPATION You can try using home remedies first to relieve your child's constipation. These remedies should begin to work within 24 hours; if your child does not have a bowel movement with 24 hours or if you are worried, call your child's doctor or nurse for advice. Infants \u2014 If your child is younger than four months old, talk to a doctor or nurse about treatment of constipation. For infants of any age, contact the child's doctor if there are concerning signs or symptoms (severe pain, rectal bleeding) along with constipation. The following treatments are for infants with constipation who are older than four months. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Dark corn syrup \u2014 Dark corn syrup has been a folk remedy for constipation for hundreds of years. Dark corn syrup contains complex sugar proteins that keep water in the bowel movement. However, current types of dark corn syrup may not contain these sugar proteins, so the syrup may not be helpful. Light corn syrup is not helpful. For an infant who is healthy, a doctor or nurse may recommend adding one-quarter teaspoon to one teaspoon (1.25 to 5 mL) of dark corn syrup to four ounces of formula or expressed breast milk. Use the lowest dose initially; you can increase the amount up to a total of one teaspoon per four ounces of formula or expressed breast milk until the infant has a daily bowel movement. After your child's bowel movements become soft and more frequent, you can slowly stop the corn syrup. You can give corn syrup whenever the bowel movements start to get too hard, until your child begins eating cereal or solid foods. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Fruit juice \u2014 If your infant is at least four months old, you can give certain fruit juices to treat constipation. This includes prune, apple, or pear juice (other juices are not as helpful). You can give a total of two to four ounces of 100 percent fruit juice per day for children 4 to 8 months old. You can give up to six ounces of fruit juice per day to infants 8 and 12 months old. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * High-fiber foods \u2014 If your infant has started eating solid foods, you can substitute barley cereal for rice cereal. You can also offer other high-fiber fruits and vegetables (or pur\u00e9es), including apricots, sweet potatoes, pears, prunes, peaches, plums, beans, peas, broccoli, or spinach. You can mix fruit juice (apple, prune, pear) with cereal or the fruit/vegetable pur\u00e9e. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Formulas with iron \u2014The iron in infant formula does not cause or worsen constipation because the dose of iron is very small. Therefore, changing to a low-iron formula is not recommended because this will not help with the constipation. Your doctor or nurse may recommend a different type of formula; consult them before making any formula changes.  Iron drops contain higher amounts of iron, and may sometimes cause constipation. Therefore, infants who need iron drops sometimes also need extra diet changes or treatments to make sure that they do not get constipated. Children \u2014 If your child has been constipated for a short time, changing what he or she eats may be the only treatment needed. You can make these changes as often as needed so that the child has soft and painless bowel movements. If your child does not have a bowel movement within 24 hours of trying the following suggestions, call your child's doctor or nurse. If your child has worrisome symptoms (severe pain, rectal bleeding) with constipation or you have questions, call your child's doctor or nurse before using any of the following treatments. Dietary recommendations \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Fruit juice \u2014 Certain fruit juices can help to soften bowel movements. These include prune, apple, or pear (other juices are not as helpful). Do not give more than four to six ounces of 100 percent fruit juice per day to children between one and six years of age; children older than seven years may drink up to two four-ounce servings per day. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Fluids \u2014 It is not necessary to drink large amounts of fluid to treat constipation, although it is reasonable to be sure that the child drinks enough fluid. For children older than one year, enough fluid is defined as 32 ounces (960 mL) or more water or other non-milk liquids per day. It is not necessary or helpful for the child to drink more fluid than this if he or she is not thirsty.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Food recommendations \u2014 Offer your child a well-balanced diet, including whole grain foods, fruits, and vegetables. However, do not force these foods and do not use a high fiber diet instead of other treatments.  Praise your child for trying these foods, and encourage him or her to eat them frequently, but do not force these foods if your child is unwilling to eat them. You should offer a new food 8 to 10 times before giving up. You may want to avoid giving (or give smaller amounts of) certain foods while your child is constipated, including cow's milk, yogurt, cheese, and ice cream. A fiber supplement may be recommended for some children. Fiber supplements are available in several forms, including wafers, chewable tablets, or powdered fiber that can be mixed in juice (or frozen into popsicles).\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Milk \u2014 Some children develop constipation because they are unable to tolerate the protein in cow's milk. If other treatments for constipation are not helpful, it may be reasonable for the child to avoid all cow's milk (and milk products) for one to two weeks. If your child does not improve during this time, you can begin giving cow's milk again. If the child does not drink milk for a long time, ask your child's doctor or nurse for suggestions about ways to be sure that the child gets enough calcium and vitamin D. Stop toilet training \u2014 If your child develops constipation while learning to use the toilet, stop toilet training temporarily. It is reasonable to wait two to three months before restarting toilet training. Reassure your child that it will not hurt to poop, and praise the child for sitting on the toilet, even if he or she does not have a bowel movement. Avoid punishing or pressuring the child.  Establish regular toilet time \u2014 If your child is toilet trained, encourage him or her to sit on the toilet for 5 to 10 minutes once or twice a day after eating. The child is more likely to have a bowel movement after a meal, especially breakfast. Reward the child with praise or attention for sitting, even if he or she does not have a bowel movement. Reading to the child or keeping him/her company while in the bathroom can help to keep the child's interest and encourage cooperation.  MEDICAL EVALUATION OF CONSTIPATION Some infants and children have concerning symptoms with constipation or have constipation that does not improve with home treatments. In these situations, your child should see a doctor or nurse. The doctor or nurse will ask you (and your child, if appropriate) when constipation began, if there was a painful bowel movement, and how often the child normally has a bowel movement. Mention any other symptoms (such as pain, vomiting, decreased appetite), how much the child drinks, and if you have seen blood in the child's bowel movements.  The doctor or nurse will do a physical examination, and may do a rectal examination. Most children with constipation will not require any laboratory testing or x-rays. RECURRENT CONSTIPATION If your infant or child has repeated episodes of constipation (called recurrent constipation), work with your child's doctor or nurse to figure out why this is happening. (See \"Treatment of chronic functional constipation and fecal incontinence in infants and children\".) Possible reasons for recurrent constipation include: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Fear of pain due to hard stools or an anal fissure (a small tear in the anal opening) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Fear of using the bathroom away from home \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Not having enough time to use the bathroom \"Clean out\" treatment \u2014 If your child has recurrent constipation, continue to follow the suggestions for home treatment above. Your child may also need a \"clean out\" treatment to help empty the bowels. This treatment may include a medicine (eg, polyethylene glycol [Miralax\u00ae]), an enema or rectal suppository (a pill that you insert in the child's bottom), or a combination of treatments. Consult your child's doctor or nurse before giving any of these treatments.  Maintenance treatment \u2014 After the \"clean out\" treatment, most infants and children are treated with a laxative for several months or longer. You can adjust the amount of laxative so that the child has one soft bowel movement per day.  Although many of these laxatives are available without a prescription, it is important to consult with your child's doctor or nurse before giving laxatives on a regular basis. Parents are often concerned about giving laxatives, fearing the child will not be able to have a bowel movement when the laxative is stopped. Using laxatives does not increase the risk of constipation in the future. Instead, careful use of laxatives can actually prevent long-term problems with constipation by breaking the cycle of pain and withholding, and helping the child to develop healthy toileting habits. Some children need to continue using a laxative treatment for months or even years. After the child has regular bowel movements and uses the toilet alone for at least six months, it is reasonable to talk about decreasing and eventually stopping the laxative with the child's doctor or nurse. Do not stop the laxative too soon because constipation could return and the child would need to start over with treatment. Rescue treatment \u2014 It is possible for a child to have a large bowel movement collect in the colon, even while using laxatives. Develop a \"rescue\" plan with your child's doctor or nurse in case this happens. If the child has not had a bowel movement for two to three days, a \"clean out\" treatment and an increased dose of the maintenance laxative are usually recommended. Behavior changes \u2014 In children who have constipation frequently, behavior changes are recommended to help the child develop normal bowel habits. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Encourage your child to sit on the toilet within 30 minutes after meals (ie, for 5 to 10 minutes, two to three times per day). Do this every day. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Design a reward system with your child to recognize the child's efforts. Give the reward after the child sits (the child does not have to have a bowel movement). \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Keep a diary of your child's bowel movements, medicines, pain, and accidents. This will help you and your child's doctor or nurse figure out if there are triggers for constipation. Dietary suggestions \u2014 There are a number of myths about dietary treatments for constipation in children and infants. Drinking extra fluids and eating a high-fiber diet are not enough to treat repeated episodes of constipation in children; most children also need a laxative and behavior changes.  Treatment follow-up \u2014 After beginning treatment for constipation, most doctors and nurses recommend periodic follow-up phone calls or visits to check on the child. Infants and children with constipation often need adjustments in treatment as they grow and there are changes in their diet and daily routine. WHEN TO SEEK HELP Call your child's doctor or nurse immediately (during the day or night) if your child has severe abdominal or rectal pain. In addition, call your child's doctor or nurse if any of the following occurs: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Your child has not had a bowel movement within 24 hours of starting constipation treatment \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Your infant (younger than 4 months) has not had a bowel movement within 24 hours of their normal pattern (eg, if an infant who normally has a bowel movement every two days goes three days without a bowel movement) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Your infant (younger than 4 months) has hard (rather than soft or pasty) stools \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * You see blood in your child's bowel movement or diaper \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Your child has repeated episodes of constipation \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Your child complains of pain with bowel movements \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * You have questions or concerns about your child's bowel habits",

            "en": "13        13. CONFESSIONS Edward in the sunlight was shocking. I couldn't get used to it, though I'd been staring at him all afternoon. His skin, white despite the faint flush from yesterday's hunting trip, literally sparkled, like thousands of tiny diamonds were embedded in the surface. He lay perfectly still in the grass, his shirt open over his sculpted, incandescent chest, his scintillating arms bare. His glistening, pale lavender lids were shut, though of course he didn't sleep. A perfect statue, carved in some unknown stone, smooth like marble, glittering like crystal. Now and then, his lips would move, so fast it looked like they were trembling. But, when I asked, he told me he was singing to himself; it was too low for me to hear. I enjoyed the sun, too, though the air wasn't quite dry enough for my taste. I would have liked to lie back, as he did, and let the sun warm my face. But I stayed curled up, my chin resting on my knees, unwilling to take my eyes off him. The wind was gentle; it tangled my hair and ruffled the grass that swayed around his motionless form. The meadow, so spectacular to me at first, paled next to his magnificence. Hesitantly, always afraid, even now, that he would disappear like a mirage, too beautiful to be real\u2026 hesitantly, I reached out one finger and stroked the back of his shimmering hand, where it lay within my reach. I marveled again at the perfect texture, satin smooth, cool as stone. When I looked up again, his eyes were open, watching me. Butterscotch today, lighter, warmer after hunting. His quick smile turned up the corners of his flawless lips. \"I don't scare you?\" he asked playfully, but I could hear the real curiosity in his soft voice. \"No more than usual.\" He smiled wider; his teeth flashed in the sun. I inched closer, stretched out my whole hand now to trace the contours of his forearm with my fingertips. I saw that my fingers trembled, and knew it wouldn't escape his notice. \"Do you mind?\" I asked, for he had closed his eyes again. \"No,\" he said without opening his eyes. \"You can't imagine how that feels.\" He sighed. I lightly trailed my hand over the perfect muscles of his arm, followed\u00a0 the faint pattern of bluish veins inside the crease at his elbow. With my other hand, I reached to turn his hand over. Realizing what I wished, he flipped his palm up in one of those blindingly fast, disconcerting movements of his. It startled me; my fingers froze on his arm for a brief second. \"Sorry,\" he murmured. I looked up in time to see his golden eyes close again. \"It's too easy to be myself with you.\" I lifted his hand, turning it this way and that as I watched the sun glitter on his palm. I held it closer to my face, trying to see the hidden facets in his skin. \"Tell me what you're thinking,\" he whispered. I looked to see his eyes watching me, suddenly intent. \"It's still so strange for me, not knowing.\" \"You know, the rest of us feel that way all the time.\" \"It's a hard life.\" Did I imagine the hint of regret in his tone? \"But you didn't tell me.\" \"I was wishing I could know what you were thinking\u2026\" I hesitated. \"And?\" \"I was wishing that I could believe that you were real. And I was wishing that I wasn't afraid.\" \"I don't want you to be afraid.\" His voice was just a soft murmur. I heard what he couldn't truthfully say, that I didn't need to be afraid, that there was nothing to fear. \"Well, that's not exactly the fear I meant, though that's certainly something to think about.\" So quickly that I missed his movement, he was half sitting, propped up on his right arm, his left palm still in my hands. His angel's face was only a few inches from mine. I might have \u2014 should have \u2014 flinched away from his unexpected closeness, but I was unable to move.  His golden eyes mesmerized me. \"What are you afraid of, then?\" he whispered intently. But I couldn't answer. As I had just that once before, I smelled his cool breath in my face. Sweet, delicious, the scent made my mouth water. It was unlike anything else. Instinctively, unthinkingly, I leaned closer, inhaling. And he was gone, his hand ripped from mine. In the time it took my eyes to focus, he was twenty feet away, standing at the edge of the small meadow, in the deep shade of a huge fir tree. He stared at me, his eyes dark in the shadows, his expression unreadable. I could feel the hurt and shock on my face. My empty hands stung. \"I'm\u2026 sorry\u2026 Edward,\" I whispered. I knew he could hear. \"Give me a moment,\" he called, just loud enough for my less sensitive ears. I sat very still. After ten incredibly long seconds, he walked back, slowly for him. He stopped, still several feet away, and sank gracefully to the ground, crossing his legs. His eyes never left mine.  He took two deep breaths, and then smiled in apology. \"I am so very sorry.\" He hesitated. \"Would you understand what I meant if I said I was only human?\" I nodded once, not quite able to smile at his joke. Adrenaline pulsed through my veins as the realization of danger slowly sank in. He could smell that from where he sat. His smile turned mocking. \"I'm the world's best predator, aren't I? Everything about me invites you in \u2014 my voice, my face, even my smell. As if I need any of that!\" Unexpectedly, he was on his feet, bounding away, instantly out of sight, only to appear beneath the same tree as before, having circled the meadow in half a second. \"As if you could outrun me,\" he laughed bitterly. He reached up with one hand and, with a deafening crack, effortlessly ripped a two-foot-thick branch from the trunk of the spruce. He balanced it in that hand for a moment, and then threw it with blinding speed, shattering it against another huge tree, which shook and trembled at the blow. And he was in front of me again, standing two feet away, still as a stone. \"As if you could fight me off,\" he said gently. I sat without moving, more frightened of him than I had ever been. I'd never seen him so completely freed of that carefully cultivated facade. He'd never been less human\u2026 or more beautiful. Face ashen, eyes wide, I sat like a bird locked in the eyes of a snake. His lovely eyes seem to glow with rash excitement. Then, as the seconds passed, they dimmed. His expression slowly folded into a mask of ancient sadness. \"Don't be afraid,\" he murmured, his velvet voice unintentionally seductive. \"I promise\u2026\" He hesitated. \"I swear not to hurt you.\" He seemed more concerned with convincing himself than me. \"Don't be afraid,\" he whispered again as he stepped closer, with exaggerated slowness. He sat sinuously, with deliberately <em>unhurried</em> movements, till our faces were on the same level, just a foot apart. \"Please forgive me,\" he said formally. \"I can control myself. You caught me off guard. But I'm on my best behavior now.\" He waited, but I still couldn't speak. \"I'm not thirsty today, honestly.\" He winked. At that I had to laugh, though the sound was shaky and breathless. \"Are you all right?\" he asked tenderly, reaching out slowly, carefully, to place his marble hand back in mine. I looked at his smooth, cold hand, and then at his eyes. They were soft, repentant. I looked back at his hand, and then deliberately returned to tracing the lines in his hand with my fingertip. I looked up and smiled timidly. His answering smile was dazzling. \"So where were we, before I behaved so rudely?\" he asked in the gentle cadences of an earlier century. \"I honestly can't remember.\" He smiled, but his face was ashamed. \"I think we were talking about why you were afraid, besides the obvious reason.\" \"Oh, right.\" \"Well?\" I looked down at his hand and doodled aimlessly across his smooth, iridescent palm. The seconds ticked by. \"How easily frustrated I am,\" he sighed. I looked into his eyes, abruptly grasping that this was every bit as new to him as it was to me. As many years of unfathomable experience as he had, this was hard for him, too. I took courage from that thought. \"I was afraid\u2026 because, for, well, obvious reasons, I can't stay with you. And I'm afraid that I'd like to stay with you, much more than I should.\" I looked down at his hands as I spoke. It was difficult for me to say this aloud. \"Yes,\" he agreed slowly. \"That is something to be afraid of, indeed. Wanting to be with me. That's really not in your best interest.\" I frowned. \"I should have left long ago,\" he sighed. \"I should leave now. But I don't know if I can.\" \"I don't want you to leave,\" I mumbled pathetically, staring down again. \"Which is exactly why I should. But don't worry. I'm essentially a selfish creature. I crave your company too much to do what I should.\" \"I'm glad.\" \"Don't be!\" He withdrew his hand, more gently this time; his voice was harsher than usual. Harsh for him, still more beautiful than any human voice. It was hard to keep up \u2014 his sudden mood changes left me always a step behind, dazed. \"It's not only your company I crave! Never forget that. Never forget I am more dangerous to you than I am to anyone else.\" He stopped, and I looked to see him gazing unseeingly into the forest. I thought for a moment. \"I don't think I understand exactly what you mean \u2014 by that last part anyway,\" I said. He looked back at me and smiled, his mood shifting yet again. \"How do I explain?\" he mused. \"And without frightening you again\u2026 hmmmm.\" Without seeming to think about it, he placed his hand back in mine; I held it tightly in both of mine. He looked at our hands. \"That's amazingly pleasant, the warmth.\" He sighed. A moment passed as he assembled his thoughts. \"You know how everyone enjoys different flavors?\" he began. \"Some people love chocolate ice cream, others prefer strawberry?\" I nodded. \"Sorry about the food analogy \u2014 I couldn't think of another way to explain.\" I smiled. He smiled ruefully back. \"You see, every person smells different, has a different essence. If you locked an alcoholic in a room full of stale beer, he'd gladly drink it. But he could resist, if he wished to, if he were a recovering alcoholic. Now let's say you placed in that room a glass of hundred-year-old brandy, the rarest, finest cognac \u2014 and filled the room with its warm aroma \u2014 how do you think he would fare then?\" We sat silently, looking into each other's eyes \u2014 trying to read each other's thoughts. He broke the silence first. \"Maybe that's not the right comparison. Maybe it would be too easy to turn down the brandy. Perhaps I should have made our alcoholic a heroin addict instead.\" \"So what you're saying is, I'm your brand of heroin?\" I teased, trying to lighten the mood. He smiled swiftly, seeming to appreciate my effort. \"Yes, you are exactly my brand of heroin.\" \"Does that happen often?\" I asked. He looked across the treetops, thinking through his response. \"I spoke to my brothers about it.\" He still stared into the distance. \"To Jasper, every one of you is much the same. He's the most recent to join our family. It's a struggle for him to abstain at all. He hasn't had time to grow sensitive to the differences in smell, in flavor.\" He glanced swiftly at me, his expression apologetic. \"Sorry,\" he said. \"I don't mind. Please don't worry about offending me, or frightening me, or whichever. That's the way you think. I can understand, or I can try to at least. Just explain however you can.\" He took a deep breath and gazed at the sky again. \"So Jasper wasn't sure if he'd ever come across someone who was as\" \u2014 he hesitated, looking for the right word \u2014 \"appealing as you are to me.\u00a0 Which makes me think not. Emmett has been on the wagon longer, so to speak, and he understood what I meant. He says twice, for him, once stronger than the other.\" \"And for you?\" \"Never.\" The word hung there for a moment in the warm breeze. \"What did Emmett do?\" I asked to break the silence. It was the wrong question to ask. His face grew dark, his hand clenched into a fist inside mine. He looked away. I waited, but he wasn't going to answer. \"I guess I know,\" I finally said. He lifted his eyes; his expression was wistful, pleading. \"Even the strongest of us fall off the wagon, don't we?\" \"What are you asking? My permission?\" My voice was sharper than I'd intended. I tried to make my tone kinder \u2014 I could guess what his honesty must cost him. \"I mean, is there no hope, then?\" How calmly I could discuss my own death! \"No, no!\" He was instantly contrite. \"Of course there's hope! I mean, of course I won't\u2026\" He left the sentence hanging. His eyes burned into mine. \"It's different for us. Emmett\u2026 these were strangers he happened across. It was a long time ago, and he wasn't as\u2026 practiced, as careful, as he is now.\" He fell silent and watched me intently as I thought it through. \"So if we'd met\u2026 oh, in a dark alley or something\u2026\" I trailed off. \"It took everything I had not to jump up in the middle of that class full of children and \u2014\" He stopped abruptly, looking away. \"When you walked past me, I could have ruined everything Carlisle has built for us, right then and there. If I hadn't been denying my thirst for the last, well, too many years, I wouldn't have been able to stop myself.\" He paused, scowling at the trees. He glanced at me grimly, both of us remembering. \"You must have thought I was possessed.\" \"I couldn't understand why. How you could hate me so quickly\u2026\" \"To me, it was like you were some kind of demon, summoned straight from my own personal hell to ruin me. The fragrance coming off your skin\u2026 I thought it would make me deranged that first day. In that one hour, I thought of a hundred different ways to lure you from the room with me, to get you alone. And I fought them each back, thinking of my family, what I could do to them. I had to run out, to get away before I could speak the words that would make you follow\u2026\" He looked up then at my staggered expression as I tried to absorb his bitter memories. His golden eyes scorched from under his lashes, hypnotic and deadly. \"You would have come,\" he promised. I tried to speak calmly. \"Without a doubt.\" He frowned down at my hands, releasing me from the force of his stare. \"And then, as I tried to rearrange my schedule in a pointless attempt to avoid you, you were there \u2014 in that close, warm little room, the scent was maddening. I so very nearly took you then. There was only one other frail human there \u2014 so easily dealt with.\" I shivered in the warm sun, seeing my memories anew through his eyes, only now grasping the danger. Poor Ms. Cope; I shivered again at how close I'd come to being inadvertently responsible for her death. \"But I resisted. I don't know how. I forced myself not to wait for you, not to follow you from the school. It was easier outside, when I couldn't smell you anymore, to think clearly, to make the right decision. I left the others near home \u2014 I was too ashamed to tell them how weak I was, they only knew something was very wrong \u2014 and then I went straight to Carlisle, at the hospital, to tell him I was leaving.\" I stared in surprise.  \"I traded cars with him \u2014 he had a full tank of gas and I didn't want to stop. I didn't dare to go home, to face Esme. She wouldn't have let me go without a scene. She would have tried to convince me that it wasn't necessary\u2026 \"By the next morning I was in Alaska.\" He sounded ashamed, as if admitting a great cowardice. \"I spent two days there, with some old acquaintances\u2026 but I was homesick. I hated knowing I'd upset Esme, and the rest of them, my adopted family. In the pure air of the mountains it was hard to believe you were so irresistible. I convinced myself it was weak to run away. I'd dealt with temptation before, not of this magnitude, not even close, but I was strong. Who were you, an insignificant little girl\" \u2014 he grinned suddenly \u2014 \"to chase me from the place I wanted to be? So I came back\u2026\" He stared off into space. I couldn't speak. \"I took precautions, hunting, feeding more than usual before seeing you again. I was sure that I was strong enough to treat you like any other human. I was arrogant about it. \"It was unquestionably a complication that I couldn't simply read your thoughts to know what your reaction was to me. I wasn't used to having to go to such circuitous measures, listening to your words in Jessica's mind\u2026 her mind isn't very original, and it was annoying to have to stoop to that. And then I couldn't know if you really meant what you said. It was all extremely irritating.\" He frowned at the memory. \"I wanted you to forget my behavior that first day, if possible, so I tried to talk with you like I would with any person. I was eager actually, hoping to decipher some of your thoughts. But you were too interesting, I found myself caught up in your expressions\u2026 and every now and then you would stir the air with your hand or your hair, and the scent would stun me again\u2026 \"Of course, then you were nearly crushed to death in front of my eyes. Later I thought of a perfectly good excuse for why I acted at that moment \u2014 because if I hadn't saved you, if your blood had been spilled there in front of me, I don't think I could have stopped myself from exposing us for what we are. But I only thought of that excuse later. At the time, all I could think was, 'Not her.'\" He closed his eyes, lost in his agonized confession. I listened, more eager than rational. Common sense told me I should be terrified. Instead, I was relieved to finally understand. And I was filled with compassion for his suffering, even now, as he confessed his craving to take my life. I finally was able to speak, though my voice was faint. \"In the hospital?\" His eyes flashed up to mine. \"I was appalled. I couldn't believe I had put us in danger after all, put myself in your power \u2014 you of all people. As if I needed another motive to kill you.\"  We both flinched as that word slipped out. \"But it had the opposite effect,\" he continued quickly. \"I fought with Rosalie, Emmett, and Jasper when they suggested that now was the time\u2026 the worst fight we've ever had. Carlisle sided with me, and Alice.\" He grimaced when he said her name. I couldn't imagine why. \"Esme told me to do whatever I had to in order to stay.\" He shook his head indulgently. \"All that next day I eavesdropped on the minds of everyone you spoke to, shocked that you kept your word. I didn't understand you at all. But I knew that I couldn't become more involved with you. I did my very best to stay as far from you as possible. And every day the perfume of your skin, your breath, your hair\u2026 it hit me as hard as the very first day.\" He met my eyes again, and they were surprisingly tender. \"And for all that,\" he continued, \"I'd have fared better if I had exposed us all at that first moment, than if now, here \u2014 with no witnesses and nothing to stop me \u2014 I were to hurt you.\" I was human enough to have to ask. \"Why?\" \"Isabella.\" He pronounced my full name carefully, then playfully ruffled my hair with his free hand. A shock ran through my body at his casual touch. \"Bella, I couldn't live with myself if I ever hurt you. You don't know how it's tortured me.\" He looked down, ashamed again. \"The thought of you, still, white, cold\u2026 to never see you blush scarlet again, to never see that flash of intuition in your eyes when you see through my pretenses\u2026 it would be unendurable.\" He lifted his glorious, agonized eyes to mine. \"You are the most important thing to me now. The most important thing to me ever.\" My head was spinning at the rapid change in direction our conversation had taken. From the cheerful topic of my impending demise, we were suddenly declaring ourselves. He waited, and even though I looked down to study our hands between us, I knew his golden eyes were on me.  \"You already know how I feel, of course,\" I finally said. \"I'm here\u2026 which, roughly translated, means I would rather die than stay away from you.\" I frowned. \"I'm an idiot.\" \"You are an idiot,\" he agreed with a laugh. Our eyes met, and I laughed, too. We laughed together at the idiocy and sheer impossibility of such a moment. \"And so the lion fell in love with the lamb\u2026\" he murmured. I looked away, hiding my eyes as I thrilled to the word. \"What a stupid lamb,\" I sighed. \"What a sick, masochistic lion.\" He stared into the shadowy forest for a long moment, and I wondered where his thoughts had taken him. \"Why\u2026 ?\" I began, and then paused, not sure how to continue. He looked at me and smiled; sunlight glinted off his face, his teeth.  \"Yes?\" \"Tell me why you ran from me before.\" His smile faded. \"You know why.\" \"No, I mean, exactly what did I do wrong? I'll have to be on my guard, you see, so I better start learning what I shouldn't do. This, for example\" \u2014 I stroked the back of his hand \u2014 \"seems to be all right.\" He smiled again. \"You didn't do anything wrong, Bella. It was my fault.\" \"But I want to help, if I can, to not make this harder for you.\" \"Well\u2026\" He contemplated for a moment. \"It was just how close you were. Most humans instinctively shy away from us, are repelled by our alienness\u2026 I wasn't expecting you to come so close. And the smell of your throat.\" He stopped short, looking to see if he'd upset me. \"Okay, then,\" I said flippantly, trying to alleviate the suddenly tense atmosphere. I tucked my chin. \"No throat exposure.\" It worked; he laughed. \"No, really, it was more the surprise than anything else.\" He raised his free hand and placed it gently on the side of my neck. I sat very still, the chill of his touch a natural warning \u2014 a warning telling me to be terrified. But there was no feeling of fear in me. There were, however, other feelings\u2026 \"You see,\" he said. \"Perfectly fine.\" My blood was racing, and I wished I could slow it, sensing that this must make everything so much more difficult \u2014 the thudding of my pulse in my veins. Surely he could hear it. \"The blush on your cheeks is lovely,\" he murmured. He gently freed his other hand. My hands fell limply into my lap. Softly he brushed my cheek, then held my face between his marble hands. \"Be very still,\" he whispered, as if I wasn't already frozen. Slowly, never moving his eyes from mine, he leaned toward me. Then abruptly, but very gently, he rested his cold cheek against the hollow at the base of my throat. I was quite unable to move, even if I'd wanted to. I listened to the sound of his even breathing, watching the sun and wind play in his bronze hair, more human than any other part of him. With deliberate slowness, his hands slid down the sides of my neck. I shivered, and I heard him catch his breath. But his hands didn't pause as they softly moved to my shoulders, and then stopped. His face drifted to the side, his nose skimming across my collarbone. He came to rest with the side of his face pressed tenderly against my chest. Listening to my heart. \"Ah,\" he sighed. I don't know how long we sat without moving. It could have been hours.  Eventually the throb of my pulse quieted, but he didn't move or speak again as he held me. I knew at any moment it could be too much, and my life could end \u2014 so quickly that I might not even notice. And I couldn't make myself be afraid. I couldn't think of anything, except that he was touching me. And then, too soon, he released me.  His eyes were peaceful. \"It won't be so hard again,\" he said with satisfaction. \"Was that very hard for you?\" \"Not nearly as bad as I imagined it would be. And you?\" \"No, it wasn't bad\u2026 for me.\" He smiled at my inflection. \"You know what I mean.\" I smiled. \"Here.\" He took my hand and placed it against his cheek. \"Do you feel how warm it is?\" And it was almost warm, his usually icy skin. But I barely noticed, for I was touching his face, something I'd dreamed of constantly since the first day I'd seen him. \"Don't move,\" I whispered. No one could be still like Edward. He closed his eyes and became as immobile as stone, a carving under my hand. I moved even more slowly than he had, careful not to make one unexpected move. I caressed his cheek, delicately stroked his eyelid, the purple shadow in the hollow under his eye. I traced the shape of his perfect nose, and then, so carefully, his flawless lips. His lips parted under my hand, and I could feel his cool breath on my fingertips. I wanted to lean in, to inhale the scent of him. So I dropped my hand and leaned away, not wanting to push him too far. He opened his eyes, and they were hungry. Not in a way to make me fear, but rather to tighten the muscles in the pit of my stomach and send my pulse hammering through my veins again. \"I wish,\" he whispered, \"I wish you could feel the\u2026 complexity\u2026 the confusion\u2026 I feel. That you could understand.\" He raised his hand to my hair, then carefully brushed it across my face. \"Tell me,\" I breathed. \"I don't think I can. I've told you, on the one hand, the hunger \u2014 the thirst \u2014 that, deplorable creature that I am, I feel for you. And I think you can understand that, to an extent. Though\" \u2014 he half-smiled \u2014 \"as you are not addicted to any illegal substances, you probably can't empathize completely. \"But\u2026\" His fingers touched my lips lightly, making me shiver again. \"There are other hungers. Hungers I don't even understand, that are foreign to me.\" \"I may understand that better than you think.\" \"I'm not used to feeling so human. Is it always like this?\" \"For me?\" I paused. \"No, never. Never before this.\" He held my hands between his. They felt so feeble in his iron strength. \"I don't know how to be close to you,\" he admitted. \"I don't know if I can.\" I leaned forward very slowly, cautioning him with my eyes. I placed my cheek against his stone chest. I could hear his breath, and nothing else. \"This is enough,\" I sighed, closing my eyes. In a very human gesture, he put his arms around me and pressed his face against my hair. \"You're better at this than you give yourself credit for,\" I noted. \"I have human instincts \u2014 they may be buried deep, but they're there.\" We sat like that for another immeasurable moment; I wondered if he could be as unwilling to move as I was. But I could see the light was fading, the shadows of the forest beginning to touch us, and I sighed. \"You have to go.\" \"I thought you couldn't read my mind.\" \"It's getting clearer.\" I could hear a smile in his voice. He took my shoulders and I looked into his face. \"Can I show you something?\" he asked, sudden excitement flaring in his eyes. \"Show me what?\" \"I'll show you how I travel in the forest.\" He saw my expression. \"Don't worry, you'll be very safe, and we'll get to your truck much faster.\" His mouth twitched up into that crooked smile so beautiful my heart nearly stopped. \"Will you turn into a bat?\" I asked warily. He laughed, louder than I'd ever heard. \"Like I haven't heard that one before!\" \"Right, I'm sure you get that all the time.\" \"Come on, little coward, climb on my back.\" I waited to see if he was kidding, but, apparently, he meant it. He smiled as he read my hesitation, and reached for me. My heart reacted; even though he couldn't hear my thoughts, my pulse always gave me away. He then proceeded to sling me onto his back, with very little effort on my part, besides, when in place, clamping my legs and arms so tightly around him that it would choke a normal person. It was like clinging to a stone. \"I'm a bit heavier than your average backpack,\" I warned.  \"Hah!\" he snorted. I could almost hear his eyes rolling. I'd never seen him in such high spirits before. He startled me, suddenly grabbing my hand, pressing my palm to his face, and inhaling deeply. \"Easier all the time,\" he muttered. And then he was running. If I'd ever feared death before in his presence, it was nothing compared to how I felt now. He streaked through the dark, thick underbrush of the forest like a bullet, like a ghost. There was no sound, no evidence that his feet touched the earth. His breathing never changed, never indicated any effort. But the trees flew by at deadly speeds, always missing us by inches. I was too terrified to close my eyes, though the cool forest air whipped against my face and burned them. I felt as if I were stupidly sticking my head out the window of an airplane in flight. And, for the first time in my life, I felt the dizzy faintness of motion sickness. Then it was over. We'd hiked hours this morning to reach Edward's meadow, and now, in a matter of minutes, we were back to the truck. \"Exhilarating, isn't it?\" His voice was high, excited. He stood motionless, waiting for me to climb down. I tried, but my muscles wouldn't respond. My arms and legs stayed locked around him while my head spun uncomfortably. \"Bella?\" he asked, anxious now. \"I think I need to lie down,\" I gasped. \"Oh, sorry.\" He waited for me, but I still couldn't move. \"I think I need help,\" I admitted. He laughed quietly, and gently unloosened my stranglehold on his neck. There was no resisting the iron strength of his hands. Then he pulled me around to face him, cradling me in his arms like a small child. He held me for a moment, then carefully placed me on the springy ferns. \"How do you feel?\" he asked. I couldn't be sure how I felt when my head was spinning so crazily. \"Dizzy, I think.\" \"Put your head between your knees.\" I tried that, and it helped a little. I breathed in and out slowly, keeping my head very still. I felt him sitting beside me. The moments passed, and eventually I found that I could raise my head. There was a hollow ringing sound in my ears. \"I guess that wasn't the best idea,\" he mused. I tried to be positive, but my voice was weak. \"No, it was very interesting.\" \"Hah! You're as white as a ghost \u2014 no, you're as white as me!\" \"I think I should have closed my eyes.\" \"Remember that next time.\" \"Next time!\" I groaned. He laughed, his mood still radiant. \"Show-off,\" I muttered. \"Open your eyes, Bella,\" he said quietly. And he was right there, his face so close to mine. His beauty stunned my mind \u2014 it was too much, an excess I couldn't grow accustomed to. \"I was thinking, while I was running\u2026\" He paused. \"About not hitting the trees, I hope.\" \"Silly Bella,\" he chuckled. \"Running is second nature to me, it's not something I have to think about.\" \"Show-off,\" I muttered again. He smiled. \"No,\" he continued, \"I was thinking there was something I wanted to try.\" And he took my face in his hands again. I couldn't breathe. He hesitated \u2014 not in the normal way, the human way. Not the way a man might hesitate before he kissed a woman, to gauge her reaction, to see how he would be received. Perhaps he would hesitate to prolong the moment, that ideal moment of anticipation, sometimes better than the kiss itself. Edward hesitated to test himself, to see if this was safe, to make sure he was still in control of his need. And then his cold, marble lips pressed very softly against mine. What neither of us was prepared for was my response. Blood boiled under my skin, burned in my lips. My breath came in a wild gasp. My fingers knotted in his hair, clutching him to me. My lips parted as I breathed in his heady scent. Immediately I felt him turn to unresponsive stone beneath my lips. His hands gently, but with irresistible force, pushed my face back. I opened my eyes and saw his guarded expression. \"Oops,\" I breathed. \"That's an understatement.\" His eyes were wild, his jaw clenched in acute restraint, yet he didn't lapse from his perfect articulation. He held my face just inches from his. He dazzled my eyes. \"Should I\u2026 ?\" I tried to disengage myself, to give him some room. His hands refused to let me move so much as an inch. \"No, it's tolerable. Wait for a moment, please.\" His voice was polite, controlled. I kept my eyes on his, watched as the excitement in them faded and gentled. Then he smiled a surprisingly impish grin. \"There,\" he said, obviously pleased with himself. \"Tolerable?\" I asked. He laughed aloud. \"I'm stronger than I thought. It's nice to know.\" \"I wish I could say the same. I'm sorry.\" \"You are only human, after all.\" \"Thanks so much,\" I said, my voice acerbic. He was on his feet in one of his lithe, almost invisibly quick movements. He held out his hand to me, an unexpected gesture. I was so used to our standard of careful non-contact. I took his icy hand, needing the support more than I thought. My balance had not yet returned. \"Are you still faint from the run? Or was it my kissing expertise?\" How lighthearted, how human he seemed as he laughed now, his seraphic face untroubled. He was a different Edward than the one I had known. And I felt all the more besotted by him. It would cause me physical pain to be separated from him now. \"I can't be sure, I'm still woozy,\" I managed to respond. \"I think it's some of both, though.\" \"Maybe you should let me drive.\" \"Are you insane?\" I protested. \"I can drive better than you on your best day,\" he teased. \"You have much slower reflexes.\" \"I'm sure that's true, but I don't think my nerves, or my truck, could take it.\" \"Some trust, please, Bella.\" My hand was in my pocket, curled tightly around the key. I pursed my lips, deliberated, then shook my head with a tight grin. \"Nope. Not a chance.\" He raised his eyebrows in disbelief. I started to step around him, heading for the driver's side. He might have let me pass if I hadn't wobbled slightly. Then again, he might not have. His arm created an inescapable snare around my waist. \"Bella, I've already expended a great deal of personal effort at this point to keep you alive. I'm not about to let you behind the wheel of a vehicle when you can't even walk straight. Besides, friends don't let friends drive drunk,\" he quoted with a chuckle. I could smell the unbearably sweet fragrance coming off his chest. \"Drunk?\" I objected. \"You're intoxicated by my very presence.\" He was grinning that playful smirk again. \"I can't argue with that,\" I sighed.; I couldn't resist him in anything. I held the key high and dropped it, watching his hand flash like lightning to catch it soundlessly. \"Take it easy \u2014 my truck is a senior citizen.\" \"Very sensible,\" he approved. \"And are you not affected at all?\" I asked, irked. \"By my presence?\" Again his mobile features transformed, his expression became soft, warm. He didn't answer at first; he simply bent his face to mine, and brushed his lips slowly along my jaw, from my ear to my chin, back and forth. I trembled. \"Regardless,\" he finally murmured, \"I have better reflexes.\"",
