            "en": "Fathers don't use baby talk as often or in the same ways as mothers - and that\u2019s perfectly OK, according to a new study. Mark Van Dam of Washington State\u00a0University at <em>Spokane</em> and colleagues equipped parents with recording devices and\u00a0speech-recognition software to study the way they interacted with their youngsters\u00a0during a normal day. \u2018We found that moms do exactly what you\u2019d expect and what's\u00a0been described many times over,' VanDam explains. \u2018But we found that dads aren\u2019t\u00a0doing the same thing. Dads didn\u2019t raise their pitch or fundamental frequency when\u00a0they talked to kids.' Their role may be rooted in what is called the bridge hypothesis,\u00a0which dates back to 1975. It suggests that fathers use less familial language to\u00a0provide their children with a bridge to the kind of speech they\u2019ll hear in public. The\u00a0idea is that a kid gets to practice a certain kind of speech with mom and another\u00a0kind of speech with dad, so the kid then has a wider repertoire of kinds of speech to\u00a0practice,\u2019 says VanDam.",
