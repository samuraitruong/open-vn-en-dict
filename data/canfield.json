The most common answers to this question are, \"about twenty-one days,\" or \"three to four weeks.\" What you'll find is, that after twenty-one to thirty experiences with a new habit, it's harder not to do it than to do it. Before you can change a habit, you need to first check how long you have owned it.If you have been doing something repeatedly for thirty years, you may not be able to let go of it in a few short weeks. Acknowledge the fact that a deeply entrenched habit has long roots. It's like trying to sever a multistranded fiber that has molded itself, over time, into a single powerful rope. While avoiding slipping back into old patterns is always a risk, you can learn to break them permanently. It just takes practice. And it's well worth the effort.\" - Jack <em>Canfield</em>",
