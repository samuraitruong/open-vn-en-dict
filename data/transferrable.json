Certainly we know that heads of finance and HR tend to move around a lot more because the skills are very <em>transferrable</em>, and in fact it looks better for an HR executive or CFO to show a breadth of industry.

But general counsel is a little different, because legal issues are often more specific to the industry. So I don't really understand that one.\"",
