            "en": "In what might be a significant breakthrough in HIV/AIDS research, online gamers playing a game called Foldit have cracked a key protein structure problem that has had scientists scratching their heads for years. And the gamers did it in three weeks. You can read a scientific account of how researchers recruited Foldit players to work on the modeling problem and ultimately solve the crystal structure of M-PMV retroviral protease in a paper published online this week in the journal Nature Structural & Molecular Biology.\nFoldit invites players to predict protein structures. The game was developed by researchers at the University of Washington, as a deliberate way to get gamers to compete by solving scientific problems. The game requires they use spatial and critical thinking skills to build 3D models of protein molecules. In this case, they were invited to build models of M-PMV, a protease enzyme that plays a key role in how a virus similar to HIV replicates in cells. Few of the players had any background in biochemistry.\n By solving the mystery of the 3D structure of the protein, the gamers have helped scientists move a step forward in developing a drug that could stop viruses like HIV from spreading.\n The researchers write: \n\"Remarkably, Foldit players were able to generate models of sufficient quality for successful molecular replacement and subsequent structure determination. The refined structure provides new insights for the design of antiretroviral drugs.\"\n The study is a good example of how people skilled at video games can get involved in science and help solve a wide range of problems.\n In Foldit, the gamers try to predict how proteins fold themselves. When the gamers are playing the game, their actions to try and solve the problem are recorded and used to create algorithms to help computers increase their spatial reasoning.\n Solving problems in the game helps scientists gain a better understanding of how cells make protein, a process call biosynthesis. A particular challenge in this field is understanding how certain proteins fold into three-dimensional structures.\nTo win, gamers have to do well in three factors: how well you pack the protein in 3D, how efficiently you hide the hydrophobic bits of the molecule, and how you resolve the clashes. The gamers don't have to understand these factors in this way to play the game.\nThe game presents them with a new protein and away they go, trying to bend it around to find its ideal form. When they hit a correct move, that hits these factors, they get points. The gamers are able to chat to each other online and compare solutions. It was through sharing strategies that gamers around the world solved the M-PMV problem.\n Seth Cooper, lead designer of Foldit and co-author of the paper, told the press:\n \"People have spatial reasoning skills, something computers are not yet good at.\"\n \"Games provide a framework for bringing together the strengths of computers and humans,\" he added.\nWritten by Catharine <em>Paddock</em> PhD  Copyright: Medical News Today",

            "en": "Women's fertility linked to oral health          Women who want to have a baby should look after their oral health, a fertility expert told a meeting in Sweden yesterday. During the meeting, delegates heard about preliminary research that found for the first time, from when she starts trying to conceive, a woman's chances of falling pregnant can depend on how well she looks after her teeth and gums.  Roger Hart, a professor at the University of Western Australia in Perth, told the annual meeting of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology in Stockholm, that the effect of gum disease on conception is about the same order of magnitude as the effect of obesity. Hart, who is Professor of Reproductive Medicine at the University and Medical Director of Fertility Specialists of Western Australia, said their study was the first to be published that investigates links between gum disease and women's chances of getting pregnant, so it is the:  \"... first report to suggest that gum disease might be one of several factors that could be modified to improve the chances of a pregnancy.\"  He says women who want to become pregnant should visit their dentist and brush their teeth regularly.  For their research, Hart and colleagues analyzed data on over 3,400 pregnant women from Western Australia who were taking part in a study called SMILE that was investigating how treatment for gum disease affects pregnancy outcomes.   They found that women with gum disease took on average two months longer to conceive than women without gum disease (seven months instead of five).  Non-Caucasian women appeared to be the group most affected: they were likely to take more than 12 months to become pregnant if they had gum disease. Gum disease, also known as periodontal disease, is where the gums and supporting tissue are chronically infected and inflamed.   Our mouths are full of bacteria, which stick to mucus and bits of food and form a sticky \"plaque\" on our teeth. Brushing and flossing gets rid of plaque, but if this is not done regularly, then the plaque goes hard and turns into \"tartar\", that is much harder to get rid of. You should then visit the dentist or hygienist to have it removed properly.  If you leave it too long before removing plaque and tartar, the bacteria causes an inflammation called \"gingivitis\", where the gums appear red and swollen, and bleed. At this stage, daily brushing and flossing and visits to the dentist can restore oral health. But eventually, if not attended to, the disease moves to a stage where tissue and bone are affected: this is periodontitis, which literally means \"inflammation around the tooth\".  In periodontitis the gums pull away from the teeth and little pockets develop that become infected. The bacteria and plaque starts to grow below the gum line, causing the immune system to respond. Toxins from the bacteria and immune system activity start to attack the tissue and bone that hold teeth in place, and they become loose.  But these destructive agents also get into the bloodstream, which may explain why gum disease is linked to increased risk of a number of chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, respiratory and kidney disease, and also, miscarriage and premature birth.  About one in ten people is thought to have severe periodontal disease. The best way to prevent it is to brush and floss your teeth regularly.  Hart suggests the reason the non-Caucasian women were the most affected was because they appeared to have the highest level of inflammatory response when suffering from gum disease.  He also said that receiving treatment for gum disease while pregnant does not affect the health of the foetus or the mother. Source : ESHRE 2011 Stockholm.

            "en": "Frog skin could help treat cancer and other diseases         \nScientists have discovered two proteins secreted from the skin of frogs that could help treat cancer and other diseases by disrupting the growth of blood vessels: one switches the process of \"angiogenesis\" on, and the other switches it off. The researchers say the discovery has the potential to transform cancer from a terminal illness to a chronic condition.  The award-winning discovery is the work of Professor Chris Shaw and colleagues at Queen's University Belfast, in Northern Ireland.   Shaw is Professor in Drug Discovery at Queen's School of Pharmacy, where he specializes in finding and classifying naturally occurring, biologically active agents, most notably those found in the venom of amphibians all over the world.\n \nIn this latest discovery, Shaw and colleagues identified two mini-proteins or \"peptides\" (typically shorter than proteins but made from similar building blocks, amino acids) secreted on the skin of the Waxy Monkey Frog and the Giant Firebellied Toad that have the potential to stimulate or switch off \"angiogenesis\", the process of growing new blood vessels.  The peptide they found in skin of the Waxy Monkey Frog can switch off angiogenesis and the peptide they found in the skin of the Giant Firebellied Toad does the opposite: it can switch on angiogenesis.  As a cancer tumor grows and needs more oxygen and nutrients, it gets to a point where it has to develop its own blood supply, or it can't grow any bigger. So the idea is that a peptide that switches off angiogenesis could be incorporated into cancer drugs so the tumors either starve or stop growing.\n \nIn a statement to the press, Shaw explained the potential of such a compound:\n \n\"Stopping the blood vessels from growing will make the tumour less likely to spread and may eventually kill it. This has the potential to transform cancer from a terminal illness into a chronic condition.\"  On the other hand, a peptide that can switch on angiogenesis is also useful. For instance, in diseases or conditions where blood vessels need to repair quickly, such as in helping wounds to heal, in organ transplants, diabetic ulcers, and where strokes or heart conditions have left blood vessels damaged.  Angiogenesis has been a prime target for new drugs for over four decades, said Shaw, who said the reason he and his team look to the natural world for such compounds is because despite billions of investment by scientists and drug companies, man-made drugs that can effectively target and control the growth of blood vessels have yet to appear.  \"We are absolutely convinced that the natural world holds the solutions to many of our problems, we just need to pose the right questions to find them,\" said Shaw.\n \n\"It would be a great shame to have something in nature that is potentially the wonder drug to treat cancer and not aim to do everything in our power to make it work,\" he added.\n \nShaw's team members are very careful when they handle the frogs, so as not to harm them. They gently extract the secretions, and then release the frogs back into the wild.  Other studies have also shown that amphibians synthesize and secrete a range of chemicals with antimicrobial properties.  Earlier this year, scientists Ren Lai and colleagues from China reported in the Journal of Proteome Research that they found 79 different antimicrobial peptides, including 59 that were totally new to science, in the brains of two types of toad.

            "en": "Longer, More Regular Sleep May Reduce Childhood Obesity        Promoting longer, more regular sleep, even catching up at weekends on sleep lost in the week, may help reduce the incidence of childhood obesity, concluded US researchers in a new study published online in a leading journal this week.     You can read how Dr David Gozal, Professor and Chair of the Department of Pediatrics at the University of Chicago Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, and colleagues, arrived at this conclusion in a paper published online on 24 January in the journal Pediatrics.  Previous studies have already reported that insufficient sleep is linked to an increased risk of obesity in children, but in this study, Gozal and colleagues set out specifically to explore the effect of duration and regularity of sleep on BMI and metabolic regulation in children.  BMI stands for Body Mass Index, a measure of obesity, expressed in kg per meter squared, and equal to a person's weight divided by the square of their height.  For this cross-sectional study, they recruited 308 community-resident children aged 4 to 10 years, and measured their BMIs, their blood glucose before eating in the morning, insulin, blood fats and cholesterol. In a sub-sample group, they also measured levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (an \"inflammation\" marker used to assess risk of cardiovascular disease).   The children wore wrist monitors for a week. These measured physical activity and allowed the researchers to assess how often, when the children slept, and how long for, over the week.  The results showed that:   \nThe children slept for 8 hours every night on average, regardless of their BMI.\n\n  However, there was also a non-linear trend between sleep and weight.\n\n  The children in the obese BMI range, slept fewer hours and showed greater variability in the differences between weekend sleep time and school days sleep time.\n\n  Children whose BMI was in the overweight range, showed an inconsistent sleep pattern.\n\n  Analysis of sleep patterns and blood markers showed that high variance in sleep duration, or shorter sleep duration, was more likely to be linked to altered levels of insulin, LDL cholesterol, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein.\n\n  Children who slept the least, particularly those who also had irregular sleep patterns, showed the greatest health risk (ie the riskiest combination of BMI and blood markers).\n\n  The researchers found that just an extra half hour of sleep every night was linked to lower BMI and reduced pattern of risky blood markers.  And they also found that catching up with sleep at the weekend was linked to a lower risk of obesity, they wrote that:  \"Obese children were less likely to experience 'catch-up' sleep on weekends, and the combination of shorter sleep duration and more-variable sleep patterns was associated with adverse metabolic outcomes.\"  They concluded that:  \"Educational campaigns, aimed at families, regarding longer and more-regular sleep may promote decreases in obesity rates and may improve metabolic dysfunction trends in school-aged children.\"  \"Sleep Duration, Sleep Regularity, Body Weight, and Metabolic Homeostasis in School-aged Children.\" Karen Spruyt, Dennis L.

            "en": "Lower IQ Linked To Higher Attempted Suicide Risk, Large Swedish Study       A large scale study of over 1.1 million men living in Sweden that spanned nearly a quarter of a century found a link between lower IQ measured in early adulthood and higher risk of attempted suicide later in life. The study was the work of Dr Finn Rasmussen, a professor in the Department of Public Health Sciences at Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden, and colleagues from the UK and Australia. They wrote a paper about it published in the 3 June online issue of the British Medical Journal, BMJ. As well as exploring the links between early IQ scores and attempted suicide, Rasmussen and colleagues wanted to see if psychosis made a difference and also how variations in early IQ might relate to methods of attempted suicide. Described as the largest study of its kind, they examined the medical records of nearly 1,109,500 men aged between 16 and 57 years living in Sweden. Of these Rasmussen and colleagues found that nearly 18,000 (1.6 per cent) had been admitted to hospital at least once for attempting suicide during 24 years of follow up (after having IQ tested). They found that men with the lowest early adulthood IQ scores were almost nine times more likely to attempt suicide then those with the highest, and there was a stepwise increase in risk across the full IQ range, which was \"evident for attempted suicide by any means and for seven specific methods\". The authors wrote that while adjustment for \"childhood and adult socioeconomic status and, to a greater extent, education led to a reduction in magnitude\", the links remained strong. However, for men who had been diagnosed with psychosis before attempting suicide, a separate analysis showed there was no such link between IQ level and attempted suicide risk. They concluded that \"low IQ scores in early adulthood were associated with a subsequently increased risk of attempted suicide in men free from psychosis,\" and recommended looking more closely at the underlying mechanisms to see if they reveal opportunities to intervene and reduce rates of suicide among men. Speculating on the reasons behind the link, they suggested perhaps because people with lower IQ tend to have lower socioeconomic status and income, they could face more social and financial hardship, leading to their having more suicidal thoughts and behaviours. They also mentioned that unhealthy lifestyle (eg binge drinking) has also been linked with lower IQ, and this could also affect frequency of suicidal thinking, plus other studies have also linked lower IQ with lower problem solving skills, and this could affect resilience to stress. Another possibility is some research suggests that exposure to violence in childhood, either as a victim or a witness, can hamper IQ development as well as influence future suicide risk. \"Psychosis alters association between IQ and future risk of attempted suicide: cohort study of 1 109 475 Swedish men.\" G David Batty, Elise Whitley, Ian J Deary, Catharine R Gale, Per Tynelius, Finn Rasmussen.

But that is because of the way this humble vegetable is usually prepared.\n\"In reality, when prepared without frying and served without butter, margarine or sour cream, one potato has only 110 calories and dozens of healthful phytochemicals and vitamins,\" said Vinson, adding that he and his colleagues hope their study will help to remake the potato's popular nutritional image.For their study, Vinson and colleagues first did before and after tests of blood and urine of a group of healthy participants who ate either 6 to 8 small purple potatoes cooked in a microwave oven or the equivalent amount of starch in the form of biscuits. The results showed that the antioxidant capacity of their blood and urine was increased by the potatoes and lowered by the biscuits. \u00a0 Then they recruited 18 mostly overweight and obese patients with high blood pressure (their average BMI was 29) and invited them to take part in a crossover study. For 4 weeks, they ate either 6 to 8 purple potatoes twice a day or no potatoes in their normal diet, and then crossed over to the other regimen for another 4 weeks. The potatoes were each about the size of a golf ball and eaten with skins on.\nThey found that eating potatoes was not accompanied by changes in body weight, blood fats (lipids) or glucose levels (HbA1c), but resulted in lower blood pressure: the diastolic (the lower reading of a conventional blood pressure reading such as 120/80) went down by a significant 4.3%, and systolic by 3.5%. The blood pressure went down in spite of the fact 14 of the 18 participants were also on blood pressure medication.\nThe researchers concluded that purple potatoes are an effective agent for lowering blood pressure and thereby lower the risk of heart disease and stroke in patients with high blood pressure.  Although the participants in this study ate purple potatoes, which contain high amounts of antioxidants, such as phenolic acids, anthocyanins and carotenoids, Vinson and colleagues believe red-skin and white potatoes would confer similar benefits and are already planning a study that uses them. Vinson said previous studies have found potatoes contain phytochemicals (chemicals that occur naturally in plants) that have similar effects to ACE-inhibitors, medications used to treat high blood pressure.He said potatoes contain other phytochemicals in similar amounts as found in broccoli spinach and Brussels sprouts, and these could also be helping to lower blood pressure.But deep frying potatoes subjects them to such high temperatures that it seems to destroy these healthy chemicals, leaving the consumer with only starch, fat and minerals. Vinson said that just microwaving the raw potatoes seems to be the best way to preserve the antioxidants. \u00a0 The United States Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS) State Cooperative Potato Research Program helped pay for the study.\n  Written by Catharine <em>Paddock</em> PhD  Copyright: Medical News Today",

            "en": "The air of two Midwestern US cities contains significant amounts of bacteria from feces, particularly dog poop, according to a new study led by the University of Colorado Boulder, published recently in the journal Applied and Environmental Microbiology. The researchers tested the air of four locations in the Great Lakes region, and found that, in addition to the more predictable organic sources (such as leaves and soil), fecal material, most likely from dogs, often represents an unexpected source of atmospheric bacteria in urbanized areas during the winter.  Lead author Robert Bowers, a graduate student at the University of Colorado Boulder and Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES), told the press on Thursday: \"We found unexpectedly high bacterial diversity in all of our samples, but to our surprise the airborne bacterial communities of Detroit and Cleveland most closely resembled those communities found in dog poop.\"\nThe atmosphere around and above us is full of material of organic origin, a significant amount being bacteria, including those that cause disease in plants and animals. Some of them also cause or trigger human diseases, including asthma and seasonal allergies. Yet, despite their importance, we don't know a lot about them, and it is only in the last few years that scientists have begun to realize the diversity of bacteria in the air:  \"There is a real knowledge gap,\" said co-author Noah Fierer, an assistant professor in CU-Boulder's ecology and evolutionary biology department and a CIRES fellow. \"We are just starting to realize this uncharted microbial diversity in the air -- a place where you wouldn't exactly expect microbes to be living\". \"We breathe in bacteria every minute we are outside, and some of these bugs may have potential health implications,\" he added. For the study, the team analyzed the numbers and types of bacteria in nearly 100 local air samples, taken in summer and winter, at four places in the Great Lakes region of the US: three large cities of more than 2 million inhabitants (Chicago Cleveland and Detroit), and one town with less than 6,000 people (Mayville in Wisconsin).   They looked for bacterial DNA in the air samples and compared it to a database of known DNA signatures of bacteria from leaf surfaces, soil, and human, cow and dog feces. They found a surprising diversity in the atmospheric bacterial communities. Also, in the winter samples from two of the four locations, Detroit and Cleveland, the bacterial DNA signatures most closely resembled that of dog feces.  \"As best as we can tell, dog feces are the only explanation for these results,\" said Fierer, adding that they need to do more research before they can be sure.  Bowers suggested that because the snow covers the ground in the winter, the proportion of airborne bacteria from leaf surfaces, soil and dust goes down. Fierer said they don't know if the patterns they found in these four cities are unique: \"Does San Francisco have the same bacteria as New York? Nobody knows as yet,\" said Fierer.  \"We need much better information on what sources of bacteria we are breathing in every time we go outside,\" so that scientists can then investigate their impact on human health, he added. The team now wants to investigate other cities and create a continental \"atlas\" of airborne bacterial communities.  Funds from CIRES (a joint institute of CU-Boulder and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), the US Environmental Protection Agency, the National Science Foundation, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the National Institutes of Health helped pay for the research, with additional support from the Lake Michigan Air Directors Consortium for air sample collection.\nWritten by Catharine <em>Paddock</em> PhD  Copyright: Medical News Today",

            "en": "Cheap Injection Could Stop Thousands Of People Dying Of Severe Bleeding From Accidents, Injuries      Results from an international trial involving over 20,000 participants in 40 countries suggest that if recently injured patients with serious bleeding were to be given an injection of a cheap, widely available drug, it could save the lives of tens of thousands of people every year worldwide, including victims of traffic accidents, shootings, stabbings and land mine injuries. The results of the CRASH-2 study, a large, randomised trial involving over 20,000 adult patients in 274 hospitals in 40 countries, are published in the 14 June online issue of The Lancet, along with other information and an editorial commentary. The trial was funded by England's National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme and was led by Dr Ian Roberts, Professor of Epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM). Roberts and colleagues found that early administration of tranexamic acid (TXA, a drug that reduces clot breakdown) to patients with severe, recent bleeding injuries saves lives with no evidence of side effects from unwanted clotting.  They suggest using the widely available and easily administered off-patent drug, which is manufactured by a number of different companies, and costs about \u00a33 ($4.50) per gram, in this way could save tens of thousands of lives every year worldwide. The trial was the first to test TXA in injured patients, although previous, smaller studies have shown that the drug also reduces bleeding in patients undergoing major surgery. The trial was necessary to check the safety of TXA for this type of use, because although it is obviously an advantage to have a drug that reduces clot breakdown in situations of severe bleeding, doctors were concerned about side effects like increased risk of complications like heart attacks, strokes and blood clots in the lungs. However, the trial showed TXA reduced deaths from bleeding with no increase in such complications. Roberts told the press that about 600,000 injured people bleed to death every year around the world: it is the second biggest killer of people between 5 and 45 years old, second only to HIV/AIDS. \"Injuries may be accidental, for example traffic crashes, or intentional, such as shootings, stabbings or land mine injuries and the majority of deaths occur soon after injury,\" explained Roberts, adding that: \"Although most deaths from injuries are in developing countries, injury is a leading cause of death in young adults throughout the world.\" He said it was also important to note that deaths from injuries are on the rise the globe over, and often the victims are young adults with families to support. For the study, Roberts and colleagues only enrolled patients who had significant bleeding, or were at risk of significant bleeding and the injury had happened within the last few hours. They randomly allocated participants to either the treatment group or the placebo group. The treatment group received one gram of TXA by injection followed by another 1 gram in a drip in the following 8 hours. The placebo group had the same treatment but received a matching placebo instead of the TXA. They followed up the patients in both groups for 4 weeks after injury, counting all deaths. The analysis showed that compared to placebo, TXA reduced the chance of death due to massive blood loss by around one sixth. Roberts and colleagues estimated that TXA used in this way could save up to 100,000 lives worldwide, including 13,000 in India and 12,000 in China. Roberts said: \"We believe that doctors across the world should now consider using it [TXA] to improve accident victims' chances of survival and that it should be considered for inclusion in the WHO List of Essential Medicines.\" Source: LSHTM.\nWritten by: Catharine <em>Paddock</em>, PhD  Copyright: Medical News Today",

            "en": "At least two otherwise healthy men appear to have acquired a rare bacterial skin infection that is hard to treat with antibiotics after receiving tattoos at a parlor in Seattle in the state of Washington in the US, according to a report in the Emerging Infectious Diseases journal that was e-published ahead of print on 10 August by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Although no evidence was found to link the use of tap water to the infections, the report authors recommend that tattoo operators avoid using tap water and use sterilized water throughout their procedures. One case is confirmed, the other is as yet unconfirmed say the CDC. The confirmed case is of a healthy 44-year-old man who received a tattoo on his left forearm at a commercial tattoo parlor in August 2009. He has tested positive for Mycobacterium haemophilum, a bacterium that rarely affects people with a healthy immune system, write lead author Meagan K. Kay of the CDC in Atlanta, and colleagues.  The yet to be confirmed case is of a healthy 35-year-old man who received his tattoo at the same parlor two months later. His tests were inconclusive, and the CDC are treating him as a \"suspected\" case of infection. The authors write that although rare, difficult-to-treat bacterial infections have been reported even in healthy people who receive tattoos.\nIn the case of the man with the confirmed Mycobacterium haemophilum infection, he developed a painless rash at the tattoo site three days after visiting the parlor in August 2009. 12 days later he sought medical help. By then the rash had developed into bumpy, red nodules with pus (erythematous nodules) about 3 to 5 mm in diameter. By the following February, after several visits and treatment with various antibiotics, the rash eventually improved although some traces of infection remained. The man stopped treatment in March because of nausea, and by May the lesions had healed. The source of the bacteria has not been traced. An investigation of the tattoo parlor by local authorities in December 2009 found all the procedures complied with Washington State safety and sanitation standards, although they did instruct the owner to switch to sterilized water instead of tap water for rinse solutions and diluting tattoo dyes. None of the samples taken from various sites in the parlor, including the source of tap water, the tip of a reusable black ink container, various bits of equipment, the soap dispenser, and so on, showed traces of mycobacteria when tested by the CDC.  However, the authors note that although water has been suspected as a reservoir for M. haemophilum for various reasons, when investigators come to test environmental samples, using culture tests, as in this case, they are usually negative. They suggest that perhaps the interval of more than four months between the man visiting the parlor and the local authority investigation further reduced the chance of recovering any M. haemophilum. They suggest tattoo operators probably use tap water because:\n\"No tattoo industry standards exist for the practice of diluting tattoo ink. Washington State does not specifically require tattoo artists to use steam-distilled or sterile water when rinsing needles or diluting ink.\" But they refer to legislation, brought in in July 2010, that \"prohibits mixing ink and pigments with improper ingredients\". So their conclusion, and recommendation is that despite the fact infections due to water appear uncommon, operators should not use tap water for tattoo procedures.

            "en": "The developers of an innovative outdoor decoy device that uses the odour of smelly socks or a similar synthetic smell to lure and kill malaria-carrying mosquitoes, have just won a grant to test their design and then take it from the lab through production to market. Grand Challenges Canada and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation have jointly awarded Tanzanian entomologist Dr. Fredros Okumu and his team at the Ifakara Health Institute in Tanzania, East Africa, the grant in order eventually for their mosquito traps to be available at low cost to the communities that most need them. Every year, malaria infects 250 million and kills nearly 800,000 people around the world, most of them young children. Dr. Peter A. Singer, Chief Executive Officer of Grand Challenges Canada, told the press that the innovative device could \"contribute significantly to accelerating the elimination of malaria and save lives\". The decoy device, which resembles a portable weather station in the shape of a large box with louvred sides, is placed outside the home and complements indoor mosquito-foiling strategies such as bed nets and sprays. In their research, Okumu and his team at the Ifakara Health Institute found that the most effective way to lure mosquitoes to the decoy device was to bait them with the odour of smelly socks, or using synthetic chemicals with a similar smell. They found that four times as many mosquitoes are lured by both the real odour and the synthetic version as they are by humans. Once they are inside the decoy, the mosquitoes remain trapped or they are poisoned and die. One may ask, why so much emphasis on smelly socks, why not just go for the synthetic bait? According to the Washington Post, Okumu said smelly socks were readily available, you don't need to mix any chemicals. They are currently testing lots of ways to get hold of the smelly socks smell, including asking schoolchildren to put pads inside their shoes, wear them all day, then hand them in to the researchers. Okumu said while there has been considerable progress in the global fight against malaria, there was still a lot of work to be done. \"Malaria has claimed so many lives, including those of people close to me, and my hope is that this innovative device will be part of the solution,\" he said. But new ideas don't always make it from the inventor's bench to the marketplace, there are many hurdles to be overcome. Something Joseph L. Rotman, a philanthropist and businessman who chairs the board of directors of Grand Challenges Canada, spoke about: \"Through a lifetime of hard lessons, I know that discovery is not enough.\" \"Discoveries also need to be implemented in the real world through business and social innovation,\" he added.  This is one reason that Grand Challenges Canada has stepped in with the grant, under its Integrated Innovation approach.

            "en": "Less educated people age faster, DNA study    People who leave education with fewer academic qualifications may grow old faster, according to a DNA study that compared groups of people who spent different lengths of time in education and found the ones who spent the least time had shorter telomeres or \"caps\" on the ends of their DNA, a sign of premature aging in cells. Co-funded by the British Heart Foundation (BHF) and the Medical Research Council (MRC), and led by University College London (UCL), the study used 450 volunteers from the ongoing \"Whitehall II\" study, which started in 1985 to investigate links between social class and health. BHF's Associate Medical Director, Professor Jeremy Pearson, said the study reinforces the need to tackle social inequalities to combat ill health: \"It's not acceptable that where you live or how much you earn -- or lesser academic attainment -- should put you at greater risk of ill health,\" he said in a statement. Andrew Steptoe, BHF Professor of Psychology at UCL, and colleagues, wrote about their findings in a paper published recently in the journal Brain, Behavior, and Immunity. They were concerned that while there is evidence that low socioeconomic status is linked to faster biological aging, attempts to tie it telomere length have yielded inconsistent results. Telomeres are short repetitive sequences of DNA that \"cap\" the ends of chromosomes and stop them degrading and fusing with their neighbours: imagine the tips on the ends of shoelaces that stop them fraying. Telomeres get consumed in cell division, and are replenished by an enzyme called telomerase, but there is a limit to how many times this can happen, and they gradually get shorter, limiting the number of times cells can divide, and in turn, lifespan. The researchers set out to test the hypothesis that \"shorter telomere length and telomerase activity would be related more robustly to education, an early life indicator of socioeconomic position, than to current indicators of socioeconomic circumstances\".    For the study, they split the 450 volunteers, healthy men and women aged between 53 and 76 years, into four groups according to how long they had spent in education. They also measured their current socioeconomic status in terms of household income and grade of employment. From blood samples, they were able to assess telomere length in 448 of the participants and telomerase activity in 416. After adjusting for possible confounding factors, such as age, gender, various health indicators such as smoking and cholesterol, and lifestyle indicators such as exercise, they found that lower educational attainment was linked to shorter telomere length, while household income was not, and neither was employment grade.    In fact, the link between \"telomere length and education remained significant after adjusting for current socioeconomic circumstances,\" they wrote. They also found that in men, the highest telomerase activity (the enzyme that repairs the telomeres) was in the lowest education group. The researchers concluded that low socioeconomic status defined in terms of education but not current socioeconomic circumstances is linked to shorter telomeres. This supports the idea that faster aging is not just a result of current economic circumstances or social status in a person's life, but of long-term effects that start early in life, such as education.     The researchers also suggest that people with higher levels of education are probably better equipped with life skills like problem-solving that help them deal with the stresses of life, and this reduces the biological stress on their bodies, the so-called \u201callostatic load\u201d.  \"Educational attainment but not measures of current socioeconomic circumstances are associated with leukocyte telomere length in healthy older men and women.\" Andrew Steptoe, Mark Hamer, Lee Butcher, Jue Lin, Lena Brydon, Mika Kivim\u00e4ki, Michael Marmot, Elizabeth Blackburn, Jorge D.

            "en": "Seniors who shop frequently live longer      Elderly people who shop as frequently as every day are more likely to live longer than less frequent shoppers, with men appearing to benefit more from the activity than women, according to a new study from Taiwan published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health recently.  Dr Yu-Hung Chang from the National Health Research Institutes in Taiwan, and colleagues, studied nearly 1,850 elderly people aged 65 and over who were living independently at home and who took part in the nationally representative 1999-2000 Elderly Nutrition and Health Survey in Taiwan (NAHSIT Elderly).  Participants answered questions about how often they went shopping, with responses ranging from \"never\" to \"every day\".     They also completed questionnaires that helped researchers assess their intellectual and physical function, and gave the usual demographic information such as financial status, employment status, age, gender, education, and ethnicity, plus lifestyle, health behaviors, and chronic disease/medical status.  This data was then cross-referenced to national death registers covering 1999 to 2008 to find out which of the participants had died during that period.  The results showed that:    Nearly two-thirds of participants were under the age of 75, and 54% were men.\n\n  48% of the participants never or rarely shopped during the week, 22% shopped between 2 and 4 times a week, 17% shopped every day, and the rest shopped once a week.\n\n  Most participants had a healthy lifestyle, and around three quarters were financially self-sufficient.\n\n  60% of participants had either one or two long term medical conditions.\n\n  Those who went shopping more than once a week tended to be men at the younger end of the age range.\n\n  This group had a higher proportion of smokers and drinkers, tended to have better physical and mental health, took more regular exercise and were more likely to have a network of dinner companions.\n\n  Compared with the least frequent shoppers, those who shopped every day had a 27% lower risk of death.\n\n  For men this figure was 28% compared to 23% for women.\n\n   The researchers concluded that their findings showed shopping predicts survival and that very frequent shopping may favour men more than women.     They used different types of analysis to consider the potential effects of physical limitations and cognitive impairment, but these still showed that daily shoppers lived longer than infrequent shoppers.  They conceded that perhaps the ability to shop is just reflective of a person's health, and frequent shoppers are just healthier people, but they also said it could work the other way around: frequent shopping itself may benefit health, for instance by increasing the opportunity to buy food, take an interest in your diet and health, meet companions, and also take exercise in a way that is easier and requires less motivation than formal methods.  \"Shopping captures several dimensions of personal well-being, health and security as well as contributing to the community's cohesiveness and economy and may represent or actually confer increased longevity,\" they noted.  \"Frequent shopping by men and women increases survival in the older Taiwanese population.\" Yu-Hung Chang, Rosalind Chia-Yu Chen, Mark L Wahlqvist, Meei-Shyuan Lee.

            "en": "Dogs Helped Kids Improve Reading Fluency       Researchers in the US found that reading to dogs helped children improve their fluency by up to 30 per cent. Many animal organizations and libraries in the US already have reading improvement schemes where they pair up children and dogs, but until now the evidence has been more anecdotal than research-based. The findings are the result of a collaboration between the University of California Davis School of Veterinary Medicine and Tony La Russa's Animal Rescue Foundation of Walnut Creek, California. Together they studied participants of the Foundation's already established animal assisted therapy scheme called the All Ears Reading Program, according to a statement released by UC Davis earlier this month. Lead researcher Martin Smith, a veterinary school science educator with UC Davis, told the press that: \"The dogs, in contrast to a human, don't judge the individual, aren't grading the individual, and hopefully that allows the children to build some confidence in their reading skills.\" Smith and colleagues explored changes in reading skills among third graders at school and among home-schooled students. They found reading fluency went up 12 per cent in the school-based students and 30 per cent in the home-schooled students. Reading speeds also increased by up to 30 words per minute. The children regularly read out loud to three shelter-rescued dogs called Molly, Digory and Lollipop (a Chihuahua-terrier mix) from Tony La Russa's Animal Rescue Foundation. The home-schooled children visited the veterinary school campus every week for 10 weeks during which time each child read out loud to one of the dogs for 15 to 20 minutes. One child told the researchers that: \"I feel relaxed when I am reading to a dog because I am having fun.\" Another added that: \"The dogs don't care if you read really, really bad so you just keep going.\" After the study, 75 per cent of parents reported that their child was now reading aloud more frequently and with more confidence. Smith and colleagues proposed that because the children perceived the dogs as patient and non-judgemental, this changed their attitude to reading. Research into animal assisted therapy (AAT) shows that pets can also improve people's health.  In 2004, Dr Daniel Joffe, a Canadian veterinarian reviewed the medical literature and found pet therapy increased social interaction among long stay psychiatric patients, opened up social and recreational opportunities in nursing homes, gave valuable companionship to low-mobility orthopedic patients, helped dementia patients be less agitated and reduced loneliness in patients with HIV/AIDS. There is also evidence to suggest that babies who have greater exposure to dirt and allergens, such as when they share a home with a dog or a cat, have a stronger immune system, according to Dr James E. Gern, a pediatrician at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who co-authored a paper about it in the 2004 issue of the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.
