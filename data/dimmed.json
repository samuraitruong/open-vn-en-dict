            "en": "7         7. UNHAPPY ENDING Rosalie hesitated in the doorway, her breathtaking face unsure. \u201cOf course,\u201d I replied, my voice an octave high with surprise. \u201cCome on in.\u201d I sat up, sliding to the end of the sofa to make room. My stomach twisted nervously as the one Cullen who did not like me moved silently to sit down in the open space. I tried to come up with a reason why she would want to see me, but my mind was a blank on that point. \u201cDo you mind talking to me for a few minutes?\u201d she asked. \u201cI didn\u2019t wake you or anything, did I?\u201d Her eyes shifted to the stripped bed and back to my couch. \u201cNo, I was awake. Sure, we can talk.\u201d I wondered if she could hear the alarm in my voice as clearly as I could. She laughed lightly, and it sounded like a chorus of bells. \u201cHe so rarely leaves you alone,\u201d she said. \u201cI figured I\u2019d better make the best of this opportunity.\u201d What did she want to say that couldn\u2019t be said in front of Edward? My hands twisted and untwisted around the edge of the comforter. \u201cPlease don\u2019t think I\u2019m horribly interfering,\u201d Rosalie said, her voice gentle and almost pleading. She folded her hands in her lap and looked down at them as she spoke. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ve hurt your feelings enough in the past, and I don\u2019t want to do that again.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Rosalie. My feelings are great. What is it?\u201d She laughed again, sounding oddly embarrassed. \u201cI\u2019m going to try to tell you why I think you should stay human \u2014 why I would stay human if I were you.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d She smiled at the shocked tone of my voice, and then she sighed. \u201cDid Edward ever tell you what led to this?\u201d she asked, gesturing to her glorious immortal body. I nodded slowly, suddenly somber. \u201cHe said it was close to what happened to me that time in Port Angeles, only no one was there to save you .\u201d I shuddered at the memory. \u201cIs that really all he told you?\u201d she asked. \u201cYes,\u201d I said, my voice blank with confusion. \u201cWas there more?\u201d She looked up at me and smiled; it was a harsh, bitter \u2014 but still stunning \u2014 expression. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was more.\u201d I waited while she stared out the window. She seemed to be trying to calm herself. \u201cWould you like to hear my story, Bella? It doesn\u2019t have a happy ending \u2014 but which of ours does? If we had happy endings, we\u2019d all be under gravestones now.\u201d I nodded, though I was frightened by the edge in her voice. \u201cI lived in a different world than you do, Bella. My human world was a much simpler place. It was nineteen thirty-three. I was eighteen, and I was beautiful. My life was perfect.\u201d She stared out the window at the silver clouds, her expression far away. \u201cMy parents were thoroughly middle class. My father had a stable job in a bank, something I realize now that he was smug about \u2014 he saw his prosperity as a reward for talent and hard work, rather than acknowledging the luck involved. I took it all for granted then; in my home, it was as if the Great Depression was only a troublesome rumor. Of course I saw the poor people, the ones who weren\u2019t as lucky. My father left me with the impression that they\u2019d brought their troubles on themselves.  \u00a0\u201cIt was my mother\u2019s job to keep our house \u2014 and myself and my two younger brothers \u2014 in spotless order. It was clear that I was both her first priority and her favorite. I didn\u2019t fully understand at the time, but I was always vaguely aware that my parents weren\u2019t satisfied with what they had, even if it was so much more than most. They wanted more. They had social aspirations \u2014 social climbers, I suppose you could call them. My beauty was like a gift to them. They saw so much more potential in it than I did.  \u00a0\u201cThey weren\u2019t satisfied, but I was. I was thrilled to be me, to be Rosalie Hale. Pleased that men\u2019s eyes watched me everywhere I went, from the year I turned twelve. Delighted that my girlfriends sighed with envy when they touched my hair. Happy that my mother was proud of me and that my father liked to buy me pretty dresses.  \u00a0\u201cI knew what I wanted out of life, and there didn\u2019t seem to be any way that I wouldn\u2019t get exactly what I wanted. I wanted to be loved, to be adored. I wanted to have a huge, flowery wedding, where everyone in town would watch me walk down the aisle on my father\u2019s arm and think I was the most beautiful thing they\u2019d ever seen. Admiration was like air to me, Bella. I was silly and shallow, but I was content.\u201d She smiled, amused at her own evaluation. \u00a0\u201cMy parents\u2019 influence had been such that I also wanted the material things of life. I wanted a big house with elegant furnishings that someone else would clean and a modern kitchen that someone else would cook in. As I said, shallow. Young and very shallow. And I didn\u2019t see any reason why I wouldn\u2019t get these things. \u00a0\u201cThere were a few things I wanted that were more meaningful. One thing in particular. My very closest friend was a girl named Vera. She married young, just seventeen. She married a man my parents would never have considered for me \u2014 a carpenter. A year later she had a son, a beautiful little boy with dimples and curly black hair. It was the first time I\u2019d ever felt truly jealous of anyone else in my entire life.\u201d She looked at me with unfathomable eyes. \u201cIt was a different time. I was the same age as you, but I was ready for it all. I yearned for my own little baby. I wanted my own house and a husband who would kiss me when he got home from work \u2014 just like Vera. Only I had a very different kind of house in mind. . .\u201d It was hard for me to imagine the world that Rosalie had known. Her story sounded more like a fairy tale than history to me. With a slight shock, I realized that this was very close to the world that Edward would have experienced when he was human, the world he had grown up in. I wondered \u2014 while Rosalie sat silent for a moment \u2014 if my world seemed as baffling to him as Rosalie\u2019s did to me? Rosalie sighed, and when she spoke again her voice was different, the wistfulness gone. \u201cIn Rochester, there was one royal family \u2014 the Kings, ironically enough. Royce King owned the bank my father worked at, and nearly every other really profitable business in town. That\u2019s how his son, Royce King the Second\u201d \u2014 her mouth twisted around the name, it came out through her teeth \u2014 \u201csaw me the first time. He was going to take over at the bank, and so he began overseeing the different \u00a0positions. Two days later, my mother conveniently forgot to send my father\u2019s lunch to work with him. I remember being confused when she insisted that I wear my white organza and roll my hair up just to run over to the bank.\u201d Rosalie laughed without humor. \u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t notice Royce watching me particularly. Everyone watched me. But that night the first of the\u00a0 roses came. Every night of our courtship, he sent a bouquet of roses to me. My room was always overflowing with them. It got to the point that I would smell like roses when I left the house. \u201cRoyce was handsome, too. He had lighter hair than I did, and pale blue eyes. He said my eyes were like violets, and then those started showing up alongside the roses. \u00a0\u201cMy parents approved \u2014 that\u2019s putting it mildly. This was everything they\u2019d dreamed of. And Royce seemed to be everything I\u2019d dreamed of. The fairy tale prince, come to make me a princess. Everything I wanted, yet it was still no more than I expected. We were engaged before I\u2019d known him for two months. \u00a0\u201cWe didn\u2019t spend a great deal of time alone with each other. Royce told me he had many responsibilities at work, and, when we were together, he liked people to look at us, to see me on his arm. I liked that, too. There were lots of parties, dancing, and pretty dresses. When you were a King, every door was open for you, every red carpet rolled out to greet you. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a long engagement. Plans went ahead for the most lavish wedding. It was going to be everything I\u2019d ever wanted. I was completely happy. When I called at Vera\u2019s, I no longer felt jealous. I pictured my fair-haired children playing on the huge lawns of the Kings\u2019 estate, and I pitied her.\u201d Rosalie broke off suddenly, clenching her teeth together. It pulled me out of her story, and I realized that the horror was not far off. There would be no happy ending, as she\u2019d promised. I wondered if this was why she had so much more bitterness in her than the rest of them \u2014 because she\u2019d been within reach of everything she\u2019d wanted when her human life was cut short. \u201cI was at Vera\u2019s that night,\u201d Rosalie whispered. Her face was smooth as marble, and as hard. \u201cHer little Henry really was adorable, all smiles and dimples \u2014 he was just sitting up on his own. Vera walked me to the door as I was leaving, her baby in her arms and her husband at her side, his arm around her waist. He kissed her on the cheek when he thought I wasn\u2019t looking. That bothered me. When Royce kissed me, it wasn\u2019t quite the same \u2014 not so sweet somehow. . . . I shoved that thought aside. Royce was my prince. Someday, I would be queen.\u201d It was hard to tell in the moonlight, but it looked like her bone white face got paler. \u201cIt was dark in the streets, the lamps already on. I hadn\u2019t realized how late it was.\u201d  She continued to whisper almost inaudibly. \u201cIt was cold, too. Very cold for late April. The wedding was only a week away, and I was worrying about the weather as I hurried home \u2014 I can remember that clearly. I remember every detail about that night. I clung to it so hard . . . in the beginning. I thought of nothing else. And so I remember this, when so many pleasant memories have faded away completely. . . .\u201d She sighed, and began whispering again. \u201cYes, I was worrying about the weather. . . . I didn\u2019t want to have to move the wedding indoors. . . . \u201cI was a few streets from my house when I heard them. A cluster of men under a broken streetlamp, laughing too loud. Drunk. I wished I\u2019d called my father to escort me home, but the way was so short, it seemed silly. And then he called my name. \u00a0\u201c\u2018Rose!\u2019 he yelled, and the others laughed stupidly. \u201cI hadn\u2019t realized the drunks were so well dressed. It was Royce and some of his friends, sons of other rich men. \u201c\u2018Here\u2019s my Rose!\u2019 Royce shouted, laughing with them, sounding just as stupid. \u2018You\u2019re late. We\u2019re cold, you\u2019ve kept us waiting so long.\u2019\u201d \u201cI\u2019d never seen him drink before. A toast, now and then, at a party. He\u2019d told me he didn\u2019t like champagne. I hadn\u2019t realized that he preferred something much stronger. \u00a0\u201cHe had a new friend \u2014 the friend of a friend, come up from Atlanta. \u201c\u2018What did I tell you, John,\u2019 Royce crowed, grabbing my arm and pulling me closer. \u2018Isn\u2019t she lovelier than all your Georgia peaches?\u2019 \u201cThe man named John was dark-haired and suntanned. He looked me over like I was a horse he was buying. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s hard to tell,\u2019 he drawled slowly. \u2018She\u2019s all covered up.\u2019 \u201cThey laughed, Royce like the rest. \u00a0\u201cSuddenly, Royce ripped my jacket from my shoulders \u2014 it was a gift from him \u2014 popping the brass buttons off. They scattered all over the street. \u201c\u2018Show him what you look like, Rose!\u2019 He laughed again and then he tore my hat out of my hair. The pins wrenched my hair from the roots, and I cried out in pain. They seemed to enjoy that \u2014 the sound of my pain. . . .\u201d Rosalie looked at me suddenly, as if she\u2019d forgotten I was there. I was sure my face was as white as hers. Unless it was green. \u201cI won\u2019t make you listen to the rest,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cThey left me in the street, still laughing as they stumbled away. They thought I was dead. They were teasing Royce that he would have to find a new bride. He laughed and said he\u2019d have to learn some patience first. \u00a0\u201cI waited in the road to die. It was cold, though there was so much pain that I was surprised it bothered me. It started to snow, and I wondered why I wasn\u2019t dying. I was impatient for death to come, to end the pain. It was taking so long. . . . \u00a0\u201cCarlisle found me then. He\u2019d smelled the blood, and come to investigate. I remember being vaguely irritated as he worked over me, trying to save my life. I\u2019d never liked Dr. Cullen or his wife and her brother \u2014 as Edward pretended to be then. It had upset me that they were all more beautiful than I was, especially that the men were. But they didn\u2019t mingle in society, so I\u2019d only seen them once or twice. \u00a0\u201cI thought I\u2019d died when he pulled me from the ground and ran with me \u2014 because of the speed \u2014 it felt like I was flying. I remembered being horrified that the pain didn\u2019t stop. . . . \u00a0\u201cThen I was in a bright room, and it was warm. I was slipping away, and I was grateful as the pain began to dull. But suddenly something sharp was cutting me, my throat, my wrists, my ankles. I screamed in shock, thinking he\u2019d brought me there to hurt me more. Then fire started burning through me, and I didn\u2019t care about anything else. I begged him to kill me. When Esme and Edward returned home, I begged them to kill me, too. Carlisle sat with me. He held my hand and said that he was so sorry, promising that it would end. He told me everything, and sometimes I listened. He told me what he was, what I was becoming. I didn\u2019t believe him. He apologized each time I screamed. \u00a0\u201cEdward wasn\u2019t happy. I remember hearing them discuss me. I stopped screaming sometimes. It did no good to scream. \u201c\u2018What were you thinking, Carlisle?\u2019 Edward said. \u2018Rosalie Hale?\u2019\u201d Rosalie imitated Edward\u2019s irritated tone to perfection. \u201cI didn\u2019t like the way he said my name, like there was something wrong with me. \u201c\u2018I couldn\u2019t just let her die,\u2019 Carlisle said quietly. \u2018It was too much \u2014 too horrible, too much waste.\u2019 \u00a0\u201c\u2018I know,\u2019 Edward said, and I thought he sounded dismissive. It angered me. I didn\u2019t know then that he really could see exactly what Carlisle had seen. \u201c\u2018It was too much waste. I couldn\u2019t leave her,\u2019 Carlisle repeated in a whisper. \u201c\u2018Of course you couldn\u2019t,\u2019 Esme agreed. \u201c\u2018People die all the time,\u2019 Edward reminded him in a hard voice. \u2018Don\u2019t you think she\u2019s just a little recognizable, though? The Kings will have to put up a huge search \u2014 not that anyone suspects the fiend,\u2019 he growled. \u00a0\u201cIt pleased me that they seemed to know that Royce was guilty. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize that it was almost over \u2014 that I was getting stronger and that was why I was able to concentrate on what they were saying. The pain was beginning to fade from my fingertips. \u201c\u2018What are we going to do with her?\u2019 Edward said disgustedly \u2014 or that\u2019s how it sounded to me, at least. \u00a0\u201cCarlisle sighed. \u2018That\u2019s up to her, of course. She may want to go her own way.\u2019 \u201cI\u2019d believed enough of what he\u2019d told me that his words terrified me. I knew that my life was ended, and there was no going back for me. I couldn\u2019t stand the thought of being alone. . . . \u201cThe pain finally ended and they explained to me again what I was. This time I believed. I felt the thirst, my hard skin; I saw my brilliant red eyes. \u201cShallow as I was, I felt better when I saw my reflection in the mirror the first time. Despite the eyes, I was the most beautiful thing I\u2019d ever seen.\u201d She laughed at herself for a moment. \u201cIt took some time before I began to blame the beauty for what had happened to me \u2014 for me to see the curse of it. To wish that I had been . . . well, not ugly, but normal. Like Vera. So I could have been allowed to marry someone who loved me, and have pretty babies. That\u2019s what I\u2019d really wanted, all along. It still doesn\u2019t seem like too much to have asked for.\u201d She was thoughtful for a moment, and I wondered if she\u2019d forgotten my presence again. But then she smiled at me, her expression suddenly triumphant. \u201cYou know, my record is almost as clean as Carlisle\u2019s,\u201d she told me. \u201cBetter than Esme. A thousand times better than Edward. I\u2019ve never tasted human blood,\u201d she announced proudly. She understood my puzzled expression as I wondered why her record was only almost as clean. \u00a0\u201cI did murder five humans,\u201d she told me in a complacent tone. \u201cIf you can really call them human . But I was very careful not to spill their blood \u2014 I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to resist that, and I didn\u2019t want any part of them in me, you see. \u00a0\u201cI saved Royce for last. I hoped that he would hear of his friends\u2019 deaths and understand, know what was coming for him. I hoped the fear would make the end worse for him. I think it worked. He was hiding inside a windowless room behind a door as thick as a bank vault\u2019s, guarded outside by armed men, when I caught up with him. Oops \u2014 seven murders,\u201d she corrected herself. \u201cI forgot about his guards. They only took a second.\u201d \u00a0\u201cI was overly theatrical. It was kind of childish, really. I wore a wedding dress I\u2019d stolen for the occasion. He screamed when he saw me. He screamed a lot that night. Saving him for last was a good idea \u2014 it made it easier for me to control myself, to make it slower \u2014\u201d  She broke off suddenly, and she glanced down at me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said in a chagrined voice. \u201cI\u2019m frightening you, aren\u2019t I?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I lied. \u00a0\u201cI got carried away.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m surprised Edward didn\u2019t tell you more about it.\u201d \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like to tell other people\u2019s stories \u2014 he feels like he\u2019s betraying confidences, because he hears so much more than just the parts they mean for him to hear.\u201d She smiled and shook her head. \u201cI probably ought to give him more credit. He\u2019s really quite decent, isn\u2019t he?\u201d \u201cI think so.\u201d \u00a0\u201cI can tell.\u201d Then she sighed. \u201cI haven\u2019t been fair to you, either, Bella. Did he tell you why? Or was that too confidential?\u201d \u201cHe said it was because I was human. He said it was harder for you to have someone on the outside who knew.\u201d  Rosalie\u2019s musical laughter interrupted me. \u201cNow I really feel guilty. He\u2019s been much, much kinder to me than I deserve.\u201d She seemed warmer as she laughed, like she\u2019d let down some guard that had never been absent in my presence before. \u201cWhat a liar that boy is.\u201d She laughed again. \u00a0\u201cHe was lying?\u201d I asked, suddenly wary. \u201cWell, that\u2019s probably putting it too strongly. He just didn\u2019t tell you the whole story. What he told you was true, even truer now than it was before. However, at the time . . .\u201d She broke off, chuckling nervously. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing. You see, at first, I was mostly jealous because he wanted you and not me.\u201d Her words sent a thrill of fear through me. Sitting there in the silver light, she was more beautiful than anything else I could imagine. I could not compete with Rosalie. \u201cBut you love Emmett . . . ,\u201d I mumbled. She shook her head back and forth, amused. \u201cI don\u2019t want Edward that way, Bella. I never did \u2014 I love him as a brother, but he\u2019s irritated me from the first moment I heard him speak. You have to understand, though . . . I was so used to people wanting me . And Edward wasn\u2019t the least bit interested. It frustrated me, even offended me in the beginning. But he never wanted anyone, so it didn\u2019t bother me long. Even when we first met Tanya\u2019s clan in Denali \u2014 all those females! \u2014 Edward never showed the slightest preference. And then he met you.\u201d She looked at me with confused eyes. I was only half paying attention. I was thinking about Edward and Tanya and all those females, and my lips pressed together in a hard line. \u00a0\u201cNot that you aren\u2019t pretty, Bella,\u201d she said, misreading my expression. \u201cBut it just meant that he found you more attractive than me. I\u2019m vain enough that I minded.\u201d \u201cBut you said \u2018at first.\u2019 That doesn\u2019t still . . . bother you, does it? I mean, we both know you\u2019re the most beautiful person on the planet.\u201d I laughed at having to say the words \u2014 it was so obvious. How odd that Rosalie should need such reassurances. Rosalie laughed, too. \u201cThanks, Bella. And no, it doesn\u2019t really bother me anymore. Edward has always been a little strange.\u201d She laughed again. \u201cBut you still don\u2019t like me,\u201d I whispered. Her smile faded. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d We sat in silence for a moment, and she didn\u2019t seem inclined to go on. \u201cWould you tell me why? Did I do something . . . ?\u201d Was she angry that I\u2019d put her family \u2014 her Emmett \u2014 in danger? Time and time again. James, and now Victoria . . . \u00a0\u201cNo, you haven\u2019t done anything,\u201d she murmured. \u201cNot yet.\u201d I stared at her, perplexed. \u201cDon\u2019t you see, Bella?\u201d Her voice was suddenly more passionate than before, even while she\u2019d told her unhappy story. \u201cYou already have everything . You have a whole life ahead of you \u2014 everything I want.  And you\u2019re going to just throw it away . Can\u2019t you see that I\u2019d trade everything I have to be you? You have the choice that I didn\u2019t have, and you\u2019re choosing wrong !\u201d I flinched back from her fierce expression. I realized my mouth had fallen open and I snapped it shut. She stared at me for a long moment and, slowly, the fervor in her eyes <em>dimmed</em>. Abruptly, she was abashed. \u201cAnd I was so sure that I could do this calmly.\u201d She shook her head, seeming a little dazed by the flood of emotion. \u201cIt\u2019s just that it\u2019s harder now than it was then, when it was no more than vanity.\u201d She stared at the moon in silence. It was a few moments before I was brave enough to break into her reverie. \u201cWould you like me better if I chose to stay human?\u201d She turned back to me, her lips twitching into a hint of a smile. \u201cMaybe.\u201d \u201cYou did get some of your happy ending, though,\u201d I reminded her. \u201cYou got Emmett.\u201d \u201cI got half.\u201d She grinned. \u201cYou know that I saved Emmett from a bear that was mauling him, and carried him home to Carlisle. But can you guess why I stopped the bear from eating him?\u201d I shook my head. \u201cWith the dark curls . . . the dimples that showed even while he was grimacing in pain . . . the strange innocence that seemed so out of place on a grown man\u2019s face . . . he reminded me of Vera\u2019s little Henry. I didn\u2019t want him to die \u2014 so much that, even though I hated this life, I was selfish enough to ask Carlisle to change him for me. \u00a0\u201cI got luckier than I deserved. Emmett is everything I would have asked for if I\u2019d known myself well enough to know what to ask for. He\u2019s exactly the kind of person someone like me needs. And, oddly enough, he needs me, too. That part worked out better than I could have hoped. But there will never be more than the two of us. And I\u2019ll never sit on a porch somewhere, with him gray-haired by my side, surrounded by our grandchildren.\u201d Her smile was kind now. \u201cThat sounds quite bizarre to you, doesn\u2019t it? In some ways, you are much more mature than I was at eighteen. But in other ways . . . there are many things you\u2019ve probably never thought about seriously. You\u2019re too young to know what you\u2019ll want in ten years, fifteen years \u2014 and too young to give it all up without thinking it through. You don\u2019t want to be rash about \u00a0permanent things, Bella.\u201d She patted my head, but the gesture didn\u2019t feel condescending. I sighed. \u201cJust think about it a little. Once it\u2019s done, it can\u2019t be undone. Esme\u2019s made do with us as substitutes . . . and Alice doesn\u2019t remember anything human so she can\u2019t miss it. . . . You will remember, though. It\u2019s a lot to give up.\u201d But more to get in return, I didn\u2019t say aloud.  \u201cThanks, Rosalie. It\u2019s nice to understand . . . to know you better.\u201d \u00a0\u201cI apologize for being such a monster.\u201d She grinned. \u201cI\u2019ll try to behave myself from now on.\u201d I grinned back at her. We weren\u2019t friends yet, but I was pretty sure she wouldn\u2019t always hate me so much. \u201cI\u2019ll let you sleep now.\u201d Rosalie\u2019s eyes flickered to the bed, and her lips twitched. \u201cI know you\u2019re frustrated that he\u2019s keeping you locked up like this, but don\u2019t give him too bad a time when he gets back.  He loves you more than you know. It terrifies him to be away from you.\u201d She got up silently and ghosted to the door. \u201cGoodnight, Bella,\u201d she whispered as she shut it behind herself. \u201cGoodnight, Rosalie,\u201d I murmured a second too late. It took me a long time to fall asleep after that. When I did sleep, I had a nightmare. I was crawling across the dark, cold stones of an unfamiliar street, under lightly falling snow, leaving a trail of blood smeared behind me. A shadowy angel in a long white dress watched my progress with resentful eyes. The next morning, Alice drove me to school while I stared grumpily out the windshield. I was feeling sleep-deprived, and it made the irritation of my imprisonment that much stronger. \u201cTonight we\u2019ll go out to Olympia or something,\u201d she promised. \u201cThat would be fun, right?\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just lock me in the basement,\u201d I suggested, \u201cand forget the sugar coating?\u201d Alice frowned. \u201cHe\u2019s going to take the Porsche back. I\u2019m not doing a very good job. You\u2019re supposed to be having fun.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault,\u201d I muttered. I couldn\u2019t believe I actually felt guilty. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at lunch.\u201d I trudged off to English. Without Edward, the day was guaranteed to be unbearable. I sulked through my first class, well aware that my attitude wasn\u2019t helping anything. When the bell rang, I got up without much enthusiasm. Mike was there at the door, holding it open for me. \u201cEdward hiking this weekend?\u201d he asked sociably as we walked out into the light rain. \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cYou want to do something tonight?\u201d How could he still sound hopeful? \u201cCan\u2019t. I\u2019ve got a slumber party,\u201d I grumbled. He gave me a strange look as he processed my mood. \u00a0\u201cWho are you \u2014\u201d Mike\u2019s question was cut short as a loud, growling roar erupted from behind us in the parking lot. Everyone on the sidewalk turned to look, staring in disbelief as the noisy black motorcycle screeched to a stop on the edge of the concrete, the engine still snarling. Jacob waved to me urgently. \u201cRun, Bella!\u201d he yelled over the engine\u2019s roar. I was frozen for a second before I understood. I looked at Mike quickly. I knew I only had seconds. How far would Alice go to restrain me in public? \u201cI got really sick and went home, okay?\u201d I said to Mike, my voice filled with sudden excitement. \u201cFine,\u201d he muttered. I pecked Mike swiftly on the cheek. \u201cThanks, Mike. I owe you one!\u201d I called as I sprinted away. Jacob revved his engine, grinning. I jumped on the back of his seat, wrapping my arms tightly around his waist. I caught sight of Alice, frozen at the edge of the cafeteria, her eyes sparking with fury, her lip curled back over her teeth. I shot her one pleading glance. Then we were racing across the blacktop so fast that my stomach got lost somewhere behind me. \u201cHold on,\u201d Jacob shouted. I hid my face in his back as he sped down the highway. I knew he would slow down when we hit the Quileute border. I just had to hold on till then. I prayed silently and fervently that Alice wouldn\u2019t follow, and that Charlie wouldn\u2019t happen to see me. . . . It was obvious when we had reached the safe zone. The bike slowed, and Jacob straightened up and howled with laughter. I opened my eyes. \u201cWe made it,\u201d he shouted. \u201cNot bad for a prison break, eh?\u201d \u201cGood thinking, Jake.\u201d \u201cI remembered what you said about the psychic leech not being about to predict what I\u2019m going to do. I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t think of this \u2014 she wouldn\u2019t have let you go to school.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s why I didn\u2019t consider it.\u201d He laughed triumphantly. \u201cWhat do you want to do today?\u201d \u201cAnything!\u201d I laughed back. It felt great to be free.",

            "en": "13        13. CONFESSIONS Edward in the sunlight was shocking. I couldn't get used to it, though I'd been staring at him all afternoon. His skin, white despite the faint flush from yesterday's hunting trip, literally sparkled, like thousands of tiny diamonds were embedded in the surface. He lay perfectly still in the grass, his shirt open over his sculpted, incandescent chest, his scintillating arms bare. His glistening, pale lavender lids were shut, though of course he didn't sleep. A perfect statue, carved in some unknown stone, smooth like marble, glittering like crystal. Now and then, his lips would move, so fast it looked like they were trembling. But, when I asked, he told me he was singing to himself; it was too low for me to hear. I enjoyed the sun, too, though the air wasn't quite dry enough for my taste. I would have liked to lie back, as he did, and let the sun warm my face. But I stayed curled up, my chin resting on my knees, unwilling to take my eyes off him. The wind was gentle; it tangled my hair and ruffled the grass that swayed around his motionless form. The meadow, so spectacular to me at first, paled next to his magnificence. Hesitantly, always afraid, even now, that he would disappear like a mirage, too beautiful to be real\u2026 hesitantly, I reached out one finger and stroked the back of his shimmering hand, where it lay within my reach. I marveled again at the perfect texture, satin smooth, cool as stone. When I looked up again, his eyes were open, watching me. Butterscotch today, lighter, warmer after hunting. His quick smile turned up the corners of his flawless lips. \"I don't scare you?\" he asked playfully, but I could hear the real curiosity in his soft voice. \"No more than usual.\" He smiled wider; his teeth flashed in the sun. I inched closer, stretched out my whole hand now to trace the contours of his forearm with my fingertips. I saw that my fingers trembled, and knew it wouldn't escape his notice. \"Do you mind?\" I asked, for he had closed his eyes again. \"No,\" he said without opening his eyes. \"You can't imagine how that feels.\" He sighed. I lightly trailed my hand over the perfect muscles of his arm, followed\u00a0 the faint pattern of bluish veins inside the crease at his elbow. With my other hand, I reached to turn his hand over. Realizing what I wished, he flipped his palm up in one of those blindingly fast, disconcerting movements of his. It startled me; my fingers froze on his arm for a brief second. \"Sorry,\" he murmured. I looked up in time to see his golden eyes close again. \"It's too easy to be myself with you.\" I lifted his hand, turning it this way and that as I watched the sun glitter on his palm. I held it closer to my face, trying to see the hidden facets in his skin. \"Tell me what you're thinking,\" he whispered. I looked to see his eyes watching me, suddenly intent. \"It's still so strange for me, not knowing.\" \"You know, the rest of us feel that way all the time.\" \"It's a hard life.\" Did I imagine the hint of regret in his tone? \"But you didn't tell me.\" \"I was wishing I could know what you were thinking\u2026\" I hesitated. \"And?\" \"I was wishing that I could believe that you were real. And I was wishing that I wasn't afraid.\" \"I don't want you to be afraid.\" His voice was just a soft murmur. I heard what he couldn't truthfully say, that I didn't need to be afraid, that there was nothing to fear. \"Well, that's not exactly the fear I meant, though that's certainly something to think about.\" So quickly that I missed his movement, he was half sitting, propped up on his right arm, his left palm still in my hands. His angel's face was only a few inches from mine. I might have \u2014 should have \u2014 flinched away from his unexpected closeness, but I was unable to move.  His golden eyes mesmerized me. \"What are you afraid of, then?\" he whispered intently. But I couldn't answer. As I had just that once before, I smelled his cool breath in my face. Sweet, delicious, the scent made my mouth water. It was unlike anything else. Instinctively, unthinkingly, I leaned closer, inhaling. And he was gone, his hand ripped from mine. In the time it took my eyes to focus, he was twenty feet away, standing at the edge of the small meadow, in the deep shade of a huge fir tree. He stared at me, his eyes dark in the shadows, his expression unreadable. I could feel the hurt and shock on my face. My empty hands stung. \"I'm\u2026 sorry\u2026 Edward,\" I whispered. I knew he could hear. \"Give me a moment,\" he called, just loud enough for my less sensitive ears. I sat very still. After ten incredibly long seconds, he walked back, slowly for him. He stopped, still several feet away, and sank gracefully to the ground, crossing his legs. His eyes never left mine.  He took two deep breaths, and then smiled in apology. \"I am so very sorry.\" He hesitated. \"Would you understand what I meant if I said I was only human?\" I nodded once, not quite able to smile at his joke. Adrenaline pulsed through my veins as the realization of danger slowly sank in. He could smell that from where he sat. His smile turned mocking. \"I'm the world's best predator, aren't I? Everything about me invites you in \u2014 my voice, my face, even my smell. As if I need any of that!\" Unexpectedly, he was on his feet, bounding away, instantly out of sight, only to appear beneath the same tree as before, having circled the meadow in half a second. \"As if you could outrun me,\" he laughed bitterly. He reached up with one hand and, with a deafening crack, effortlessly ripped a two-foot-thick branch from the trunk of the spruce. He balanced it in that hand for a moment, and then threw it with blinding speed, shattering it against another huge tree, which shook and trembled at the blow. And he was in front of me again, standing two feet away, still as a stone. \"As if you could fight me off,\" he said gently. I sat without moving, more frightened of him than I had ever been. I'd never seen him so completely freed of that carefully cultivated facade. He'd never been less human\u2026 or more beautiful. Face ashen, eyes wide, I sat like a bird locked in the eyes of a snake. His lovely eyes seem to glow with rash excitement. Then, as the seconds passed, they <em>dimmed</em>. His expression slowly folded into a mask of ancient sadness. \"Don't be afraid,\" he murmured, his velvet voice unintentionally seductive. \"I promise\u2026\" He hesitated. \"I swear not to hurt you.\" He seemed more concerned with convincing himself than me. \"Don't be afraid,\" he whispered again as he stepped closer, with exaggerated slowness. He sat sinuously, with deliberately unhurried movements, till our faces were on the same level, just a foot apart. \"Please forgive me,\" he said formally. \"I can control myself. You caught me off guard. But I'm on my best behavior now.\" He waited, but I still couldn't speak. \"I'm not thirsty today, honestly.\" He winked. At that I had to laugh, though the sound was shaky and breathless. \"Are you all right?\" he asked tenderly, reaching out slowly, carefully, to place his marble hand back in mine. I looked at his smooth, cold hand, and then at his eyes. They were soft, repentant. I looked back at his hand, and then deliberately returned to tracing the lines in his hand with my fingertip. I looked up and smiled timidly. His answering smile was dazzling. \"So where were we, before I behaved so rudely?\" he asked in the gentle cadences of an earlier century. \"I honestly can't remember.\" He smiled, but his face was ashamed. \"I think we were talking about why you were afraid, besides the obvious reason.\" \"Oh, right.\" \"Well?\" I looked down at his hand and doodled aimlessly across his smooth, iridescent palm. The seconds ticked by. \"How easily frustrated I am,\" he sighed. I looked into his eyes, abruptly grasping that this was every bit as new to him as it was to me. As many years of unfathomable experience as he had, this was hard for him, too. I took courage from that thought. \"I was afraid\u2026 because, for, well, obvious reasons, I can't stay with you. And I'm afraid that I'd like to stay with you, much more than I should.\" I looked down at his hands as I spoke. It was difficult for me to say this aloud. \"Yes,\" he agreed slowly. \"That is something to be afraid of, indeed. Wanting to be with me. That's really not in your best interest.\" I frowned. \"I should have left long ago,\" he sighed. \"I should leave now. But I don't know if I can.\" \"I don't want you to leave,\" I mumbled pathetically, staring down again. \"Which is exactly why I should. But don't worry. I'm essentially a selfish creature. I crave your company too much to do what I should.\" \"I'm glad.\" \"Don't be!\" He withdrew his hand, more gently this time; his voice was harsher than usual. Harsh for him, still more beautiful than any human voice. It was hard to keep up \u2014 his sudden mood changes left me always a step behind, dazed. \"It's not only your company I crave! Never forget that. Never forget I am more dangerous to you than I am to anyone else.\" He stopped, and I looked to see him gazing unseeingly into the forest. I thought for a moment. \"I don't think I understand exactly what you mean \u2014 by that last part anyway,\" I said. He looked back at me and smiled, his mood shifting yet again. \"How do I explain?\" he mused. \"And without frightening you again\u2026 hmmmm.\" Without seeming to think about it, he placed his hand back in mine; I held it tightly in both of mine. He looked at our hands. \"That's amazingly pleasant, the warmth.\" He sighed. A moment passed as he assembled his thoughts. \"You know how everyone enjoys different flavors?\" he began. \"Some people love chocolate ice cream, others prefer strawberry?\" I nodded. \"Sorry about the food analogy \u2014 I couldn't think of another way to explain.\" I smiled. He smiled ruefully back. \"You see, every person smells different, has a different essence. If you locked an alcoholic in a room full of stale beer, he'd gladly drink it. But he could resist, if he wished to, if he were a recovering alcoholic. Now let's say you placed in that room a glass of hundred-year-old brandy, the rarest, finest cognac \u2014 and filled the room with its warm aroma \u2014 how do you think he would fare then?\" We sat silently, looking into each other's eyes \u2014 trying to read each other's thoughts. He broke the silence first. \"Maybe that's not the right comparison. Maybe it would be too easy to turn down the brandy. Perhaps I should have made our alcoholic a heroin addict instead.\" \"So what you're saying is, I'm your brand of heroin?\" I teased, trying to lighten the mood. He smiled swiftly, seeming to appreciate my effort. \"Yes, you are exactly my brand of heroin.\" \"Does that happen often?\" I asked. He looked across the treetops, thinking through his response. \"I spoke to my brothers about it.\" He still stared into the distance. \"To Jasper, every one of you is much the same. He's the most recent to join our family. It's a struggle for him to abstain at all. He hasn't had time to grow sensitive to the differences in smell, in flavor.\" He glanced swiftly at me, his expression apologetic. \"Sorry,\" he said. \"I don't mind. Please don't worry about offending me, or frightening me, or whichever. That's the way you think. I can understand, or I can try to at least. Just explain however you can.\" He took a deep breath and gazed at the sky again. \"So Jasper wasn't sure if he'd ever come across someone who was as\" \u2014 he hesitated, looking for the right word \u2014 \"appealing as you are to me.\u00a0 Which makes me think not. Emmett has been on the wagon longer, so to speak, and he understood what I meant. He says twice, for him, once stronger than the other.\" \"And for you?\" \"Never.\" The word hung there for a moment in the warm breeze. \"What did Emmett do?\" I asked to break the silence. It was the wrong question to ask. His face grew dark, his hand clenched into a fist inside mine. He looked away. I waited, but he wasn't going to answer. \"I guess I know,\" I finally said. He lifted his eyes; his expression was wistful, pleading. \"Even the strongest of us fall off the wagon, don't we?\" \"What are you asking? My permission?\" My voice was sharper than I'd intended. I tried to make my tone kinder \u2014 I could guess what his honesty must cost him. \"I mean, is there no hope, then?\" How calmly I could discuss my own death! \"No, no!\" He was instantly contrite. \"Of course there's hope! I mean, of course I won't\u2026\" He left the sentence hanging. His eyes burned into mine. \"It's different for us. Emmett\u2026 these were strangers he happened across. It was a long time ago, and he wasn't as\u2026 practiced, as careful, as he is now.\" He fell silent and watched me intently as I thought it through. \"So if we'd met\u2026 oh, in a dark alley or something\u2026\" I trailed off. \"It took everything I had not to jump up in the middle of that class full of children and \u2014\" He stopped abruptly, looking away. \"When you walked past me, I could have ruined everything Carlisle has built for us, right then and there. If I hadn't been denying my thirst for the last, well, too many years, I wouldn't have been able to stop myself.\" He paused, scowling at the trees. He glanced at me grimly, both of us remembering. \"You must have thought I was possessed.\" \"I couldn't understand why. How you could hate me so quickly\u2026\" \"To me, it was like you were some kind of demon, summoned straight from my own personal hell to ruin me. The fragrance coming off your skin\u2026 I thought it would make me deranged that first day. In that one hour, I thought of a hundred different ways to lure you from the room with me, to get you alone. And I fought them each back, thinking of my family, what I could do to them. I had to run out, to get away before I could speak the words that would make you follow\u2026\" He looked up then at my staggered expression as I tried to absorb his bitter memories. His golden eyes scorched from under his lashes, hypnotic and deadly. \"You would have come,\" he promised. I tried to speak calmly. \"Without a doubt.\" He frowned down at my hands, releasing me from the force of his stare. \"And then, as I tried to rearrange my schedule in a pointless attempt to avoid you, you were there \u2014 in that close, warm little room, the scent was maddening. I so very nearly took you then. There was only one other frail human there \u2014 so easily dealt with.\" I shivered in the warm sun, seeing my memories anew through his eyes, only now grasping the danger. Poor Ms. Cope; I shivered again at how close I'd come to being inadvertently responsible for her death. \"But I resisted. I don't know how. I forced myself not to wait for you, not to follow you from the school. It was easier outside, when I couldn't smell you anymore, to think clearly, to make the right decision. I left the others near home \u2014 I was too ashamed to tell them how weak I was, they only knew something was very wrong \u2014 and then I went straight to Carlisle, at the hospital, to tell him I was leaving.\" I stared in surprise.  \"I traded cars with him \u2014 he had a full tank of gas and I didn't want to stop. I didn't dare to go home, to face Esme. She wouldn't have let me go without a scene. She would have tried to convince me that it wasn't necessary\u2026 \"By the next morning I was in Alaska.\" He sounded ashamed, as if admitting a great cowardice. \"I spent two days there, with some old acquaintances\u2026 but I was homesick. I hated knowing I'd upset Esme, and the rest of them, my adopted family. In the pure air of the mountains it was hard to believe you were so irresistible. I convinced myself it was weak to run away. I'd dealt with temptation before, not of this magnitude, not even close, but I was strong. Who were you, an insignificant little girl\" \u2014 he grinned suddenly \u2014 \"to chase me from the place I wanted to be? So I came back\u2026\" He stared off into space. I couldn't speak. \"I took precautions, hunting, feeding more than usual before seeing you again. I was sure that I was strong enough to treat you like any other human. I was arrogant about it. \"It was unquestionably a complication that I couldn't simply read your thoughts to know what your reaction was to me. I wasn't used to having to go to such circuitous measures, listening to your words in Jessica's mind\u2026 her mind isn't very original, and it was annoying to have to stoop to that. And then I couldn't know if you really meant what you said. It was all extremely irritating.\" He frowned at the memory. \"I wanted you to forget my behavior that first day, if possible, so I tried to talk with you like I would with any person. I was eager actually, hoping to decipher some of your thoughts. But you were too interesting, I found myself caught up in your expressions\u2026 and every now and then you would stir the air with your hand or your hair, and the scent would stun me again\u2026 \"Of course, then you were nearly crushed to death in front of my eyes. Later I thought of a perfectly good excuse for why I acted at that moment \u2014 because if I hadn't saved you, if your blood had been spilled there in front of me, I don't think I could have stopped myself from exposing us for what we are. But I only thought of that excuse later. At the time, all I could think was, 'Not her.'\" He closed his eyes, lost in his agonized confession. I listened, more eager than rational. Common sense told me I should be terrified. Instead, I was relieved to finally understand. And I was filled with compassion for his suffering, even now, as he confessed his craving to take my life. I finally was able to speak, though my voice was faint. \"In the hospital?\" His eyes flashed up to mine. \"I was appalled. I couldn't believe I had put us in danger after all, put myself in your power \u2014 you of all people. As if I needed another motive to kill you.\"  We both flinched as that word slipped out. \"But it had the opposite effect,\" he continued quickly. \"I fought with Rosalie, Emmett, and Jasper when they suggested that now was the time\u2026 the worst fight we've ever had. Carlisle sided with me, and Alice.\" He grimaced when he said her name. I couldn't imagine why. \"Esme told me to do whatever I had to in order to stay.\" He shook his head indulgently. \"All that next day I eavesdropped on the minds of everyone you spoke to, shocked that you kept your word. I didn't understand you at all. But I knew that I couldn't become more involved with you. I did my very best to stay as far from you as possible. And every day the perfume of your skin, your breath, your hair\u2026 it hit me as hard as the very first day.\" He met my eyes again, and they were surprisingly tender. \"And for all that,\" he continued, \"I'd have fared better if I had exposed us all at that first moment, than if now, here \u2014 with no witnesses and nothing to stop me \u2014 I were to hurt you.\" I was human enough to have to ask. \"Why?\" \"Isabella.\" He pronounced my full name carefully, then playfully ruffled my hair with his free hand. A shock ran through my body at his casual touch. \"Bella, I couldn't live with myself if I ever hurt you. You don't know how it's tortured me.\" He looked down, ashamed again. \"The thought of you, still, white, cold\u2026 to never see you blush scarlet again, to never see that flash of intuition in your eyes when you see through my pretenses\u2026 it would be unendurable.\" He lifted his glorious, agonized eyes to mine. \"You are the most important thing to me now. The most important thing to me ever.\" My head was spinning at the rapid change in direction our conversation had taken. From the cheerful topic of my impending demise, we were suddenly declaring ourselves. He waited, and even though I looked down to study our hands between us, I knew his golden eyes were on me.  \"You already know how I feel, of course,\" I finally said. \"I'm here\u2026 which, roughly translated, means I would rather die than stay away from you.\" I frowned. \"I'm an idiot.\" \"You are an idiot,\" he agreed with a laugh. Our eyes met, and I laughed, too. We laughed together at the idiocy and sheer impossibility of such a moment. \"And so the lion fell in love with the lamb\u2026\" he murmured. I looked away, hiding my eyes as I thrilled to the word. \"What a stupid lamb,\" I sighed. \"What a sick, masochistic lion.\" He stared into the shadowy forest for a long moment, and I wondered where his thoughts had taken him. \"Why\u2026 ?\" I began, and then paused, not sure how to continue. He looked at me and smiled; sunlight glinted off his face, his teeth.  \"Yes?\" \"Tell me why you ran from me before.\" His smile faded. \"You know why.\" \"No, I mean, exactly what did I do wrong? I'll have to be on my guard, you see, so I better start learning what I shouldn't do. This, for example\" \u2014 I stroked the back of his hand \u2014 \"seems to be all right.\" He smiled again. \"You didn't do anything wrong, Bella. It was my fault.\" \"But I want to help, if I can, to not make this harder for you.\" \"Well\u2026\" He contemplated for a moment. \"It was just how close you were. Most humans instinctively shy away from us, are repelled by our alienness\u2026 I wasn't expecting you to come so close. And the smell of your throat.\" He stopped short, looking to see if he'd upset me. \"Okay, then,\" I said flippantly, trying to alleviate the suddenly tense atmosphere. I tucked my chin. \"No throat exposure.\" It worked; he laughed. \"No, really, it was more the surprise than anything else.\" He raised his free hand and placed it gently on the side of my neck. I sat very still, the chill of his touch a natural warning \u2014 a warning telling me to be terrified. But there was no feeling of fear in me. There were, however, other feelings\u2026 \"You see,\" he said. \"Perfectly fine.\" My blood was racing, and I wished I could slow it, sensing that this must make everything so much more difficult \u2014 the thudding of my pulse in my veins. Surely he could hear it. \"The blush on your cheeks is lovely,\" he murmured. He gently freed his other hand. My hands fell limply into my lap. Softly he brushed my cheek, then held my face between his marble hands. \"Be very still,\" he whispered, as if I wasn't already frozen. Slowly, never moving his eyes from mine, he leaned toward me. Then abruptly, but very gently, he rested his cold cheek against the hollow at the base of my throat. I was quite unable to move, even if I'd wanted to. I listened to the sound of his even breathing, watching the sun and wind play in his bronze hair, more human than any other part of him. With deliberate slowness, his hands slid down the sides of my neck. I shivered, and I heard him catch his breath. But his hands didn't pause as they softly moved to my shoulders, and then stopped. His face drifted to the side, his nose skimming across my collarbone. He came to rest with the side of his face pressed tenderly against my chest. Listening to my heart. \"Ah,\" he sighed. I don't know how long we sat without moving. It could have been hours.  Eventually the throb of my pulse quieted, but he didn't move or speak again as he held me. I knew at any moment it could be too much, and my life could end \u2014 so quickly that I might not even notice. And I couldn't make myself be afraid. I couldn't think of anything, except that he was touching me. And then, too soon, he released me.  His eyes were peaceful. \"It won't be so hard again,\" he said with satisfaction. \"Was that very hard for you?\" \"Not nearly as bad as I imagined it would be. And you?\" \"No, it wasn't bad\u2026 for me.\" He smiled at my inflection. \"You know what I mean.\" I smiled. \"Here.\" He took my hand and placed it against his cheek. \"Do you feel how warm it is?\" And it was almost warm, his usually icy skin. But I barely noticed, for I was touching his face, something I'd dreamed of constantly since the first day I'd seen him. \"Don't move,\" I whispered. No one could be still like Edward. He closed his eyes and became as immobile as stone, a carving under my hand. I moved even more slowly than he had, careful not to make one unexpected move. I caressed his cheek, delicately stroked his eyelid, the purple shadow in the hollow under his eye. I traced the shape of his perfect nose, and then, so carefully, his flawless lips. His lips parted under my hand, and I could feel his cool breath on my fingertips. I wanted to lean in, to inhale the scent of him. So I dropped my hand and leaned away, not wanting to push him too far. He opened his eyes, and they were hungry. Not in a way to make me fear, but rather to tighten the muscles in the pit of my stomach and send my pulse hammering through my veins again. \"I wish,\" he whispered, \"I wish you could feel the\u2026 complexity\u2026 the confusion\u2026 I feel. That you could understand.\" He raised his hand to my hair, then carefully brushed it across my face. \"Tell me,\" I breathed. \"I don't think I can. I've told you, on the one hand, the hunger \u2014 the thirst \u2014 that, deplorable creature that I am, I feel for you. And I think you can understand that, to an extent. Though\" \u2014 he half-smiled \u2014 \"as you are not addicted to any illegal substances, you probably can't empathize completely. \"But\u2026\" His fingers touched my lips lightly, making me shiver again. \"There are other hungers. Hungers I don't even understand, that are foreign to me.\" \"I may understand that better than you think.\" \"I'm not used to feeling so human. Is it always like this?\" \"For me?\" I paused. \"No, never. Never before this.\" He held my hands between his. They felt so feeble in his iron strength. \"I don't know how to be close to you,\" he admitted. \"I don't know if I can.\" I leaned forward very slowly, cautioning him with my eyes. I placed my cheek against his stone chest. I could hear his breath, and nothing else. \"This is enough,\" I sighed, closing my eyes. In a very human gesture, he put his arms around me and pressed his face against my hair. \"You're better at this than you give yourself credit for,\" I noted. \"I have human instincts \u2014 they may be buried deep, but they're there.\" We sat like that for another immeasurable moment; I wondered if he could be as unwilling to move as I was. But I could see the light was fading, the shadows of the forest beginning to touch us, and I sighed. \"You have to go.\" \"I thought you couldn't read my mind.\" \"It's getting clearer.\" I could hear a smile in his voice. He took my shoulders and I looked into his face. \"Can I show you something?\" he asked, sudden excitement flaring in his eyes. \"Show me what?\" \"I'll show you how I travel in the forest.\" He saw my expression. \"Don't worry, you'll be very safe, and we'll get to your truck much faster.\" His mouth twitched up into that crooked smile so beautiful my heart nearly stopped. \"Will you turn into a bat?\" I asked warily. He laughed, louder than I'd ever heard. \"Like I haven't heard that one before!\" \"Right, I'm sure you get that all the time.\" \"Come on, little coward, climb on my back.\" I waited to see if he was kidding, but, apparently, he meant it. He smiled as he read my hesitation, and reached for me. My heart reacted; even though he couldn't hear my thoughts, my pulse always gave me away. He then proceeded to sling me onto his back, with very little effort on my part, besides, when in place, clamping my legs and arms so tightly around him that it would choke a normal person. It was like clinging to a stone. \"I'm a bit heavier than your average backpack,\" I warned.  \"Hah!\" he snorted. I could almost hear his eyes rolling. I'd never seen him in such high spirits before. He startled me, suddenly grabbing my hand, pressing my palm to his face, and inhaling deeply. \"Easier all the time,\" he muttered. And then he was running. If I'd ever feared death before in his presence, it was nothing compared to how I felt now. He streaked through the dark, thick underbrush of the forest like a bullet, like a ghost. There was no sound, no evidence that his feet touched the earth. His breathing never changed, never indicated any effort. But the trees flew by at deadly speeds, always missing us by inches. I was too terrified to close my eyes, though the cool forest air whipped against my face and burned them. I felt as if I were stupidly sticking my head out the window of an airplane in flight. And, for the first time in my life, I felt the dizzy faintness of motion sickness. Then it was over. We'd hiked hours this morning to reach Edward's meadow, and now, in a matter of minutes, we were back to the truck. \"Exhilarating, isn't it?\" His voice was high, excited. He stood motionless, waiting for me to climb down. I tried, but my muscles wouldn't respond. My arms and legs stayed locked around him while my head spun uncomfortably. \"Bella?\" he asked, anxious now. \"I think I need to lie down,\" I gasped. \"Oh, sorry.\" He waited for me, but I still couldn't move. \"I think I need help,\" I admitted. He laughed quietly, and gently unloosened my stranglehold on his neck. There was no resisting the iron strength of his hands. Then he pulled me around to face him, cradling me in his arms like a small child. He held me for a moment, then carefully placed me on the springy ferns. \"How do you feel?\" he asked. I couldn't be sure how I felt when my head was spinning so crazily. \"Dizzy, I think.\" \"Put your head between your knees.\" I tried that, and it helped a little. I breathed in and out slowly, keeping my head very still. I felt him sitting beside me. The moments passed, and eventually I found that I could raise my head. There was a hollow ringing sound in my ears. \"I guess that wasn't the best idea,\" he mused. I tried to be positive, but my voice was weak. \"No, it was very interesting.\" \"Hah! You're as white as a ghost \u2014 no, you're as white as me!\" \"I think I should have closed my eyes.\" \"Remember that next time.\" \"Next time!\" I groaned. He laughed, his mood still radiant. \"Show-off,\" I muttered. \"Open your eyes, Bella,\" he said quietly. And he was right there, his face so close to mine. His beauty stunned my mind \u2014 it was too much, an excess I couldn't grow accustomed to. \"I was thinking, while I was running\u2026\" He paused. \"About not hitting the trees, I hope.\" \"Silly Bella,\" he chuckled. \"Running is second nature to me, it's not something I have to think about.\" \"Show-off,\" I muttered again. He smiled. \"No,\" he continued, \"I was thinking there was something I wanted to try.\" And he took my face in his hands again. I couldn't breathe. He hesitated \u2014 not in the normal way, the human way. Not the way a man might hesitate before he kissed a woman, to gauge her reaction, to see how he would be received. Perhaps he would hesitate to prolong the moment, that ideal moment of anticipation, sometimes better than the kiss itself. Edward hesitated to test himself, to see if this was safe, to make sure he was still in control of his need. And then his cold, marble lips pressed very softly against mine. What neither of us was prepared for was my response. Blood boiled under my skin, burned in my lips. My breath came in a wild gasp. My fingers knotted in his hair, clutching him to me. My lips parted as I breathed in his heady scent. Immediately I felt him turn to unresponsive stone beneath my lips. His hands gently, but with irresistible force, pushed my face back. I opened my eyes and saw his guarded expression. \"Oops,\" I breathed. \"That's an understatement.\" His eyes were wild, his jaw clenched in acute restraint, yet he didn't lapse from his perfect articulation. He held my face just inches from his. He dazzled my eyes. \"Should I\u2026 ?\" I tried to disengage myself, to give him some room. His hands refused to let me move so much as an inch. \"No, it's tolerable. Wait for a moment, please.\" His voice was polite, controlled. I kept my eyes on his, watched as the excitement in them faded and gentled. Then he smiled a surprisingly impish grin. \"There,\" he said, obviously pleased with himself. \"Tolerable?\" I asked. He laughed aloud. \"I'm stronger than I thought. It's nice to know.\" \"I wish I could say the same. I'm sorry.\" \"You are only human, after all.\" \"Thanks so much,\" I said, my voice acerbic. He was on his feet in one of his lithe, almost invisibly quick movements. He held out his hand to me, an unexpected gesture. I was so used to our standard of careful non-contact. I took his icy hand, needing the support more than I thought. My balance had not yet returned. \"Are you still faint from the run? Or was it my kissing expertise?\" How lighthearted, how human he seemed as he laughed now, his seraphic face untroubled. He was a different Edward than the one I had known. And I felt all the more besotted by him. It would cause me physical pain to be separated from him now. \"I can't be sure, I'm still woozy,\" I managed to respond. \"I think it's some of both, though.\" \"Maybe you should let me drive.\" \"Are you insane?\" I protested. \"I can drive better than you on your best day,\" he teased. \"You have much slower reflexes.\" \"I'm sure that's true, but I don't think my nerves, or my truck, could take it.\" \"Some trust, please, Bella.\" My hand was in my pocket, curled tightly around the key. I pursed my lips, deliberated, then shook my head with a tight grin. \"Nope. Not a chance.\" He raised his eyebrows in disbelief. I started to step around him, heading for the driver's side. He might have let me pass if I hadn't wobbled slightly. Then again, he might not have. His arm created an inescapable snare around my waist. \"Bella, I've already expended a great deal of personal effort at this point to keep you alive. I'm not about to let you behind the wheel of a vehicle when you can't even walk straight. Besides, friends don't let friends drive drunk,\" he quoted with a chuckle. I could smell the unbearably sweet fragrance coming off his chest. \"Drunk?\" I objected. \"You're intoxicated by my very presence.\" He was grinning that playful smirk again. \"I can't argue with that,\" I sighed.; I couldn't resist him in anything. I held the key high and dropped it, watching his hand flash like lightning to catch it soundlessly. \"Take it easy \u2014 my truck is a senior citizen.\" \"Very sensible,\" he approved. \"And are you not affected at all?\" I asked, irked. \"By my presence?\" Again his mobile features transformed, his expression became soft, warm. He didn't answer at first; he simply bent his face to mine, and brushed his lips slowly along my jaw, from my ear to my chin, back and forth. I trembled. \"Regardless,\" he finally murmured, \"I have better reflexes.\"",
