This led to numerous myths and legends sticking to the story.  Some researchers think there was no wooden horse but just a ram that looked like a horse or a siege weapon, one of those which were often named after animals.  Others propose the Trojan Horse was an earthquake that destroyed the walls of Troy.  In any case, the story of the horse seems to be just a story after all.",
