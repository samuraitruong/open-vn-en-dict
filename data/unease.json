            "en": "China shares lead global stock market falls        \nChinese shares have suffered their biggest one-day fall since August last year because of fears that the government may increase interest rates.  The Shanghai Composite index closed down 5% on concerns that the government might shortly make a further attempt to control inflation.  The speculation, along with heightened fears about the Irish Republic's debt problem, also hit other markets.  European indexes opened 1-2% lower, before recovering their losses.  Shortly before lunchtime, Paris' Cac 40 was 0.7% lower. London's FTSE 100 and Frankfurt's Dax index were both down by less than 1%.  China's inflation rate hit a two-year high in October, according to figures released on Thursday, largely due to higher food prices.  This was despite recent government efforts to dampen price rises and cool its rapidly growing economy through interest rates rises and the introduction of limits on bank lending Some analysts expect the government to intensify efforts to control price rises in the coming days.  \"There are some rumours there might be another interest rate hike this weekend,\" said Linus Yip from First Shanghai Securities in Hong Kong.  The falls began in Asia overnight and continued in the early hours of European trading  'Full confidence'  Earlier sharp falls in European markets also coincided with the release of figures showing that the pace of economic recovery in Europe's leading economies had declined in the third quarter.  A slowdown had been expected, especially in Germany which enjoyed record growth in the previous quarter. But the figures were slightly lower than economists had been predicting.  There was no update on the state of the Irish economy, which has been the focus of growing <em>unease</em> in recent days, prompting talks on the sidelines of the G20 summit in South Korea.  European members of the G20 - France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK - issued a statement aimed at reassuring the bond markets, which pushed the Irish government's cost of borrowing to record levels this week.  Despite initial concerns from the Irish prime minister that the statement could be counterproductive, Irish bond yields fell, reflecting increased confidence in the likelihood that Irish government debt would be paid back in full.  They dropped to 8.2%, down from the all-time high of 8.95% reached on Thursday.  Irish Finance Minister Brian Lenihan said the statement had shown the countries had \"full confidence\" in his government's policies.",

            "en": "House Democrats vent on tax plan, focus criticism on estate tax      Washington (CNN) -- House Democrats vented their frustrations with President Barack Obama's tax proposal at a closed-door meeting Tuesday night, with rank-and-file members slamming the White House for leaving House Democrats out of final negotiations, and agreeing too quickly to a GOP proposal on the estate tax. According to several Democratic members and aides, much of the discussion centered on the addition of the estate tax exemption to the package extending all the Bush-era tax cuts for two years. Democrats are fuming that the administration agreed to exempt inheritances up to $5 million and to set the tax rate at 35%. The estate tax is scheduled to be reinstated at a higher rate of 55% next year, with the exemption up to $1 million. A bill passed the House a year ago that set the threshold for the exemption at $3.5 million and the tax rate at 45%. Pennsylvania Democrat Allyson Schwartz said, \"My sense is people are not happy with this,\" telling reporters that Democrats plan to \"push back at little\" at the White House to try to change the estate tax back to the version that passed the House. Schwartz said if the administration agreed to do that, she could support the package, but she could not predict how many other Democrats would do the same. Liberal Democratic Rep Anthony Weiner of New York called the estate tax provision \"one of the biggest problems, because that was the one we had the most leverage on.\" According to a senior House Democratic aide, Democratic Rep Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who represented House Democrats in discussions with the administration and Republicans, said the decision to accept the GOP estate tax proposal was \"an unnecessary giveaway to Kyl.\" GOP Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona, who was negotiating for Senate Republicans, sponsored an estate tax bill that is essentially the same as the deal outlined by Obama. About 20 House Democrats lined up at microphones at the evening meeting to complain about the president's proposal. According to the senior Democratic aide, in addition to concerns about the substance of the proposal, equally upsetting to attendees was how \"House Democrats were left out of the process at the end.\"\u00a0  The aide added, \"they view it as a trend,\" noting that it started with the president's stimulus package. \"The House always seems to get rolled,\" the aide said. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi \"didn't really weigh in either way\" during the meeting about how members should vote on the president's plan, according to the aide, \"but she certainly wasn't cheerleading for it.\" But Pelosi made it clear Democrats were unhappy, telling reporters outside the meeting, \"I think it's fair to say that there is a certain amount of <em>unease</em> with the proposal that was put forth by the president.\" She also noted that the estate tax benefits a much smaller number of families than the middle-class tax cut. The senior Democratic aide conceded that despite the threats to vote against the plan, it's also a reality that the proposal could still pass the House. \"This gets done, but does not get done with a majority of Democratic votes,\" the aide said. Vice President Joe Biden is scheduled to talk to House Democrats Wednesday afternoon. Asked whether Biden could convince Democrats to support the plan, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer quipped, \"You'll have to ask him.\" Hoyer didn't directly answer whether he believed House Democrats could make significant changes to the administration's plan, saying, \"I think it's under discussion,\" but he added, \"the majority of the House is still Democratic\"",

            "en": "2-2songngu        2. STITCHES CARLISLE WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO STAYED calm. Centuries of\u00a0 experience in the emergency room were evident in his quiet, authoritative voice. \"Emmett, Rose, get Jasper outside.\" Unsmiling for once, Emmett nodded. \"Come on, Jasper.\" Jasper struggled against Emmett's unbreakable grasp, twisting around, reaching toward his brother with his bared teeth, his eyes still past reason. Edward's face was whiter than bone as he wheeled to crouch over me, taking a clearly defensive position. A low warning growl slid from between his clenched teeth. I could tell that he wasn't breathing. Rosalie, her divine face strangely smug, stepped in front of Jasper\u2014keeping a careful distance from his teeth\u2014and helped Emmett wrestle him through the glass door that Esme held open, one hand pressed over her mouth and nose. Esme's heart-shaped face was ashamed. \"I'm so sorry, Bella,\" she cried as she followed the others into the yard. \"Let me by, Edward,\" Carlisle murmured. A second passed, and then Edward nodded slowly and relaxed his stance. Carlisle knelt beside me, leaning close to examine my arm. I could feel the shock frozen on my face, and I tried to compose it. \"Here, Carlisle,\" Alice said, handing him a towel. He shook his head. \"Too much glass in the wound.\" He reached over and ripped a long, thin scrap from the bottom of the white tablecloth. He twisted it around my arm above the elbow to form a tourniquet. The smell of the blood was making me dizzy. My ears rang. \"Bella,\" Carlisle said softly. \"Do you want me to drive you to the hospital, or would you like me to take care of it here?\" \"Here, please,\" I whispered. If he took me to the hospital, there would be no way to keep this from Charlie. \"I'll get your bag,\" Alice said. \"Let's take her to the kitchen table,\" Carlisle said to Edward. Edward lifted me effortlessly, while Carlisle kept the pressure steady on my arm. \"How are you doing, Bella?\" Carlisle asked. \"I'm fine.\" My voice was reasonably steady, which pleased me. Edward's face was like stone. Alice was there. Carlisle's black bag was already on the table, a small but brilliant desk light plugged into the wall. Edward sat me gently into a chair, and Carlisle pulled up another. He went to work at once. Edward stood over me, still protective, still not breathing. \"Just go, Edward,\" I sighed. \"I can handle it,\" he insisted. But his jaw was rigid; his eyes burned with the intensity of the thirst he fought, so much worse for him than it was for the others. \"You don't need to be a hero,\" I said. \"Carlisle can fix me up without your help. Get some fresh air.\" I winced as Carlisle did something to my arm that stung. \"I'll stay,\" he said. \"Why are you so masochistic?\" I mumbled. Carlisle decided to intercede. \"Edward, you may as well go find Jasper before he gets too far. I'm sure he's upset with himself, and I doubt he'll listen to anyone but you right now.\" \"Yes,\" I eagerly agreed. \"Go find Jasper.\" \"You might as well do something useful,\" Alice added. Edward's eyes narrowed as we ganged up on him, but, finally, he nodded once and sprinted smoothly through the kitchen's back door. I was sure he hadn't taken a breath since I'd sliced my finger. A numb, dead feeling was spreading through my arm. Though it erased the sting, it reminded me of the gash, and I watched Carlisle's face carefully to distract me from what his hands were doing. His hair gleamed gold in the bright light as he bent over my arm. I could feel the faint stirrings of <em>unease</em> in the pit of my stomach, but I was determined not to let my usual squeamishness get the best of me. There was no pain now, just a gentle tugging sensation that I tried to ignore. No reason to get sick like a baby. If she hadn't been in my line of sight, I wouldn't have noticed Alice give up and steal out of the room. With a tiny, apologetic smile on her lips, she disappeared through the kitchen doorway. \"Well, that's everyone,\" I sighed. \"I can clear a room, at least.\" \"It's not your fault,\" Carlisle comforted me with a chuckle. \"It could happen to anyone.\" \"Could\" I repeated. \"But it usually just happens to me.\" He laughed again. His relaxed calm was only more amazing set in direct contrast with everyone else's reaction. I couldn't find any trace of anxiety in his face. He worked with quick, sure movements. The only sound besides our quiet breathing was the soft plink, plink as the tiny fragments of glass dropped one by one to the table. \"How can you do this?\" I demanded. \"Even Alice and Esme\u2026\" I trailed off, shaking my head in wonder. Though the rest of them had given up the traditional diet of vampires just as absolutely as Carlisle had, he was the only one who could bear the smell of my blood without suffering from the intense temptation. Clearly, this was much more difficult than he made it seem. \"Years and years of practice,\" he told me. \"I barely notice the scent anymore.\" \"Do you think it would be harder if you took a vacation from the hospital for a long time. And weren't around any blood?\" \"Maybe.\" He shrugged his shoulders, but his hands remained steady. \"I've never felt the need for an extended holiday.\" He flashed a brilliant smile in my direction. \"I enjoy my work too much.\" Plink, plink, plink. I was surprised at how much glass there seemed to be in my arm. I was tempted to glance at the growing pile, just to check the size, but I knew that idea would not be helpful to my no-vomiting strategy. \"What is it that you enjoy?\" I wondered. It didn't make sense to me\u2014the years of struggle and self-denial he must have spent to get to the point where he could endure this so easily. Besides, I wanted to keep him talking; the conversation kept my mind off the queasy feeling in my stomach. His dark eyes were calm and thoughtful as he answered. \"Hmm. What I enjoy the very most is when my\u2026 enhanced abilities let me save someone who would otherwise have been lost. It's pleasant knowing that, thanks to what I can do, some people's lives are better because I exist. Even the sense of smell is a useful diagnostic tool at times.\" One side of his mouth pulled up in half a smile. I mulled that over while he poked around, making sure all the glass splinters were gone. Then he rummaged in his bag for new tools, and I tried not to picture a needle and thread. \"You try very hard to make up for something that was never your fault,\" I suggested while a new kind of tugging started at the edges of my skin. \"What I mean is, it's not like you asked for this. You didn't choose this kind of life, and yet you have to work so hard to be good.\" \"I don't know that I'm making up for anything,\" he disagreed lightly. \"Like everything in life, I just had to decide what to do with what I was given.\" \"That makes it sound too easy.\" He examined my arm again. \"There,\" he said, snipping a thread. \"All done.\" He wiped an oversized Q-tip, dripping with some syrup-colored liquid, thoroughly across the operation site. The smell was strange; it made my head spin. The syrup stained my skin. \"In the beginning, though,\" I pressed while he taped another long piece of gauze securely in place, sealing it to my skin. \"Why did you even think to try a different way than the obvious one?\" His lips turned up in a private smile. \"Hasn't Edward told you this story?\" \"Yes. But I'm trying to understand what you were thinking\u2026\" His face was suddenly serious again, and I wondered if his thoughts had gone to the same place that mine had. Wondering what I would be thinking when\u2014I refused to think if\u2014it was me. n\u1ebfu \"You know my father was a clergyman,\" he mused as he cleaned the table carefully, rubbing everything down with wet gauze, and then doing it again. The smell of alcohol burned in my nose. \"He had a rather harsh view of the world, which I was already beginning to question before the time that I changed.\" Carlisle put all the dirty gauze and the glass slivers into an empty crystal bowl. I didn't understand what he was doing, even when he lit the match. Then he threw it onto the alcohol-soaked fibers, and the sudden blaze made me jump. \"Sorry,\" he apologized. \"That ought to do it\u2026 So I didn't agree with my father's particular brand of faith. But never, in the nearly four hundred years now since I was born, have I ever seen anything to make me doubt whether God exists in some form or the other. Not even the reflection in the mirror.\" I pretended to examine the dressing on my arm to hide my surprise at the direction our conversation had taken. Religion was the last thing I expected, all things considered. My own life was fairly devoid of belief. Charlie considered himself a Lutheran, because that's what his parents had been, but Sundays he worshipped by the river with a fishing pole in his hand. Renee tried out a church now and then, but, much like her brief affairs with tennis, pottery, yoga, and French classes, she moved on by the time I was aware of her newest fad.  \"I'm sure all this sounds a little bizarre, coming from a vampire.\" He grinned, knowing how their casual use of that word never failed to shock me. \"But I'm hoping that there is still a point to this life, even for us.\u00a0 It's a long shot, I'll admit,\" he continued in an offhand voice. \"By all accounts, we're damned regardless. But I hope, maybe foolishly, that we'll get some measure of credit for trying.\" \"I don't think that's foolish,\" I mumbled. I couldn't imagine anyone, deity included, who wouldn't be impressed by Carlisle. Besides, the only kind of heaven I could appreciate would have to include Edward. \"And I don't think anyone else would, either.\" \"Actually, you're the very first one to agree with me.\" \"The rest of them don't feel the same?\" I asked, surprised, thinking of only one person in particular. Carlisle guessed the direction of my thoughts again. \"Edward's with me up to a point. God and heaven exist\u2026 and so does hell. But he doesn't believe there is an afterlife for our kind.\" Carlisle's voice was very soft; he stared out the big window over the sink, into the darkness. \"You see, he thinks we've lost our souls.\" I immediately thought of Edward's words this afternoon: unless you want to die\u2014or whatever it is that we do. The light bulb flicked on over my head. \"That's the real problem, isn't it?\" I guessed. \"That's why he's being so difficult about me.\" \u00a0Carlisle spoke slowly. \"I look at my\u2026 son. His strength, his goodness, the brightness that shines out of him\u2014and it only fuels that hope, that faith, more than ever. How could there not be more for one such as Edward?\" I nodded in fervent agreement. \"But if I believed as he does\u2026\" He looked down at me with unfathomable eyes. \"If you believed as he did. Could you take away his soul?\" The way he phrased the question thwarted my answer. If he'd asked me whether I would risk my soul for Edward, the reply would be obvious. But would I risk Edward's soul? I pursed my lips unhappily. That wasn't a fair exchange. \"You see the problem.\" I shook my head, aware of the stubborn set of my chin. Carlisle sighed. \"It's my choice,\" I insisted. \"It's his, too.\" He held up his hand when he could see that I was about to argue. \"Whether he is responsible for doing that to you.\" \"He's not the only one able to do it.\" I eyed Carlisle speculatively. He laughed, abruptly lightening the mood. \"Oh, no! You're going to have to work this out with him.\" But then he sighed. \"That's the one part I can never be sure of. I think, in most other ways, that I've done the best I could with what I had to work with. But was it right to doom the others to this life? I can't decide.\" I didn't answer. I imagined what my life would be like if Carlisle had resisted the temptation to change his lonely existence\u2026 and shuddered. \"It was Edward's mother who made up my mind.\" Carlisle's voice was almost a whisper. He stared unseeingly out the black windows. \"His mother?\" Whenever I'd asked Edward about his parents, he would merely say that they had died long ago, and his memories were vague. I realized Carlisle's memory of them, despite the brevity of their contact, would be perfectly clear. \"Yes. Her name was Elizabeth. Elizabeth Masen. His father, Edward Senior, never regained consciousness in the hospital. He died in the first wave of the influenza. But Elizabeth was alert until almost the very end. Edward looks a great deal like her\u2014she had that same strange bronze shade to her hair, and her eyes were exactly the same color green.\" \"His eyes were green?\" I murmured, trying to picture it. \"Yes\u2026\" Carlisle's ocher eyes were a hundred years away now. \"Elizabeth worried obsessively over her son. She hurt her own chances of survival trying to nurse him from her sickbed. I expected that he would go first, he was so much worse off than she was. When the end came for her, it was very quick. It was just after sunset, and I'd arrived to relieve the doctors who'd been working all day. That was a hard time to pretend\u2014there was so much work to be done, and I had no need of rest. How I hated to go back to my house, to hide in the dark and pretend to sleep while so many were dying. \"I went to check Elizabeth and her son first. I'd grown attached\u2014always a dangerous thing to do considering the fragile nature of humans. I could see at once that she'd taken a bad turn. The fever was raging out of control, and her body was too weak to fight anymore. She didn't look weak, though, when she glared up at me from her cot. \"Save him!' she commanded me in the hoarse voice that was all her throat could manage. \"I'll do everything in my power,' I promised her, taking her hand. The fever was so high, she probably couldn't even tell how unnaturally cold mine felt. Everything felt cold to her skin. \"You must,\" she insisted, clutching at my hand with enough strength that I wondered if she wouldn't pull through the crisis after all. Her eyes were hard, like stones, like emeralds. 'You must do everything in your power. What others cannot do, that is what you must do for my Edward.\" \"It frightened me. She looked it me with those piercing eyes, and, for one instant, I felt certain that she knew my secret. Then the fever overwhelmed her, and she never regained consciousness. She died within an hour of making her demand. \"I'd spent decades considering the idea of creating a companion for myself. Just one other creature who could really know me, rather than what I pretended to be. But I could never justify it to myself\u2014doing what had been done to me. \"There Edward lay, dying. It was clear that he had only hours left. Beside him, his mother, her face somehow not yet peaceful, not even in death.\" Carlisle saw it all again, his memory unburned by the intervening century. I could see it clearly, too, as he spoke\u2014the despair of the hospital, the overwhelming atmosphere of death. Edward burning with fever, his life slipping away with each tick of the clock\u2026 I shuddered again, and forced the picture from my mind. \"Elizabeth's words echoed in my head. How could she guess what I could do? Could anyone really want that for her son? \"I looked at Edward. Sick as he was, he was still beautiful. There was something pure and good about his face. The kind of face I would have wanted my son to have. \"After all those years of indecision, I simply acted on a whim. I wheeled his mother to the morgue first, and then I came back for him. No one noticed that he was still breathing. There weren't enough hands, enough eyes, to keep track of half of what the patients needed. The morgue was empty\u2014of the living, at least. I stole him out the back door, and carried him across the rooftops back to my home. \"I wasn't sure what had to be done. I settled for recreating the wounds I'd received myself, so many centuries earlier in London. I felt bad about that later. It was more painful and lingering than necessary. \"I wasn't sorry, though. I've never been sorry that I saved Edward.\" He shook his head, coming back to the present. He smiled at me. \"I suppose I should take you home now.\" \"I'll do that,\" Edward said. He came through the shadowy dining room, walking slowly for him. His face was smooth, unreadable, but there was something wrong with his eyes\u2014something he was trying very hard to hide. I felt a spasm of <em>unease</em> in my stomach. \"Carlisle can take me,\" I said. I looked down at my shirt; the light blue cotton was soaked and spotted with my blood. My right shoulder was covered in thick pink frosting. \"I'm fine.\" Edward's voice was unemotional. \"You'll need to change anyway. You'd give Charlie a heart attack the way you look. I'll have Alice get you something.\" He strode out the kitchen door again. I looked at Carlisle anxiously. \"He's very upset.\" \"Yes,\" Carlisle agreed. \"Tonight is exactly the kind of thing that he fears the most. You being put in danger, because of what we are.\" \"It's not his fault.\" \"It's not yours, either.\" I looked away from his wise, beautiful eyes. I couldn't agree with that. Carlisle offered me his hand and helped me up from the table. I followed him out into the main room. Esme had come back; she was mopping the floor where I'd fallen\u2014with straight bleach from the smell of it. \"Esme, let me do that.\" I could feel that my face was bright red again. \"I'm already done.\" She smiled up at me. \"How do you feel?\" \"I'm fine,\" I assured her. \"Carlisle sews faster than any other doctor I've had.\" They both chuckled. Alice and Edward came in the back doors. Alice hurried to my side, but Edward hung back, his face indecipherable. \"C'mon,\" Alice said. \"I'll get you something less macabre to wear.\" She found me a shirt of Esme's that was close to the same color mine had been. Charlie wouldn't notice, I was sure. The long white bandage on my arm didn't look nearly as serious when I was no longer spattered in gore. Charlie was never surprised to see me bandaged. \"Alice,\" I whispered as she headed back to the door. \"Yes?\" She kept her voice low, too, and looked at me curiously, her head cocked to the side. \"How bad is it?\" I couldn't be sure if my whispering was a wasted effort. Even though we were upstairs, with the door closed, perhaps he could hear me. Her face tensed. \"I'm not sure yet.\" \"How's Jasper?\" She sighed. \"He's very unhappy with himself. It's all so much more of challenge for him, and he hates feeling weak.\" \"It's not his fault. You'll tell him that I'm not mad at him, not at all, won't you?\" \"Of course.\" Edward was waiting for me by the front door. As I got to the bottom of the staircase, he held it open without a word. \"Take your things!\" Alice cried as I walked warily toward Edward. She scooped up the two packages, one half-opened, and my camera from under the piano, and pressed them into my good arm. \"You can thank me later, when you've opened them.\" Esme and Carlisle both said a quiet goodnight. I could see them stealing quick glances at their impassive son, much like I was. It was a relief to be outside; I hurried past the lanterns and the roses, now unwelcome reminders.  Edward kept pace with me silently. He opened the passenger side for me, and I climbed in without complaint. On the dashboard was a big red ribbon, stuck to the new stereo. I pulled it off, throwing it to the floor. As Edward slid into the other side, I kicked the ribbon under my seat. He didn't look at me or the stereo. Neither of us switched it on, and the silence was somehow intensified by the sudden thunder of the engine. He drove too fast down the dark, serpentine lane. The silence was making me insane. \"Say something,\" I finally begged as he turned onto the freeway. \"What do you want me to say?\" he asked in a detached voice. I cringed at his remoteness. 'Tell me you forgive me.\" That brought a flicker of life to his face\u2014a flicker of anger. \"Forgive you? For what?\" \"If I'd been more careful, nothing would have happened.\" \"Bella, you gave yourself a paper cut\u2014that hardly deserves the death penalty.\" \"It's still my fault.\" My words opened up the floodgate. \"Your fault? If you'd cut yourself at Mike Newton's house, with Jessica there and Angela and your other normal friends, the worst that could possibly have happened would be what? Maybe they couldn't find you a bandage? If you'd tripped and knocked over a pile of glass plates on your own\u2014without someone throwing you into them\u2014even then, what's the worst? You'd get blood on the seats when they drove you to the emergency room? Mike Newton could have held your hand while they stitched you up\u2014and he wouldn't be righting the urge to kill you the whole time he was there. Don't try to take any of this on yourself, Bella. It will only make me more disgusted with myself.\" \"How the hell did Mike Newton end up in this conversation?\" I demanded. \"Mike Newton ended up in this conversation because Mike Newton would be a hell of a lot healthier for you to be with,\" he growled. \"I'd rather die than be with Mike Newton,\" I protested. \"I'd rather die than be with anyone but you.\" \"Don't be melodramatic, please.\" \"Well then, don't you be ridiculous.\" He didn't answer. He glared through the windshield, his expression black. I racked my brain for some way to salvage the evening. When we pulled up in front of my house, I still hadn't come up with anything. He killed the engine, but his hands stayed clenched around the steering wheel. \"Will you stay tonight?\" I asked. \"I should go home.\" The last thing I wanted was for him to go wallow in remorse. \"For my birthday,\" I pressed. \"You can't have it both ways\u2014either you want people to ignore your birthday or you don't. One or the other.\" His voice was stern, but not as serious as before. I breathed a silent sigh of relief. \"Okay. I've decided that I don't want you to ignore my birthday. I'll see you upstairs.\" I hopped out, reaching back in for my packages. He frowned. \"You don't have to take those.\" \"I want them,\" I responded automatically, and then wondered if he was using reverse psychology. \"No, you don't. Carlisle and Esme spent money on you.\" \"I'll live.\" I tucked the presents awkwardly under my good arm and slammed the door behind me. He was out of the truck and by my side in less than a second. \"Let me carry them, at least.\" he said as he took them away. \"I'll be in your room.\" I smiled. \"Thanks.\" \"Happy birthday,\" he sighed, and leaned down to touch his lips to mine. I reached up on my toes to make the kiss last longer when he pulled away. He smiled my favorite crooked smile, and then he disappeared into the darkness. The game was still on; as soon as I walked through the front door I could hear the announcer rambling over the babble of the crowd. \"Bell?\" Charlie called. \"Hey, Dad,\" I said as I came around the corner. I held my arm close to my side. The slight pressure burned, and I wrinkled my nose. The anesthetic was apparently losing its effectiveness. \"How was it?\" Charlie lounged across the sofa with his bare feet propped up on the arm.  What was left of his curly brown hair was crushed flat on one side. \"Alice went overboard. Flowers, cake, candles, presents\u2014the whole bit.\" \"What did they get you?\" \"A stereo for my truck.\" And various unknowns. \"Wow.\" \"Yeah,\" I agreed. \"Well, I'm calling it a night.\" \"I'll see you in the morning.\" I waved. \"See ya.\" \"What happened to your arm?\" I flushed and cursed silently. \"I tripped. It's nothing.\" \"Bella,\" he sighed, shaking his head. \"Goodnight, Dad.\" I hurried up to the bathroom, where I kept my pajamas for just such nights as these. I shrugged into the matching tank top and cotton pants that I'd gotten to replace the holey sweats I used to wear to bed, wincing as the movement pulled at the stitches. I washed my face one-handed, brushed my teeth, and then skipped to my room. He was sitting in the center of my bed, toying idly with one of the silver boxes. \"Hi,\" he said. His voice was sad. He was wallowing. I went to the bed, pushed the presents out of his hands, and climbed into his lap. \"Hi.\" I snuggled into his stone chest. \"Can I open my presents now?\" \"Where did the enthusiasm come from?\" he wondered. \"You made me curious.\" I picked up the long flat rectangle that must have been from Carlisle and Esme. \"Allow me,\" he suggested. He took the gift from my hand and tore the silver paper off with one fluid movement. He handed the rectangular white box back to me. \"Are you sure I can handle lifting the lid?\" I muttered, but he ignored me. Inside the box was a long thick piece of paper with an overwhelming amount of fine print. It took me a minute to get the gist of the information. \"We're going to Jacksonville?\" And I was excited, in spite of myself. It was a voucher for plane tickets, for both me and Edward. \"That's the idea.\" \"I can't believe it. Renee is going to flip! You don't mind, though, do you? It's sunny, you'll have to stay inside all day.\" \"I think I can handle it,\" he said, and then frowned. \"If I'd had any idea that you could respond to a gift this appropriately, I would have made you open it in front of Carlisle and Esme. I thought you'd complain.\" \"Well, of course it's too much. But I get to take you with me!\" He chuckled. \"Now I wish I'd spent money on your present. I didn't realize that you were capable of being reasonable.\" I set the tickets aside and reached for his present, my curiosity rekindled. He took it from me and unwrapped it like the first one. He handed back a clear CD jewel case, with a blank silver CD inside. \"What is it?\" I asked, perplexed. He didn't say anything; he took the CD and reached around me to put it in the CD player on the bedside table. He hit play, and we waited in silence. Then the music began. I listened, speechless and wide-eyed. I knew he was waiting for my reaction, but I couldn't talk. Tears welled up, and I reached up to wipe them away before they could spill over. \"Does your arm hurt?\" he asked anxiously. \"No, it's not my arm. It's beautiful, Edward. You couldn't have given me anything I would love more. I can't believe it.\" I shut up, so I could listen. It was his music, his compositions. The first piece on the CD was my lullaby. \"I didn't think you would let me get a piano so I could play for you here,\" he explained. \"You're right.\" \"How does your arm feel?\" \"Just fine.\" Actually, it was starting to blaze under the bandage. I wanted ice. I would have settled for his hand, but that would have given me away. \"I'll get you some Tylenol.\" \"I don't need anything,\" I protested, but he slid me off his lap and headed for the door. \"Charlie,\" I hissed. Charlie wasn't exactly aware that Edward frequently stayed over. In fact, he would have a stroke if that fact were brought to his attention. But I didn't feel too guilty for deceiving him.\u00a0\u00a0  It wasn't as if we were up to anything he wouldn't want me to be up to. Edward and his rules\u2026 \"He won't catch me,\" Edward promised as he disappeared silently out the door . . and returned, catching the door before it had swung back to touch the frame. He had the glass from the bathroom and the bottle of pills in one hand. I took the pills he handed me without arguing\u2014I knew I would lose the argument And my arm really was starting to bother me. My lullaby continued, soft and lovely, in the background. \"It's late,\" Edward noted. He scooped me up off the bed with one arm, and pulled the cover back with the other. He put me down with my head on my pillow and tucked the quilt around me. He lay down next to me\u2014on top of the blanket so I wouldn't get chilled\u2014and put his arm over me. I leaned my head against his shoulder and sighed happily. \"Thanks again,\" I whispered. \"You're welcome.\" It was quiet for a long moment as I listened to my lullaby drift to a close. Another song began. I recognized Esme's favorite. \"What are you thinking about?'\" I wondered in a whisper. He hesitated for a second before he told me. \"I was thinking about right and wrong, actually.\" I felt a chill tingle along my spine. \"Remember how I decided that I wanted you to not ignore my birthday?\" I asked quickly, hoping it wasn't too clear that I was trying to distract him. \"Yes,\" he agreed, wary. \"Well, I was thinking, since it's still my birthday, that I'd like you to kiss me again.\" \"You're greedy tonight.\" \"Yes, I am\u2014but please, don't do anything you don't want to do,\" I added, piqued. He laughed, and then sighed. \"Heaven forbid that I should do anything I don't want to do,\" he said in a strangely desperate tone as he put his hand under my chin and pulled my face up to his. The kiss began much the same as usual\u2014Edward was as careful as ever, and my heart began to overreact like it always did. And then something seemed to change. Suddenly his lips became much more urgent, his free hand twisted into my hair and held my face securely to his. And, though my hands tangled in his hair, too, and though I was clearly beginning to cross his cautious lines, for once he didn't stop me. His body was cold through the thin quilt, but I crushed myself against him eagerly. When he stopped it was abrupt; he pushed me away with gentle, firm hands. I collapsed back onto my pillow, gasping, my head spinning. Something tugged at my memory, elusive, on the edges. \"Sorry,\" he said, and he was breathless, too. \"That was out of line.\" \"I don't mind,\" I panted. He frowned at me in the darkness. \"Try to sleep. Bella.\" \"No, I want you to kiss me again.\" \"You're overestimating my self-control.\" \"Which is tempting you more, my blood or my body?\" I challenged. \"It's a tie.\" He grinned briefly in spite of himself, and then was serious again. \"Now. why don't you stop pushing your luck and go to sleep?\" \"Fine,\" I agreed, snuggling closer to him. I really did feel exhausted. It had been a long day in so many ways, yet I felt no sense of relief at its end. Almost as if something worse was coming tomorrow. It was a silly premonition\u2014what could be worse than today?' Just the shock catching up with me, no doubt. Trying to be sneaky about it, I pressed my injured arm against his shoulder, so his cool skin would sooth the burning. It felt better at once. I was halfway asleep, maybe more, when I realized what his kiss had reminded me of: last spring, when he'd had to leave me to throw James off my trail, Edward had kissed me goodbye, not knowing when\u2014or if\u2014we would see each other again. This kiss had the same almost painful edge for some reason I couldn't imagine. I shuddered into unconsciousness, as if I were already having a nightmare.",

            "en": "It made me sad that he had to try so hard. I comforted myself with the knowledge that I wouldn\u2019t be causing him pain much longer.  I heard Charlie approaching then, stamping his feet on the way to express his customary displeasure with our guest. Edward\u2019s eyes snapped open and he let our hands fall, keeping them twined.     \u201cGood evening, Charlie.\u201d Edward was always flawlessly polite, though Charlie didn\u2019t deserve it. Charlie grunted at him, and then stood there with his arms crossed over his chest. He was taking the idea of parental supervision to extremes lately.  \u201cI brought another set of applications,\u201d Edward told me then, holding up a stuffed manila envelope. He was wearing a roll of stamps like a ring around his littlest finger.    I groaned. How were there any colleges left that he hadn\u2019t forced me to apply to already? And how did he keep finding these loophole openings? It was so late in the year.  He smiled as if he could read my thoughts; they must have been very obvious on my face. \u201cThere are still a few open deadlines. And a few places willing to make exceptions.\u201d    I could just imagine the motivations behind such exceptions. And the dollar amounts involved.  Edward laughed at my expression.  \u201cShall we?\u201d he asked, towing me toward the kitchen table.  Charlie huffed and followed behind, though he could hardly complain about the activity on tonight\u2019s agenda. He\u2019d been pestering me to make a decision about college on a daily basis.    I cleared the table quickly while Edward organized an intimidating stack of forms. When I moved Wuthering Heights to the counter, Edward raised one eyebrow. I knew what he was thinking, but Charlie interrupted before Edward could comment.  \u201cSpeaking of college applications, Edward,\u201d Charlie said, his tone even more sullen \u2014 he tried to avoid addressing Edward directly, and when he had to, it exacerbated his bad mood. \u201cBella and I were just talking about next year. Have you decided where you\u2019re going to school?\u201d      Edward smiled up at Charlie and his voice was friendly. \u201cNot yet. I\u2019ve received a few acceptance letters, but I\u2019m still weighing my options.\u201d  \u201cWhere have you been accepted?\u201d Charlie pressed.  \u201cSyracuse . . . Harvard . . . Dartmouth . . . and I just got accepted to the University of Alaska Southeast today.\u201d Edward turned his face slightly to the side so that he could wink at me. I stifled a giggle.    \u201cHarvard? Dartmouth?\u201d Charlie mumbled, unable to conceal his awe. \u201cWell that\u2019s pretty . . . that\u2019s something. Yeah, but the University of Alaska . . . you wouldn\u2019t really consider that when you could go Ivy League. I mean, your father would want you to . . .\u201d  \u201cCarlisle\u2019s always fine with whatever I choose to do,\u201d Edward told him serenely.  \u201cHmph.\u201d     \u201cGuess what, Edward?\u201d I asked in a bright voice, playing along.  \u201cWhat, Bella?\u201d  I pointed to the thick envelope on the counter. \u201cI just got my acceptance to the University of Alaska!\u201d  \u201cCongratulations!\u201d He grinned. \u201cWhat a coincidence.\u201d  Charlie\u2019s eyes narrowed and he glared back and forth between the two of us. \u201cFine,\u201d he muttered after a minute. \u201cI\u2019m going to go watch the game, Bella. Nine-thirty.\u201d  That was his usual parting command.     \u201cEr, Dad? Remember the very recent discussion about my freedom . . . ?\u201d  He sighed. \u201cRight. Okay, ten -thirty. You still have a curfew on school nights.\u201d  \u201cBella\u2019s no longer grounded?\u201d Edward asked. Though I knew he wasn\u2019t really surprised, I couldn\u2019t detect any false note to the sudden excitement in his voice.  \u201cConditionally,\u201d Charlie corrected through his teeth. \u201cWhat\u2019s it to you?\u201d  I frowned at my dad, but he didn\u2019t see.  \u201cIt\u2019s just good to know,\u201d Edward said. \u201cAlice has been itching for a shopping partner, and I\u2019m sure Bella would love to see some city lights.\u201d He smiled at me.  But Charlie growled, \u201cNo!\u201d and his face flushed purple.      \u201cDad! What\u2019s the problem?\u201d  He made an effort to unclench his teeth. \u201cI don\u2019t want you going to Seattle right now.\u201d  \u201cHuh?\u201d  \u201cI told you about that story in the paper \u2014 there\u2019s some kind of gang on a killing spree in Seattle and I want you to steer clear, okay?\u201d    I rolled my eyes. \u201cDad, there\u2019s a better chance that I\u2019ll get struck by lightning than that the one day I\u2019m in Seattle \u2014\u201d  \u201cNo, that\u2019s fine, Charlie,\u201d Edward said, interrupting me. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean Seattle. I was thinking Portland, actually. I wouldn\u2019t have Bella in Seattle, either. Of course not.\u201d  I looked at him in disbelief, but he had Charlie\u2019s newspaper in his hands and he was reading the front page intently     He must have been trying to appease my father. The idea of being in danger from even the most deadly of humans while I was with Alice or Edward was downright hilarious.  It worked. Charlie stared at Edward for one second more, and then shrugged. \u201cFine.\u201d He stalked off toward the living room, in a bit of a hurry now \u2014 maybe he didn\u2019t want to miss tip-off.  I waited till the TV was on, so that Charlie wouldn\u2019t be able to hear me.  \u201cWhat \u2014,\u201d I started to ask.  \u201cHold on,\u201d Edward said without looking up from the paper. His eyes stayed focused on the page as he pushed the first application toward me across the table. \u201cI think you can recycle your essays for this one. Same questions.\u201d     Charlie must still be listening. I sighed and started to fill out the repetitive information: name, address, social. . . . After a few minutes I glanced up, but Edward was now staring pensively out the window. As I bent my head back to my work, I noticed for the first time the name of the school.  I snorted and shoved the papers aside.      \u201cBella?\u201d  \u201cBe serious, Edward. Dartmouth ?\u201d  Edward lifted the discarded application and laid it gently in front of me again. \u201cI think you\u2019d like New Hampshire,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a full complement of night courses for me, and the forests are very conveniently located for the avid hiker. Plentiful wildlife.\u201d He pulled out the crooked smile he knew I couldn\u2019t resist.     I took a deep breath through my nose.  \u201cI\u2019ll let you pay me back, if that makes you happy,\u201d he promised. \u201cIf you want, I can charge you interest.\u201d  \u201cLike I could even get in without some enormous bribe. Or was that part of the loan? The new Cullen wing of the library? Ugh. Why are we having this discussion again?\u201d     \u201cWill you just fill out the application, please, Bella? It won\u2019t hurt you to apply.\u201d  My jaw flexed. \u201cYou know what? I don\u2019t think I will.\u201d  I reached for the papers, planning to crumple them into a suitable shape for lobbing at the trashcan, but they were already gone. I stared at the empty table for a moment, and then at Edward. He didn\u2019t appear to have moved, but the application was probably already tucked away in his jacket.      \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I demanded.  \u201cI sign your name better than you do yourself. You\u2019ve already written the essays.\u201d  \u201cYou\u2019re going way overboard with this, you know.\u201d I whispered on the off chance that Charlie wasn\u2019t completely lost in his game. \u201cI really don\u2019t need to apply anywhere else. I\u2019ve been accepted in Alaska. I can almost afford the first semester\u2019s tuition. It\u2019s as good an alibi as any. There\u2019s no need to throw away a bunch of money, no matter whose it is.\u201d  A pained looked tightened his face. \u201cBella \u2014\u201d  \u201cDon\u2019t start. I agree that I need to go through the motions for Charlie\u2019s sake, but we both know I\u2019m not going to be in any condition to go to school next fall. To be anywhere near people.\u201d     My knowledge of those first few years as a new vampire was sketchy. Edward had never gone into details \u2014 it wasn\u2019t his favorite subject \u2014 but I knew it wasn\u2019t pretty. Self-control was apparently an acquired skill. Anything more than correspondence school was out of the question.  \u201cI thought the timing was still undecided,\u201d Edward reminded me softly. \u201cYou might enjoy a semester or two of college. There are a lot of human experiences you\u2019ve never had.\u201d  \u201cI\u2019ll get to those afterward.\u201d  \u201cThey won\u2019t be human experiences afterward. You don\u2019t get a second chance at humanity, Bella.\u201d  I sighed. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be reasonable about the timing, Edward. It\u2019s just too dangerous to mess around with.\u201d     \u201cThere\u2019s no danger yet,\u201d he insisted.  I glared at him. No danger? Sure. I only had a sadistic vampire trying to avenge her mate\u2019s death with my own, preferably through some slow and torturous method. Who was worried about Victoria? And, oh yeah, the Volturi \u2014 the vampire royal family with their small army of vampire warriors \u2014 who insisted that my heart stop beating one way or another in the near future, because humans weren\u2019t allowed to know they existed. Right. No reason at all to panic.  Even with Alice keeping watch \u2014 Edward was relying on her uncannily accurate visions of the future to give us advance warning \u2014 it was insane to take chances.    Besides, I\u2019d already won this argument. The date for my transformation was tentatively set for shortly after my graduation from high school, only a handful of weeks away.  A sharp jolt of <em>unease</em> pierced my stomach as I realized how short the time really was. Of course this change was necessary \u2014 and the key to what I wanted more than everything else in the world put together \u2014 but I was deeply conscious of Charlie sitting in the other room enjoying his game, just like every other night. And my mother, Ren\u00e9e, far away in sunny Florida, still pleading with me to spend the summer on the beach with her and her new husband. And Jacob, who, unlike my parents, would know exactly what was going on when I disappeared to some distant school. Even if my parents didn\u2019t grow suspicious for a long time, even if I could put off visits with excuses about travel expenses or study loads or illnesses, Jacob would know the truth.    For a moment, the idea of Jacob\u2019s certain revulsion overshadowed every other pain.  \u201cBella,\u201d Edward murmured, his face twisting when he read the distress in mine. \u201cThere\u2019s no hurry. I won\u2019t let anyone hurt you. You can take all the time you need.\u201d  \u201cI want to hurry,\u201d I whispered, smiling weakly, trying to make a joke of it. \u201cI want to be a monster, too.\u201d     His teeth clenched; he spoke through them. \u201cYou have no idea what you\u2019re saying.\u201d Abruptly, he flung the damp newspaper onto the table in between us. His finger stabbed the headline on the front page:  DEATH TOLL ON THE RISE, POLICE FEAR GANG ACTIVITY  \u201cWhat does that have to do with anything?\u201d  \u201cMonsters are not a joke, Bella.\u201d  I stared at the headline again, and then up to his hard expression. \u201cA . . . avampire is doing this?\u201d I whispered.     He smiled without humor. His voice was low and cold. \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised, Bella, at how often my kind are the source behind the horrors in your human news. It\u2019s easy to recognize, when you know what to look for. The information here indicates a newborn vampire is loose in Seattle. Bloodthirsty, wild, out of control. The way we all were.\u201d  I let my gaze drop to the paper again, avoiding his eyes.     \u201cWe\u2019ve been monitoring the situation for a few weeks. All the signs are there \u2014 the unlikely disappearances, always in the night, the poorly disposed-of corpses, the lack of other evidence. . . . Yes, someone brand-new. And no one seems to be taking responsibility for the neophyte. . . .\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not our problem. We wouldn\u2019t even pay attention to the situation if wasn\u2019t going on so close to home. Like I said, this happens all the time. The existence of monsters results in monstrous consequences.\u201d      I tried not to see the names on the page, but they jumped out from the rest of the print like they were in bold. The five people whose lives were over, whose families were mourning now. It was different from considering murder in the abstract, reading those names. Maureen Gardiner, Geoffrey Campbell, Grace Razi, Michelle O\u2019Connell, Ronald Albrook. People who\u2019d had parents and children and friends and pets and jobs and hopes and plans and memories and futures. . . .  \u201cIt won\u2019t be the same for me,\u201d I whispered, half to myself. \u201cYou won\u2019t let me be like that. We\u2019ll live in Antarctica.\u201d     Edward snorted, breaking the tension. \u201cPenguins. Lovely.\u201d  I laughed a shaky laugh and knocked the paper off the table so I wouldn\u2019t have to see those names; it hit the linoleum with a thud. Of course Edward would consider the hunting possibilities. He and his \u201cvegetarian\u201d family \u2014 all committed to protecting human life \u2014 preferred the flavor of large predators for satisfying their dietary needs. \u201cAlaska, then, as planned. Only somewhere much more remote than Juneau \u2014 somewhere with grizzlies galore.\u201d  \u201cBetter,\u201d he allowed. \u201cThere are polar bears, too. Very fierce. And the wolves get quite large.\u201d      My mouth fell open and my breath blew out in a sharp gust.  \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked. Before I could recover, the confusion vanished and his whole body seemed to harden. \u201cOh. Never mind the wolves, then, if the idea is offensive to you.\u201d His voice was stiff, formal, his shoulders rigid.  \u201cHe was my best friend, Edward,\u201d I muttered. It stung to use the past tense. \u201cOf course the idea offends me.\u201d  \u201cPlease forgive my thoughtlessness,\u201d he said, still very formal. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have suggested that.\u201d  \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d I stared at my hands, clenched into a double fist on the table.  We were both silent for a moment, and then his cool finger was under my chin, coaxing my face up. His expression was much softer now.       \u201cSorry. Really.\u201d  \u201cI know. I know it\u2019s not the same thing. I shouldn\u2019t have reacted that way. It\u2019s just that . . . well, I was already thinking about Jacob before you came over.\u201d I hesitated. His tawny eyes seemed to get a little bit darker whenever I said Jacob\u2019s name. My voice turned pleading in response. \u201cCharlie says Jake is having a hard time. He\u2019s hurting right now, and . . . it\u2019s my fault.\u201d  \u201cYou\u2019ve done nothing wrong, Bella.\u201d  I took a deep breath. \u201cI need to make it better, Edward. I owe him that. And it\u2019s one of Charlie\u2019s conditions, anyway \u2014\u201d     His face changed while I spoke, turning hard again, statue-like.  \u201cYou know it\u2019s out of the question for you to be around a werewolf unprotected, Bella. And it would break the treaty if any of us cross over onto their land. Do you want us to start a war?\u201d  \u201cOf course not!\u201d  \u201cThen there\u2019s really no point in discussing the matter further.\u201d He dropped his hand and looked away, searching for a subject change. His eyes paused on something behind me, and he smiled, though his eyes stayed wary.  \u201cI\u2019m glad Charlie has decided to let you out \u2014 you\u2019re sadly in need of a visit to the bookstore. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re reading Wuthering Heights again. Don\u2019t you know it by heart yet?\u201d     \u201cNot all of us have photographic memories,\u201d I said curtly.  \u201cPhotographic memory or not, I don\u2019t understand why you like it. The characters are ghastly people who ruin each others\u2019 lives. I don\u2019t know how Heathcliff and Cathy ended up being ranked with couples like Romeo and Juliet or Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy. It isn\u2019t a love story, it\u2019s a hate story.\u201d     \u201cYou have some serious issues with the classics,\u201d I snapped.  \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s because I\u2019m not impressed by antiquity.\u201d He smiled, evidently satisfied that he\u2019d distracted me. \u201cHonestly, though, why do you read it over and over?\u201d His eyes were vivid with real interest now, trying \u2014 again \u2014 to unravel the convoluted workings of my mind. He reached across the table to cradle my face in his hand. \u201cWhat is it that appeals to you?\u201d    His sincere curiosity disarmed me. \u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d I said, scrambling for coherency while his gaze unintentionally scattered my thoughts. \u201cI think it\u2019s something about the inevitability. How nothing can keep them apart \u2014 not her selfishness, or his evil, or even death, in the end. . . .\u201d  His face was thoughtful as he considered my words. After a moment he smiled a teasing smile. \u201cI still think it would be a better story if either of them had one redeeming quality.\u201d     \u201cI think that may be the point,\u201d I disagreed. \u201cTheir love is their only redeeming quality.\u201d  \u201cI hope you have better sense than that \u2014 to fall in love with someone so . . . malignant.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s a bit late for me to worry about who I fall in love with,\u201d I pointed out. \u201cBut even without the warning, I seem to have managed fairly well.\u201d      He laughed quietly. \u201cI\u2019m glad you think so.\u201d  \u201cWell, I hope you\u2019re smart enough to stay away from someone so selfish. Catherine is really the source of all the trouble, not Heathcliff.\u201d  \u201cI\u2019ll be on my guard,\u201d he promised.  I sighed. He was so good at distractions.  I put my hand over his to hold it to my face. \u201cI need to see Jacob.\u201d  His eyes closed. \u201cNo.\u201d      \u201cIt\u2019s truly not dangerous at all,\u201d I said, pleading again. \u201cI used to spend all day in La Push with the whole lot of them, and nothing ever happened.\u201d  But I made a slip; my voice faltered at the end because I realized as I was saying the words that they were a lie. It was not true that nothing had ever happened. A brief flash of memory \u2014 an enormous gray wolf crouched to spring, baring his dagger-like teeth at me \u2014 had my palms sweating with an echo of remembered panic.  Edward heard my heart accelerate and nodded as if I\u2019d acknowledged the lie aloud. \u201cWerewolves are unstable. Sometimes, the people near them get hurt. Sometimes, they get killed.\u201d     I wanted to deny it, but another image slowed my rebuttal. I saw in my head the once beautiful face of Emily Young, now marred by a trio of dark scars that dragged down the corner of her right eye and left her mouth warped forever into a lopsided scowl.  He waited, grimly triumphant, for me to find my voice.  \u201cYou don\u2019t know them,\u201d I whispered.  \u201cI know them better than you think, Bella. I was here the last time.\u201d  \u201cThe last time?\u201d     \u201cWe started crossing paths with the wolves about seventy years ago. . . . We had just settled near Hoquiam. That was before Alice and Jasper were with us. We outnumbered them, but that wouldn\u2019t have stopped it from turning into a fight if not for Carlisle. He managed to convince Ephraim Black that coexisting was possible, and eventually we made the truce.\u201d  Jacob\u2019s great-grandfather\u2019s name startled me.    \u201cWe thought the line had died out with Ephraim,\u201d Edward muttered; it sounded like he was talking to himself now. \u201cThat the genetic quirk which allowed the transmutation had been lost. . . .\u201d He broke off and stared at me accusingly. \u201cYour bad luck seems to get more potent every day. Do you realize that your insatiable pull for all things deadly was strong enough to recover a pack of mutant canines from extinction? If we could bottle your luck, we\u2019d have a weapon of mass destruction on our hands.\u201d  I ignored the ribbing, my attention caught by his assumption \u2014 was he serious? \u201cBut I didn\u2019t bring them back. Don\u2019t you know?\u201d     \u201cKnow what?\u201d  \u201cMy bad luck had nothing to do with it. The werewolves came back because the vampires did.\u201d  Edward stared at me, his body motionless with surprise.  \u201cJacob told me that your family being here set things in motion. I thought you would already know. . . .\u201d  His eyes narrowed. \u201cIs that what they think?\u201d  \u201cEdward, look at the facts. Seventy years ago, you came here, and the werewolves showed up. You come back now, and the werewolves show up again. Do you think that\u2019s a coincidence?\u201d     He blinked and his glare relaxed. \u201cCarlisle will be interested in that theory.\u201d  \u201cTheory,\u201d I scoffed.  He was silent for a moment, staring out the window into the rain; I imagined he was contemplating the fact that his family\u2019s presence was turning the locals into giant dogs.  \u201cInteresting, but not exactly relevant,\u201d he murmured after a moment. \u201cThe situation remains the same.\u201d  I could translate that easily enough: no werewolf friends.  I knew I must be patient with Edward. It wasn\u2019t that he was unreasonable, it was just that he didn\u2019t understand. He had no idea how very much I owed Jacob Black \u2014 my life many times over, and possibly my sanity, too.     I didn\u2019t like to talk about that barren time with anyone, and especially not Edward. He had only been trying to save me when he\u2019d left, trying to save my soul. I didn\u2019t hold him responsible for all the stupid things I\u2019d done in his absence, or the pain I had suffered.  He did.  So I would have to word my explanation very carefully.  I got up and walked around the table. He opened his arms for me and I sat on his lap, nestling into his cool stone embrace. I looked at his hands while I spoke.    \u201cPlease just listen for a minute. This is so much more important than some whim to drop in on an old friend. Jacob is in pain.\u201d My voice distorted around the word. \u201cI can\u2019t not try to help him \u2014 I can\u2019t give up on him now, when he needs me. Just because he\u2019s not human all the time. . . . Well, he was there for me when I was . . . not so human myself. You don\u2019t know what it was like. . . .\u201d I hesitated. Edward\u2019s arms were rigid around me; his hands were in fists now, the tendons standing out. \u201cIf Jacob hadn\u2019t helped me . . . I\u2019m not sure what you would have come home to. I owe him better than this, Edward.\u201d     I looked up at his face warily. His eyes were closed, and his jaw was strained.  \u201cI\u2019ll never forgive myself for leaving you,\u201d he whispered. \u201cNot if I live a hundred thousand years.\u201d  I put my hand against his cold face and waited until he sighed and opened his eyes.  \u201cYou were just trying to do the right thing. And I\u2019m sure it would have worked with anyone less mental than me. Besides, you\u2019re here now. That\u2019s the part that matters.\u201d  \u201cIf I\u2019d never left, you wouldn\u2019t feel the need to go risk your life to comfort a dog .\u201d  I flinched. I was used to Jacob and all his derogatory slurs \u2014bloodsucker, leech, parasite . . . .    Somehow it sounded harsher in Edward\u2019s velvet voice.  \u201cI don\u2019t know how to phrase this properly,\u201d Edward said, and his tone was bleak. \u201cIt\u2019s going to sound cruel, I suppose. But I\u2019ve come too close to losing you in the past. I know what it feels like to think I have. I am not going to tolerate anything dangerous.\u201d  \u201cYou have to trust me on this. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d  His face was pained again. \u201cPlease, Bella,\u201d he whispered.  I stared into his suddenly burning golden eyes. \u201cPlease what?\u201d  \u201cPlease, for me. Please make a conscious effort to keep yourself safe. I\u2019ll do everything I can, but I would appreciate a little help.\u201d      \u201cI\u2019ll work on it,\u201d I murmured.  \u201cDo you really have any idea how important you are to me? Any concept at all of how much I love you?\u201d He pulled me tighter against his hard chest, tucking my head under his chin.  I pressed my lips against his snow-cold neck. \u201cI know how much I love you ,\u201d I answered.  \u201cYou compare one small tree to the entire forest.\u201d  I rolled my eyes, but he couldn\u2019t see. \u201cImpossible.\u201d  He kissed the top of my head and sighed.  \u201cNo werewolves.\u201d  \u201cI\u2019m not going along with that. I have to see Jacob.\u201d  \u201cThen I\u2019ll have to stop you.\u201d    He sounded utterly confident that this wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  I was sure he was right.  \u201cWe\u2019ll see about that,\u201d I bluffed anyway. \u201cHe\u2019s still my friend.\u201d  I could feel Jacob\u2019s note in my pocket, like it suddenly weighed ten pounds. I could hear the words in his voice, and he seemed to be agreeing with Edward \u2014 something that would never happen in reality.  Doesn\u2019t change anything. Sorry.",

            "en": "10         10. THE MEADOW JACOB DIDN'T CALL. The first time I called, Billy answered and told me that Jacob was still in bed. I got nosy, checking to make sure that Billy had taken him to a doctor. Billy said he had, but, for some reason I couldn't nail down, I didn't really believe him. I called again, several times a day, for the next two days, but no one was ever there. Saturday, I decided to go see him, invitation be damned. But the little red house was empty. This frightened me\u2014was Jacob so sick that he'd needed to go to the hospital? I stopped by the hospital on the way back home, but the nurse at the front desk told me neither Jacob or Billy had been in. I made Charlie call Harry Clearwater as soon as he got home from work. I waited, anxious, while Charlie chatted with his old friend; the conversation seemed to go on forever without Jacob even being mentioned. It seemed that Harry had been in the hospital . . some kind of tests for his heart. Charlie's forehead got all pinched together, but Harry joked with him, blowing it off, until Charlie was laughing again. Only then did Charlie ask about Jacob, and now his side of the conversation didn't give me much to work with, just a lot of hmms and yeahs. I drummed my fingers against the counter beside him until he put a hand over mine to stop me. Finally, Charlie hung up the phone and turned to me. \"Harry says there's been some trouble with the phone lines, and that's why you haven't been able to get through. Billy took Jake to the doc down there, and it looks like he has mono. He's real tired, and Billy said no visitors,\" he reported. \"No visitors?\" I demanded in disbelief. Charlie raised one eyebrow. \"Now don't you go making a pest of yourself, Bells. Billy knows what's best for Jake. He'll be up and around soon enough. Be patient.\" I didn't push it. Charlie was too worried about Harry. That was clearly the more important issue\u2014it wouldn't be right to bug him with my lesser concerns. Instead, I went straight upstairs and turned on my computer. I found a medical site online and typed \"mononucleosis\" into the search box. All I knew about mono was that you were supposed to get it from kissing, which was clearly not the case with Jake. I read through the symptoms quickly\u2014the fever he definitely had, but what about the rest of it? No horrible sore throat, no exhaustion, no headaches, at least not before he'd gone home from the movie; he'd said he felt \"fit as a fiddle.\" Did it really come on so fast? The article made it sound like the sore stuff showed up first.  I glared at the computer screen and wondered why, exactly, I was doing this. Why did I feel so\u2026 so suspicious, like I didn't believe Billy's story? Why would Billy lie to Harry? I was being silly, probably. I was just worried, and, to be honest, I was afraid of not being allowed to see Jacob\u2014that made me nervous. I skimmed through the rest of the article, looking for more information. I stopped when I got to the part about how mono could last more than a month. A month? My mouth fell open. But Billy couldn't enforce the no-visitors thing that long. Of course not. Jake would go crazy stuck in bed that long without anyone to talk to. What was Billy afraid of, anyway? The article said that a person with mono needed to avoid physical activity, but there was nothing about visitors. The disease wasn't very infectious. I'd give Billy a week, I decided, before I got pushy. A week was generous. A week was long. By Wednesday, I was sure I wasn't going to live till Saturday. When I'd decided to leave Billy and Jacob alone for a week, I hadn't really believed that Jacob would go along with Billy's rule. Every day when I got home from school, I ran to the phone to check for messages. There never were any. I cheated three times by trying to call him, but the phone lines still weren't working. I was in the house much too much, and much too alone. Without Jacob, and my\u00a0 adrenaline and my distractions, everything I'd been repressing started creeping up on me. The dreams got hard again. I could no longer see the end coming. Just the horrible nothingness\u2014half the time in the forest, half the time in the empty fern sea where the white house no longer existed. Sometimes Sam Uley was there in the forest, watching me again. I paid him no attention\u2014there was no comfort in his presence; it made me feel no less alone. It didn't stop me from screaming myself awake, night after night. The hole in my chest was worse than ever. I'd thought that I'd been getting it under control, but I found myself hunched over, day after day, clutching my sides together and gasping for air. I wasn't handling alone well. I was relieved beyond measure the morning I woke up\u2014screaming, of course\u2014and remembered that it was Saturday. Today I could call Jacob. And if the phone lines still weren't working, then I was going to La Push. One way or another, today would be better than the last lonely week. I dialed, and then waited without high expectations. It caught me off guard when Billy answered on the second ring. \"Hello?\" \"Oh, hey, the phone is working again! Hi, Billy. It's Bella. I was just calling to see how Jacob is doing. Is he up for visitors yet? I was thinking about dropping by\u2014\" \"I'm sorry, Bella,\" Billy interrupted, and I wondered if he were watching TV; he sounded distracted.  \"He's not in.\" \"Oh.\" It took me a second. \"So he's feeling better then?\" \"Yeah,\" Billy hesitated for an instant too long. \"Turns out it wasn't mono after all. Just some other virus.\" \"Oh. So\u2026 where is he?\" \"He's giving some friends a ride up to Port Angeles\u2014I think they were going to catch a double feature or something. He's gone for the whole day.\" \"Well, that's a relief. I've been so worried. I'm glad he felt good enough to get out.\" My voice sounded horribly phony as I babbled on. Jacob was better, but not well enough to call me. He was out with friends. I was sitting home, missing him more every hour. I was lonely, worried, bored\u2026 perforated\u2014and now also desolate as I realized that the week apart had not had the same effect on him. \"Is there anything in particular you wanted?\" Billy asked politely. \"No, not really.\" \"Well, I'll tell him that you called,\" Billy promised. \"Bye, Bella.\" \"Bye,\" I replied, but he'd already hung up. I stood for a moment with the phone still in my hand. Jacob must have changed his mind, just like I'd feared. He was going to take my advice and not waste any more time on someone who couldn't return his feelings. I felt the blood run out of my face. \"Something wrong?\" Charlie asked as he came down the stairs. \"No,\" I lied, hanging up the phone. \"Billy says Jacob is feeling better. It wasn't mono. So that's good.\" \"Is he coming here, or are you going there?\" Charlie asked absentmindedly as he started poking through the fridge. \"Neither,\" I admitted. \"He's going out with some other friends.\" The tone of my voice finally caught Charlie's attention. He looked up at me with sudden alarm, his hands frozen around a package of cheese slices. \"Isn't it a little early for lunch?\" I asked as lightly as I could manage, trying to distract him. \"No, I'm just packing something to take out to the river\u2026\" \"Oh, fishing today?\" \"Well, Harry called\u2026 and it's not raining.\" He was creating a stack of food on the counter as he spoke. Suddenly he looked up again as if he'd just realized something. \"Say, did you want me to stay with you, since Jake's out?\" \"That's okay, Dad,\" I said, working to sound indifferent. \"The fish bite better when the weather's nice.\" He stared at me, indecision clear on his face. I knew that he was worrying, afraid to leave me alone, in case I got \"mopey\" again. \"Seriously, Dad. I think I'll call Jessica,\" I fibbed quickly. I'd rather be alone than have him watching me all day. \"We have a Calculus test to study for. I could use her help.\" That part was true. But I'd have to make do without it. \"That's a good idea. You've been spending so much time with Jacob, your other friends are going to think you've forgotten them.\" I smiled and nodded as if I cared what my other friends thought. Charlie started to turn, but then spun back with a worried expression. \"Hey, you'll study here or at Jess's, right?\" \"Sure, where else?\" \"Well, it's just that I want you to be careful to stay out of the woods, like I told you before.\" It took me a minute to understand, distracted as I was. \"More bear trouble?\" Charlie nodded, frowning. \"We've got a missing hiker\u2014the rangers found his camp early this morning, but no sign of him. There were some really big animal prints\u2026 of course those could have come later, smelling the food\u2026 Anyway, they're setting traps for it now.\" \"Oh,\" I said vaguely. I wasn't really listening to his warnings; I was much more upset by the situation with Jacob than by the possibility of being eaten by a bear. I was glad that Charlie was in a hurry. He didn't wait for me to call Jessica, so I didn't have to put on that charade. I went through the motions of gathering my school-books on the kitchen table to pack them in my bag; that was probably too much, and if he hadn't been eager to hit the holes, it might have made him suspicious. I was so busy looking busy that the ferociously empty day ahead didn't really crash down on me until after I'd watched him drive away. It only took about two minutes of staring at the silent kitchen phone to decide that I wasn't staying home today. I considered my options. I wasn't going to call Jessica. As far as I could tell, Jessica had crossed over to the dark side. I could drive to La Push and get my motorcycle\u2014an appealing thought but for one minor problem: who was going to drive me to the emergency room if I needed it afterward? Or\u2026 I already had our map and compass in the truck. I was pretty sure I understood the process well enough by now that I wouldn't get lost. Maybe I could eliminate two lines today, putting us ahead of schedule for whenever Jacob decided to honor me with his presence again. I refused to think about how long that might be. Or if it was going to be never. I felt a brief twinge of guilt as I realized how Charlie would feel about this, but I ignored it. I just couldn't stay in the house again today. A few minutes later I was on the familiar dirt road that led to nowhere in particular. I had the windows rolled down and I drove as fast as was healthy for my truck, trying to enjoy the wind against my face. It was cloudy, but almost dry\u2014a very nice day, for Forks. Getting started took me longer than it would have taken Jacob. After I parked in the usual spot, I had to spend a good fifteen minutes studying the little needle on the compass face and the markings on the now worn map. When I was reasonably certain that I was following the right line of the web, I set off into the woods. The forest was full of life today, all the little creatures enjoying the momentary dryness. Somehow, though, even with the birds chirping and cawing, the insects buzzing noisily around my head, and the occasional scurry of the field mice through the shrubs, the forest seemed creepier today; it reminded me of my most recent nightmare. I knew it was just because I was alone, missing Jacob's carefree whistle and the sound of another pair of feet squishing across the damp ground. The sense of <em>unease</em> grew stronger the deeper I got into the trees. Breathing started to get more difficult\u2014not because of exertion, but because I was having trouble with the stupid hole in my chest again. I kept my arms tight around my torso and tried to banish the ache from my thoughts. I almost turned around, but I hated to waste the effort I'd already expended. The rhythm of my footsteps started to numb my mind and my pain as I trudged on. My breathing evened out eventually, and I was glad I hadn't quit. I was getting better at this bushwhacking thing; I could tell I was faster. I didn't realize quite how much more efficiently I was moving. I thought I'd covered maybe four miles, and I wasn't even starting to look around for it yet. And then, with an abruptness that disoriented me, I stepped through a low arch made by two vine maples\u2014pushing past the chest-high ferns\u2014into the meadow. It was the same place, of that I was instantly sure. I'd never seen another clearing so symmetrical. It was as perfectly round as if someone had intentionally created the flawless circle, tearing out the trees but leaving no evidence of that violence in the waving grass. To the east, I could hear the stream bubbling quietly. The place wasn't nearly so stunning without the sunlight, but it was still very beautiful and serene. It was the wrong season for wildflowers; the ground was thick with tall grass that swayed in the light breeze like ripples across a lake. It was the same place\u2026 but it didn't hold what I had been searching for. The disappointment was nearly as instantaneous as the recognition. I sank down right where I was, kneeling there at the edge of the clearing, beginning to gasp. What was the point of going any farther? Nothing lingered here. Nothing more than the memories that I could have called back whenever I wanted to, if I was ever willing to endure the corresponding pain\u2014the pain that had me now, had me cold. There was nothing special about this place without him. I wasn't exactly sure what I'd hoped to feel here, but the meadow was empty of atmosphere, empty of everything, just like everywhere else. Just like my nightmares. My head swirled dizzily. At least I'd come alone. I felt a rush of thankfulness as I realized that. If I'd discovered the meadow with Jacob\u2026 well, there was no way I could have disguised the abyss I was plunging into now. How could I have explained the way I was fracturing into pieces, the way I had to curl into a ball to keep the empty hole from tearing me apart? It was so much better that I didn't have an audience. And I wouldn't have to explain to anyone why I was in such a hurry to leave, either. Jacob would have assumed, after going to so much trouble to locate the stupid place, I would want to spend more than a few seconds here. But I was already trying to find the strength to get to my feet again, forcing myself out of the ball so that I could escape. There was too much pain in this empty place to bear\u2014I would crawl away if I had to. How lucky that I was alone! Alone. I repeated the word with grim satisfaction as I wrenched myself to my feet despite the pain. At precisely that moment, a figure stepped out from the trees to the north, some thirty paces away. A dizzying array of emotions shot through me in a second. The first was surprise; I was far from any trail here, and I didn't expect company. Then, as my eyes focused on the motionless figure, seeing the utter stillness, the pallid skin, a rush of piercing hope rocked through me. I suppressed it viciously, fighting against the equally sharp lash of agony as my eyes continued to the face beneath the black hair, the face that wasn't the one I wanted to see. Next was fear; this was not the face I grieved for, but it was close enough for me to know that the man facing me was no stray hiker. And finally, in the end, recognition. \"Laurent!\" I cried in surprised pleasure. It was an irrational response. I probably should have stopped at fear. Laurent had been one of James's coven when we'd first met. He hadn't been involved with the hunt that followed\u2014the hunt where I was the quarry\u2014but that was only because he was afraid; I was protected by a bigger coven than his own. It would have been different if that wasn't the case\u2014he'd had no compunctions, at the time, against making a meal of me. Of course, he must have changed, because he'd gone to Alaska to live with the other civilized coven there, the other family that refused to drink human blood for ethical\u00a0 reasons. The other family like\u2026 but I couldn't let myself think the name. Yes, fear would have made more sense, but all I felt was an overwhelming satisfaction. The meadow was a magic place again. A darker magic than I'd expected, to be sure, but magic all the same. Here was the connection I'd sought. The proof, however remote, that\u2014somewhere in the same world where I lived\u2014 he did exist. It was impossible how exactly the same Laurent looked. I suppose it was very silly and human to expect some kind of change in the last year. But there was something\u2026 I couldn't quite put my finger on it. \"Bella?\" he asked, looking more astonished than I felt. \"You remember.\" I smiled. It was ridiculous that I should be so elated because a vampire knew my name. He grinned. \"I didn't expect to see you here.\" He strolled toward me, his expression bemused. \"Isn't it the other way around? I do live here. I thought you'd gone to Alaska.\" He stopped about ten paces away, cocking his head to the side. His face was the most beautiful face I'd seen in what felt like an eternity. I studied his features with a strangely greedy sense of release. Here was someone I didn't have to pretend for\u2014someone who already knew everything I could never say. \"You're right,\" he agreed. \"I did go to Alaska. Still, I didn't expect\u2026 When I found the Cullen place empty, I thought they'd moved on.\" \"Oh.\" I bit my lip as the name set the raw edges of my wound throbbing. It took me a second to compose myself. Laurent waited with curious eyes. \"They did move on,\" I finally managed to tell him. \"Hmm,\" he murmured. \"I'm surprised they left you behind. Weren't you sort of a pet of theirs?\" His eyes were innocent of any intended offense. I smiled wryly. \"Something like that.\" \"Hmm,\" he said, thoughtful again. At that precise moment, I realized why he looked the same\u2014too much the same. After Carlisle told us that Laurent had stayed with Tanya's family, I'd begun to picture him, on the rare occasions that I thought of him at all, with the same golden eyes that the\u2026 Cullens\u2014I forced the name out, wincing\u2014had. That all good vampires had. I took an involuntary step back, and his curious, dark red eyes followed the movement. \"Do they visit often?\" he asked, still casual, but his weight shifted toward me. \"Lie,\" the beautiful velvet voice whispered anxiously from my memory. I started at the sound of his voice, but it should not have surprised me. Was I not in the worst danger imaginable? The motorcycle was safe as kittens next to this. I did what the voice said to do. \"Now and again.\" I tried to make my voice light, relaxed. \"The time seems longer to me, I imagine. You know how they get distracted\u2026\" I was beginning to babble. I had to work to shut myself up. \"Hmm,\" he said again. \"The house smelled like it had been vacant for a while\u2026\" \"You must lie better than that, Bella,\" the voice urged. I tried. \"I'll have to mention to Carlisle that you stopped by. He'll be sorry they missed your visit.\" I pretended to deliberate for a second. \"But I probably shouldn't mention it to\u2026 Edward, I suppose\u2014\" I barely managed to say his name, and it twisted my expression on the way out, ruining my bluff \"\u2014he has such a temper\u2026 well, I'm sure you remember. He's still touchy about the whole James thing.\" I rolled my eyes and waved one hand dismissively, like it was all ancient history, but there was an edge of hysteria to my voice. I wondered if he would recognize what it was. \"Is he really?\" Laurent asked pleasantly\u2026 skeptically. I kept my reply short, so that my voice wouldn't betray my panic. \"Mm-hmm.\" Laurent took a casual step to the side, gazing around at the little meadow. I didn't miss that the step brought him closer to me. In my head, the voice responded with a low snarl. \"So how are things working out in Denali? Carlisle said you were staying with Tanya?\" My voice was too high. The question made him pause. \"I like Tanya very much,\" he mused. \"And her sister Irina even more\u2026 I've never stayed in one place for so long before, and I enjoy the advantages, the novelty of it. But, the restrictions are difficult\u2026 I'm surprised that any of them can keep it up for long.\" He smiled at me conspiratorially. \"Sometimes I cheat.\" I couldn't swallow. My foot started to ease back, but I froze when his red eyes flickered down to catch the movement. \"Oh,\" I said in a faint voice. \"Jasper has problems with that, too.\" \"Don't move,\" the voice whispered. I tried to do what he instructed. It was hard; the instinct to take flight was nearly uncontrollable. \"Really?\" Laurent seemed interested. \"Is that why they left?\" \"No,\" I answered honestly. \"Jasper is more careful at home.\" \"Yes,\" Laurent agreed. \"I am, too.\" The step forward he took now was quite deliberate. \"Did Victoria ever find you?\" I asked, breathless, desperate to distract him. It was the first question that popped into my head, and I regretted it as soon as the words were spoken. Victoria\u2014who had hunted me with James, and then disappeared\u2014was not someone I wanted to think of at this particular moment. But the question did stop him. \"Yes,\" he said, hesitating on that step. \"I actually came here as a favor to her.\" He made a face. \"She won't be happy about this.\" \"About what?\" I said eagerly, inviting him to continue. He was glaring into the trees, away from me. I took advantage of his diversion, taking a furtive step back. He looked back at me and smiled\u2014the expression made him look like a black-haired angel. \"About me killing you,\" he answered in a seductive purr. I staggered back another step. The frantic growling in my head made it hard to hear. \"She wanted to save that part for herself,\" he went on blithely. \"She's sort of\u2026 put out with you, Bella.\" \"Me?\" I squeaked. He shook his head and chuckled. \"I know, it seems a little backward to me, too. But James was her mate, and your Edward killed him.\" Even here, on the point of death, his name tore against my unhealed wounds like a serrated edge. Laurent was oblivious to my reaction. \"She thought it more appropriate to kill you than Edward\u2014fair turnabout, mate for mate. She asked me to get the lay of the land for her, so to speak. I didn't imagine you would be so easy to get to. So maybe her plan was flawed\u2014apparently it wouldn't be the revenge she imagined, since you must not mean very much to him if he left you here unprotected.\" Another blow, another tear through my chest. Laurent's weight shifted slightly, and I stumbled another step back. He frowned. \"I suppose she'll be angry, all the same.\" \"Then why not wait for her?\" I choked out. A mischievous grin rearranged his features. \"Well, you've caught me at a bad time, Bella. I didn't come to this place on Victoria's mission\u2014I was hunting. I'm quite thirsty, and you do smell\u2026 simply mouthwatering.\" Laurent looked at me with approval, as if he meant it as a compliment. \"Threaten him,\" the beautiful delusion ordered, his voice distorted with dread. \"He'll know it was you,\" I whispered obediently. \"You won't get away with this.\" \"And why not?\" Laurent's smile widened. He gazed around the small opening in the trees. \"The scent will wash away with the next rain. No one will find your body\u2014you'll simply go missing, like so many, many other humans. There's no reason for Edward to think of me, if he cares enough to investigate. This is nothing personal, let me assure you, Bella. Just thirst.\" \"Beg,\" my hallucination begged. \"Please,\" I gasped. Laurent shook his head, his face kind. \"Look at it this way, Bella. You're very lucky I was the one to find you.\" \"Am I?\" I mouthed, faltering another step back. Laurent followed, lithe and graceful. \"Yes,\" he assured me. \"I'll be very quick. You won't feel a thing, I promise. Oh, I'll lie to Victoria about that later, naturally, just to placate her. But if you knew what she had planned for you, Bella\u2026\" He shook his head with a slow movement, almost as if in disgust. \"I swear you'd be thanking me for this.\" I stared at him in horror. He sniffed at the breeze that blew threads of my hair in his direction. \"Mouthwatering,\" he repeated, inhaling deeply. I tensed for the spring, my eyes squinting as I cringed away, and the sound of Edward's furious roar echoed distantly in the back of my head. His name burst through all the walls I'd built to contain it. Edward, Edward, Edward. I was going to die. It shouldn't matter if I thought of him now. Edward, I love you. Through my narrowed eyes, I watched as Laurent paused in the act of inhaling and whipped his head abruptly to the left. I was afraid to look away from him, to follow his glance, though he hardly needed a distraction or any other trick to overpower me. I was too amazed to feel relief when he started slowly backing away from me. \"I don't believe it,\" he said, his voice so low that I barely heard it. I had to look then. My eyes scanned the meadow, searching for the interruption that had extended my life by a few seconds. At first I saw nothing, and my gaze flickered back to Laurent. He was retreating more quickly now, his eyes boring into the forest. Then I saw it; a huge black shape eased out of the trees, quiet as a shadow, and stalked deliberately toward the vampire. It was enormous\u2014as tall as a horse, but thicker, much more muscular. The long muzzle grimaced, revealing a line of dagger-like incisors. A grisly snarl rolled out from between the teeth, rumbling across the clearing like a prolonged crack of thunder. The bear. Only, it wasn't a bear at all. Still, this gigantic black monster had to be the creature causing all the alarm. From a distance, anyone would assume it was a bear. What else could be so vast, so powerfully built? I wished I were lucky enough to see it from a distance. Instead, it padded silently through the grass a mere ten feet from where I stood. \"Don't move an inch,\" Edward's voice whispered. I stared at the monstrous creature, my mind boggling as I tried to put a name to it. There was a distinctly canine cast to the shape of it, the way it moved. I could only think of one possibility, locked in horror as I was. Yet I'd never imagined that a wolf could get so big. Another growl rumbled in its throat, and I shuddered away from the sound. Laurent was backing toward the edge of the trees, and, under the freezing terror,\u00a0 confusion swept through me. Why was Laurent retreating? Granted, the wolf was monstrous in size, but it was just an animal. What reason would a vampire have for fearing an animal? And Laurent was afraid. His eyes were wide with horror, just like mine. As if in answer to my question, suddenly the mammoth wolf was not alone. Flanking it on either side, another two gigantic beasts prowled silently into the meadow. One was a deep gray, the other brown, neither one quite as tall as the first. The gray wolf came through the trees only a few feet from me, its eyes locked on Laurent. Before I could even react, two more wolves followed, lined up in a V, like geese flying south. Which meant that the rusty brown monster that shrugged through the brush last was close enough for me to touch. I gave an involuntary gasp and jumped back\u2014which was the stupidest thing I could have done. I froze again, waiting for the wolves to turn on me, the much weaker of the available prey. I wished briefly that Laurent would get on with it and crush the wolf pack\u2014it should be so simple for him. I guessed that, between the two choices before me, being eaten by wolves was almost certainly the worse option. The wolf closest to me, the reddish brown one, turned its head slightly at the sound of my gasp. The wolf's eyes were dark, nearly black. It gazed at me for a fraction of a second, the deep eyes seeming too intelligent for a wild animal. As it stared at me, I suddenly thought of Jacob\u2014again, with gratitude. At least I'd come here alone, to this fairytale meadow filled with dark monsters. At least Jacob wasn't going to die, too. At least I wouldn't have his death on my hands. Then another low growl from the leader caused the russet wolf to whip his head around, back toward Laurent. Laurent was staring at the pack of monster wolves with unconcealed shock and fear. The first I could understand. But I was stunned when, without warning, he spun and disappeared into the trees. He ran away. The wolves were after him in a second, sprinting across the open grass with a few powerful bounds, snarling and snapping so loudly that my hands flew up instinctively to cover my ears. The sound faded with surprising swiftness once they disappeared into the woods. And then I was alone again. My knees buckled under me, and I fell onto my hands, sobs building in my throat. I knew I needed to leave, and leave now. How long would the wolves chase Laurent before they doubled back for me? Or would Laurent turn on them? Would he be the one that came looking? I couldn't move at first, though; my arms and legs were shaking, and I didn't know how to get back to my feet. My mind couldn't move past the fear, the horror or the confusion. I didn't understand what I'd just witnessed. A vampire should not have run from overgrown dogs like that. What good would their teeth be against his granite skin? And the wolves should have given Laurent a wide berth. Even if their extraordinary size had taught them to fear nothing, it still made no sense that they would pursue him. I doubted his icy marble skin would smell anything like food. Why would they pass up something warm-blooded and weak like me to chase after Laurent? I couldn't make it add up. A cold breeze whipped through the meadow, swaying the grass like something was moving through it. I scrambled to my feet, backing away even though the wind brushed harmlessly past me. Stumbling in panic, I turned and ran headlong into the trees. The next few hours were agony. It took me three times as long to escape the trees as it had to get to the meadow. At first I paid no attention to where I was headed, focused only on what I was running from By the time I collected myself enough to remember the compass, I was deep in the unfamiliar and menacing forest. My hands were shaking so violently that I had to set the compass on the muddy ground to be able to read it. Every few minutes I would stop to put the compass down and check that I was still heading northwest, hearing\u2014when the sounds weren't hidden behind the frantic squelching of my footsteps\u2014the quiet whisper of unseen things moving in the leaves. The call of a jaybird made me leap back and fall into a thick stand of young spruce, scraping up my arms and tangling my hair with sap. The sudden rush of a squirrel up a hemlock made me scream so loud it hurt my own ears. At last there was a break in the trees ahead. I came out onto the empty road a mile or so south of where I'd left the truck. Exhausted as I was, I jogged up the lane until I found it. By the time I pulled myself into the cab, I was sobbing again. I fiercely shoved down both stiff locks before I dug my keys out of my pocket. The roar of the engine was comforting and sane. It helped me control the tears as I sped as fast as my truck would allow toward the main highway. I was calmer, but still a mess when I got home. Charlie's cruiser was in the driveway\u2014I hadn't realized how late it was. The sky was already dusky. \"Bella?\" Charlie asked when I slammed the front door behind me and hastily turned the locks.  \"Yeah, it's me.\" My voice was unsteady. \"Where have you been?\" he thundered, appearing through the kitchen doorway with an ominous expression. I hesitated. He'd probably called the Stanleys. I'd better stick to the truth. \"I was hiking,\" I admitted. His eyes were tight. \"What happened to going to Jessica's?\" \"I didn't feel like Calculus today.\" Charlie folded his arms across his chest. \"I thought I asked you to stay out of the forest.\" \"Yeah, I know. Don't worry, I won't do it again.\" I shuddered. Charlie seemed to really look at me for the first time. I remembered that I had spent some time on the forest floor today; I must be a mess. \"What happened?\" Charlie demanded. Again, I decided that the truth, or part of it anyway, was the best option. I was too shaken to pretend that I'd spent an uneventful day with the flora and fauna. \"I saw the bear.\" I tried to say it calmly, but my voice was high and shaky. \"It's not a bear, though\u2014it's some kind of wolf. And there are five of them. A big black one, and gray, and reddish-brown\u2026\" Charlie's eyes grew round with horror. He strode quickly to me and grabbed the tops of my arms. \"Are you okay?\" My head bobbed in a weak nod. \"Tell me what happened.\" \"They didn't pay any attention to me. But after they were gone, I ran away and I fell down a lot.\" He let go of my shoulders and wrapped his arms around me. For a long moment, he didn't say anything. \"Wolves,\" he murmured. \"What?\" \"The rangers said the tracks were wrong for a bear\u2014but wolves just don't get that big\u2026\" \"These were huge.\" \"How many did you say you saw?\" \"Five.\" Charlie shook his head, frowning with anxiety, He finally spoke in a tone that allowed no argument. \"No more hiking.\" \"No problem,\" I promised fervently. .  Charlie called the station to report what I'd seen. I fudged a little bit about where exactly I'd seen the wolves\u2014claiming I'd been on the trail that led to the north. I didn't want my dad to know how deep I'd gone into the forest against his wishes, and, more importantly, I didn't want anyone wandering near where Laurent might be searching for me. The thought of it made me feel sick. \"Are you hungry?\" he asked me when he hung up the phone. I shook my head, though I must have been starving. I hadn't eaten all day. \"Just tired,\" I told him. I turned for the stairs. \"Hey,\" Charlie said, his voice suddenly suspicious again. \"Didn't you say Jacob was gone for the day?\" \"That's what Billy said,\" I told him, confused by his question. He studied my expression for a minute, and seemed satisfied with what he saw there. \"Huh.\" \"Why?\" I demanded. It sounded like he was implying that I'd been lying to him this morning. About something besides studying with Jessica. \"Well, it's just that when I went to pick up Harry, I saw Jacob out in front of the store down there with some of his friends. I waved hi, but he\u2026 well, I guess I don't know if he saw me. I think maybe he was arguing with his friends. He looked strange, like he was upset about something. And\u2026 different. It's like you can watch that kid growing! He gets bigger every time I see him.\" \"Billy said Jake and his friends were going up to Port Angeles to see some movies. They were probably just waiting for someone to meet them.\" \"Oh.\" Charlie nodded and headed for the kitchen. I stood in the hall, thinking about Jacob arguing with his friends. I wondered if he had confronted Embry about the situation with Sam. Maybe that was the reason he'd ditched me today\u2014if it meant he could sort things out with Embry, I was glad he had. I paused to check the locks again before I went to my room. It was a silly thing to do. What difference would a lock make to any of the monsters I'd seen this afternoon? I assumed the handle alone would stymie the wolves, not having opposable thumbs. And if Laurent came here\u2026 Or\u2026 Victoria. I lay down on my bed, but I was shaking too hard to hope for sleep. I curled into a cramped ball under my quilt, and faced the horrifying facts. There was nothing I could do. There were no precautions I could take. There was no place I could hide. There was no one who could help me. I realized, with a nauseous roll of my stomach, that the situation was worse than even that. Because all those facts applied to Charlie, too. My father, sleeping one room away from me, was just a hairsbreadth off the heart of the target that was centered on me. My scent would lead them here, whether I was here or not. The tremors rocked me until my teeth chattered. To calm myself, I fantasized the impossible: I imagined the big wolves catching up to Laurent in the woods and massacring the indestructible immortal the way they would any normal person. Despite the absurdity of such a vision, the idea comforted me. If the wolves got him, then he couldn't tell Victoria I was here all alone. If he didn't return, maybe she'd think the Cullens were still protecting me. If only the wolves could win such a fight\u2026 My good vampires were never coming back; how soothing it was to imagine that the other kind could also disappear. I squeezed my eyes tight together and waited for unconsciousness\u2014almost eager for my nightmare to start. Better that than the pale, beautiful face that smiled at me now from behind my lids. In my imagination, Victoria's eyes were black with thirst, bright with anticipation, and her lips curled back from her gleaming teeth in pleasure. Her red hair was brilliant as fire; it blew chaotically around her wild face. Laurent's words repeated in my head. If you knew what she had planned for you \u2026 I pressed my fist against my mouth to keep from screaming.",
