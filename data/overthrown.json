            "en": "Thai Demonstrators Hold 'Bloody' Protest       Protesters have poured blood at the Thai government's administrative building and governing party headquarters in a gesture calling for the government to resign. The National Human Rights Commission is in talks between the protesters and government in bid to open a dialogue and negotiation. In a symbolic demonstration, protesters poured human blood at the main gate of the Thai government administrative building and later at the headquarters of the governing Democrat Party. The red-dressed protesters have been demanding the government of Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva to stand down and call fresh elections. The blood had been drawn from hundreds of protesters as part of a campaign against the government that has seen over 100,000 demonstrators assembled in Bangkok since late last week. Sean Boonpracong, the red shirts' international spokesman, says at least 20,000 protesters donated blood with the rituals targeting the government which he says came to power with the backing of the army. \"We feel like at least symbolically each time [Thai Prime Minister] Abhisit goes to the Government House they will walk in, cross a track of blood that we planted and we want to shake him up a little bit because his government came from a barrel of a gun formed in an army barracks,\" said the spokesman. He says the protesters will consider civil disobedience as a further step. Many of the protesters, who are demanding the government step down, are supporters of former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. But Prime Minister Abhisit has refused to dissolve parliament, with coalition partners saying they will stand by the Democrat Party. National Human Right Commission Chairperson Amaran Pengsapij met with red-shirt leaders. Amaran said the talks were aimed at achieving reconciliation with the government. \"Yes, two steps; one is establish dialogue between different stakeholders and the goal of course is to stop the rally.\" said the chairperson. Amaran is to meet with the government Wednesday. Most of the protesters are from outside Bangkok, especially the poorer northern provinces that remain a strong Thaksin-support base. Thaksin has been living in exile to avoid a two-year jail term for corruption and abuse of power gained widespread support through populist policies while in power. He was <em>overthrown</em> in 2006 by the military.",

            "en": "Significant historical events in the year of the tiger         The tiger is also known as the god of the mountain and forest and the king of all kinds of animals. For Vietnamese people, the year of the tiger often comes with significant events in the nation\u2019s history.  In 2010, along with the arrival of a new spring, we are entering a new year of the tiger that reminds us of unforgettable events in the nation\u2019s history. The year of tiger in 714, Mai Thuc Loan, also known as Mai Hac De (the Black Emperor), successfully led a heroic revolt against Chinese invaders, halting the domination of the Chinese Tang dynasty and bringing back national liberation. The year of tiger in 906, Khuc Thua Du led insurgent troops to struggle against the Chinese Tang aggressor and take over Dai La Citadel proclaiming himself Governor. On February 7, 906 (the 11th day of the first lunar month), the Chinese Tang dynasty was <em>overthrown</em>, and the Vietnamese people ruled their own territory, successfully ending more than 1000 years of Chinese domination. The year of tiger in 966, the 12 Lords Rebellion (Lo\u1ea1n 12 S\u1ee9 Qu\u00e2n) was a period of chaos and civil war in the history of Vietnam, from 966 to 968 AD during the Ngo Dynasty, due to a conflict of succession after the death of King Ngo Quyen. The year of tiger in 1002, King Le Dai Hanh intensified a series of measures to adjust and reform the administrative and political system. He issued laws, renamed administrative units and divided mandarins into two groups \u2013 civil and military. He also reorganized and streamlined the army. The year of tiger in 1038, King Ly Thai Ton himself got involved in ploughing in Bo Hai rice field to promote agriculture and set an example for local farmers. This fine customs was then upheld by generations throughout the ensuing dynasties. The year of tiger in 1158, mandarin Nguyen Quoc advised King Ly Anh Ton to set a glass box at the royal court so that mandarins and the people could file complaints, denunciations and petitions on paper. The King followed the advice and received the box full of petition papers one month later. This method proved the effective in drawing people\u2019s opinions and demonstrated democratic progress. The year of tiger in 1230, the Tran dynasty issued many documents regulating the organisation and management of authorities. The same year, the dynasty also revised some articles in its existing laws. The year of tiger in 1242, the Tran dynasty began administrative reform on a large scale, divided its territory into different administrative units and reorganised local mandarin networks. The Tran dynasty made a family record book, classifying citizens and imposing taxes. The year of tiger in 1374, a feudal Court examination was organised to select candidates with good academic results. The examination was held every seven years to select the top 30 candidates. The same year, the Tran dynasty also introduced measures to preserve traditional cultural values. The dynasty prohibited people from wearing Chinese-style clothes and speaking the Lao and Cambodian languages. The year of tiger in 1398, Mandarin Ho Quy Ly implemented a comprehensive land reform. The year of tiger in 1506, the Le dynasty launched a large examination at Giang Vo royal court. More than 30,000 candidates at the event competed in writing skills and mathematics. As a result, 1,519 candidates passed the exam. The year of tiger in 1614, the Vietnamese alphabet was first introduced in Vietnam by Portuguese priests. The year of tiger in 1650, businesspeople from France, Italy, Portugal, the Netherlands and Japan were allowed to extend their stay in Thanh Tri village on the outskirt of Hanoi, to run their businesses in the capital city. Vietnam\u2019s foreign trade relations began to develop strongly. The year of tiger in 1698, the Mandarin Nguyen Huu Canh moved to the south to establish Gia Dinh palace in order to manage two districts, namely Phuoc Long in Bien Hoa and Tan Binh in Saigon, stretching from the Saigon River to Vam Co Dong River. The former Saigon (nowadays Ho Chi Minh City) was established during that time. The year of tiger in 1782, three brothers, Nguyen Nhac, Nguyen Hue and Nguyen Lu, launched an uprising in 1771 that ousted the Trinh-Le regime in the north and eventually toppled the Nguyen Lord in the south. The Tay Son uprising achieved great success and took control of the whole country. Lord Nguyen Anh suffered a heavy defeat and fled to foreign countries to call for support. The year of tiger in 1806, Nguyen Anh took the throne and named himself Gia Long, becoming the first King of the last feudal dynasty in Vietnam\u2019s history. The year of tiger in 1830, the Nguyen Dynasty sent many mandarin delegations to various countries around the world to establish and develop diplomatic relations. The year of tiger in 1854, Cao Ba Quat rose up in arms against the offensive ruling Nguyen dynasty. Although the uprising received strong support from the people, it was trounced by the Nguyen dynasty. The year of tiger in 1866, the Truong Quyen insurgent army coordinated with the Pokum Pao insurgent army to fight French invaders. They claimed victories in many localities in Vietnam and Cambodia.
