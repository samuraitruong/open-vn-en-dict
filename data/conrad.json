Democrats Ben Nelson of Nebraska, Evan Bayh of Indiana, Kent <em>Conrad</em> of North Dakota, and Independent Joe Lieberman of Connecticut have each publicly expressed concern about the impact of raising taxes, even on the well-to-do, during an economic downturn. \"The general rule of thumb would be you don't want to do tax changes, tax increases...until the recovery is on more solid ground,\" <em>Conrad</em> said recently, summarizing their view. Each has said the tax cuts should be extended at least temporarily. Senate Democratic leaders know it will be virtually impossible to pass a controversial tax bill without the support of all their members but intend to press ahead with the debate later this month. They believe the political and fiscal arguments are on their side and that allowing the tax cuts for the wealthy to expire is \"the consensus position of the caucus,\" even if a few Democrats oppose doing so, according to a top Senate Democratic leadership aide. \"There is bipartisan consensus that we should not raise taxes,\" retorted a senior senate Republican leadership aide, seizing on the division in the Democratic ranks. The GOP aide didn't rule out a compromise that involved passing a short-term extension, a proposal put forth by House Majority Leader John Boehner. \"If the only way to pass a bill that didn't raise taxes would to pass a temporary extension, we'd be open to talking about it,\" said the aide. But the Democratic aide doubted Republicans would seriously work to help Democrats pass a bill this close to the November election. \"I don't believe the Republicans are interested in compromise,\" the aide said.",

            "en": "First Anniversary of Michael Jackson's Death Marked Across Globe          Music fans across the globe on Friday marked the first anniversary of the death of the legendary Michael Jackson. The so-called King of Pop died suddenly at the age of 50 on June 25, 2009, in Los Angeles. His death was attributed to an overdose of a powerful anesthetic (propofol).\u00a0 The doctor who administered the drug (<em>Conrad</em> Murray) is facing criminal charges (involuntary manslaughter) in connection with Jackson's death. Also, Jackson' father filed a wrongful death lawsuit Friday, accusing the Nevada doctor of lying to the doctors and paramedics trying to save the singer's life. At New York's Apollo Theater on Friday, Jackson's music blared from loudspeakers as fans danced in the streets. His music could also be heard on the streets of Gary, Indiana, Jackson's hometown, where his mother (Katherine) and his children (Prince, Paris and Blanket) unveiled a Michael Jackson monument. And at the Los Angeles cemetery where Jackson was buried (Forest Lawn) hundreds paid tribute to the dead singer. In Tokyo, the Japanese capital, 50 devout Jackson fans paid more than $1,000 each to spend a night in the Tokyo Tower with the singer's possessions.\u00a0 The Neverland Collection, named for Jackson's California ranch, is the only official Michael Jackson exhibition outside the United States. Jackson's death came as he was preparing for a series of London concerts as part of a musical comeback.\u00a0 It is estimated that sales of his music and films have generated at least $1 billion in the year since he died.",

            "en": "Prosecutors said he acted with \"gross negligence\" and gave Jackson a lethal dose of the sedative propofol that caused his death in June 2009. The defence said Jackson gave himself too much of the drug, a sleeping aid. Dr Murray, 58, who denies the charge, could face four years in jail and the loss of his medical licence. Slurred message \u00a0 In Tuesday's opening statement, lead prosecutor David Walgren told the court the evidence would show \"<em>Conrad</em> Murray repeatedly acted with gross negligence, repeatedly denied appropriate care to his patient, Michael Jackson\".  \"That misplaced trust... cost Michael Jackson his life.\" The jury was shown a photo of the 50-year-old singer's pale body lying on a gurney after he died, and heard a recording of the pop star slurring while talking about planned comeback concerts. Mr Walgren said the audio, aired in public for the first time, had come from a message on Dr Murray's mobile phone. \"When people leave my show, I want them to say, 'I've never seen nothing like this in my life',\" says Jackson, apparently heavily drugged, on the audio. \"Go. Go. I've never seen nothing like this. Go. It's amazing. He's the greatest entertainer in the world.\" \u00a0The prosecutor said Jackson's difficulty in speaking on the recording showed that Dr Murray ought to have realised the star should not have taken any more propofol. Mr Walgren said that after administering what it says was the fatal dose, Dr Murray had not been attentive to Jackson's health. 'Abandoned'  \u00a0 The prosecutor said the doctor had left to go to the bathroom and checked his mobile phone. \"He [Murray] left him [Jackson] there, abandoned him to fend for himself,\" the prosecutor said. \u201cMr Walgren said when Dr Murray found Jackson unconscious, he did not immediately call the emergency services, instead telling a bodyguard to do so 20 minutes later.  Dr Murray also did not mention to paramedics or emergency room doctors that he had administered propofol, according to the prosecutor. During his lawyer's turn to speak, Dr Murray appeared to wipe tears from his eyes. Defence attorney Ed Chernoff said it was drugs taken by Jackson himself which had proved fatal. \"He did an act without his doctor's knowledge, without his doctor's permission, against his orders, he did an act that caused his own death,\" Mr Chernoff said. \u00a0He claimed the singer had swallowed pills of the sedative lorazepam on the morning of his death. That dosage was enough to put six people to sleep, said the defence.  'Perfect storm'  \u00a0 He also said Jackson had self-ingested propofol, and that it had killed him instantly. Mr Chernoff said the two drugs together had created \"a perfect storm in his body\". Jackson \"died so rapidly, so instantly, he didn't even have time to close his eyes\", the defence lawyer added. He also said that Dr Murray had been trying to wean Jackson off propofol, which the star used to call his \"milk\". The prosecutor said Dr Murray had initially asked for $5m (\u00a33.2m) to work with Jackson for a year, though accepted a lower rate of $150,000 per month. But his contract to become the star's personal physician was never signed, and Dr Murray was never paid. First witnesses Jackson choreographer Kenny Ortega was the first prosecution witness to take the stand. He told the court of Jackson's excitement about his series of comeback concerts.  Mr Ortega also told the court that days before Jackson's death, he expressed \"deep concern\" in an email to Jackson's concert promoter about the state of Jackson's health. The email was written after a period of about a week when Jackson repeatedly failed to appear at rehearsals.  But in the last day or two before Jackson's death Mr Ortega said the star seemed \"full of energy, full of desire to work... It was a different Michael.\" Footage of the star's rehearsals became part of a documentary, This Is It, directed by Mr Ortega.  Paul Gongaware, co-chief executive of concert promoter AEG, followed Mr Ortega to the stand as the second prosecution witness. He told the court about how he employed Dr Murray as Jackson's personal physician. A number of witnesses, including security guards, paramedics and emergency room doctors, are yet to be called. Propofol is usually administered intravenously, often during surgery.  Medical experts are expected to testify about the sedative's effects, as well as how a trace of the drug was found in Jackson's stomach. Hundreds of Jackson fans gathered outside court earlier as the trial began. The trial is expected to last about five weeks.",

            "en": "Coroner's preliminary finding: Jackson overdosed on propofol          (CNN) -- The Los Angeles coroner has concluded preliminarily that singer Michael Jackson died of an overdose of propofol, a powerful sedative he was given to help him sleep, according to court documents released Monday. A search warrant filed in court showed toxicology reports found propofol in Michael Jackson's body. Los Angeles coroner Dr. Lakshmanan Sathyavagiswaran reached that preliminary conclusion after reviewing toxicology results carried out on Jackson's blood, according to a search warrant and affidavit unsealed in Houston, Texas.  The affidavit, used to outline probable cause for search warrants of the offices of doctors who are believed to have treated Jackson, disclosed many details of drugs given to Jackson in the weeks before his death. Jackson family lawyer Londell McMillan said the report \"reaffirms the very sad reality that there was a tragic and gross violation of duty and care for Michael Jackson.\" The publicist for Jackson's family said the \"family looks forward to the day that justice can be served.\" \"The Jackson family has full confidence in the legal process, and commends the ongoing efforts of the L.A. County Coroner, the L.A. District Attorney and the L.A. Police Department,\" the statement said. The Associated Press is quoting a single law enforcement official, who said the L.A. County Coroner ruled Michael Jackson's death a homicide. The Los Angeles County Coroner's office told CNN they had \"no comment\" on the report. An LAPD spokesman said the story did not come from their department. \"We will not comment on the \"anonymous\" law enforcement source that claims that Michael Jackson's death will be ruled a homicide,\" Murray's lawyer Ed Chernoff said in a statement on his firm's Web site. \"Most of the reports by \"anonymous\" sources have been proven wrong. We will be happy to address the Coroner's report when it is officially released.\" The 32-page warrant said Dr. <em>Conrad</em> Murray, Jackson's personal physician, told a detective that he had been treating Jackson for insomnia for six weeks. Murray said each night he gave Jackson 50 mg of propofol, also known as Diprivan, diluted with the anesthetic lidocaine via an intravenous drip.  Worried that Jackson may have been becoming addicted to the drug, the Houston cardiologist said he attempted to wean him from it, putting together combinations of other drugs that succeeded in helping Jackson sleep during the two nights prior to his death. On June 22 Murray said he gave Jackson a cocktail of drugs similar to what he gave him on the day he died, June 25 -- propofol, Ativan and Versed, which helped the star fall asleep, according to the documents. On June 23 he gave Jackson only the Ativan and Versed, which helped him sleep. But on June 25, other drugs failed to do the job, as Murray recounted to detectives in an hour-by-hour account detailed by detective Orlando Martinez of the Los Angeles Police  -- At about 1:30 a.m., Murray gave Jackson 10 mg of Valium. -- At about 2 a.m., he injected Jackson with 2 mg of the anti-anxiety drug Ativan. -- At about 3 a.m., Murray then administered 2 mg of the sedative Versed. -- At about 5 a.m., he administered another 2 mg of Ativan. -- At about 7:30 a.m., Murray gave Jackson yet another 2 mg of Versed while monitoring him with a device that measured the oxygen saturation of his blood. -- At about 10:40 a.m., \"after repeated demands/requests from Jackson,\" Murray administered 25 mg of propofol, the document said. \"Jackson finally went to sleep and Murray stated that he remained monitoring him. After approximately 10 minutes, Murray stated he left Jackson's side to go to the restroom and relieve himself. Murray stated he was out of the room for about two minutes maximum. Upon his return, Murray noticed that Jackson was no longer breathing,\" the affidavit said. Efforts at CPR proved fruitless, according Murray. Shortly after Murray said he found Jackson not breathing, Murray was on the phone with three separate callers starting at 11:18 a.m. and ending at 12:05 p.m., according to the court documents which cite the doctor's phone records. \"Murray didn't tell this to anyone when he was interviewed,\" the court documents said. Chernoff denied the timeline referenced in the affidavit. \"Much of what was in the search warrant affidavit is factual. However, unfortunately, much is police theory. Most egregiously, the timeline reported by law enforcement was not obtained through interviews with Dr. Murray, as was implied by the affidavit,\" the statement said. \"Dr. Murray simply never told investigators that he found Michael Jackson at 11:00 a.m. not breathing. He also never said that he waited a mere 10 minutes before leaving to make several phone calls. In fact, Dr. Murray never said that he left Michael Jackson's room to make phone calls at all.\" The document also cited reports from staff at the University of California at Los Angeles Medical Center, where Jackson's body was taken, who said Murray \"admitted\" to having given Jackson flumazenil to counteract the Ativan. The document lists another five doctors and a nurse practitioner who reportedly treated Jackson. \"Detectives ... believe that the miscellaneous prescriptions, from multiple doctors ... could have contributed to his death,\" the document said. \"It cannot be determined whether the cause of death is due to the actions of a single night and/or a single doctor, or the grossly negligent treatment of several doctors over an extended period of time.\" According to the warrant and affidavit, Murray said he was not the first doctor to give Jackson the powerful anesthetic, which the singer called his \"milk.\" The drug has a milky appearance. Jackson also told Murray about two unknown doctors in Germany who gave him propofol, according to documents. Documents show police found eight bottles of propofol inside Jackson's home. A search of Murray's doctor bag, which he left at the house the day Jackson died, contained multiple bottles/vials of Lidocaine and several bottles/vials of propofol, Ativan, Versed and Anexate, according to the documents. The affidavit said a search of Jackson's home revealed \"numerous bottles of medications\" at Jackson's bedside that were prescribed by Murray and two other physicians -- Dr. Allan Metzger and Dr. Arnold Klein. Many of the drugs \"have an indicated or off label use in the treatment of insomnia,\" the affidavit said. Metzger's lawyer told CNN last month that Metzger -- who treated Jackson in 2003 -- refused Jackson's request in April for a propofol prescription. Klein -- a dermatologist who also was Jackson's longtime friend -- has insisted he never gave Jackson dangerous drugs. Jackson visited Klein's Beverly Hills, California, medical office just days before his June 25 death. Murray took the job as Jackson's personal physician in May, as the pop star was preparing for a series of comeback concerts set to begin in July at London's O2 arena. Murray told investigators that Jackson would not tell him what drugs other doctors had given him, but he did tell Murray the medicine given to him by Klein and Metzger was not working, the affidavit said. The DEA has been unable to find a record of Dr. Murray purchasing, ordering or obtaining any propofol under his medical license or DEA number, according to the documents.",
