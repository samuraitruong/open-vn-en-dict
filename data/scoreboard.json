            "en": "Five Reasons Why Inter Beat Bayern Munich    1) Diego Milito It\u2019s not hard to figure out that the 30-year-old was an important factor, simply by looking at the <em>scoreboard</em>.  You\u2019ll see the Argentine\u2019s name not once, but twice as he continued his penchant of scoring in big matches.  His goals clinched all three of Inter\u2019s titles this season \u2013 the Coppa Italia, Serie A and now the Champions League.  President Massimo Moratti\u2019s dream has been realised in no small part due to his efforts.  At Real Zaragoza and Genoa he proved to be a capable scorer, but at Inter he displayed a world-class pedigree at the top level and will hope to carry that into the World Cup.  2) Bayern\u2019s Weak Defense Milito clincially took both his chances with great aplomb, but also exposed FC Hollywood\u2019s centre-backs, a weakness that had been highlighted throughout the season in Europe\u2019s top competition, even against Manchester United and Fiorentina, and an Achilles heel that Goal.com\u2019s Ewan Macdonald pinpointed before the match. In the first instance, he beat Martin Demichelis in the air before playing a give-and-go with Wesley Sneijder and completed his brace when he left Daniel van Buyten for dead. 3) Motivation Of course both sides had their motivations, but in reality it may have propelled the Beneamata further than the Bavarians on the day. As Goal.com\u2019s Peter Staunton reports, Mourinho was motivated to defeat former mentor Louis van Gaal and win \u2018the war\u2019 with Italy.  The players were motivated by history \u2013 an Italian club\u2019s first-ever treble season and patron Massimo Moratti motivated to replicate his father\u2019s success.  Eto\u2019o determined to succeed somewhere other than Barcelona, Lucio resolute in overcoming the side that let him go, Sneijder unwavering in his goal to succeed at the Santiago Bernabeu, the list goes on...  4) Selfless Style Of Play It may not be the most pretty football to watch \u2013 Arsenal or Barcelona will offer you more of a spectacle \u2013 but the Nerazzurri proved they are the most effective in 2009-10 by working hard and diligently for one another.  Samuel Eto\u2019o is a true example, having given up his goalscoring instincts for a spot on the wing, Lucio and Walter Samuel threw their bodies on the line time and time again, Javier Zanetti dug deep to find the energy reserves to cover men and ground, and even Maicon curbed his attacking enthusiasm on Saturday evening.  5) Jose Mourinho Yes, you all knew this list would end with \u2018The Special One\u2019.  Tactically he was spot on once again \u2013 denying Bayern space in the attacking third, keeping their opportunities to a minimum, and of course ending their hopes \u2013 as he did to Chelsea, CSKA Moscow and former champions Barcelona.  Now on his way to Real Madrid, he leaves a legacy in Milan having won a historic treble that the fans will remember for years to come. His time in Serie A was anything but smooth, but in the end it was a boost for himself, the club and the country.",
