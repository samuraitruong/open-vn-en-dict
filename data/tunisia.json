The UNHCR says tens of thousands of people are stuck at the borders and in urgent need of help.  The U.N. refugee agency says the situation at the Libya-<em>Tunisia</em> border is chaotic. It says 14,000 people crossed the border Monday, the highest number to date.  The agency says it is crucial to move tens of thousands of people away from the overcrowded border to avoid a humanitarian crisis. But transportation is scarce.  UNHCR spokeswoman Melissa Fleming says the agency has erected 1,500 tents, which can shelter 12,000 people. And she says two airlifts planned for Thursday will deliver tents and supplies for up to 10,000 people. \u201cWe have now visited the border entry point to <em>Tunisia</em>. What is unfortunate is that thousands of people are waiting on the Libyan side of the border to enter. Some for as long as three days. They are obliged to spend the night outside in the bitter cold without shelter. We are very concerned that a large number of sub-Saharan Africans are not being allowed into <em>Tunisia</em> at this point. We are in negotiation with self-appointed volunteers from the local community who are guarding the border,\" she said. Fleming says nearly 70,000 people have crossed from Libya into Egypt since February 19. She says the majority are Egyptians.  She says the UNHCR is particularly worried about thousands of refugees and asylum-seekers stuck inside Libya. She says the refugees come mainly from Iraq, Palestine, Somalia, Sudan and Eritrea. She says they have been living in Libya for a long time but now are desperate to leave. Fleming reads a recent message sent by a refugee to UNHCR staff in Libya describing the fearful conditions under which he and his family are living. She says refugees and migrants from sub-Saharan Africa are particularly vulnerable. \u201cWe are under attack by local people who are saying that we are mercenaries killing people. Let me say that they did not want to see black people. There is racism. We need help. Please, please, please, where is the humanity? Where is the United Nations? I am crying. I need help. Our home was burnt down. Ten Somalis were killed in Libya in the last seven days. Why is nobody concerned about the Somali migrants in Libya? We are victims of racism and ruthless exploitation,\" she said. Fleming says the UNHCR offers assistance to those refugees who are able to reach its office in Tripoli. She says the agency\u2019s 24-hour hotline continues to receive desperate calls from refugees in Libya and their family members outside. She says they say they feel trapped, threatened and hunted.",

            "en": "Food crisis fears rise with commodities          Editor's Note: CNN International launched a year-long series, \"The Price We Pay,\" this week. CNN will examine in-depth the factors and direct impact of global price instability around the world. (CNN) -- In Shandong Province in northeastern China, the nation's grain heartland, the worst drought in 60 years has raised the specter of shortages for the world's largest wheat producer. Russia -- still reeling from a drought that slashed wheat harvest by nearly 40% and spur red Moscow to ban exports last summer -- hopes new, resilient strains of the crop will lead to a resumption of wheat exports. However, soil damaged by the drought means nearly 10% of Russian wheat fields couldn't be planted this year. Social media may have fanned the flames of revolt which toppled governments in <em>Tunisia</em> and Egypt and triggered demonstrations across the Middle East. But the tinderbox was built on high unemployment, corruption and rising food prices. It's a telling sign that the trouble in <em>Tunisia</em> started with the self immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi, a street vendor protesting the police seizure of his produce cart. \"I think that we have to be careful, as an international community, not to let food prices become not [only] a national security threat in countries, but a global security threat,\" Ngozi Iweala, managing director of the World Bank, told CNN. Rising food prices have driven nearly 44 million people into poverty since June, according to World Bank estimates released this week, pushing the number of chronically hungry toward 1 billion. Global food prices rose 29% in the past year due to weather shocks such as the Russian drought and subsequent export ban, as well as the growing appetite for biofuels and rising demand from emerging economies such as Brazil, India and China. Rising inflation is a top Chinese concern Price increases were led by sugar and wheat, at 20%. Fats and oils used in cooking rose 22%, according to the World Bank. \"Our research shows higher global wheat prices have directly fed into sharp increases in domestic wheat prices in many countries,\" Robert Zoellick, president of the World Bank, said earlier this week. \"In just six months, prices for wheat rose by more than 50% in Kyrgyzstan; 45% in Bangladesh and 33% in Mongolia.\" Rising food prices create political strife. Nations in northern Africa and the Middle East -- where arable land is scarce -- scour Eastern Europe and Central Asia for grain deals. When Rachid Rachid was Egypt's Trade and Industry Minister, he personally combed the world for wheat -- with visits to Russia and Central Asia -- attempting to meet the domestic demand of six million tons a year. \"The fact you know that you need this much quantity to feed the people in Egypt and knowing that there is not that much quantity around the world makes you really scared,\" Rachid told CNN.  The price of a kilogram of onions in India nearly doubled from September to December, resulting in an export ban that was lifted this week after Indian farmers protested and onion prices plummeted. Chinese food prices rose 10.3% in January, raising concerns about the economy overheating. In the U.S. consumer prices rose only 1.6% in January, but as CNNMoney reports prices for clothing, appliances and food are expected to rise as increasing demand from emerging economies hikes the cost of raw materials. \"This is something we need to really pay attention to, because it impacts the most vulnerable: children, women, pregnant women and it really hits the poor,\" said Iweala of the World Bank.",

He has kept his job but many allies of ousted President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali have left. Mr Ghannouchi said in a TV address that 12 ministers had been replaced. He insisted the government was \"transitional\" and would \"take the country to democracy\". Protests are continuing, demanding a purge of Mr Ben Ali's allies. On Wednesday, <em>Tunisia</em> issued an international arrest warrant for Mr Ben Ali, who fled to Saudi Arabia on 14 January. Mr Ben Ali is accused of illegally acquiring property and assets and transferring funds abroad during his presidency. Trade union endorsement  Mr Ghannouchi announced the cabinet overhaul late on Thursday, saying he had included very competent people in his new line-up. Among the key changes was the replacement of the defence, interior and finance ministers, who had all served under Mr Ben Ali. Earlier on Thursday, Foreign Minister Kamel Morjane announced his resignation, saying it was in the national interests of the country. The reshuffle was welcomed by the powerful UGTT trade union, although it said it would not be joining the new government. The endorsement by the UGTT may go some way towards softening opposition to Mr Ghannouchi among protesters, says the BBC's Magdi Abdelhadi in the capital Tunis.  But our correspondent adds that it is unclear whether the cabinet overhaul will be enough to calm widespread opposition to Mr Ghannouchi himself, who had served as prime minister under Mr Ben Ali for many years. Anti-government rallies continued on Thursday in Tunis and also in the central town of Sidi Bouzid. \"We reject Ghannouchi totally. We were surprised to see him announce the government,\" protester Mohammed Fadel in Tunis was quoted as saying by Reuters. \"Since he did not fight corruption under Ben Ali, he is an accomplice.\" On Wednesday, police in the capital fired tear gas at hundreds of demonstrators after they reportedly tried to breach barricades around the prime minister's office. Mr Ghannouchi has promised to quit \"in the shortest possible timeframe\", pledging to hold elections within six months http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12302232",

            "en": "Libya's Foreign Minister Resigns, Arrives in Britain        Libyan Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa has arrived in Britain and has declared he is leaving Moammar Gadhafi's government. The British foreign office said Wednesday that Koussa traveled from <em>Tunisia</em> to London under his own free will, telling officials he is resigning his post. British officials urged Mr. Gadhafi's other supporters to desert him as well. A Libyan government spokesman, Moussa Ibrahim, denied the foreign minister has defected, saying he is in Britain on a \"diplomatic mission.\" Libya's justice and interior ministers resigned early in the conflict and joined the rebels fighting in the east. U.S. officials called Koussa's resignation \"very significant,\" and an example of growing splits inside the Libyan government. The foreign minister has been a close confidant of Mr. Gadhafi and served as his intelligence chief for more than a decade. In Washington, the White House repeated that no decision has been made to provide arms to rebel forces in Libya. Wednesday's statement was issued amid reports that President Barack Obama has approved a secret authorization for covert efforts to support anti-government rebels. The New York Times reported that the CIA has put an unknown number of operatives into Libya to gather intelligence and make contact with anti-Gadhafi forces. The newspaper said the CIA declined comment on the report, which quoted what it called current and former British officials as saying British special forces and intelligence officers also are in the North African nation. Earlier Wednesday, troops loyal to Mr. Gadhafi drove anti-government rebels from key coastal cities they had seized days before, reversing opposition gains made since international airstrikes began. Libyan rebels retreated amid intense fighting around the strategic oil towns of Ras Lanuf and Brega. Many opposition fighters fell back to the city of Ajdabiya, from where residents were seen fleeing along the road toward the opposition stronghold of Benghazi. Pro-Gadhafi forces were shelling Brega and a rebel military spokesman said he expected the loyalists to enter the city by Wednesday night. The spokesman ((Colonel Ahmad Bani)) also said as many as 3,600 heavily armed members of the Chadian Republican Guard are now fighting alongside Gadhafi loyalists. He dismissed concerns that members of al-Qaida are fighting with the Libyan rebels. On Tuesday, U.S. Admiral James Stavridis told a congressional hearing that groups such as al-Qaida and the Lebanese Hezbollah militia have a small presence among the Libyan opposition. He also said the opposition leadership appeared to be \"responsible men and women\" fighting the Libyan government. A prominent U.S.-based rights group said Wednesday that Mr. Gadhafi's forces have laid land mines around Ajdabiya when the coastal city was under their control earlier this month. In a statement from the rebel stronghold of Benghazi, Human Rights Watch said a civil defense team found more than 50 anti-vehicle and anti-personnel mines in a heavily traveled area. A U.S. military spokesman said coalition airplanes resumed bombing pro-Gadhafi troops Wednesday, although the timing and location of those strikes was not specified.

            "en": "Teachers\u2019 Day           In some countries, Teachers' Days are intended to be special days for the appreciation of teachers. Some of them are holidays while others are celebrated during working days. A day that is dedicated to the hard work that is input by the teacher all year long, a day that is a complete tribute to the teachers all around India. In India teacher\u2019s day is celebrated on 5th of September. Teacher\u2019s Day is a dedication to Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, who was a staunch believer of education and was one of the most well known diplomat, scholar, president of India and above all a teacher. As a tribute to this great teacher, his birthday has been observed as teachers' day and this led to its origin.  This day is just a mere reflection of Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan's love for and attachment to the teaching profession. As a matter of fact Dr. Radhakrishnan himself asked his admirers to celebrate his birthday not as his birthday but as the teacher's day. His work varied on philosophical, theological, ethical, educational, social and cultural subjects. He contributed numerous articles to different well-known journals, which, are of immense value and seems to surprise various readers because of the depth in the meaning of the articles. Teacher's day is now one of the occasion that is looked forward by the teachers and students alike as on this occasion its not only when teachers are praised but also around various schools students dress up as a representation of their teachers and take various lectures that are assigned to the teachers they represent. On this day students realize what it means to be a teacher and what it means to control the future of several students in their classes and also teachers are reminded what it felt like when they were the students. Apart from the fun aspect everybody should pay their respects to the great Dr. Radhakrishnan. Since that day this event have become a regular event. Apart from the fun aspect of the day it is also a day when one can look back and admire and get inspired by Dr. Radhakrishnan, a small town cunning boy, who grew up to become one of the most respected politicians in the history of democracy of India. Teachers' Days Celebrated in Working Days India September 5 is Teacher's Day in India. It is the birthday of second President of India and teacher Dr. Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan. When Dr. Radhakrishnan became the president of India in 1962, some of his students and friends approached him and requested him to allow them to celebrate 5 September, his birthday. In reply, Dr. Radhakrishnan said, \"Instead of celebrating my birthday separately, it would be my proud privilege if September 5 is observed as \"Teachers Day\". This is not a holiday in India. It is considered a \"celebration\" day, where teachers and students report to school as usual but the usual activities and classes are replaced by activities of celebration, thanking and remembrance. At some schools on this day, the responsibility of teaching is taken up by the senior students as an appreciation for their teachers. Traditionally, people in India have given tremendous respect and honor to teachers. An old Indian saying (usually taught to children), ranks teacher in the third place, even before God: \"'Maata, Pitha, Guru, Daivam'\", meaning Mother, Father and Teacher is God.
