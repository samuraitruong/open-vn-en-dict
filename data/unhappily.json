            "en": "2-2songngu        2. STITCHES CARLISLE WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO STAYED calm. Centuries of\u00a0 experience in the emergency room were evident in his quiet, authoritative voice. \"Emmett, Rose, get Jasper outside.\" Unsmiling for once, Emmett nodded. \"Come on, Jasper.\" Jasper struggled against Emmett's unbreakable grasp, twisting around, reaching toward his brother with his bared teeth, his eyes still past reason. Edward's face was whiter than bone as he wheeled to crouch over me, taking a clearly defensive position. A low warning growl slid from between his clenched teeth. I could tell that he wasn't breathing. Rosalie, her divine face strangely smug, stepped in front of Jasper\u2014keeping a careful distance from his teeth\u2014and helped Emmett wrestle him through the glass door that Esme held open, one hand pressed over her mouth and nose. Esme's heart-shaped face was ashamed. \"I'm so sorry, Bella,\" she cried as she followed the others into the yard. \"Let me by, Edward,\" Carlisle murmured. A second passed, and then Edward nodded slowly and relaxed his stance. Carlisle knelt beside me, leaning close to examine my arm. I could feel the shock frozen on my face, and I tried to compose it. \"Here, Carlisle,\" Alice said, handing him a towel. He shook his head. \"Too much glass in the wound.\" He reached over and ripped a long, thin scrap from the bottom of the white tablecloth. He twisted it around my arm above the elbow to form a tourniquet. The smell of the blood was making me dizzy. My ears rang. \"Bella,\" Carlisle said softly. \"Do you want me to drive you to the hospital, or would you like me to take care of it here?\" \"Here, please,\" I whispered. If he took me to the hospital, there would be no way to keep this from Charlie. \"I'll get your bag,\" Alice said. \"Let's take her to the kitchen table,\" Carlisle said to Edward. Edward lifted me effortlessly, while Carlisle kept the pressure steady on my arm. \"How are you doing, Bella?\" Carlisle asked. \"I'm fine.\" My voice was reasonably steady, which pleased me. Edward's face was like stone. Alice was there. Carlisle's black bag was already on the table, a small but brilliant desk light plugged into the wall. Edward sat me gently into a chair, and Carlisle pulled up another. He went to work at once. Edward stood over me, still protective, still not breathing. \"Just go, Edward,\" I sighed. \"I can handle it,\" he insisted. But his jaw was rigid; his eyes burned with the intensity of the thirst he fought, so much worse for him than it was for the others. \"You don't need to be a hero,\" I said. \"Carlisle can fix me up without your help. Get some fresh air.\" I winced as Carlisle did something to my arm that stung. \"I'll stay,\" he said. \"Why are you so masochistic?\" I mumbled. Carlisle decided to intercede. \"Edward, you may as well go find Jasper before he gets too far. I'm sure he's upset with himself, and I doubt he'll listen to anyone but you right now.\" \"Yes,\" I eagerly agreed. \"Go find Jasper.\" \"You might as well do something useful,\" Alice added. Edward's eyes narrowed as we ganged up on him, but, finally, he nodded once and sprinted smoothly through the kitchen's back door. I was sure he hadn't taken a breath since I'd sliced my finger. A numb, dead feeling was spreading through my arm. Though it erased the sting, it reminded me of the gash, and I watched Carlisle's face carefully to distract me from what his hands were doing. His hair gleamed gold in the bright light as he bent over my arm. I could feel the faint stirrings of unease in the pit of my stomach, but I was determined not to let my usual squeamishness get the best of me. There was no pain now, just a gentle tugging sensation that I tried to ignore. No reason to get sick like a baby. If she hadn't been in my line of sight, I wouldn't have noticed Alice give up and steal out of the room. With a tiny, apologetic smile on her lips, she disappeared through the kitchen doorway. \"Well, that's everyone,\" I sighed. \"I can clear a room, at least.\" \"It's not your fault,\" Carlisle comforted me with a chuckle. \"It could happen to anyone.\" \"Could\" I repeated. \"But it usually just happens to me.\" He laughed again. His relaxed calm was only more amazing set in direct contrast with everyone else's reaction. I couldn't find any trace of anxiety in his face. He worked with quick, sure movements. The only sound besides our quiet breathing was the soft plink, plink as the tiny fragments of glass dropped one by one to the table. \"How can you do this?\" I demanded. \"Even Alice and Esme\u2026\" I trailed off, shaking my head in wonder. Though the rest of them had given up the traditional diet of vampires just as absolutely as Carlisle had, he was the only one who could bear the smell of my blood without suffering from the intense temptation. Clearly, this was much more difficult than he made it seem. \"Years and years of practice,\" he told me. \"I barely notice the scent anymore.\" \"Do you think it would be harder if you took a vacation from the hospital for a long time. And weren't around any blood?\" \"Maybe.\" He shrugged his shoulders, but his hands remained steady. \"I've never felt the need for an extended holiday.\" He flashed a brilliant smile in my direction. \"I enjoy my work too much.\" Plink, plink, plink. I was surprised at how much glass there seemed to be in my arm. I was tempted to glance at the growing pile, just to check the size, but I knew that idea would not be helpful to my no-vomiting strategy. \"What is it that you enjoy?\" I wondered. It didn't make sense to me\u2014the years of struggle and self-denial he must have spent to get to the point where he could endure this so easily. Besides, I wanted to keep him talking; the conversation kept my mind off the queasy feeling in my stomach. His dark eyes were calm and thoughtful as he answered. \"Hmm. What I enjoy the very most is when my\u2026 enhanced abilities let me save someone who would otherwise have been lost. It's pleasant knowing that, thanks to what I can do, some people's lives are better because I exist. Even the sense of smell is a useful diagnostic tool at times.\" One side of his mouth pulled up in half a smile. I mulled that over while he poked around, making sure all the glass splinters were gone. Then he rummaged in his bag for new tools, and I tried not to picture a needle and thread. \"You try very hard to make up for something that was never your fault,\" I suggested while a new kind of tugging started at the edges of my skin. \"What I mean is, it's not like you asked for this. You didn't choose this kind of life, and yet you have to work so hard to be good.\" \"I don't know that I'm making up for anything,\" he disagreed lightly. \"Like everything in life, I just had to decide what to do with what I was given.\" \"That makes it sound too easy.\" He examined my arm again. \"There,\" he said, snipping a thread. \"All done.\" He wiped an oversized Q-tip, dripping with some syrup-colored liquid, thoroughly across the operation site. The smell was strange; it made my head spin. The syrup stained my skin. \"In the beginning, though,\" I pressed while he taped another long piece of gauze securely in place, sealing it to my skin. \"Why did you even think to try a different way than the obvious one?\" His lips turned up in a private smile. \"Hasn't Edward told you this story?\" \"Yes. But I'm trying to understand what you were thinking\u2026\" His face was suddenly serious again, and I wondered if his thoughts had gone to the same place that mine had. Wondering what I would be thinking when\u2014I refused to think if\u2014it was me. n\u1ebfu \"You know my father was a clergyman,\" he mused as he cleaned the table carefully, rubbing everything down with wet gauze, and then doing it again. The smell of alcohol burned in my nose. \"He had a rather harsh view of the world, which I was already beginning to question before the time that I changed.\" Carlisle put all the dirty gauze and the glass slivers into an empty crystal bowl. I didn't understand what he was doing, even when he lit the match. Then he threw it onto the alcohol-soaked fibers, and the sudden blaze made me jump. \"Sorry,\" he apologized. \"That ought to do it\u2026 So I didn't agree with my father's particular brand of faith. But never, in the nearly four hundred years now since I was born, have I ever seen anything to make me doubt whether God exists in some form or the other. Not even the reflection in the mirror.\" I pretended to examine the dressing on my arm to hide my surprise at the direction our conversation had taken. Religion was the last thing I expected, all things considered. My own life was fairly devoid of belief. Charlie considered himself a Lutheran, because that's what his parents had been, but Sundays he worshipped by the river with a fishing pole in his hand. Renee tried out a church now and then, but, much like her brief affairs with tennis, pottery, yoga, and French classes, she moved on by the time I was aware of her newest fad.  \"I'm sure all this sounds a little bizarre, coming from a vampire.\" He grinned, knowing how their casual use of that word never failed to shock me. \"But I'm hoping that there is still a point to this life, even for us.\u00a0 It's a long shot, I'll admit,\" he continued in an offhand voice. \"By all accounts, we're damned regardless. But I hope, maybe foolishly, that we'll get some measure of credit for trying.\" \"I don't think that's foolish,\" I mumbled. I couldn't imagine anyone, deity included, who wouldn't be impressed by Carlisle. Besides, the only kind of heaven I could appreciate would have to include Edward. \"And I don't think anyone else would, either.\" \"Actually, you're the very first one to agree with me.\" \"The rest of them don't feel the same?\" I asked, surprised, thinking of only one person in particular. Carlisle guessed the direction of my thoughts again. \"Edward's with me up to a point. God and heaven exist\u2026 and so does hell. But he doesn't believe there is an afterlife for our kind.\" Carlisle's voice was very soft; he stared out the big window over the sink, into the darkness. \"You see, he thinks we've lost our souls.\" I immediately thought of Edward's words this afternoon: unless you want to die\u2014or whatever it is that we do. The light bulb flicked on over my head. \"That's the real problem, isn't it?\" I guessed. \"That's why he's being so difficult about me.\" \u00a0Carlisle spoke slowly. \"I look at my\u2026 son. His strength, his goodness, the brightness that shines out of him\u2014and it only fuels that hope, that faith, more than ever. How could there not be more for one such as Edward?\" I nodded in fervent agreement. \"But if I believed as he does\u2026\" He looked down at me with unfathomable eyes. \"If you believed as he did. Could you take away his soul?\" The way he phrased the question thwarted my answer. If he'd asked me whether I would risk my soul for Edward, the reply would be obvious. But would I risk Edward's soul? I pursed my lips <em>unhappily</em>. That wasn't a fair exchange. \"You see the problem.\" I shook my head, aware of the stubborn set of my chin. Carlisle sighed. \"It's my choice,\" I insisted. \"It's his, too.\" He held up his hand when he could see that I was about to argue. \"Whether he is responsible for doing that to you.\" \"He's not the only one able to do it.\" I eyed Carlisle speculatively. He laughed, abruptly lightening the mood. \"Oh, no! You're going to have to work this out with him.\" But then he sighed. \"That's the one part I can never be sure of. I think, in most other ways, that I've done the best I could with what I had to work with. But was it right to doom the others to this life? I can't decide.\" I didn't answer. I imagined what my life would be like if Carlisle had resisted the temptation to change his lonely existence\u2026 and shuddered. \"It was Edward's mother who made up my mind.\" Carlisle's voice was almost a whisper. He stared unseeingly out the black windows. \"His mother?\" Whenever I'd asked Edward about his parents, he would merely say that they had died long ago, and his memories were vague. I realized Carlisle's memory of them, despite the brevity of their contact, would be perfectly clear. \"Yes. Her name was Elizabeth. Elizabeth Masen. His father, Edward Senior, never regained consciousness in the hospital. He died in the first wave of the influenza. But Elizabeth was alert until almost the very end. Edward looks a great deal like her\u2014she had that same strange bronze shade to her hair, and her eyes were exactly the same color green.\" \"His eyes were green?\" I murmured, trying to picture it. \"Yes\u2026\" Carlisle's ocher eyes were a hundred years away now. \"Elizabeth worried obsessively over her son. She hurt her own chances of survival trying to nurse him from her sickbed. I expected that he would go first, he was so much worse off than she was. When the end came for her, it was very quick. It was just after sunset, and I'd arrived to relieve the doctors who'd been working all day. That was a hard time to pretend\u2014there was so much work to be done, and I had no need of rest. How I hated to go back to my house, to hide in the dark and pretend to sleep while so many were dying. \"I went to check Elizabeth and her son first. I'd grown attached\u2014always a dangerous thing to do considering the fragile nature of humans. I could see at once that she'd taken a bad turn. The fever was raging out of control, and her body was too weak to fight anymore. She didn't look weak, though, when she glared up at me from her cot. \"Save him!' she commanded me in the hoarse voice that was all her throat could manage. \"I'll do everything in my power,' I promised her, taking her hand. The fever was so high, she probably couldn't even tell how unnaturally cold mine felt. Everything felt cold to her skin. \"You must,\" she insisted, clutching at my hand with enough strength that I wondered if she wouldn't pull through the crisis after all. Her eyes were hard, like stones, like emeralds. 'You must do everything in your power. What others cannot do, that is what you must do for my Edward.\" \"It frightened me. She looked it me with those piercing eyes, and, for one instant, I felt certain that she knew my secret. Then the fever overwhelmed her, and she never regained consciousness. She died within an hour of making her demand. \"I'd spent decades considering the idea of creating a companion for myself. Just one other creature who could really know me, rather than what I pretended to be. But I could never justify it to myself\u2014doing what had been done to me. \"There Edward lay, dying. It was clear that he had only hours left. Beside him, his mother, her face somehow not yet peaceful, not even in death.\" Carlisle saw it all again, his memory unburned by the intervening century. I could see it clearly, too, as he spoke\u2014the despair of the hospital, the overwhelming atmosphere of death. Edward burning with fever, his life slipping away with each tick of the clock\u2026 I shuddered again, and forced the picture from my mind. \"Elizabeth's words echoed in my head. How could she guess what I could do? Could anyone really want that for her son? \"I looked at Edward. Sick as he was, he was still beautiful. There was something pure and good about his face. The kind of face I would have wanted my son to have. \"After all those years of indecision, I simply acted on a whim. I wheeled his mother to the morgue first, and then I came back for him. No one noticed that he was still breathing. There weren't enough hands, enough eyes, to keep track of half of what the patients needed. The morgue was empty\u2014of the living, at least. I stole him out the back door, and carried him across the rooftops back to my home. \"I wasn't sure what had to be done. I settled for recreating the wounds I'd received myself, so many centuries earlier in London. I felt bad about that later. It was more painful and lingering than necessary. \"I wasn't sorry, though. I've never been sorry that I saved Edward.\" He shook his head, coming back to the present. He smiled at me. \"I suppose I should take you home now.\" \"I'll do that,\" Edward said. He came through the shadowy dining room, walking slowly for him. His face was smooth, unreadable, but there was something wrong with his eyes\u2014something he was trying very hard to hide. I felt a spasm of unease in my stomach. \"Carlisle can take me,\" I said. I looked down at my shirt; the light blue cotton was soaked and spotted with my blood. My right shoulder was covered in thick pink frosting. \"I'm fine.\" Edward's voice was unemotional. \"You'll need to change anyway. You'd give Charlie a heart attack the way you look. I'll have Alice get you something.\" He strode out the kitchen door again. I looked at Carlisle anxiously. \"He's very upset.\" \"Yes,\" Carlisle agreed. \"Tonight is exactly the kind of thing that he fears the most. You being put in danger, because of what we are.\" \"It's not his fault.\" \"It's not yours, either.\" I looked away from his wise, beautiful eyes. I couldn't agree with that. Carlisle offered me his hand and helped me up from the table. I followed him out into the main room. Esme had come back; she was mopping the floor where I'd fallen\u2014with straight bleach from the smell of it. \"Esme, let me do that.\" I could feel that my face was bright red again. \"I'm already done.\" She smiled up at me. \"How do you feel?\" \"I'm fine,\" I assured her. \"Carlisle sews faster than any other doctor I've had.\" They both chuckled. Alice and Edward came in the back doors. Alice hurried to my side, but Edward hung back, his face indecipherable. \"C'mon,\" Alice said. \"I'll get you something less macabre to wear.\" She found me a shirt of Esme's that was close to the same color mine had been. Charlie wouldn't notice, I was sure. The long white bandage on my arm didn't look nearly as serious when I was no longer spattered in gore. Charlie was never surprised to see me bandaged. \"Alice,\" I whispered as she headed back to the door. \"Yes?\" She kept her voice low, too, and looked at me curiously, her head cocked to the side. \"How bad is it?\" I couldn't be sure if my whispering was a wasted effort. Even though we were upstairs, with the door closed, perhaps he could hear me. Her face tensed. \"I'm not sure yet.\" \"How's Jasper?\" She sighed. \"He's very unhappy with himself. It's all so much more of challenge for him, and he hates feeling weak.\" \"It's not his fault. You'll tell him that I'm not mad at him, not at all, won't you?\" \"Of course.\" Edward was waiting for me by the front door. As I got to the bottom of the staircase, he held it open without a word. \"Take your things!\" Alice cried as I walked warily toward Edward. She scooped up the two packages, one half-opened, and my camera from under the piano, and pressed them into my good arm. \"You can thank me later, when you've opened them.\" Esme and Carlisle both said a quiet goodnight. I could see them stealing quick glances at their impassive son, much like I was. It was a relief to be outside; I hurried past the lanterns and the roses, now unwelcome reminders.  Edward kept pace with me silently. He opened the passenger side for me, and I climbed in without complaint. On the dashboard was a big red ribbon, stuck to the new stereo. I pulled it off, throwing it to the floor. As Edward slid into the other side, I kicked the ribbon under my seat. He didn't look at me or the stereo. Neither of us switched it on, and the silence was somehow intensified by the sudden thunder of the engine. He drove too fast down the dark, serpentine lane. The silence was making me insane. \"Say something,\" I finally begged as he turned onto the freeway. \"What do you want me to say?\" he asked in a detached voice. I cringed at his remoteness. 'Tell me you forgive me.\" That brought a flicker of life to his face\u2014a flicker of anger. \"Forgive you? For what?\" \"If I'd been more careful, nothing would have happened.\" \"Bella, you gave yourself a paper cut\u2014that hardly deserves the death penalty.\" \"It's still my fault.\" My words opened up the floodgate. \"Your fault? If you'd cut yourself at Mike Newton's house, with Jessica there and Angela and your other normal friends, the worst that could possibly have happened would be what? Maybe they couldn't find you a bandage? If you'd tripped and knocked over a pile of glass plates on your own\u2014without someone throwing you into them\u2014even then, what's the worst? You'd get blood on the seats when they drove you to the emergency room? Mike Newton could have held your hand while they stitched you up\u2014and he wouldn't be righting the urge to kill you the whole time he was there. Don't try to take any of this on yourself, Bella. It will only make me more disgusted with myself.\" \"How the hell did Mike Newton end up in this conversation?\" I demanded. \"Mike Newton ended up in this conversation because Mike Newton would be a hell of a lot healthier for you to be with,\" he growled. \"I'd rather die than be with Mike Newton,\" I protested. \"I'd rather die than be with anyone but you.\" \"Don't be melodramatic, please.\" \"Well then, don't you be ridiculous.\" He didn't answer. He glared through the windshield, his expression black. I racked my brain for some way to salvage the evening. When we pulled up in front of my house, I still hadn't come up with anything. He killed the engine, but his hands stayed clenched around the steering wheel. \"Will you stay tonight?\" I asked. \"I should go home.\" The last thing I wanted was for him to go wallow in remorse. \"For my birthday,\" I pressed. \"You can't have it both ways\u2014either you want people to ignore your birthday or you don't. One or the other.\" His voice was stern, but not as serious as before. I breathed a silent sigh of relief. \"Okay. I've decided that I don't want you to ignore my birthday. I'll see you upstairs.\" I hopped out, reaching back in for my packages. He frowned. \"You don't have to take those.\" \"I want them,\" I responded automatically, and then wondered if he was using reverse psychology. \"No, you don't. Carlisle and Esme spent money on you.\" \"I'll live.\" I tucked the presents awkwardly under my good arm and slammed the door behind me. He was out of the truck and by my side in less than a second. \"Let me carry them, at least.\" he said as he took them away. \"I'll be in your room.\" I smiled. \"Thanks.\" \"Happy birthday,\" he sighed, and leaned down to touch his lips to mine. I reached up on my toes to make the kiss last longer when he pulled away. He smiled my favorite crooked smile, and then he disappeared into the darkness. The game was still on; as soon as I walked through the front door I could hear the announcer rambling over the babble of the crowd. \"Bell?\" Charlie called. \"Hey, Dad,\" I said as I came around the corner. I held my arm close to my side. The slight pressure burned, and I wrinkled my nose. The anesthetic was apparently losing its effectiveness. \"How was it?\" Charlie lounged across the sofa with his bare feet propped up on the arm.  What was left of his curly brown hair was crushed flat on one side. \"Alice went overboard. Flowers, cake, candles, presents\u2014the whole bit.\" \"What did they get you?\" \"A stereo for my truck.\" And various unknowns. \"Wow.\" \"Yeah,\" I agreed. \"Well, I'm calling it a night.\" \"I'll see you in the morning.\" I waved. \"See ya.\" \"What happened to your arm?\" I flushed and cursed silently. \"I tripped. It's nothing.\" \"Bella,\" he sighed, shaking his head. \"Goodnight, Dad.\" I hurried up to the bathroom, where I kept my pajamas for just such nights as these. I shrugged into the matching tank top and cotton pants that I'd gotten to replace the holey sweats I used to wear to bed, wincing as the movement pulled at the stitches. I washed my face one-handed, brushed my teeth, and then skipped to my room. He was sitting in the center of my bed, toying idly with one of the silver boxes. \"Hi,\" he said. His voice was sad. He was wallowing. I went to the bed, pushed the presents out of his hands, and climbed into his lap. \"Hi.\" I snuggled into his stone chest. \"Can I open my presents now?\" \"Where did the enthusiasm come from?\" he wondered. \"You made me curious.\" I picked up the long flat rectangle that must have been from Carlisle and Esme. \"Allow me,\" he suggested. He took the gift from my hand and tore the silver paper off with one fluid movement. He handed the rectangular white box back to me. \"Are you sure I can handle lifting the lid?\" I muttered, but he ignored me. Inside the box was a long thick piece of paper with an overwhelming amount of fine print. It took me a minute to get the gist of the information. \"We're going to Jacksonville?\" And I was excited, in spite of myself. It was a voucher for plane tickets, for both me and Edward. \"That's the idea.\" \"I can't believe it. Renee is going to flip! You don't mind, though, do you? It's sunny, you'll have to stay inside all day.\" \"I think I can handle it,\" he said, and then frowned. \"If I'd had any idea that you could respond to a gift this appropriately, I would have made you open it in front of Carlisle and Esme. I thought you'd complain.\" \"Well, of course it's too much. But I get to take you with me!\" He chuckled. \"Now I wish I'd spent money on your present. I didn't realize that you were capable of being reasonable.\" I set the tickets aside and reached for his present, my curiosity rekindled. He took it from me and unwrapped it like the first one. He handed back a clear CD jewel case, with a blank silver CD inside. \"What is it?\" I asked, perplexed. He didn't say anything; he took the CD and reached around me to put it in the CD player on the bedside table. He hit play, and we waited in silence. Then the music began. I listened, speechless and wide-eyed. I knew he was waiting for my reaction, but I couldn't talk. Tears welled up, and I reached up to wipe them away before they could spill over. \"Does your arm hurt?\" he asked anxiously. \"No, it's not my arm. It's beautiful, Edward. You couldn't have given me anything I would love more. I can't believe it.\" I shut up, so I could listen. It was his music, his compositions. The first piece on the CD was my lullaby. \"I didn't think you would let me get a piano so I could play for you here,\" he explained. \"You're right.\" \"How does your arm feel?\" \"Just fine.\" Actually, it was starting to blaze under the bandage. I wanted ice. I would have settled for his hand, but that would have given me away. \"I'll get you some Tylenol.\" \"I don't need anything,\" I protested, but he slid me off his lap and headed for the door. \"Charlie,\" I hissed. Charlie wasn't exactly aware that Edward frequently stayed over. In fact, he would have a stroke if that fact were brought to his attention. But I didn't feel too guilty for deceiving him.\u00a0\u00a0  It wasn't as if we were up to anything he wouldn't want me to be up to. Edward and his rules\u2026 \"He won't catch me,\" Edward promised as he disappeared silently out the door . . and returned, catching the door before it had swung back to touch the frame. He had the glass from the bathroom and the bottle of pills in one hand. I took the pills he handed me without arguing\u2014I knew I would lose the argument And my arm really was starting to bother me. My lullaby continued, soft and lovely, in the background. \"It's late,\" Edward noted. He scooped me up off the bed with one arm, and pulled the cover back with the other. He put me down with my head on my pillow and tucked the quilt around me. He lay down next to me\u2014on top of the blanket so I wouldn't get chilled\u2014and put his arm over me. I leaned my head against his shoulder and sighed happily. \"Thanks again,\" I whispered. \"You're welcome.\" It was quiet for a long moment as I listened to my lullaby drift to a close. Another song began. I recognized Esme's favorite. \"What are you thinking about?'\" I wondered in a whisper. He hesitated for a second before he told me. \"I was thinking about right and wrong, actually.\" I felt a chill tingle along my spine. \"Remember how I decided that I wanted you to not ignore my birthday?\" I asked quickly, hoping it wasn't too clear that I was trying to distract him. \"Yes,\" he agreed, wary. \"Well, I was thinking, since it's still my birthday, that I'd like you to kiss me again.\" \"You're greedy tonight.\" \"Yes, I am\u2014but please, don't do anything you don't want to do,\" I added, piqued. He laughed, and then sighed. \"Heaven forbid that I should do anything I don't want to do,\" he said in a strangely desperate tone as he put his hand under my chin and pulled my face up to his. The kiss began much the same as usual\u2014Edward was as careful as ever, and my heart began to overreact like it always did. And then something seemed to change. Suddenly his lips became much more urgent, his free hand twisted into my hair and held my face securely to his. And, though my hands tangled in his hair, too, and though I was clearly beginning to cross his cautious lines, for once he didn't stop me. His body was cold through the thin quilt, but I crushed myself against him eagerly. When he stopped it was abrupt; he pushed me away with gentle, firm hands. I collapsed back onto my pillow, gasping, my head spinning. Something tugged at my memory, elusive, on the edges. \"Sorry,\" he said, and he was breathless, too. \"That was out of line.\" \"I don't mind,\" I panted. He frowned at me in the darkness. \"Try to sleep. Bella.\" \"No, I want you to kiss me again.\" \"You're overestimating my self-control.\" \"Which is tempting you more, my blood or my body?\" I challenged. \"It's a tie.\" He grinned briefly in spite of himself, and then was serious again. \"Now. why don't you stop pushing your luck and go to sleep?\" \"Fine,\" I agreed, snuggling closer to him. I really did feel exhausted. It had been a long day in so many ways, yet I felt no sense of relief at its end. Almost as if something worse was coming tomorrow. It was a silly premonition\u2014what could be worse than today?' Just the shock catching up with me, no doubt. Trying to be sneaky about it, I pressed my injured arm against his shoulder, so his cool skin would sooth the burning. It felt better at once. I was halfway asleep, maybe more, when I realized what his kiss had reminded me of: last spring, when he'd had to leave me to throw James off my trail, Edward had kissed me goodbye, not knowing when\u2014or if\u2014we would see each other again. This kiss had the same almost painful edge for some reason I couldn't imagine. I shuddered into unconsciousness, as if I were already having a nightmare.",

            "en": "7 REPETITION         3. The truth I had the sense that i'd been asleep for a very long time\u2014my body was stiff, like i hadn't moved once through all that time, either. My mind was dazed and slow; strange, colorful dreams\u2014dreams and nightmares\u2014swirled dizzily around the inside of my head. They were so vivid. The horrible and the heavenly, all mixed together into a bizarre jumble. There was sharp impatience and fear, both part of that frustrating dream where your feet can't move fast enough\u2026 and there were plenty of monsters, red-eyed fiends that were all the more ghastly for their genteel civility. The dream was still strong\u2014i could even remember the names. But the strongest, clearest part of the dream was not the horror. It was the angel that was most clear. It was hard to let him go and wake up. This dream did not want to be shoved away into the vault of dreams I refused to revisit. I struggled with it as my mind became more alert, focusing on reality. I couldn't remember what day of the week it was, but I was sure Jacob or school or work or something was waiting for me. I inhaled deeply, wondering how to face another day. Something cold touched my forehead with the softest pressure. I squeezed my eyes more tightly shut. I was still dreaming, it seemed, and it felt \u00a0abnormally real. I was so close to waking\u2026 any second now, and it would be gone. But I realized that it felt too real, too real to be good for me. The stone arms I imagined wrapped around me were far too substantial. If I let this go any further, I'd be sorry for it later. With a resigned sigh, I wrenched back my eyelids to dispel the illusion. \"Oh!\" I gasped, and threw my fists over my eyes. Well, clearly, I'd gone too far; it must have been a mistake to let my imagination get so out of hand. Okay, so \"let\" was the wrong word. I'd forced it to get out of hand\u2014pretty much stalked my hallucinations\u2014and now my mind had snapped. It took less than half a second for me to realize that, as long as I was truly insane now, I might as well enjoy the delusions while they were pleasant. I opened my eyes again\u2014and Edward was still there, his perfect face just inches away from mine. \"Did I frighten you?\" His low voice was anxious. This was very good, as delusions went. The face, the voice, the scent, everything\u2014it was so much better than drowning. The beautiful figment of my imagination watched my changing expressions, with alarm. His irises were pitch-black, with bruise-like shadows under them. This surprised me; my hallucinatory Edwards were usually better fed. I blinked twice, desperately trying to remember the last thing that I was sure was real. Alice was part of my dream, and I wondered if she had really come back at all, or if that was just the preamble. I thought she'd returned the day I'd nearly drowned\u2026 \"Oh, crap\" I croaked. My throat was thick with sleeping. \"What's wrong, Bella?\" I frowned at him <em>unhappily</em>. His face was even more anxious than before. \"I'm dead, right?\" I moaned. \"I did drown. Crap, crap, crap! This is gonna kill Charlie.\" Edward frowned, too. \"You're not dead.\" \"Then why am I not waking up?\" I challenged, raising my eyebrows. \"You are awake, Bella.\" I shook my head. \"Sure, sure. That's what you want me to think. And then it will be worse when I do wake up. If I wake up, which I won't, because I'm dead. This is awful. Poor Charlie. And Renee and Jake\u2026\" I trailed off in horror at what I had done. \"I can see where you might confuse me with a nightmare.\" His short-lived smile was grim. \"But I can't imagine what you could have done to wind up in hell. Did you commit many murders while I was away?\" I grimaced. \"Obviously not. If I was in hell, you wouldn't be with me.\" He sighed. My head was getting clearer. My eyes flickered away from his face\u2014unwillingly\u2014for one second, to the dark, open window, and then back to him. I started to remember details\u2026 and I felt a faint, unfamiliar blush warm the skin over my cheekbones as I slowly realized that Edward was really, truly here with me, and I was wasting time being an idiot. \"Did all of that really happen, then?\" It was almost impossible to reassign my dream as reality. I couldn't wrap my head around the concept. \"That depends.\" Edward's smile was still hard. \"If you're referring to us nearly being massacred in Italy, then, yes.\" \"How strange,\" I mused. \"I really went to Italy. Did you know I'd never been farther east than Albuquerque?\" He rolled his eyes. \"Maybe you should go back to sleep. You're not coherent.\" \"I'm not tired anymore.\" It was all coming clear now. \"What time is it? How long have I been sleeping?\" \"It's just after one in the morning. So, about fourteen hours.\" I stretched as he spoke. I was so stiff. \"Charlie?\" I asked. Edward frowned. \"Sleeping. You should probably know that I'm breaking the rules right now. Well, not technically, since he said I was never to walk through his door again, and I came in the window\u2026 But, still, the intent was clear.\" \"Charlie banned you from the house?\" I asked, disbelief quickly melting into fury. His eyes were sad. \"Did you expect anything else?\" My eyes were mad. I was going to have a few words with my father\u2014perhaps it would be a good time to remind him that I was over the legal age of adulthood. It didn't matter so much, of course, except in principle. All too soon there would be no reason for the prohibition. I turned my thoughts to less painful avenues. \"What's the story?\" I asked, genuinely curious, but also trying desperately to keep the conversation casual, to keep a firm grip on myself, so I wouldn't scare him away with the frantic, gnawing craving that was raging inside me. \"What do you mean?\" \"What am I telling Charlie? What's my excuse for disappearing for\u2026 how long was I gone, anyway?\" I tried to count the hours in my head. \"Just three days.\" His eyes tightened, but he smiled more naturally this time. \"Actually, I was hoping you might have a good explanation. I've got nothing.\" I groaned. \"Fabulous.\" \"Well, maybe Alice will come up with something,\" he offered, trying to comfort me. And I was comforted. Who cared what I had to deal with later? Every second that he was here\u2014so close, his flawless face glowing in the dim light from the numbers on my alarm clock\u2014was precious and not to be wasted. \"So,\" I began, picking the least important\u2014though still vitally interesting\u2014question to start with. I was safely delivered home, and he might decide to leave at any moment. I had to keep him talking. Besides, this temporary heaven wasn't entirely complete without the sound of his voice. \"What have you been doing, up until three days ago?\" His face turned wary in an instant. \"Nothing terribly exciting.\" \"Of course not,\" I mumbled. \"Why are you making that face?\" \"Well\u2026\" I pursed my lips, considering. \"If you were, after all, just a dream, that's exactly the kind of thing you would say. My imagination must be used up.\" He sighed. \"If I tell you, will you finally believe that you're not having a nightmare?\" \"Nightmare!\" I repeated scornfully. He waited for my answer. \"Maybe,\" I said after a second of thought. \"If you tell me.\" \"I was\u2026 hunting.\" \"Is that the best you can do?\" I criticized. \"That definitely doesn't prove I'm awake.\" He hesitated, and then spoke slowly, choosing his words with care. \"I wasn't hunting for food\u2026 I was actually trying my hand at\u2026 tracking. I'm not very good at it.\" \"What were you tracking?\" I asked, intrigued. \"Nothing of consequence.\" His words didn't match his expression; he looked upset, uncomfortable. \"I don't understand.\" He hesitated; his face, shining with an odd green cast from the light of the clock, was torn. \"I\u2014\" He took a deep breath. \"I owe you an apology. No, of course I owe you much, \u00a0much more than that. But you have to know,\"\u2014the words began to flow so fast, the way I remembered he spoke sometimes when he was agitated, that I really had to concentrate to catch them all\u2014\"that I had no idea. I didn't realize the mess I was leaving behind. I thought it was safe for you here. So safe. I had no idea that Victoria,\"\u2014his lips curled back when he said the name\u2014\"would come back. I'll admit, when I saw her that one time, I was paying much more attention to James's thoughts. But I just didn't see that she had this kind of response in her. That she even had such a tie to him. I think I realize why now\u2014she was so sure of him, the thought of him failing never occurred to her. It was her overconfidence that clouded her feelings about him\u2014that kept me from seeing the depth of them, the bond there. \"Not that there's any excuse for what I left you to face. When I heard what you told Alice\u2014what she saw herself\u2014when I realized that you had to put your life in the hands of werewolves, immature, volatile, the worst thing out there besides Victoria herself\u2014he shuddered and the gush of words halted for a short second. \"Please know that I had no idea of any of this. I feel sick, sick to my core, even now, when I can see and feel you safe in my arms. I am the most miserable excuse for\u2014\" \"Stop,\" I interrupted him. He stared at me with agonized eyes, and I tried to find the right words\u2014the words that would free him from this imagined obligation that caused him so much pain. They were very hard words to say. I didn't know if I could get them out without breaking down. But I had to try to do it right. I didn't want to be a source of guilt and anguish in his life. He should be happy, no matter what it cost me. I'd really been hoping to put off this part of our last conversation. It was going to bring things to an end so much sooner. Drawing on all my months of practice with trying to be normal for Charlie, I kept my face smooth.  \"Edward,\" I said. His name burned my throat a little on the way out. I could feel the ghost of the hole, waiting to rip itself wide again as soon as he disappeared. I didn't quite see how I was going to survive it this time. \"This has to stop now. You can't think about things that way. You can't let this\u2026 this guilt\u2026 rule your life. You can't take responsibility for the things that happen to me here. None of it is your fault, it's just part of how life is for me. So, if I trip in front of a bus or whatever it is next time, you have to realize that it's not your job to take the blame. You can't just go running off to Italy \u00a0because you feel bad that you didn't save me. Even if I had jumped off that cliff to die, that would have been my choice, and not your fault. I know it's your\u2026 your nature to shoulder the blame for everything, but you really can't let that make you go to such extremes! It's very irresponsible\u2014think of Esme and Carlisle and\u2014\" I was on the edge of losing it. I stopped to take a deep breath, hoping to calm myself. I had to set him free. I had to make sure this never happened again. \"Isabella Marie Swan,\" he whispered, the strangest expression crossing his face. He almost looked mad. \"Do you believe that I asked the Volturi to kill me because I felt guilty?\" I could feel the blank incomprehension on my face. \"Didn't you?\" \"Feel guilty? Intensely so. More than you can comprehend.\" \"Then\u2026 what are you saying? I don't understand.\" \"Bella, I went to the Volturi because I thought you were dead,\" he said, voice soft, eyes fierce. \"Even if I'd had no hand in your death\"\u2014he shuddered as he whispered the last word\u2014\"even if it wasn't my fault, I would have gone to Italy. Obviously, I should have been more careful\u2014I should have spoken to Alice directly, rather than accepting it secondhand from Rosalie. But, really, what was I supposed to think when the boy said Charlie was at the funeral? What are the odds? \"The odds\u2026\" he muttered then, distracted. His voice was so low I wasn't sure I heard it right. \"The odds are always stacked against us. Mistake after mistake. I'll never criticize Romeo again.\" \"But I still don't understand,\" I said. \"That's my whole point. So what?\" \"Excuse me?\" \"So what if I was dead?\" He stared at me dubiously for a long moment before answering. \"Don't you remember anything I told you before?\" \"I remember everything that you told me.\" Including the words that had negated all the rest. He brushed the tip of his cool finger against my lower lip. \"Bella, you seem to be under a misapprehension.\" He closed his eyes, shaking his head back and forth with half a smile on his beautiful face. It wasn't a happy smile. \"I thought I'd explained it clearly before. Bella, I can't live in a world where you don't exist.\" \"I am\u2026\" My head swam as I looked for the appropriate word. \"Confused.\" That worked. I couldn't make sense of what he was saying. He stared deep into my eyes with his sincere, earnest gaze. \"I'm a good liar, Bella, I have to be.\" I froze, my muscles locking down as if for impact. The fault line in my chest rippled; the pain of it took my breath away. He shook my shoulder, trying to loosen my rigid pose. \"Let me finish! I'm a good liar, but still, for you to believe me so quickly.\" He winced. \"That was\u2026 excruciating.\" I waited, still frozen. \"When we were in the forest, when I was telling you goodbye\u2014\" I didn't allow myself to remember. I fought to keep myself in the present second only. \"You weren't going to let go,\" he whispered. \"I could see that. I didn't want to do it\u2014it felt like it would kill me to do it\u2014but I knew that if I couldn't convince you that I didn't love you anymore, it would just take you that much longer to get on with your life. I hoped that, if you thought I'd moved on, so would you.\" \"A clean break,\" I whispered through unmoving lips. \"Exactly. But I never imagined it would be so easy to do! I thought it would be next to impossible\u2014that you would be so sure of the truth that I would have to lie through my teeth for hours to even plant the seed of doubt in your head. I lied, and I'm so sorry\u2014sorry because I hurt you, sorry because it was a worthless effort. Sorry that I couldn't protect you from what I an. I lied to save you, and it didn't work. I'm sorry. \"But how could you believe me? After all the thousand times I've told you I love you, how could you let one word break your faith in me?\" I didn't answer. I was too shocked to form a rational response. \"I could see it in your eyes, that you honestly believed that I didn't want you anymore. The most absurd, ridiculous concept\u2014as if there were any way that I could exist without needing you!\" I was still frozen. His words were incomprehensible, because they were impossible. He shook my shoulder again, not hard, but enough that my teeth rattled a little. \"Bella,\" he sighed. \"Really, what were you thinking!\" And so I started to cry. The tears welled up and then gushed miserably down my cheeks. \"I knew it,\" I sobbed. \"I knew I was dreaming.\" \"You're impossible,\" he said, and he laughed once\u2014a hard laugh, frustrated. \"How can I put this so that you'll believe me? You're not asleep, and you're not dead. I'm here, and I love you. I have always loved you, and I will always love you. I was thinking of you, seeing your face in my mind, every second that I was away. When I told you that I didn't want you, it was the very blackest kind of blasphemy.\" I shook my head while the tears continued to ooze from the corners of my eyes. \"You don't believe me, do you?\" he whispered, his face paler than his usual pale\u2014I could see that even in the dim light. \"Why can you believe the lie, but not the truth?\" \"It never made sense for you to love me,\" I explained, my voice breaking twice. \"I always knew that.\" His eyes narrowed, his jaw tightened. \"I'll prove you're awake,\" he promised. He caught my face securely between his iron hands, ignoring my struggles when I tried to turn my head away. \"Please don't,\" I whispered. He stopped, his lips just half an inch from mine. \"Why not?\" he demanded. His breath blew into my face, making my head whirl. \"When I wake up\"\u2014He opened his mouth to protest, so I revised\u2014\"okay, forget that one\u2014when you leave again, it's going to be hard enough without this, too.\" He pulled back an inch, to stare at my face. \"Yesterday, when I would touch you, you were so\u2026 hesitant, so careful, and yet still the same. I need to know why. Is it because I'm too late? Because I've hurt you too much? Because you have moved on, as I meant for you to? That would be\u2026 quite fair. I won't contest your decision. So don't try to spare my feelings, please\u2014just tell me now whether or not you can still love me, after everything I've done to you.\u00a0 Can you?\" he whispered. \"What kind of an idiotic question is that?\" \"Just answer it. Please.\" I stared at him darkly for a long moment. \"The way I feel about you will never change. Of course I love you\u2014and there's nothing you can do about it!\" \"That's all I needed to hear.\" His mouth was on mine then, and I couldn't fight him. Not because he was so many thousand times stronger than me, but because my will crumbled into dust the second our lips met. This kiss was not quite as careful as others I remembered, which suited me just fine. If I was going to rip myself up further, I might as well get as much in trade as possible. So I kissed him back, my heart pounding out a jagged, disjointed rhythm while my breathing turned to panting and my fingers moved greedily to his face. I could feel his marble body against every line of mine, and I was so glad he hadn't listened to me\u2014there was no pain in the world that would have justified missing this. His hands memorized my face, the same way mine were tracing his, and, in the brief seconds when his lips were free, he whispered my name. When I was starting to get dizzy, he pulled away, only to lay his ear against my heart. I lay there, dazed, waiting for my gasping to slow and quiet. \"By the way,\" he said in a casual tone. \"I'm not leaving you.\" I didn't say anything, and he seemed to hear skepticism in my silence. He lifted his face to lock my gaze in his. \"I'm not going anywhere. Not without you,\" he added more seriously. \"I only left you in the first place because I wanted you to have a chance at a normal, happy, human life. I could see what I was doing to you\u2014keeping you constantly on the edge of danger, taking you away from the world you belonged in, risking your life every moment I was with you. So I had to try. I had to do something, and it seemed like leaving was the only way. If I hadn't thought you would be better off, I could have never made myself leave. I'm much too selfish. Only you could be more important than what I wanted\u2026 what I needed. What I want and need is to be with you, and I know I'll never be strong enough to leave again. I have too many excuses to stay\u2014thank heaven for that! It seems you can't be safe, no matter how many miles I put between us.\" \"Don't promise me anything,\" I whispered. If I let myself hope, and it came to nothing\u2026 that would kill me. Where all those merciless vampires had not been able to finish me off, hope would do the job. Anger glinted metallic in his black eyes. \"You think I'm lying to you now?\" \"No\u2014not lying.\" I shook my head, trying to think it through coherently. To examine the hypothesis that he did love me, while staying objective, clinical, so I wouldn't fall into the trap of hoping. \"You could mean it\u2026 now. But what about tomorrow, when you think about all the reasons you left in the first place? Or next month, when Jasper takes a snap at me?\" He flinched. I thought back over those last days of my life before he left me, tried to see them through the filter of what he was telling me now. From that perspective, imagining that he'd left me while loving me, left me for me, his brooding and cold silences took on a different meaning. \"It isn't as if you hadn't thought the first decision through, is it?\" I guessed. \"You'll end up doing what you think is right.\" \"I'm not as strong as you give me credit for,\" he said. \"Right and wrong have ceased to mean much to me; I was coming back anyway. Before Rosalie told me the news, I was already past trying to live through one week at a time, or even one day. I was fighting to make it through a single hour. It was only a matter of time before I showed up at your window and begged you to take me back. I'd be happy to beg now, if you'd like that.\" I grimaced. \"Be serious, please.\" \"Oh, I am,\" he insisted, glaring now. \"Will you please try to hear what I'm telling you? Will you let me attempt to explain what you mean to me?\" He waited, studying my face as he spoke to make sure I was really listening. \"Before you, Bella, my life was like a moonless night. Very dark, but there were stars\u2014points of light and reason\u2026 And then you shot across my sky like a meteor. Suddenly everything was on fire; there was brilliancy, there was beauty. When you were gone, when the meteor had fallen over the horizon, everything went black. Nothing had changed, but my eyes were blinded by the light. I couldn't see the stars anymore. And there was no more reason for anything.\" I wanted to believe him. But this was my life without him that he was describing, not the other way around. \"Your eyes will adjust,\" I mumbled. \"That's just the problem\u2014they can't.\" \"What about your distractions?\" He laughed without a trace of humor. \"Just part of the lie, love. There was no distraction from the\u2026 the agony. My heart hasn't beat in almost ninety years, but this was different. It was like my heart was gone\u2014like I was hollow. Like I'd left everything that was inside me here with you.\" \"That's funny,\" I muttered. He arched one perfect eyebrow. \"Funny? \" \"I meant strange\u2014I thought it was just me. Lots of pieces of me went missing, too. I haven't been able to really breathe in so long.\" I filled my lungs, luxuriating in the sensation. \"And my heart. That was definitely lost.\" He closed his eyes and laid his ear over my heart again. I let my cheek press against his hair, felt the texture of it on my skin, smelled the delicious scent of him. \"Tracking wasn't a distraction then?\" I asked, curious, and also needing to distract myself. I was very much in danger of hoping. I wouldn't be able to stop myself for long. My heart throbbed, singing in my chest. \"No.\" He sighed. \"That was never a distraction. It was an obligation.\" \"What does that mean?\" \"It means that, even though I never expected any danger from Victoria, I wasn't going to let her get away with\u2026 Well, like I said, I was horrible at it. I traced her as far as Texas, but then I followed a false lead down to Brazil\u2014and really she came here.\" He groaned. \"I wasn't even on the right continent! And all the while, worse than my worst fears\u2014\" \"You were hunting Victoria?\" I half-shrieked as soon as I could find my voice, shooting through two octaves. Charlie's distant snores stuttered, and then picked up a regular rhythm again. \"Not well,\" Edward answered, studying my outraged expression with a confused look. \"But I'll do better this time. She won't be tainting perfectly good air by breathing in and out for much longer.\" \"That is\u2026 out of the question,\" I managed to choke out. Insanity. Even if he had Emmett or Jasper help him. Even if he had Emmett and Jasper help. It was worse than my other imaginings: Jacob Black standing across a small space from Victoria's vicious and feline figure. I couldn't bear to picture Edward there, even though he was so much more durable than my half-human best friend.  \"It's too late for her. I might have let the other time slide, but not now, not after\u2014\" I interrupted him again, trying to sound calm. \"Didn't you just promise that you weren't going to leave?\" I asked, fighting the words as I said them, nor letting them plant themselves in my heart. \"That isn't exactly compatible with an extended tracking expedition, is it?\" He frowned. A snarl began to build low in his chest. \"I will keep my promise, Bella. But Victoria\"\u2014the snarl became more pronounced\u2014\"is going to die. Soon.\" \"Let's not be hasty,\" I said, trying to hide my panic. \"Maybe she's not coming back. Jake's pack probably scared her off. There's really no reason to go looking for her. Besides, I've got bigger problems than Victoria.\" Edward's eyes narrowed, but he nodded. \"It's true. The werewolves are a problem.\" I snorted. \"I wasn't talking about Jacob. My problems are a lot worse that a handful of adolescent wolves getting themselves into trouble.\" Edward looked as if he were about to say something, and then thought better of it. His teeth clicked together, and he spoke through them. \"Really?\" he asked. \"Then what would be your greatest problem? That would make Victoria's returning for you seem like such an inconsequential matter in comparison?\" \"How about the second greatest?\" I hedged. \"All right,\" he agreed, suspicious. I paused. I wasn't sure I could say the name. \"There are others who are coming to look for me,\" I reminded him in a subdued whisper. He sighed, but the reaction was not as strong as I would have imagined after his response to Victoria. \"The Volturi are only the second greatest?\" \"You don't seem that upset about it,\" I noted. \"Well, we have plenty of time to think it through. Time means something very different to them than it does to you, or even me. They count years the way you count days. I wouldn't be surprised if you were thirty before you crossed their minds again,\" he added lightly. Horror washed through me. Thirty. So his promises meant nothing, in the end. If I were going to turn thirty someday, then he couldn't be planning on staying long. The harsh pain of this knowledge made me realize that I'd already begun to hope, without giving myself permission to do so. \"You don't have to be afraid,\" he said, anxious as he watched the tears dew up again on the rims of my eyes. \"I won't let them hurt you.\" \"While you're here.\" Not that I cared what happened to me when he left. He took my face between his two stone hands, holding it tightly while his midnight eyes glared into mine with the gravitational force of a black hole. \"I will never leave you again.\" \"But you said thirty,\" I whispered. The tears leaked over the edge. \"What? You're going to stay, but let me get all old anyway? Right.\" His eyes softened, while his mouth went hard. \"That's exactly what I'm going to do. What choice have I?\u00a0 I cannot be without you, but I will not destroy your soul.\" \"Is this really\u2026\" I tried to keep my voice even, but this question was too hard. I remembered his face when Aro had almost begged him to consider making me immortal. The sick look there. Was this fixation with keeping me human really about my soul, or was it because he wasn't sure that he wanted me around that long? \"Yes?\" he asked, waiting for my question. I asked a different one. Almost\u2014but not quite\u2014as hard. \"But what about when I get so old that people think I'm your mother? Your \u00a0grandmother?\" My voice was pale with revulsion\u2014I could see Gran's face again in the dream mirror. His whole face was soft now. He brushed the tears from my cheek with his lips. \"That doesn't mean anything to me,\" he breathed against my skin. \"You will always be the most beautiful thing in my world.\u00a0 Of course\u2026\" He hesitated, flinching slightly. \"If you outgrew me\u2014if you wanted something more\u2014I would understand that, Bella. I promise I wouldn't stand in your way if you wanted to leave me.\" His eyes were liquid onyx and utterly sincere. He spoke as if he'd put endless amounts of thought into this asinine plan. \"You do realize that I'll die eventually, right?\" I demanded. He'd thought about this part, too. \"I'll follow after as soon as I can.\" \"That is seriously\u2026\"I looked for the right word. \"Sick.\" \"Bella, it's the only right way left\u2014\" \"Let's just back up for a minute,\" I said; feeling angry made it so much easier to be clear, decisive. \"You do remember the Volturi, right? I can't stay human forever. They'll kill me. Even if they don't think of me till I'm thirty\"\u2014I hissed the word\u2014\"do you really think they'll forget?\" \"No,\" he answered slowly, shaking his head. \"They won't forget. But\u2026\" \"But?\" He grinned while I stared at him warily. Maybe I wasn't the only crazy one. \"I have a few plans.\" \"And these plans,\" I said, my voice getting more acidic with each word. \"These plans all center around me staying human.\" My attitude hardened his expression. \"Naturally.\" His tone was brusque, his divine face arrogant. We glowered at each other for a long minute. Then I took a deep breath, squared my shoulders, I pushed his arms away so that I could sit up. \"Do you want me to leave?\" he asked, and it made my heart flutter to see that this idea hurt him, though he tried not to show it. \"No,\" I told him. \"I'm leaving.\" He watched me suspiciously as I climbed out of the bed and fumbled around in the dark room, looking for my shoes. \"May I ask where you are going.'\" he asked. \"I'm going to your house,\" I told him, still feeling around blindly. He got up and came to my side. \"Here are your shoes. How did you plan to get there?\" \"My truck.\" \"That will probably wake Charlie,\" he offered as a deterrent. I sighed. \"I know. But honestly, I'll be grounded for weeks as it is. How much more trouble can I really get in?\" \"None. He'll blame me, not you.\" \"If you have a better idea, I'm all ears.\" \"Stay here,\" he suggested, but his expression wasn't hopeful. \"No dice. But you go ahead and make yourself at home,\" I encouraged, surprised at how natural my teasing sounded, and headed for the door. He was there before me, blocking my way. I frowned, and turned for the window. It wasn't really that far to the ground, and it was mostly grass beneath\u2026 \"Okay,\" he sighed. \"I'll give you a ride.\" I shrugged. \"Either way. But you probably should be there, too.\" \"And why is that?\" \"Because you're extraordinarily opinionated, and I'm sure you'll want a chance to air your views.\" \"My views on which subject?\" He asked through his teeth. \"This isn't just about you anymore. You're not the center of the universe, you know.\" My own personal universe was, of course, a different story. \"If you're going to bring the Volturi down on us over something as stupid as leaving me human, then your family ought to have a say.\" \"A say in what?\" he asked, each word distinct. \"My mortality. I'm putting it to a vote.\"",
