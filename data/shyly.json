            "en": "EPILOGUE:AN OCCASION        EPILOGUE:AN OCCASION Edward helped me into his car, being very careful of the wisps of silk and chiffon, the flowers he'd just pinned into my elaborately styled curls, and my bulky walking cast. He ignored the angry set of my mouth. When he had me settled, he got in the driver's seat and headed back out the long, narrow drive. \"At what point exactly are you going to tell me what's going on?\" I asked grumpily. I really hated surprises. And he knew that. I'm shocked that you haven't figured it out yet.\" He threw a mocking smile in my direction, and my breath caught in my throat. Would I ever get used to his perfection? \"I did mention that you looked very nice, didn't I?\" I verified. \"Yes.\" He grinned again. I'd never seen him dress in black before, and, with the contrast against his pale skin, his beauty was absolutely surreal. That much I couldn't deny, even if the fact that he was wearing a tuxedo made me very nervous. Not quite as nervous as the dress. Or the shoe. Only one shoe, as my other foot was still securely encased in plaster. But the stiletto heel, held on only by satin ribbons, certainly wasn't going to help me as I tried to hobble around. \"I'm not coming over anymore if Alice is going to treat me like Guinea Pig Barbie when I do,\" I griped. I'd spent the better part of the day in Alice's staggeringly vast bathroom, a helpless victim as she played hairdresser and cosmetician. Whenever I fidgeted or complained, she reminded me that she didn't have any memories of being human, and asked me not to ruin her vicarious fun. Then she'd dressed me in the most ridiculous dress \u2014 deep blue, frilly and off the shoulders, with French tags I couldn't read \u2014 a dress more suitable for a runway than Forks. Nothing good could come of our formal attire, of that I was sure. Unless\u2026 but I was afraid to put my suspicions into words, even in my own head.  I was distracted then by the sound of a phone ringing. Edward pulled his cell phone from a pocket inside his jacket, looking briefly at the caller ID before answering. \"Hello, Charlie,\" he said warily. \"Charlie?\" I frowned. Charlie had been\u2026 difficult since my return to Forks. He had compartmentalized my bad experience into two defined reactions. Toward Carlisle he was almost worshipfully grateful. On the other hand, he was stubbornly convinced that Edward was at fault \u2014 because, if not for him, I wouldn't have left home in the first place. And Edward was far from disagreeing with him. These days I had rules that hadn't existed before: curfews\u2026 visiting hours. Something Charlie was saying made Edward's eyes widen in disbelief, and then a grin spread across his face. \"You're kidding!\" He laughed. \"What is it?\" I demanded. He ignored me. \"Why don't you let me talk to him?\" Edward suggested with evident pleasure. He waited for a few seconds. \"Hello, Tyler, this is Edward Cullen.\" His voice was very friendly, on the surface. I knew it well enough to catch the soft edge of menace. What was Tyler doing at my house? The awful truth began to dawn on me. I looked again at the inappropriate dress Alice had forced me into. \"I'm sorry if there's been some kind of miscommunication, but Bella is unavailable tonight.\" Edward's tone changed, and the threat in his voice was suddenly much more evident as he continued. \"To be perfectly honest, she'll be unavailable every night, as far as anyone besides myself is concerned. No offense. And I'm sorry about your evening.\" He didn't sound sorry at all. And then he snapped the phone shut, a huge smirk on his face. My face and neck flushed crimson with anger. I could feel the rage-induced tears starting to fill my eyes. He looked at me in surprise. \"Was that last part a bit too much? I didn't mean to offend you.\" I ignored that.  \"You're taking me to the prom!\" I yelled. It was embarrassingly obvious now. If I'd been paying any attention at all, I'm sure I would have noticed the date on the posters that decorated the school buildings. But I'd never dreamed he was thinking of subjecting me to this. Didn't he know me at all? He wasn't expecting the force of my reaction, that was clear. He pressed his lips together and his eyes narrowed. \"Don't be difficult, Bella.\" My eyes flashed to the window; we were halfway to the school already. \"Why are you doing this to me?\" I demanded in horror. He gestured to his tuxedo. \"Honestly, Bella, what did you think we were doing?\" I was mortified. First, because I'd missed the obvious. And also because the vague suspicions \u2014 expectations, really \u2014 that I'd been forming all day, as Alice tried to transform me into a beauty queen, were so far wide of the mark. My half-fearful hopes seemed very silly now. I'd guessed there was some kind of occasion brewing. But prom! That was the furthest thing from my mind. The angry tears rolled over my cheeks. I remembered with dismay that I was very uncharacteristically wearing mascara. I wiped quickly under my eyes to prevent any smudges. My hand was unblackened when I pulled it away; maybe Alice had known I would need waterproof makeup. \"This is completely ridiculous. Why are you crying?\" he demanded in frustration. \"Because I'm mad!\" \"Bella.\" He turned the full force of his scorching golden eyes on me. \"What?\" I muttered, distracted. \"Humor me,\" he insisted. His eyes were melting all my fury. It was impossible to fight with him when he cheated like that. I gave in with poor grace. \"Fine,\" I pouted, unable to glare as effectively as I would have liked. \"I'll go quietly. But you'll see. I'm way overdue for more bad luck. I'll probably break my other leg. Look at this shoe! It's a death trap!\" I held out my good leg as evidence. \"Hmmm.\" He stared at my leg longer than was necessary. \"Remind me to thank Alice for that tonight.\" \"Alice is going to be there?\" That comforted me slightly. \"With Jasper, and Emmett\u2026 and Rosalie,\" he admitted. The feeling of comfort disappeared. There had been no progress with Rosalie, though I was on quite good terms with her sometimes-husband. Emmett enjoyed having me around \u2014 he thought my bizarre human reactions were hilarious\u2026 or maybe it was just the fact that I fell down a lot that he found so funny. Rosalie acted as if I didn't exist. While I shook my head to dispel the direction my thoughts had taken, I thought of something else. \"Is Charlie in on this?\" I asked, suddenly suspicious. \"Of course.\" He grinned, and then chuckled. \"Apparently Tyler wasn't, though.\" I gritted my teeth. How Tyler could be so delusional, I couldn't imagine. At school, where Charlie couldn't interfere, Edward and I were inseparable \u2014 except for those rare sunny days. We were at the school now; Rosalie's red convertible was conspicuous in the parking lot. The clouds were thin today, a few streaks of sunlight escaping through far away in the west. He got out and walked around the car to open my door. He held out his hand. I sat stubbornly in my seat, arms folded, feeling a secret twinge of smugness. The lot was crowded with people in formal dress: witnesses. He couldn't remove me forcibly from the car as he might have if we'd been alone. He sighed. \"When someone wants to kill you, you're brave as a lion \u2014 and then when someone mentions dancing\u2026\" He shook his head. I gulped. Dancing. \"Bella, I won't let anything hurt you \u2014 not even yourself. I won't let go of you once, I promise.\" I thought about that and suddenly felt much better. He could see that in my face. \"There, now,\" he said gently, \"it won't be so bad.\" He leaned down and wrapped one arm around my waist. I took his other hand and let him lift me from the car. He kept his arm tightly around me, supporting me as I limped toward the school. In Phoenix, they held proms in hotel ballrooms. This dance was in the gym, of course. It was probably the only room in town big enough for a dance. When we got inside, I giggled. There were actual balloon arches and twisted garlands of pastel crepe paper festooning the walls. \"This looks like a horror movie waiting to happen,\" I snickered. \"Well,\" he muttered as we slowly approached the ticket table \u2014 he was carrying most of my weight, but I still had to shuffle and wobble my feet forward \u2014 \"there are more than enough vampires present.\" I looked at the dance floor; a wide gap had formed in the center of the floor, where two couples whirled gracefully. The other dancers pressed to the sides of the room to give them space \u2014 no one wanted to stand in contrast with such radiance. Emmett and Jasper were intimidating and flawless in classic tuxedos. Alice was striking in a black satin dress with geometric cutouts that bared large triangles of her snowy white skin. And Rosalie was\u2026 well, Rosalie. She was beyond belief. Her vivid scarlet dress was backless, tight to her calves where it flared into a wide ruffled train, with a neckline that plunged to her waist. I pitied every girl in the room, myself included. \"Do you want me to bolt the doors so you can massacre the unsuspecting townsfolk?\" I whispered conspiratorially. \"And where do you fit into that scheme?\" He glared. \"Oh, I'm with the vampires, of course.\" He smiled reluctantly. \"Anything to get out of dancing.\" \"Anything.\" He bought our tickets, then turned me toward the dance floor. I cringed against his arm and dragged my feet. \"I've got all night,\" he warned. Eventually he towed me out to where his family was twirling elegantly \u2014 if in a style totally unsuitable to the present time and music. I watched in horror. \"Edward.\" My throat was so dry I could only manage a whisper. \"I honestly can't dance!\" I could feel the panic bubbling up inside my chest. \"Don't worry, silly,\" he whispered back. \"I can.\" He put my arms around his neck and lifted me to slide his feet under mine. And then we were whirling, too. \"I feel like I'm five years old,\" I laughed after a few minutes of effortless waltzing. \"You don't look five,\" he murmured, pulling me closer for a second, so that my feet were briefly a foot from the ground. Alice caught my eye on a turn and smiled in encouragement \u2014 I smiled back. I was surprised to realize that I was actually enjoying myself\u2026 a little. \"Okay, this isn't half bad,\" I admitted. But Edward was staring toward the doors, and his face was angry. \"What is it?\" I wondered aloud. I followed his gaze, disoriented by the spinning, but finally I could see what was bothering him. Jacob Black, not in a tux, but in a long-sleeved white shirt and tie, his hair smoothed back into his usual ponytail, was crossing the floor toward us. After the first shock of recognition, I couldn't help but feel bad for Jacob. He was clearly uncomfortable \u2014 excruciatingly so. His face was apologetic as his eyes met mine. Edward snarled very quietly. \"Behave!\" I hissed. Edward's voice was scathing. \"He wants to chat with you.\" Jacob reached us then, the embarrassment and apology even more evident on his face. \"Hey, Bella, I was hoping you would be here.\" Jacob sounded like he'd been hoping the exact opposite. But his smile was just as warm as ever.  \"Hi, Jacob.\" I smiled back. \"What's up?\" \"Can I cut in?\" he asked tentatively, glancing at Edward for the first time. I was shocked to notice that Jacob didn't have to look up. He must have grown half a foot since the first time I'd seen him. Edward's face was composed, his expression blank. His only answer was to set me carefully on my feet, and take a step back. \"Thanks,\" Jacob said amiably. Edward just nodded, looking at me intently before he turned to walk away. Jacob put his hands on my waist, and I reached up to put my hands on his shoulders. \"Wow, Jake, how tall are you now?\" He was smug. \"Six-two.\" We weren't really dancing \u2014 my leg made that impossible. Instead we swayed awkwardly from side to side without moving our feet. It was just as well; the recent growth spurt had left him looking gangly and uncoordinated, he was probably no better a dancer than I was. \"So, how did you end up here tonight?\" I asked without true curiosity. Considering Edward's reaction, I could guess. \"Can you believe my dad paid me twenty bucks to come to your prom?\" he admitted, slightly ashamed. \"Yes, I can,\" I muttered. \"Well, I hope you're enjoying yourself, at least. Seen anything you like?\" I teased, nodding toward a group of girls lined up against the wall like pastel confections. \"Yeah,\" he sighed. \"But she's taken.\" He glanced down to meet my curious gaze for just a second \u2014 then we both looked away, embarrassed. \"You look really pretty, by the way,\" he added <em>shyly</em>. \"Um, thanks. So why did Billy pay you to come here?\" I asked quickly, though I knew the answer. Jacob didn't seem grateful for the subject change; he looked away, uncomfortable again. \"He said it was a 'safe' place to talk to you. I swear the old man is losing his mind.\" I joined in his laughter weakly. \"Anyway, he said that if I told you something, he would get me that master cylinder I need,\" he confessed with a sheepish grin. \"Tell me, then. I want you to get your car finished.\" I grinned back. At least Jacob didn't believe any of this. It made the situation a bit easier. Against the wall, Edward was watching my face, his own face expressionless. I saw a sophomore in a pink dress eyeing him with timid speculation, but he didn't seem to be aware of her. Jacob looked away again, ashamed. \"Don't get mad, okay?\" \"There's no way I'll be mad at you, Jacob,\" I assured him. \"I won't even be mad at Billy. Just say what you have to.\" \"Well \u2014 this is so stupid, I'm sorry, Bella \u2014 he wants you to break up with your boyfriend. He asked me to tell you 'please.'\" He shook his head in disgust. \"He's still superstitious, eh?\" \"Yeah. He was\u2026 kind of over the top when you got hurt down in Phoenix. He didn't believe\u2026\"Jacob trailed off self-consciously. My eyes narrowed. \"I fell.\" \"I know that,\" Jacob said quickly. \"He thinks Edward had something to do with me getting hurt.\" It wasn't a question, and despite my promise, I was angry.  Jacob wouldn't meet my eyes. We weren't even bothering to sway to the music, though his hands were still on my waist, and mine around his neck. \"Look, Jacob, I know Billy probably won't believe this, but just so you know\" \u2014 he looked at me now, responding to the new earnestness in my voice \u2014 \"Edward really did save my life. If it weren't for Edward and his father, I'd be dead.\" \"I know,\" he claimed, but he sounded like my sincere words had affected him some. Maybe he'd be able to convince Billy of this much, at least. \"Hey, I'm sorry you had to come do this, Jacob,\" I apologized. \"At any rate, you get your parts, right?\" \"Yeah,\" he muttered. He was still looking awkward\u2026 upset. \"There's more?\" I asked in disbelief. \"Forget it,\" he mumbled, \"I'll get a job and save the money myself.\" I glared at him until he met my gaze. \"Just spit it out, Jacob.\" \"It's so bad.\" \"I don't care. Tell me,\" I insisted. \"Okay\u2026 but, geez, this sounds bad.\" He shook his head. \"He said to tell you, no, to warn you, that \u2014 and this is his plural, not mine\" \u2014 he lifted one hand from my waist and made little quotations marks in the air \u2014 '\"We'll be watching.'\" He watched warily for my reaction. It sounded like something from a mafia movie. I laughed out loud. \"Sorry you had to do this, Jake,\" I snickered. \"I don't mind that much.\" He grinned in relief. His eyes were appraising as they raked quickly over my dress. \"So, should I tell him you said to butt the hell out?\" he asked hopefully. \"No,\" I sighed. \"Tell him I said thanks. I know he means well.\" The song ended, and I dropped my arms. His hands hesitated at my waist, and he glanced at my bum leg. \"Do you want to dance again? Or can I help you get somewhere?\" Edward answered for me. \"That's all right, Jacob. I'll take it from here.\" Jacob flinched, and stared wide-eyed at Edward, who stood just beside us. \"Hey, I didn't see you there,\" he mumbled. \"I guess I'll see you around, Bella.\" He stepped back, waving halfheartedly. I smiled. \"Yeah, I'll see you later.\" \"Sorry,\" he said again before he turned for the door. Edward's arms wound around me as the next song started. It was a little up-tempo for slow dancing, but that didn't seem to concern him. I leaned my head against his chest, content. \"Feeling better?\" I teased. \"Not really,\" he said tersely. \"Don't be mad at Billy,\" I sighed. \"He just worries about me for Charlie's sake. It's nothing personal.\" \"I'm not mad at Billy,\" he corrected in a clipped voice. \"But his son is irritating me.\" I pulled back to look at him. His face was very serious. \"Why?\" \"First of all, he made me break my promise.\" I stared at him in confusion. He half-smiled. \"I promised I wouldn't let go of you tonight,\" he explained. \"Oh. Well, I forgive you.\" \"Thanks. But there's something else.\" Edward frowned. I waited patiently. \"He called you pretty,\" he finally continued, his frown deepening. \"That's practically an insult, the way you look right now. You're much more than beautiful.\" I laughed. \"You might be a little biased.\" \"I don't think that's it. Besides, I have excellent eyesight.\" We were twirling again, my feet on his as he held me close. \"So are you going to explain the reason for all of this?\" I wondered. He looked down at me, confused, and I glared meaningfully at the crepe paper. He considered for a moment, and then changed direction, spinning me through the crowd to the back door of the gym. I caught a glimpse of Jessica and Mike dancing, staring at me curiously. Jessica waved, and I smiled back quickly. Angela was there, too, looking blissfully happy in the arms of little Ben Cheney; she didn't look up from his eyes, a head lower than hers. Lee and Samantha, Lauren, glaring toward us, with Conner; I could name every face that spiraled past me. And then we were outdoors, in the cool, dim light of a fading sunset. As soon as we were alone, he swung me up into his arms, and carried me across the dark grounds till he reached the bench beneath the shadow of the madrone trees. He sat there, keeping me cradled against his chest. The moon was already up, visible through the gauzy clouds, and his face glowed pale in the white light. His mouth was hard, his eyes troubled. \"The point?\" I prompted softly. He ignored me, staring up at the moon. \"Twilight, again,\" he murmured. \"Another ending. No matter how perfect the day is, it always has to end.\" \"Some things don't have to end,\" I muttered through my teeth, instantly tense. He sighed. \"I brought you to the prom,\" he said slowly, finally answering my question, \"because I don't want you to miss anything. I don't want my presence to take anything away from you, if I can help it. I want you to be human. I want your life to continue as it would have if I'd died in nineteen-eighteen like I should have.\" I shuddered at his words, and then shook my head angrily. \"In what strange parallel dimension would I ever have gone to prom of my own free will? If you weren't a thousand times stronger than me, I would never have let you get away with this.\" He smiled briefly, but it didn't touch his eyes. \"It wasn't so bad, you said so yourself.\" \"That's because I was with you.\" We were quiet for a minute; he stared at the moon and I stared at him. I wished there was some way to explain how very uninterested I was in a normal human life. \"Will you tell me something?\" he asked, glancing down at me with a slight smile. \"Don't I always?\" \"Just promise you'll tell me,\" he insisted, grinning. I knew I was going to regret this almost instantly. \"Fine.\" \"You seemed honestly surprised when you figured out that I was taking you here,\" he began. \"I was,\" I interjected. \"Exactly,\" he agreed. \"But you must have had some other theory\u2026 I'm curious \u2014 what did you think I was dressing you up for?\" Yes, instant regret. I pursed my lips, hesitating. \"I don't want to tell you.\" \"You promised,\" he objected. \"I know.\" \"What's the problem?\" I knew he thought it was mere embarrassment holding me back. \"I think it will make you mad \u2014 or sad.\"  His brows pulled together over his eyes as he thought that through. \"I still want to know. Please?\" I sighed. He waited. \"Well\u2026 I assumed it was some kind of\u2026 occasion. But I didn't think it would be some trite human thing\u2026 prom!\" I scoffed. \"Human?\" he asked flatly. He'd picked up on the key word. I looked down at my dress, fidgeting with a stray piece of chiffon. He waited in silence. \"Okay,\" I confessed in a rush. \"So I was hoping that you might have changed your mind\u2026 that you were going to change me, after all.\" A dozen emotions played across his face. Some I recognized: anger\u2026 pain\u2026 and then he seemed to collect himself and his expression became amused. \"You thought that would be a black tie occasion, did you?\" he teased, touching the lapel of his tuxedo jacket. I scowled to hide my embarrassment. \"I don't know how these things work. To me, at least, it seems more rational than prom does.\" He was still grinning. \"It's not funny,\" I said. \"No, you're right, it's not,\" he agreed, his smile fading. \"I'd rather treat it like a joke, though, than believe you're serious.\" \"But I am serious.\" He sighed deeply. \"I know. And you're really that willing?\" The pain was back in his eyes. I bit my lip and nodded. \"So ready for this to be the end,\" he murmured, almost to himself, \"for this to be the twilight of your life, though your life has barely started. You're ready to give up everything.\" \"It's not the end, it's the beginning,\" I disagreed under my breath. \"I'm not worth it,\" he said sadly. \"Do you remember when you told me that I didn't see myself very clearly?\" I asked, raising my eyebrows. \"You obviously have the same blindness.\" \"I know what I am.\" I sighed. But his mercurial mood shifted on me. He pursed his lips, and his eyes were probing. He examined my face for a long moment.  \"You're ready now, then?\" he asked. \"Um.\" I gulped. \"Yes?\" He smiled, and inclined his head slowly until his cold lips brushed against the skin just under the corner of my jaw. \"Right now?\" he whispered, his breath blowing cool on my neck. I shivered involuntarily. \"Yes,\" I whispered, so my voice wouldn't have a chance to break. If he thought I was bluffing, he was going to be disappointed. I'd already made this decision, and I was sure. It didn't matter that my body was rigid as a plank, my hands balled into fists, my breathing erratic\u2026 He chuckled darkly, and leaned away. His face did look disappointed. \"You can't really believe that I would give in so easily,\" he said with a sour edge to his mocking tone. \"A girl can dream.\" His eyebrows rose. \"Is that what you dream about? Being a monster?\" \"Not exactly,\" I said, frowning at his word choice. Monster, indeed. \"Mostly I dream about being with you forever.\" His expression changed, softened and saddened by the subtle ache in my voice. \"Bella.\" His fingers lightly traced the shape of my lips. \"I will stay with you \u2014 isn't that enough?\" I smiled under his fingertips. \"Enough for now.\" He frowned at my tenacity. No one was going to surrender tonight. He exhaled, and the sound was practically a growl. I touched his face. \"Look,\" I said. \"I love you more than everything else in the world combined. Isn't that enough?\" \"Yes, it is enough,\" he answered, smiling. \"Enough for forever.\" And he leaned down to press his cold lips once more to my throat.",

            "en": "15          15. THE CULLENS The muted light of yet another cloudy day eventually woke me. I lay with my arm across my eyes, groggy and dazed. Something, a dream trying to be remembered, struggled to break into my consciousness. I moaned and rolled on my side, hoping more sleep would come. And then the previous day flooded back into my awareness. \"Oh!\" I sat up so fast it made my head spin. \"Your hair looks like a haystack\u2026 but I like it.\u201dHis unruffled voice came from the rocking chair in the corner. \"Edward! You stayed!\" I rejoiced, and thoughtlessly threw myself across the room and into his lap. In the instant that my thoughts caught up with my actions, I froze, shocked by my own uncontrolled enthusiasm. I stared up at him, afraid that I had crossed the wrong line. But he laughed. \"Of course,\u201dHe answered, startled, but seeming pleased by my reaction. His hands rubbed my back. I laid my head cautiously against his shoulder, breathing in the smell of his skin. \"I was sure it was a dream.\" \"You're not that creative,\u201dHe scoffed. \"Charlie!\" I remembered, thoughtlessly jumping up again and heading to the door. \"He left an hour ago \u2014 after reattaching your battery cables, I might add. I have to admit I was disappointed. Is that really all it would take to stop you, if you were determined to go?\" I deliberated where I stood, wanting to return to him badly, but afraid I might have morning breath. \"You're not usually this confused in the morning,\u201dHe noted. He held his arms open for me to return. A nearly irresistible invitation. \"I need another human minute,\" I admitted. \"I'll wait.\" I skipped to the bathroom, my emotions unrecognizable. I didn't know myself, inside or out. The face in the mirror was practically a stranger \u2014 eyes too bright, hectic spots of red across my cheekbones. After I brushed my teeth, I worked to straighten out the tangled chaos that was my hair. I splashed my face with cold water, and tried to breathe normally, with no noticeable success. I half-ran back to my room.  It seemed like a miracle that he was there, his arms still waiting for me. He reached out to me, and my heart thumped unsteadily. \"Welcome back,\u201dHe murmured, taking me into his arms. He rocked me for a while in silence, until I noticed that his clothes were changed, his hair smooth. \"You left?\" I accused, touching the collar of his fresh shirt. \"I could hardly leave in the clothes I came in \u2014 what would the neighbors think?\"  I pouted. \"You were very deeply asleep; I didn't miss anything.\u201dHis eyes gleamed. \"The talking came earlier.\" I groaned. \"What did you hear?\" His gold eyes grew very soft. \"You said you loved me.\" \"You knew that already,\" I reminded him, ducking my head. \"It was nice to hear, just the same.\" I hid my face against his shoulder. \"I love you,\" I whispered. \"You are my life now,\u201dHe answered simply. There was nothing more to say for the moment. He rocked us back and forth as the room grew lighter. \"Breakfast time,\u201dHe said eventually, casually \u2014 to prove, I'm sure, that he remembered all my human frailties. So I clutched my throat with both hands and stared at him with wide eyes. Shock crossed his face. \"Kidding!\" I snickered. \"And you said I couldn't act!\" He frowned in disgust. \"That wasn't funny.\" \"It was very funny, and you know it.\" But I examined his gold eyes carefully, to make sure that I was forgiven. Apparently, I was. \"Shall I rephrase?\u201dHe asked. \"Breakfast time for the human.\" \"Oh, okay.\" He threw me over his stone shoulder, gently, but with a swiftness that left me breathless. I protested as he carried me easily down the stairs, but he ignored me. He sat me right side up on a chair. The kitchen was bright, happy, seeming to absorb my mood. \"What's for breakfast?\" I asked pleasantly. That threw him for a minute. \"Er, I'm not sure. What would you like?\u201dHis marble brow puckered. I grinned, hopping up. \"That's all right, I fend for myself pretty well. Watch me hunt.\" I found a bowl and a box of cereal. I could feel his eyes on me as I poured the milk and grabbed a spoon. I sat my food on the table, and then paused. \"Can I get you anything?\" I asked, not wanting to be rude. He rolled his eyes. \"Just eat, Bella.\" I sat at the table, watching him as I took a bite. He was gazing at me, studying my every movement. It made me self-conscious. I cleared my mouth to speak, to distract him. \"What's on the agenda for today?\" I asked. \"Hmmm\u2026\" I watched him frame his answer carefully. \"What would you say to meeting my family?\" I gulped. \"Are you afraid now?\u201dHe sounded hopeful. \"Yes,\" I admitted; how could I deny it \u2014 he could see my eyes. \"Don't worry.\u201dHe smirked. \"I'll protect you.\" \"I'm not afraid of them,\" I explained. \"I'm afraid they won't\u2026 like me. Won't they be, well, surprised that you would bring someone\u2026 like me\u2026 home to meet them? Do they know that I know about them?\" \"Oh, they already know everything. They'd taken bets yesterday, you know\" \u2014 he smiled, but his voice was harsh \u2014 \"on whether I'd bring you back, though why anyone would bet against Alice, I can't imagine. At any rate, we don't have secrets in the family. It's not really feasible, what with my mind reading and Alice seeing the future and all that.\" \"And Jasper making you feel all warm and fuzzy about spilling your guts, don't forget that.\" \"You paid attention,\u201dHe smiled approvingly. \"I've been known to do that every now and then.\" I grimaced. \"So did Alice see me coming?\" His reaction was strange. \"Something like that,\u201dHe said uncomfortably, turning away so I couldn't see his eyes. I stared at him curiously. \"Is that any good?\u201dHe asked, turning back to me abruptly and eyeing my breakfast with a teasing look on his face. \"Honestly, it doesn't look very appetizing.\" \"Well, it's no irritable grizzly\u2026\" I murmured, ignoring him when he glowered. I was still wondering why he responded that way when I mentioned Alice. I hurried through my cereal, speculating. He stood in the middle of the kitchen, the statue of Adonis again, staring abstractedly out the back windows. Then his eyes were back on me, and he smiled his heartbreaking smile. \"And you should introduce me to your father, too, I think.\" \"He already knows you,\" I reminded him. \"As your boyfriend, I mean.\" I stared at him with suspicion. \"Why?\" \"Isn't that customary?\u201dHe asked innocently. \"I don't know,\" I admitted. My dating history gave me few reference points to work with. Not that any normal rules of dating applied here. \"That's not necessary, you know. I don't expect you to\u2026 I mean, you don't have to pretend for me.\" His smile was patient. \"I'm not pretending.\" I pushed the remains of my cereal around the edges of the bowl, biting my lip. \"Are you going to tell Charlie I'm your boyfriend or not?\u201dHe demanded. \"Is that what you are?\" I suppressed my internal cringing at the thought of Edward and Charlie and the word boy friend all in the same room at the same time. \"It's a loose interpretation of the word 'boy,' I'll admit.\"  \"I was under the impression that you were something more, actually,\" I confessed, looking at the table. \"Well, I don't know if we need to give him all the gory details.\u201dHe reached across the table to lift my chin with a cold, gentle finger. \"But he will need some explanation for why I'm around here so much. I don't want Chief Swan getting a restraining order put on me.\" \"Will you be?\" I asked, suddenly anxious. \"Will you really be here?\" \"As long as you want me,\u201dHe assured me. \"I'll always want you,\" I warned him. \"Forever.\" He walked slowly around the table, and, pausing a few feet away, he reached out to touch his fingertips to my cheek. His expression was unfathomable. \"Does that make you sad?\" I asked. He didn't answer. He stared into my eyes for an immeasurable period of time. \"Are you finished?\u201dHe finally asked. I jumped up. \"Yes.\" \"Get dressed \u2014 I'll wait here.\" It was hard to decide what to wear. I doubted there were any etiquette books detailing how to dress when your vampire sweetheart takes you home to meet his vampire family. It was a relief to think the word to myself. I knew I shied away from it intentionally. I ended up in my only skirt \u2014 long, khaki-colored, still casual. I put on the dark blue blouse he'd once complimented. A quick glance in the mirror told me my hair was entirely impossible, so I pulled it back into a pony tail. \"Okay.\" I bounced down the stairs. \"I'm decent.\" He was waiting at the foot of the stairs, closer than I'd thought, and I bounded right into him. He steadied me, holding me a careful distance away for a few seconds before suddenly pulling me closer. \"Wrong again,\u201dHe murmured in my ear. \"You are utterly indecent \u2014 no one should look so tempting, it's not fair.\" \"Tempting how?\" I asked. \"I can change\u2026\" He sighed, shaking his head. \"You are so absurd.\u201dHe pressed his cool lips delicately to my forehead, and the room spun. The smell of his breath made it impossible to think.  \"Shall I explain how you are tempting me?\u201dHe said. It was clearly a rhetorical question. His fingers traced slowly down my spine, his breath coming more quickly against my skin. My hands were limp on his chest, and I felt lightheaded again. He tilted his head slowly and touched his cool lips to mine for the second time, very carefully, parting them slightly. And then I collapsed. \"Bella?\u201dHis voice was alarmed as he caught me and held me up. \"You\u2026 made\u2026 me\u2026 faint,\" I accused him dizzily. \"What am I going to do with you?\u201dHe groaned in exasperation. \"Yesterday I kiss you, and you attack me! Today you pass out on me!\" I laughed weakly, letting his arms support me while my head spun. \"So much for being good at everything,\u201dHe sighed. \"That's the problem.\" I was still dizzy. \"You're too good. Far, far too good.\" \"Do you feel sick?\u201dHe asked; he'd seen me like this before. \"No \u2014 that wasn't the same kind of fainting at all. I don't know what happened.\" I shook my head apologetically, \"I think I forgot to breathe.\" \"I can't take you anywhere like this.\" \"I'm fine,\" I insisted. \"Your family is going to think I'm insane anyway, what's the difference?\" He measured my expression for a moment. \"I'm very partial to that color with your skin,\u201dHe offered unexpectedly. I flushed with pleasure, and looked away. \"Look, I'm trying really hard not to think about what I'm about to do, so can we go already?\" I asked. \"And you're worried, not because you're headed to meet a houseful of vampires, but because you think those vampires won't approve of you, correct?\" \"That's right,\" I answered immediately, hiding my surprise at his casual use of the word. He shook his head. \"You're incredible.\" I realized, as he drove my truck out of the main part of town, that I had no idea where he lived. We passed over the bridge at the Calawah River, the road winding northward, the houses flashing past us growing farther apart, getting bigger. And then we were past the other houses altogether, driving through misty forest. I was trying to decide whether to ask or be patient, when he turned abruptly onto an unpaved road. It was unmarked, barely visible among the ferns. The forest encroached on both sides, leaving the road ahead only discernible for a few meters as it twisted, serpentlike, around the ancient trees. And then, after a few miles, there was some thinning of the woods, and we were suddenly in a small meadow, or was it actually a lawn? The gloom of the forest didn't relent, though, for there were six primordial cedars that shaded an entire acre with their vast sweep of branches. The trees held their protecting shadow right up to the walls of the house that rose among them, making obsolete the deep porch that wrapped around the first story. I don't know what I had expected, but it definitely wasn't this. The house was timeless, graceful, and probably a hundred years old. It was painted a soft, faded white, three stories tall, \u00a0\u00a0rectangular and well proportioned. The windows and doors were either part of the original structure or a perfect restoration. My truck was the only car in sight. I could hear the river close by, hidden in the obscurity of the forest. \"Wow.\" \"You like it?\u201dHe smiled. \"It\u2026 has a certain charm.\" He pulled the end of my ponytail and chuckled. \"Ready?\u201dHe asked, opening my door. \"Not even a little bit \u2014 let's go.\" I tried to laugh, but it seemed to get stuck in my throat. I smoothed my hair nervously. \"You look lovely.\u201dHe took my hand easily, without thinking about it. We walked through the deep shade up to the porch. I knew he could feel my tension; his thumb rubbed soothing circles into the back of my hand. He opened the door for me. The inside was even more surprising, less predictable, than the exterior. It was very bright, very open, and very large. This must have originally been several rooms, but the walls had been removed from most of the first floor to create one wide space. The back, south-facing wall had been entirely replaced with glass, and, beyond the shade of the cedars, the lawn stretched bare to the wide river. A massive curving staircase dominated the west side of the room. The walls, the high-beamed ceiling, the wooden floors, and the thick carpets were all varying shades of white. Waiting to greet us, standing just to the left of the door, on a raised portion of the floor by a spectacular grand piano, were Edward's parents. I'd seen Dr. Cullen before, of course, yet I couldn't help but be struck again by his youth, his outrageous perfection. At his side was Esme, I assumed, the only one of the family I'd never seen before. She had the same pale, beautiful features as the rest of them. Something about her heart-shaped face, her billows of soft, caramel-colored hair, reminded me of the ing\u00e9nues of the silent-movie era. She was small, slender, yet less angular, more rounded than the others. They were both dressed casually, in light colors that matched the inside of the house. They smiled in welcome, but made no move to approach us. Trying not to frighten me, I guessed. \"Carlisle, Esme,\u201dEdward's voice broke the short silence, \"this is Bella.\" \"You're very welcome, Bella.\u201dCarlisle's step was measured, careful as he approached me. He raised his hand tentatively, and I stepped forward to shake hands with him. \"It's nice to see you again, Dr. Cullen.\" \"Please, call me Carlisle.\" \"Carlisle.\" I grinned at him, my sudden confidence surprising me. I could feel Edward's relief at my side. Esme smiled and stepped forward as well, reaching for my hand. Her cold, stone grasp was just as I expected. \"It's very nice to know you,\" she said sincerely. \"Thank you. I'm glad to meet you, too.\u201dAnd I was. It was like meeting a fairy tale \u2014 Snow White, in the flesh. \"Where are Alice and Jasper?\u201dEdward asked, but no one answered, as they had just appeared at the top of the wide staircase. \"Hey, Edward!\u201dAlice called enthusiastically. She ran down the stairs, a streak of black hair and white skin, coming to a sudden and graceful stop in front of me. Carlisle and Esme shot warning glances at her, but I liked it. It was natural \u2014 for her, anyway. \"Hi, Bella!\u201dAlice said, and she bounced forward to kiss my cheek. If Carlisle and Esme had looked cautious before, they now looked staggered. There was shock in my eyes, too, but I was also very pleased that she seemed to approve of me so entirely. I was startled to feel Edward stiffen at my side. I glanced at his face, but his expression was unreadable. \"You do smell nice, I never noticed before,\" she commented, to my extreme embarrassment. No one else seemed to know quite what to say, and then Jasper was there \u2014 tall and leonine. A feeling of ease spread through me, and I was suddenly comfortable despite where I was. Edward stared at Jasper, raising one eyebrow, and I remembered what Jasper could do.  \"Hello, Bella,\" Jasper said. He kept his distance, not offering to shake my hand. But it was impossible to feel awkward near him. \"Hello, Jasper.\" I smiled at him <em>shyly</em>, and then at the others. \"It's nice to meet you all \u2014 you have a very beautiful home,\" I added conventionally. \"Thank you,\u201dEsme said. \"We're so glad that you came.\" She spoke with feeling, and I realized that she thought I was brave. I also realized that Rosalie and Emmett were nowhere to be seen, and I remembered Edward's too-innocent denial when I'd asked him if the others didn't like me. Carlisle's expression distracted me from this train of thought; he was gazing meaningfully at Edward with an intense expression. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Edward nod once. I looked away, trying to be polite. My eyes wandered again to the beautiful instrument on the platform by the door. I suddenly remembered my childhood fantasy that, should I ever win a lottery, I would buy a grand piano for my mother. She wasn't really good \u2014 she only played for herself on our secondhand upright \u2014 but I loved to watch her play. She was happy, absorbed \u2014 she seemed like a new, mysterious being to me then, someone outside the \"mom\" persona I took for granted. She'd put me through lessons, of course, but like most kids, I whined until she let me quit. Esme noticed my preoccupation. \"Do you play?\" she asked, inclining her head toward the piano. I shook my head. \"Not at all. But it's so beautiful. Is it yours?\" \"No,\" she laughed. \"Edward didn't tell you he was musical?\" \"No.\" I glared at his suddenly innocent expression with narrowed eyes. \"I should have known, I guess.\" Esme raised her delicate eyebrows in confusion. \"Edward can do everything, right?\" I explained. Jasper snickered and Esme gave Edward a reproving look. \"I hope you haven't been showing off\u2014 it's rude,\" she scolded. \"Just a bit,\u201dHe laughed freely. Her face softened at the sound, and they shared a brief look that I didn't understand, though Esme's face seemed almost smug. \"He's been too modest, actually,\" I corrected. \"Well, play for her,\u201dEsme encouraged. \"You just said showing off was rude,\u201dHe objected. \"There are exceptions to every rule,\" she replied. \"I'd like to hear you play,\" I volunteered. \"It's settled then.\u201dEsme pushed him toward the piano. He pulled me along, sitting me on the bench beside him. He gave me a long, exasperated look before he turned to the keys. And then his fingers flowed swiftly across the ivory, and the room was filled with a composition so complex, so luxuriant, it was impossible to believe only one set of hands played. I felt my chin drop, my mouth open in astonishment, and heard low chuckles behind me at my reaction. Edward looked at me casually, the music still surging around us without a break, and winked. \"Do you like it?\" \"You wrote this?\" I gasped, understanding. He nodded. \"It's Esme's favorite.\" I closed my eyes, shaking my head. \"What's wrong?\" \"I'm feeling extremely insignificant.\" The music slowed, transforming into something softer, and to my surprise I detected the melody of his lullaby weaving through the profusion of notes. \"You inspired this one,\u201dHe said softly. The music grew unbearably sweet. I couldn't speak. \"They like you, you know,\u201dHe said conversationally. \"Esme especially.\" I glanced behind me, but the huge room was empty now. \"Where did they go?\" \"Very subtly giving us some privacy, I suppose.\" I sighed. \"They like me. But Rosalie and Emmett\u2026\" I trailed off, not sure how to express my doubts. He frowned. \"Don't worry about Rosalie,\u201dHe said, his eyes wide and persuasive. \"She'll come around.\" I pursed my lips skeptically. \"Emmett?\" \"Well, he thinks I'm a lunatic, it's true, but he doesn't have a problem with you. He's trying to reason with Rosalie.\" \"What is it that upsets her?\" I wasn't sure if I wanted to know the answer. He sighed deeply. \"Rosalie struggles the most with\u2026 with what we are.\u00a0 It's hard for her to have someone on the outside know the truth. And she's a little jealous.\" \"Rosalie is jealous of me?\" I asked incredulously. I tried to imagine a universe in which someone as breathtaking as Rosalie would have any possible reason to feel jealous of someone like me. \"You're human.\u201dHe shrugged. \"She wishes that she were, too.\" \"Oh,\" I muttered, still stunned. \"Even Jasper, though\u2026\" \"That's really my fault,\u201dHe said. \"I told you he was the most recent to try our way of life. I warned him to keep his distance.\" I thought about the reason for that, and shuddered. \"Esme and Carlisle\u2026 ?\" I continued quickly, to keep him from noticing. \"Are happy to see me happy. Actually, Esme wouldn't care if you had a third eye and webbed feet. All this time she's been worried about me, afraid that there was something missing from my essential makeup, that I was too young when Carlisle changed me\u2026 She's ecstatic. Every time I touch you, she just about chokes with satisfaction.\" \"Alice seems very\u2026 enthusiastic.\" \"Alice has her own way of looking at things,\u201dHe said through tight lips. \"And you're not going to explain that, are you?\" A moment of wordless communication passed between us. He realized that I knew he was keeping something from me. I realized that he wasn't going to give anything away. Not now. \"So what was Carlisle telling you before?\" His eyebrows pulled together. \"You noticed that, did you?\" I shrugged. \"Of course.\" He looked at me thoughtfully for a few seconds before answering. \"He wanted to tell me some news \u2014 he didn't know if it was something I would share with you.\" \"Will you?\" \"I have to, because I'm going to be a little\u2026 overbearingly protective over the next few days \u2014 or weeks \u2014 and I wouldn't want you to think I'm naturally a tyrant.\" \"What's wrong?\" \"Nothing's wrong, exactly. Alice just sees some visitors coming soon. They know we're here, and they're curious.\" \"Visitors?\" \"Yes\u2026 well, they aren't like us, of course \u2014 in their hunting habits, I mean. They probably won't come into town at all, but I'm certainly not going to let you out of my sight till they're gone.\" I shivered. \"Finally, a rational response!\u201dHe murmured. \"I was beginning to think you had no sense of self-preservation at all.\" I let that one pass, looking away, my eyes wandering again around the spacious room. He followed my gaze. \"Not what you expected, is it?\u201dHe asked, his voice smug. \"No,\" I admitted. \"No coffins, no piled skulls in the corners; I don't even think we have cobwebs\u2026 what a disappointment this must be for you,\u201dHe continued slyly. I ignored his teasing. \"It's so light\u2026 so open.\" He was more serious when he answered. \"It's the one place we never have to hide.\" ,  The song he was still playing, my song, drifted to an end, the final chords shifting to a more melancholy key. The last note hovered poignantly in the silence. \"Thank you,\" I murmured. I realized there were tears in my eyes. I dabbed at them, embarrassed. He touched the corner of my eye, trapping one I missed. He lifted his finger, examining the drop of moisture broodingly. Then, so quickly I couldn't be positive that he really did, he put his finger to his mouth to taste it. I looked at him questioningly, and he gazed back for a long moment before he finally smiled. \"Do you want to see the rest of the house?\" \"No coffins?\" I verified, the sarcasm in my voice not entirely masking the slight but genuine anxiety I felt. He laughed, taking my hand, leading me away from the piano. \"No coffins,\u201dHe promised. We walked up the massive staircase, my hand trailing along the satin-smooth rail. The long hall at the top of the stairs was paneled with a honey-colored wood, the same as the floorboards. \"Rosalie and Emmett's room\u2026 Carlisle's office\u2026 Alice's room\u2026\u201dHe gestured as he led me past the doors. He would have continued, but I stopped dead at the end of the hall, staring incredulously at the ornament hanging on the wall above my head. Edward chuckled at my bewildered expression. \"You can laugh,\u201dHe said. \"It is sort of ironic.\" I didn't laugh. My hand raised automatically, one finger extended as if to touch the large wooden cross, its dark patina contrasting with the lighter tone of the wall. I didn't touch it, though I was curious if the aged wood would feel as silky as it looked. \"It must be very old,\" I guessed. He shrugged. \"Early sixteen-thirties, more or less.\" I looked away from the cross to stare at him. \"Why do you keep this here?\" I wondered. \"Nostalgia. It belonged to Carlisle's father.\" \"He collected antiques?\" I suggested doubtfully. \"No. He carved this himself. It hung on the wall above the pulpit in the vicarage where he preached.\" I wasn't sure if my face betrayed my shock, but I returned to gazing at the simple, ancient cross, just in case. I quickly did the mental math; the cross was over three hundred and seventy years old. The silence stretched on as I struggled to wrap my mind around the concept of so many years. \"Are you all right?\u201dHe sounded worried. \"How old is Carlisle?\" I asked quietly, ignoring his question, still staring up. \"He just celebrated his three hundred and sixty-second birthday,\u201dEdward said. I looked back at him, a million questions in my eyes. He watched me carefully as he spoke. \"Carlisle was born in London, in the sixteen-forties, he believes. Time wasn't marked as accurately then, for the common people anyway. It was just before Cromwell's rule, though.\" I kept my face composed, aware of his scrutiny as I listened. It was easier if I didn't try to believe. \"He was the only son of an Anglican pastor. His mother died giving birth to him. His father was an intolerant man. As the Protestants came into power, he was enthusiastic in his persecution of Roman Catholics and other religions. He also believed very strongly in the reality of evil. He led hunts for witches, werewolves\u2026 and vampires.\" I grew very still at the word. I'm sure he noticed, but he went on without pausing. \"They burned a lot of innocent people \u2014 of course the real creatures that he sought were not so easy to catch. \"When the pastor grew old, he placed his obedient son in charge of the raids. At first Carlisle was a disappointment; he was not quick to accuse, to see demons where they did not exist. But he was persistent, and more clever than his father. He actually discovered a coven of true vampires that lived hidden in the sewers of the city, only coming out by night to hunt. In those days, when monsters were not just myths and legends, that was the way many lived. \"The people gathered their pitchforks and torches, of course\" \u2014 his brief laugh was darker now \u2014 \"and waited where Carlisle had seen the monsters exit into the street. Eventually one emerged.\" His voice was very quiet; I strained to catch the words. \"He must have been ancient, and weak with hunger. Carlisle heard him call out in Latin to the others when he caught the scent of the mob. He ran through the streets, and Carlisle \u2014 he was twenty-three and very fast \u2014 was in the lead of the pursuit. The creature could have easily outrun them, but Carlisle thinks he was too hungry, so he turned and attacked. He fell on Carlisle first, but the others were close behind, and he turned to defend himself. He killed two men, and made off with a third, leaving Carlisle bleeding in the street.\" He paused. I could sense he was editing something, keeping something from me. \"Carlisle knew what his father would do. The bodies would be burned \u2014 anything infected by the monster must be destroyed. Carlisle acted instinctively to save his own life. He crawled away from the alley while the mob followed the fiend and his victim. He hid in a cellar, buried himself in rotting potatoes for three days. It's a miracle he was able to keep silent, to stay undiscovered. \"It was over then, and he realized what he had become.\" I'm not sure what my face was revealing, but he suddenly broke off. \"How are you feeling?\u201dHe asked. \"I'm fine,\" I assured him. And, though I bit my lip in hesitation, he must have seen the curiosity burning in my eyes. He smiled. \"I expect you have a few more questions for me.\" \"A few.\" His smile widened over his brilliant teeth. He started back down the hall, pulling me along by the hand. \"Come on, then,\u201dHe encouraged. \"I'll show you.\"",
