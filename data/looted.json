Chief Constable Jim Chu blamed the violence on \"anarchists and criminals\" and said police had seized weapons. Cars were set on fire and shops were <em>looted</em> following Vancouver Canucks' 4-0 defeat to the Boston Bruins. Residents said they were embarrassed at the spectacle, and volunteers helped clean up the mess on Thursday morning. \"I woke up today to read all the news reports about just how much Vancouver embarrassed ourselves yesterday,\" Barrett Nash told CBC News. \"And I thought just before going to work I could just help clean up a bit. So I went downstairs, grabbed some garbage bags and gloves, and I am trying to help clean up.\" Record crowds of supporters had gathered in the heart of the city on Wednesday in the hope of seeing the Canucks - the favourites - secure the Stanley Cup and be crowned winners of the National Hockey League (NHL). But hope quickly turned to gloom after the Boston Bruins scored first and then went on to secure a comfortable victory. Officers injured People chanted obscenities, and witnesses said some people took out their anger on nearby cars. Fifteen vehicles were burned, including two police vehicles, Chief Constable Chu said. Shop windows were smashed, with the stores then <em>looted</em>. Chief Constable Chu said nine police officers were injured, including one who needed 14 stitches to close a wound suffered when a brick was thrown at his head. Members of the public had sent in numerous tips identifying looters and rioters, and investigators had also gathered video footage and still photos shot by people in the crowd, he said at a news conference on Thursday. Some fans were seen trying to hold back more unruly members of the crowd, without much success. Fans also rioted in 1994 after the Canucks lost the Stanley Cup series, and Chief Constable Chu rejected criticism police were unready or failed to take aggressive action once the rioting started. \"When a crowd is this large, it is difficult to go and pick off the instigators and troublemakers,\" he told reporters.  \"That is what we encountered that night. The crowd was very, very large. At the live sites there was a plan to create corridors for people to get through but they were quickly taken over.  \"Those criminals and anarchists hide behind the large number of people. They were looking for that opportunity.\"",

When local people there came out to protest last week, they were fired on from a huge army base in the centre of the city with heavy artillery, including anti-aircraft guns. In response, they simply took on the army, with homemade petrol bombs. They loaded construction site vehicles with petrol and rammed them against the walls of the barracks, and ground down the troops inside. After two or three days of bitter fighting - with the aid of some defection from the government side - they took the base, defeating some of the country's most elite forces. It is now a kind of local tourist attraction, people are wandering around looking at what was inside. 'Gunfire all around'  By Monday, Benghazi was safely in opposition hands but it is tense because of the bitterness of the fighting. People say 300 protesters and 120 members of the government forces were killed.  There is also a worry that government supporters may be hunkered down here, hoping for better days, and that prisoners have escaped and may loot. Benghazi is now in the control of a committee of judges, lawyers, business people and academics. They are running the city from the local court house. They have put up signs everywhere urging people to go back to work - urging bakers and pharmacists, even government employees to get the place going again. And on the face of it, it does seem to be working. Someone joked that the traffic is running more smoothly, and people driving more carefully, than they were under Col Gaddafi. Some people from the city have armed themselves with <em>looted</em> weapons. Those people are now heading west, to oust Col Gaddafi's forces from their remaining strongholds in the rest of the country. Benghazi is also a big centre for the evacuation of foreign nationals. There are thousands and thousands of foreigners of all nationalities at the port. As word spread that the British Navy frigate HMS Cumberland was arriving there, British citizens began arriving from across Libya. Despite criticism of the British government's slow response to the crisis, the commander of the ship, Cpt Steve Dainton, said they had made all speed to get here. \"From all points of view we've reacted very quickly,\" he said.  \"In that time from three days ago we've managed to head up to Crete, take a suck of fuel, embark a whole heap of stores and extra personnel and be down here, which I think is a pretty fast response.\" Some workers had travelled hundreds of miles from remote desert compounds in southern Libya, some had just come from the city. All were delighted the Royal Navy had come to rescue them. Sue Rogers said she had been in Benghazi itself, and heard the battles. \"It was gunfire all around,\" she told the BBC. \"All the smoke was happening at the military installations all around. It started off just with simple gunfire and then it got worse, with heavy artillery fire.\" HMS Cumberland took around 200 British Nationals out of Libya. There are also other, larger ships taking nationals, particularly from East Asia and also Turkish nationals - three large ships taking them out from here.",
