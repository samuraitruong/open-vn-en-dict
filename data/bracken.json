            "en": "17         17. THE GAME It was just beginning to drizzle when Edward turned onto my street. Up until that moment, I'd had no doubt that he'd be staying with me while I spent a few interim hours in the real world. And then I saw the black car, a weathered Ford, parked in Charlie's driveway \u2014 and heard Edward mutter something unintelligible in a low, harsh voice. Leaning away from the rain under the shallow front porch, Jacob Black stood behind his father's wheelchair. Billy's face was impassive as stone as Edward parked my truck against the curb. Jacob stared down, his expression mortified. Edward's low voice was furious. \"This is crossing the line.\" \"He came to warn Charlie?\" I guessed, more horrified than angry. Edward just nodded, answering Billy's gaze through the rain with narrowed eyes. I felt weak with relief that Charlie wasn't home yet. \"Let me deal with this,\" I suggested. Edward's black glare made me anxious. To my surprise, he agreed. \"That's probably best. Be careful, though. The child has no idea.\" I bridled a little at the word child. \"Jacob is not that much younger than I am,\" I reminded him. He looked at me then, his anger abruptly fading. \"Oh, I know,\" he assured me with a grin. I sighed and put my hand on the door handle. \"Get them inside,\" he instructed, \"so I can leave. I'll be back around dusk.\" \"Do you want my truck?\" I offered, meanwhile wondering how I would explain its absence to Charlie. He rolled his eyes. \"I could walk home faster than this truck moves.\" \"You don't have to leave,\" I said wistfully. He smiled at my glum expression. \"Actually, I do. After you get rid of them\" \u2014 he threw a dark glance in the Blacks' direction \u2014 \"you still have to prepare Charlie to meet your new boyfriend.\" He grinned widely, showing all of his teeth. I groaned. \"Thanks a lot.\" He smiled the crooked smile that I loved. \"I'll be back soon,\" he promised. His eyes flickered back to the porch, and then he leaned in to swiftly kiss me just under the edge of my jaw. My heart lurched frantically, and I, too, glanced toward the porch. Billy's face was no longer impassive, and his hands clutched at the armrests of his chair. \"Soon,\" I stressed as I opened the door and stepped out into the rain. I could feel his eyes on my back as I half-ran through the light sprinkle toward the porch. \"Hey, Billy. Hi, Jacob.\" I greeted them as cheerfully as I could manage. \"Charlie's gone for the day \u2014 I hope you haven't been waiting long.\" \"Not long,\" Billy said in a subdued tone. His black eyes were piercing. \"I just wanted to bring this up.\" He indicated a brown paper sack resting in his lap. \"Thanks,\" I said, though I had no idea what it could be. \"Why don't you come in for a minute and dry off?\" I pretended to be oblivious to his intense scrutiny as I unlocked the door, and waved them in ahead of me. \"Here, let me take that,\" I offered, turning to shut the door. I allowed myself one last glance at Edward. He was waiting, perfectly still, his eyes solemn. \"You'll want to put it in the fridge,\" Billy noted as he handed me the package. \"It's some of Harry Clearwater's homemade fish fry \u2014 Charlie's favorite. The fridge keeps it drier.\" He shrugged. \"Thanks,\" I repeated, but with feeling this time. \"I was running out of new ways to fix fish, and he's bound to bring home more tonight.\" \"Fishing again?\" Billy asked with a subtle gleam in his eye. \"Down at the usual spot? Maybe I'll run by and see him.\" \"No,\" I quickly lied, my face going hard. \"He was headed someplace new\u2026 but I have no idea where.\" He took in my changed expression, and it made him thoughtful. \"Jake,\" he said, still appraising me. \"Why don't you go get that new picture of Rebecca out of the car? I'll leave that for Charlie, too.\" \"Where is it?\" Jacob asked, his voice morose. I glanced at him, but he was staring at the floor, his eyebrows pulling together. \"I think I saw it in the trunk,\" Billy said. \"You may have to dig for it.\" Jacob slouched back out into the rain. Billy and I faced each other in silence. After a few seconds, the quiet started to feel awkward, so I turned and headed to the kitchen. I could hear his wet wheels squeak against the linoleum as he followed. I shoved the bag onto the crowded top shelf of the fridge, and spun around to confront him. His deeply lined face was unreadable. \"Charlie won't be back for a long time.\" My voice was almost rude. He nodded in agreement, but said nothing. \"Thanks again for the fish fry,\" I hinted. He continued nodding. I sighed and folded my arms across my chest. He seemed to sense that I had given up on small talk. \"Bella,\" he said, and then he hesitated. I waited. \"Bella,\" he said again, \"Charlie is one of my best friends.\" \"Yes.\" He spoke each word carefully in his rumbling voice. \"I noticed you've been spending time with one of the Cullens.\" \"Yes,\" I repeated curtly. His eyes narrowed. \"Maybe it's none of my business, but I don't think that is such a good idea.\" \"You're right,\" I agreed. \"It is none of your business.\" He raised his graying eyebrows at my tone. \"You probably don't know this, but the Cullen family has an unpleasant reputation on the reservation.\" \"Actually, I did know that,\" I informed him in a hard voice. This surprised him. \"But that reputation couldn't be deserved, could it?\u00a0 Because the Cullens never set foot on the reservation, do they?\" I could see that my less than subtle reminder of the agreement that both bound and protected his tribe pulled him up short. \"That's true,\" he acceded, his eyes guarded. \"You seem\u2026 well informed about the Cullens. More informed than I expected.\" I stared him down. \"Maybe even better informed than you are.\" He pursed his thick lips as he considered that. \"Maybe.\" he allowed, but his eyes were shrewd. \"Is Charlie as well informed?\" He had found the weak chink in my armor. \"Charlie likes the Cullens a lot,\" I hedged. He clearly understood my evasion. His expression was unhappy, but unsurprised. \"It's not my business,\" he said. \"But it may be Charlie's.\" \"Though it would be my business, again, whether or not I think that it's Charlie's business, right?\" I wondered if he even understood my confused question as I struggled not to say anything compromising. But he seemed to. He thought about it while the rain picked up against the roof, the only sound breaking the silence. \"Yes,\" he finally surrendered. \"I guess that's your business, too.\" I sighed with relief. \"Thanks, Billy.\" \"Just think about what you're doing, Bella,\" he urged. \"Okay,\" I agreed quickly. He frowned. \"What I meant to say was, don't do what you're doing.\" I looked into his eyes, filled with nothing but concern for me, and there was nothing I could say. Just then the front door banged loudly, and I jumped at the sound. \"There's no picture anywhere in that car.\" Jacob's complaining voice reached us before he did. The shoulders of his shirt were stained with the rain, his hair dripping, when he rounded the corner. \"Hmm,\" Billy grunted, suddenly detached, spinning his chair around to face his son. \"I guess I left it at home.\" Jacob rolled his eyes dramatically. \"Great.\" \"Well, Bella, tell Charlie\" \u2014 Billy paused before continuing \u2014 \"that we stopped by, I mean.\" \"I will,\" I muttered. Jacob was surprised. \"Are we leaving already?\" \"Charlie's gonna be out late,\" Billy explained as he rolled himself past Jacob. \"Oh.\" Jacob looked disappointed. \"Well, I guess I'll see you later, then, Bella.\" \"Sure,\" I agreed. \"Take care,\" Billy warned me. I didn't answer. Jacob helped his father out the door. I waved briefly, glancing swiftly toward my now-empty truck, and then shut the door before they were gone. I stood in the hallway for a minute, listening to the sound of their car as it backed out and drove away. I stayed where I was, waiting for the irritation and anxiety to subside. When the tension eventually faded a bit, I headed upstairs to change out of my dressy clothes. I tried on a couple of different tops, not sure what to expect tonight. As I concentrated on what was coming, what had just passed became insignificant. Now that I was removed from Jasper's and Edward's influence, I began to make up for not being terrified before. I gave up quickly on choosing an outfit \u2014 throwing on an old flannel shirt and jeans \u2014 knowing I would be in my raincoat all night anyway. The phone rang and I sprinted downstairs to get it. There was only one voice I wanted to hear; anything else would be a disappointment. But I knew that if he wanted to talk to me, he'd probably just materialize in my room. \"Hello?\" I asked, breathless. \"Bella? It's me,\" Jessica said. \"Oh, hey, Jess.\" I scrambled for a moment to come back down to reality. It felt like months rather than days since I'd spoken to Jess. \"How was the dance?\" \"It was so much fun!\" Jessica gushed. Needing no more invitation than that, she launched into a minute-by-minute account of the previous night. I mmm'd and ahh'd at the right places, but it wasn't easy to concentrate. Jessica, Mike, the dance, the school \u2014 they all seemed strangely irrelevant at the moment. My eyes kept flashing to the window, trying to judge the degree of light behind the heavy clouds. \"Did you hear what I said, Bella?\" Jess asked, irritated. \"I'm sorry, what?\" \"I said, Mike kissed me! Can you believe it?\" \"That's wonderful, Jess,\" I said. \"So what did you do yesterday?\" Jessica challenged, still sounding bothered by my lack of attention. Or maybe she was upset because I hadn't asked for details. \"Nothing, really. I just hung around outside to enjoy the sun.\" I heard Charlie's car in the garage. \"Did you ever hear anything more from Edward Cullen?\" The front door slammed and I could hear Charlie banging around under the stairs, putting his tackle away. \"Um.\" I hesitated, not sure what my story was anymore. \"Hi there, kiddo!\" Charlie called as he walked into the kitchen. I waved at him. Jess heard his voice. \"Oh, your dad's there. Never mind \u2014 we'll talk tomorrow. See you in Trig.\" \"See ya, Jess.\" I hung up the phone. \"Hey, Dad,\" I said. He was scrubbing his hands in the sink. \"Where's the fish?\" \"I put it out in the freezer.\" \"I'll go grab a few pieces before they freeze \u2014 Billy dropped off some of Harry Clearwater's fish fry this afternoon.\" I worked to sound enthusiastic. \"He did?\" Charlie's eyes lit up. \"That's my favorite.\" Charlie cleaned up while I got dinner ready. It didn't take long till we were sitting at the table, eating in silence. Charlie was enjoying his food. I was wondering desperately how to fulfill my assignment, struggling to think of a way to broach the subject. \"What did you do with yourself today?\" he asked, snapping me out of my reverie. \"Well, this afternoon I just hung out around the house\u2026\" Only the very recent part of this afternoon, actually. I tried to keep my voice upbeat, but my stomach was hollow. \"And this morning I was over at the Cullens'.\" Charlie dropped his fork. \"Dr. Cullen's place?\" he asked in astonishment. I pretended not to notice his reaction. \"Yeah.\" \"What were you doing there?\" He hadn't picked his fork back up. \"Well, I sort of have a date with Edward Cullen tonight, and he wanted to introduce me to his parents\u2026 Dad?\" It appeared that Charlie was having an aneurysm. \"Dad, are you all right?\" \"You are going out with Edward Cullen?\" he thundered. Uh-oh. \"I thought you liked the Cullens.\" \"He's too old for you,\" he ranted. \"We're both juniors,\" I corrected, though he was more right than he dreamed. \"Wait\u2026\" He paused. \"Which one is Edwin?\" \"Edward is the youngest, the one with the reddish brown hair.\" The beautiful one, the godlike one\u2026 \"Oh, well, that's\" \u2014 he struggled \u2014 \"better, I guess. I don't like the look of that big one. I'm sure he's a nice boy and all, but he looks too\u2026 mature for you. Is this Edwin your boyfriend?\" \"It's Edward, Dad.\" \"Is he?\" \"Sort of, I guess.\" \"You said last night that you weren't interested in any of the boys in town.\" But he picked up his fork again, so I could see the worst was over. \"Well, Edward doesn't live in town, Dad.\" He gave me a disparaging look as he chewed. \"And, anyways,\" I continued, \"it's kind of at an early stage, you know.\u00a0 Don't embarrass me with all the boyfriend talk, okay?\" \"When is he coming over?\" \"He'll be here in a few minutes.\" \"Where is he taking you?\" I groaned loudly. \"I hope you're getting the Spanish Inquisition out of your system now. We're going to play baseball with his family.\" His face puckered, and then he finally chuckled. \"You're playing baseball?\" \"Well, I'll probably watch most of the time.\" \"You must really like this guy,\" he observed suspiciously. I sighed and rolled my eyes for his benefit. I heard the roar of an engine pull up in front of the house. I jumped up and started cleaning my dishes. \"Leave the dishes, I can do them tonight. You baby me too much.\" The doorbell rang, and Charlie stalked off to answer it. I was half a step behind him. I hadn't realized how hard it was pouring outside. Edward stood in the halo of the porch light, looking like a male model in an advertisement for raincoats. \"Come on in, Edward.\" I breathed a sigh of relief when Charlie got his name right. \"Thanks, Chief Swan,\" Edward said in a respectful voice. \"Go ahead and call me Charlie. Here, I'll take your jacket.\" \"Thanks, sir.\" \"Have a seat there, Edward.\" I grimaced. Edward sat down fluidly in the only chair, forcing me to sit next to Chief Swan on the sofa. I quickly shot him a dirty look. He winked behind Charlie's back. \"So I hear you're getting my girl to watch baseball.\" Only in Washington would the fact that it was raining buckets have no bearing at all on the playing of outdoor sports. \"Yes, sir, that's the plan.\" He didn't look surprised that I'd told my father the truth. He might have been listening, though. \"Well, more power to you, I guess.\" Charlie laughed, and Edward joined in. \"Okay.\" I stood up. \"Enough humor at my expense. Let's go.\" I walked back to the hall and pulled on my jacket. They followed. \"Not too late, Bell.\" \"Don't worry, Charlie, I'll have her home early,\" Edward promised. \"You take care of my girl, all right?\" I groaned, but they ignored me. \"She'll be safe with me, I promise, sir.\" Charlie couldn't doubt Edward's sincerity, it rang in every word. I stalked out. They both laughed, and Edward followed me. I stopped dead on the porch. There, behind my truck, was a monster Jeep. Its tires were higher than my waist. There were metal guards over the headlights and tail-lights, and four large spotlights attached to the crash bar. The hardtop was shiny red. Charlie let out a low whistle. \"Wear your seat belts,\" he choked out. Edward followed me around to my side and opened the door. I gauged the distance to the seat and prepared to jump for it. He sighed, and then lifted me in with one hand. I hoped Charlie didn't notice. As he went around to the driver's side, at a normal, human pace, I tried to put on my seat belt. But there were too many buckles. \"What's all this?\" I asked when he opened the door. \"It's an off-roading harness.\" \"Uh-oh.\" I tried to find the right places for all the buckles to fit, but it wasn't going too quickly. He sighed again and reached over to help me. I was glad that the rain was too heavy to see Charlie clearly on the porch. That meant he couldn't see how Edward's hands lingered at my neck, brushed along my collarbones. I gave up trying to help him and focused on not hyperventilating. Edward turned the key and the engine roared to life. We pulled away from the house. \"This is a\u2026 um\u2026 big Jeep you have.\" \"It's Emmett's. I didn't think you'd want to run the whole way.\" \"Where do you keep this thing?\" \"We remodeled one of the outbuildings into a garage.\" \"Aren't you going to put on your seat belt?\" He threw me a disbelieving look. Then something sunk in. \"Run the whole way? As in, we're still going to run part of the way?\" My voice edged up a few octaves. He grinned tightly. \"You're not going to run.\" \"I'm going to be sick.\" \"Keep your eyes closed, you'll be fine.\" I bit my lip, fighting the panic. He leaned over to kiss the top of my head, and then groaned. I looked at him, puzzled. \"You smell so good in the rain,\" he explained. \"In a good way, or in a bad way?\" I asked cautiously. He sighed. \"Both, always both.\" I don't know how he found his way in the gloom and downpour, but he somehow found a side road that was less of a road and more of a mountain path. For a long while conversation was impossible, because I was bouncing up and down on the seat like a jackhammer. He seemed to enjoy the ride, though, smiling hugely the whole way. And then we came to the end of the road; the trees formed green walls on three sides of the Jeep. The rain was a mere drizzle, slowing every second, the sky brighter through the clouds. \"Sorry, Bella, we have to go on foot from here.\" \"You know what? I'll just wait here.\" \"What happened to all your courage? You were extraordinary this morning.\" \"I haven't forgotten the last time yet.\" Could it have been only yesterday? He was around to my side of the car in a blur. He started unbuckling me. \"I'll get those, you go on ahead,\" I protested. \"Hmmm\u2026\" he mused as he quickly finished. \"It seems I'm going to have to tamper with your memory.\" Before I could react, he pulled me from the Jeep and set my feet on the ground. It was barely misting now; Alice was going to be right. \"Tamper with my memory?\" I asked nervously. \"Something like that.\" He was watching me intently, carefully, but there was humor deep in his eyes. He placed his hands against the Jeep on either side of my head and leaned forward, forcing me to press back against the door. He leaned in even closer, his face inches from mine. I had no room to escape. \"Now,\" he breathed, and just his smell disturbed my thought processes, \"what exactly are you worrying about?\" \"Well, um, hitting a tree \u2014\" I gulped \"\u2014 and dying. And then getting sick.\" He fought back a smile. Then he bent his head down and touched his cold lips softly to the hollow at the base of my throat. \"Are you still worried now?\" he murmured against my skin. \"Yes.\" I struggled to concentrate. \"About hitting trees and getting sick.\" His nose drew a line up the skin of my throat to the point of my chin. His cold breath tickled my skin. \"And now?\" His lips whispered against my jaw. \"Trees,\" I gasped. \"Motion sickness.\" He lifted his face to kiss my eyelids. \"Bella, you don't really think I would hit a tree, do you?\" \"No, but I might.\" There was no confidence in my voice. He smelled an easy victory. He kissed slowly down my cheek, stopping just at the corner of my mouth. \"Would I let a tree hurt you?\" His lips barely brushed against my trembling lower lip. \"No,\" I breathed. I knew there was a second part to my brilliant defense, but I couldn't quite call it back. \"You see,\" he said, his lips moving against mine. \"There's nothing to be afraid of, is there?\" \"No,\" I sighed, giving up. Then he took my face in his hands almost roughly, and kissed me in earnest, his unyielding lips moving against mine. There really was no excuse for my behavior. Obviously I knew better by now. And yet I couldn't seem to stop from reacting exactly as I had the first time. Instead of keeping safely motionless, my arms reached up to twine tightly around his neck, and I was suddenly welded to his stone figure. I sighed, and my lips parted. He staggered back, breaking my grip effortlessly. \"Damn it, Bella!\" he broke off, gasping. \"You'll be the death of me, I swear you will.\" I leaned over, bracing my hands against my knees for support. \"You're indestructible,\" I mumbled, trying to catch my breath. \"I might have believed that before I met you. Now let's get out of here before I do something really stupid,\" he growled. He threw me across his back as he had before, and I could see the extra effort it took for him to be as gentle as he was. I locked my legs around his waist and secured my arms in a choke hold around his neck. \"Don't forget to close your eyes,\" he warned severely. I quickly tucked my face into his shoulder blade, under my own arm, and squeezed my eyes shut. And I could hardly tell we were moving. I could feel him gliding along beneath me, but he could have been strolling down the sidewalk, the movement was so smooth. I was tempted to peek, just to see if he was really flying through the forest like before, but I resisted. It wasn't worth that awful dizziness. I contented myself with listening to his breath come and go evenly. I wasn't quite sure we had stopped until he reached back and touched my hair. \"It's over, Bella.\" I dared to open my eyes, and, sure enough, we were at a standstill. I stiffly unlocked my stranglehold on his body and slipped to the ground, landing on my backside. \"Oh!\" I huffed as I hit the wet ground. He stared at me incredulously, evidently not sure whether he was still too mad to find me funny. But my bewildered expression pushed him over the edge, and he broke into a roar of laughter. I picked myself up, ignoring him as I brushed the mud and <em>bracken</em> off the back of my jacket. That only made him laugh harder. Annoyed, I began to stride off into the forest. I felt his arm around my waist. \"Where are you going, Bella?\" \"To watch a baseball game. You don't seem to be interested in playing anymore, but I'm sure the others will have fun without you.\" \"You're going the wrong way.\" I turned around without looking at him, and stalked off in the opposite direction. He caught me again. \"Don't be mad, I couldn't help myself. You should have seen your face.\" He chuckled before he could stop himself. \"Oh, you're the only one who's allowed to get mad?\" I asked, raising my eyebrows. \"I wasn't mad at you.\" \"'Bella, you'll be the death of me'?\" I quoted sourly. \"That was simply a statement of fact.\" I tried to turn away from him again, but he held me fast. \"You were mad,\" I insisted. \"Yes.\" \"But you just said \u2014\" \"That I wasn't mad at you. Can't you see that, Bella?\" He was suddenly intense, all trace of teasing gone. \"Don't you understand?\" \"See what?\" I demanded, confused by his sudden mood swing as much as his words. \"I'm never angry with you \u2014 how could I be? Brave, trusting\u2026 warm as you are.\" \"Then why?\" I whispered, remembering the black moods that pulled him away from me, that I'd always interpreted as well-justified frustration \u2014 frustration at my weakness, my slowness, my unruly human reactions\u2026 He put his hands carefully on both sides of my face. \"I infuriate myself,\" he said gently. \"The way I can't seem to keep from putting you in danger. My very existence puts you at risk. Sometimes I truly hate myself. I should be stronger, I should be able to \u2014\"  I placed my hand over his mouth. \"Don't.\" He took my hand, moving it from his lips, but holding it to his face. \"I love you,\" he said. \"It's a poor excuse for what I'm doing, but it's still true.\" It was the first time he'd said he loved me \u2014 in so many words. He might not realize it, but I certainly did. \"Now, please try to behave yourself,\" he continued, and he bent to softly brush his lips against mine. I held properly still. Then I sighed. \"You promised Chief Swan that you would have me home early, remember? We'd better get going.\" \"Yes, ma'am.\" He smiled wistfully and released all of me but one hand. He led me a few feet through the tall, wet ferns and draping moss, around a massive hemlock tree, and we were there, on the edge of an enormous open field in the lap of the Olympic peaks. It was twice the size of any baseball stadium. I could see the others all there; Esme, Emmett, and Rosalie, sitting on a bare outcropping of rock, were the closest to us, maybe a hundred yards away. Much farther out I could see Jasper and Alice, at least a quarter of a mile apart, appearing to throw something back and forth, but I never saw any ball. It looked like Carlisle was marking bases, but could they really be that far apart? When we came into view, the three on the rocks rose. Esme started toward us. Emmett followed after a long look at Rosalie's back; Rosalie had risen gracefully and strode off toward the field without a glance in our direction. My stomach quivered uneasily in response. \"Was that you we heard, Edward?\" Esme asked as she approached. \"It sounded like a bear choking,\" Emmett clarified. I smiled hesitantly at Esme. \"That was him.\" \"Bella was being unintentionally funny,\" Edward explained, quickly settling the score. Alice had left her position and was running, or dancing, toward us. She hurtled to a fluid stop at our feet. \"It's time,\" she announced. As soon as she spoke, a deep rumble of thunder shook the forest beyond us, and then crashed westward toward town. \"Eerie, isn't it?\" Emmett said with easy familiarity, winking at me. \"Let's go.\" Alice reached for Emmett's hand and they darted toward the oversized field; she ran like a gazelle. He was nearly as graceful and just as fast \u2014 yet Emmett could never be compared to a gazelle. \"Are you ready for some ball?\" Edward asked, his eyes eager, bright. I tried to sound appropriately enthusiastic. \"Go team!\" He snickered and, after mussing my hair, bounded off after the other two. His run was more aggressive, a cheetah rather than a gazelle, and he quickly overtook them. The grace and power took my breath away. \"Shall we go down?\" Esme asked in her soft, melodic voice, and I realized I was staring openmouthed after him. I quickly reassembled my expression and nodded. Esme kept a few feet between us, and I wondered if she was still being careful not to frighten me. She matched her stride to mine without seeming impatient at the pace.  \"You don't play with them?\" I asked shyly. \"No, I prefer to referee \u2014 I like keeping them honest,\" she explained. \"Do they like to cheat, then?\" \"Oh yes \u2014 you should hear the arguments they get into! Actually, I hope you don't, you would think they were raised by a pack of wolves.\" \"You sound like my mom,\" I laughed, surprised. She laughed, too. \"Well, I do think of them as my children in most ways. I never could get over my mothering instincts \u2014 did Edward tell you I had lost a child?\" \"No,\" I murmured, stunned, scrambling to understand what lifetime she was remembering. \"Yes, my first and only baby. He died just a few days after he was born, the poor tiny thing,\" she sighed. \"It broke my heart \u2014 that's why I jumped off the cliff, you know,\" she added matter-of-factly. \"Edward just said you f-fell,\" I stammered. \"Always the gentleman.\" She smiled. \"Edward was the first of my new sons. I've always thought of him that way, even though he's older than I, in one way at least.\" She smiled at me warmly. \"That's why I'm so happy that he's found you, dear.\" The endearment sounded very natural on her lips. \"He's been the odd man out for far too long; it's hurt me to see him alone.\" \"You don't mind, then?\" I asked, hesitant again. \"That I'm\u2026 all wrong for him?\" \"No.\" She was thoughtful. \"You're what he wants. It will work out, somehow,\" she said, though her forehead creased with worry. Another peal of thunder began. Esme stopped then; apparently, we'd reached the edge of the field. It looked as if they had formed teams. Edward was far out in left field, Carlisle stood between the first and second bases, and Alice held the ball, positioned on the spot that must be the pitcher's mound. Emmett was swinging an aluminum bat; it whistled almost untraceably through the air. I waited for him to approach home plate, but then I realized, as he took his stance, that he was already there \u2014 farther from the pitcher's mound than I would have thought possible. Jasper stood several feet behind him, catching for the other team. Of course, none of them had gloves. \"All right,\" Esme called in a clear voice, which I knew even Edward would hear, as far out as he was. \"Batter up.\" Alice stood straight, deceptively motionless. Her style seemed to be stealth rather than an intimidating windup. She held the ball in both hands at her waist, and then, like the strike of a cobra, her right hand flicked out and the ball smacked into Jasper's hand. \"Was that a strike?\" I whispered to Esme. \"If they don't hit it, it's a strike,\" she told me. Jasper hurled the ball back to Alice's waiting hand. She permitted herself a brief grin. And then her hand spun out again. This time the bat somehow made it around in time to smash into the invisible ball. The crack of impact was shattering, thunderous; it echoed off the mountains \u2014 I immediately understood the necessity of the thunderstorm. The ball shot like a meteor above the field, flying deep into the surrounding forest. \"Home run,\" I murmured. \"Wait,\" Esme cautioned, listening intently, one hand raised. Emmett was a blur around the bases, Carlisle shadowing him. I realized Edward was missing. \"Out!\" Esme cried in a clear voice. I stared in disbelief as Edward sprang from the fringe of the trees, ball in his upraised hand, his wide grin visible even to me. \"Emmett hits the hardest,\" Esme explained, \"but Edward runs the fastest.\" The inning continued before my incredulous eyes. It was impossible to keep up with the speed at which the ball flew, the rate at which their bodies raced around the field. I learned the other reason they waited for a thunderstorm to play when Jasper, trying to avoid Edward's infallible fielding, hit a ground ball toward Carlisle. Carlisle ran into the ball, and then raced Jasper to first base. When they collided, the sound was like the crash of two massive falling boulders. I jumped up in concern, but they were somehow unscathed. \"Safe,\" Esme called in a calm voice. Emmett's team was up by one \u2014 Rosalie managed to flit around the bases after tagging up on one of Emmett's long flies \u2014 when Edward caught the third out. He sprinted to my side, sparkling with excitement. \"What do you think?\" he asked. \"One thing's for sure, I'll never be able to sit through dull old Major League Baseball again.\" \"And it sounds like you did so much of that before,\" he laughed. \"I am a little disappointed,\" I teased. \"Why?\" he asked, puzzled. \"Well, it would be nice if I could find just one thing you didn't do better than everyone else on the planet.\" He flashed his special crooked smile, leaving me breathless. \"I'm up,\" he said, heading for the plate. He played intelligently, keeping the ball low, out of the reach of Rosalie's always-ready hand in the outfield, gaining two bases like lightning before Emmett could get the ball back in play. Carlisle knocked one so far out of the field \u2014 with a boom that hurt my ears \u2014 that he and Edward both made it in. Alice slapped them dainty high fives. The score constantly changed as the game continued, and they razzed each other like any street ballplayers as they took turns with the lead. Occasionally Esme would call them to order. The thunder rumbled on, but we stayed dry, as Alice had predicted. Carlisle was up to bat, Edward catching, when Alice suddenly gasped. My eyes were on Edward, as usual, and I saw his head snap up to look at her. Their eyes met and something flowed between them in an instant. He was at my side before the others could ask Alice what was wrong. \"Alice?\" Esme's voice was tense. \"I didn't see \u2014 I couldn't tell,\" she whispered. All the others were gathered by this time. \"What is it, Alice?\" Carlisle asked with the calm voice of authority. \"They were traveling much quicker than I thought. I can see I had the perspective wrong before,\" she murmured. Jasper leaned over her, his posture protective. \"What changed?\" he asked. \"They heard us playing, and it changed their path,\" she said, contrite, as if she felt responsible for whatever had frightened her. Seven pairs of quick eyes flashed to my face and away. \"How soon?\" Carlisle said, turning toward Edward. A look of intense concentration crossed his face. \"Less than five minutes. They're running \u2014 they want to play.\" He scowled. \"Can you make it?\" Carlisle asked him, his eyes flicking toward me again. \"No, not carrying \u2014\" He cut short. \"Besides, the last thing we need is for them to catch the scent and start hunting.\" \"How many?\" Emmett asked Alice. \"Three,\" she answered tersely. \"Three!\" he scoffed. \"Let them come.\" The steel bands of muscle flexed along his massive arms. For a split second that seemed much longer than it really was, Carlisle deliberated. Only Emmett seemed unperturbed; the rest stared at Carlisle's face with anxious eyes. \"Let's just continue the game,\" Carlisle finally decided. His voice was cool and level. \"Alice said they were simply curious.\" All this was said in a flurry of words that lasted only a few seconds. I had listened carefully and caught most of it, though I couldn't hear what Esme now asked Edward with a silent vibration of her lips. I only saw the slight shake of his head and the look of relief on her face. \"You catch, Esme,\" he said. \"I'll call it now.\" And he planted himself in front of me. The others returned to the field, warily sweeping the dark forest with their sharp eyes. Alice and Esme seemed to orient themselves around where I stood. \"Take your hair down,\" Edward said in a low, even voice. I obediently slid the rubber band out of my hair and shook it out around me. I stated the obvious. \"The others are coming now.\" \"Yes, stay very still, keep quiet, and don't move from my side, please.\" He hid the stress in his voice well, but I could hear it. He pulled my long hair forward, around my face. \"That won't help,\" Alice said softly. \"I could smell her across the field.\" \"I know.\" A hint of frustration colored his tone. Carlisle stood at the plate, and the others joined the game halfheartedly. \"What did Esme ask you?\" I whispered. He hesitated for a second before he answered. \"Whether they were thirsty,\" he muttered unwillingly. The seconds ticked by; the game progressed with apathy now. No one dared to hit harder than a bunt, and Emmett, Rosalie, and Jasper hovered in the infield.  Now and again, despite the fear that numbed my brain, I was aware of Rosalie's eyes on me. They were expressionless, but something about the way she held her mouth made me think she was angry. Edward paid no attention to the game at all, eyes and mind ranging the forest. \"I'm sorry, Bella,\" he muttered fiercely. \"It was stupid, irresponsible, to expose you like this. I'm so sorry.\" I heard his breath stop, and his eyes zeroed in on right field. He took a half step, angling himself between me and what was coming. Carlisle, Emmett, and the others turned in the same direction, hearing sounds of passage much too faint for my ears.",

            "en": "3          3. THE END I FELT ABSOLUTELY HIDEOUS IN THE MORNING. I HADN'T slept well; my arm burned and my head ached. It didn't help my outlook that Edward's face was smooth and remote as he kissed my forehead quickly and ducked out my window. I was afraid of the time I'd spent unconscious, afraid that he might have been thinking about right and wrong again while he watched me sleep. The anxiety seemed to ratchet up the intensity of the pounding in my head. Edward was waiting for me at school, as usual, but his face was still wrong. There was something buried in his eyes that I couldn't be sure of\u2014and it scared me. I didn't want to bring up last night, but I wasn't sure if avoiding the subject would be worse. He opened my door for me. \"How do you feel?\u00a0 \" \"Perfect,\" I lied, cringing as the sound of the slamming door echoed in my head. We walked in silence, he shortening his stride to match mine. There were so many questions I wanted to ask, but most of those questions would have to wait, because they were for Alice: How was Jasper this morning?\u00a0 \u00a0What had they said when I was gone?\u00a0 \u00a0What had Rosalie said?\u00a0 \u00a0And most importantly, what could she see happening now in her strange, imperfect visions of the future?\u00a0 \u00a0Could she guess what Edward was thinking, why he was so gloomy?\u00a0 \u00a0Was there a foundation for the tenuous, instinctive fears that I couldn't seem to shake?\u00a0  The morning passed slowly. I was impatient to see Alice, though I wouldn't be able to really talk to her with Edward there. Edward remained aloof. Occasionally he would ask about my arm, and I would lie. Alice usually beat us to lunch; she didn't have to keep pace with a sloth like me. But she wasn't at the table, waiting with a tray of food she wouldn't eat. Edward didn't say anything about her absence. I wondered to myself if her class was running late\u2014until I saw Conner and Ben, who were in her fourth hour French class. \"Where's Alice?\u00a0 \" I asked Edward anxiously. He looked at the granola bar he was slowly pulverizing between his fingertips while he answered. \"She's with Jasper.\" \"Is he okay?\u00a0 \" \"He's gone away for a while.\" \"What?\u00a0 \u00a0Where?\u00a0 \" Edward shrugged. \"Nowhere in particular.\" \"And Alice, too,\" I said with quiet desperation. Of course, if Jasper needed her, she would go.  \"Yes. She'll be gone for a while. She was trying to convince him to go to Denali.\" Denali was where the one other band of unique vampires\u2014good ones like the Cullens\u2014lived. Tanya and her family. I'd heard of them now and again. Edward had run to them last winter when my arrival had made Forks difficult for him. Laurent, the most civilized member of James's little coven, had gone there rather than siding with James against the Cullens. It made sense for Alice to encourage Jasper to go there. I swallowed, trying to dislodge the sudden lump in my throat. The guilt made my head bow and my shoulders slump. I'd run them out of their home, just like Rosalie and Emmett. I was a plague. \"Is your arm bothering you?\u00a0 \" he asked solicitously. \"Who cares about my stupid arm?\u00a0 \" I muttered in disgust. He didn't answer, and I put my head down on the table. By the end of the day, the silence was becoming ridiculous. I didn't want to be the one to break it, but apparently that was my only choice if I ever wanted him to talk to me again. \"You'll come over later tonight?\u00a0 \" I asked as he walked me\u2014silently\u2014to my truck. He always came over. \"Later?\u00a0 \" It pleased me that he seemed surprised. \"I have to work. I had to trade with Mrs. Newton to get yesterday off.\" \"Oh,\" he murmured. \"So you'll come over when I'm home, though, right?\u00a0 \" I hated that I felt suddenly unsure about this. \"If you want me to.\" \"I always want you,\" I reminded him, with perhaps a little more intensity than the conversation required. I expected he would laugh, or smile, or react somehow to my words. \"All right, then,\" he said indifferently. He kissed my forehead again before he shut the door on me. Then he turned his back and loped gracefully toward his car. I was able to drive out of the parking lot before the panic really hit, but I was hyperventilating by the time I got to Newton's. He just needed time, I told myself. He would get over this. Maybe he was sad because his family was disappearing. But Alice and Jasper would come back soon, and Rosalie and Emmett, too. If it would help, I would stay away from the big white house on the river\u2014I'd never set foot there again. That didn't matter. I'd still see Alice at school. She would have to come back for school, right?\u00a0 \u00a0And she was at my place all the time anyway. She wouldn't want to hurt Charlie's feelings by staying away. No doubt I would also run into Carlisle with regularity\u2014in the emergency room. After all, what had happened last night was nothing. Nothing had happened. So I fell down\u2014that was the story of my life. Compared to last spring, it seemed especially unimportant. James had left me broken and nearly dead from loss of blood\u2014and yet Edward had handled the interminable weeks in the hospital much better than this. Was it because, this time, it wasn't an enemy he'd had to protect me from?\u00a0  Because it was his brother?\u00a0  Maybe it would be better if he took me away, rather than his family being scattered. I grew slightly less depressed as I considered all the uninterrupted alone time. If he could just last through the school year, Charlie wouldn't be able to object. We could go away to college, or pretend that's what we were doing, like Rosalie and Emmett this year. Surely Edward could wait a year. What was a year to an immortal?\u00a0 \u00a0It didn't even seem like that much to me. I was able to talk myself into enough composure to handle getting out of the truck and walking to the store. Mike Newton had beaten me here today, and he smiled and waved when I came in. I grabbed my vest, nodding vaguely in his direction. I was still imagining pleasant scenarios that consisted of me running away with Edward to various exotic locales. Mike interrupted my fantasy. \"How was your birthday?\u00a0 \" \"Ugh,\" I mumbled. \"I'm glad it's over.\" Mike looked at me from the corners of his eyes like I was crazy. Work dragged. I wanted to see Edward again, praying that he would be past the worst of this, whatever it was exactly, by the time I saw him again. It's nothing, I told myself over and over again. Everything will go back to normal. The relief I felt when I turned onto my street and saw Edward's silver car parked in front of my house was an overwhelming, heady thing. And it bothered me deeply that it should be that way. I hurried through the front door, calling out before I was completely inside. \"Dad?\u00a0 \u00a0Edward?\u00a0 \" As I spoke, I could hear the distinctive theme music from ESPN's Sports Center coming from the living room. \"In here,\" Charlie called. I hung my raincoat on its peg and hurried around the corner. Edward was in the armchair, my father on the sofa. Both had their eyes trained on the TV. The focus was normal for my father. Not so much for Edward. \"Hi,\" I said weakly. \"Hey, Bella,\" my father answered, eyes never moving. \"We just had cold pizza. I think it's still on the table.\" \"Okay.\" I waited in the doorway. Finally, Edward looked over at me with a polite smile. \"I'll be right behind you,\" he promised. His eyes strayed back to the TV. I stared for another minute, shocked. Neither one seemed to notice. I could feel something, panic maybe, building up in my chest. I escaped to the kitchen. The pizza held no interest for me. I sat in my chair, pulled my knees up, and wrapped my arms around them. Something was very wrong, maybe more wrong than I'd realized. The sounds of male bonding and banter continued from the TV set. I tried to get control of myself, to reason with myself. What's the worst that can happen?\u00a0 \u00a0I flinched. That was definitely the wrong question to ask. I was having a hard time breathing right. Okay, I thought again, what's the worst I can live through?\u00a0 \u00a0I didn't like that question so much, either. But I thought through the possibilities I'd considered today. Staying away from Edward's family. Of course, he wouldn't expect Alice to be part of that. But if Jasper was off limits, that would lessen the time I could have with her. I nodded to myself\u2014I could live with that. Or going away. Maybe he wouldn't want to wait till the end of the school year, maybe it would have to be now. In front of me, on the table, my presents from Charlie and Renee were where I had left them, the camera I hadn't had the chance to use at the Cullens' sitting beside the album. I touched the pretty cover of the scrapbook my mother had given me, and sighed, thinking of Renee. Somehow, living without her for as long as I had did not make the idea of a more permanent separation easier. And Charlie would be left all alone here, abandoned. They would both be so hurt\u2026 But we'd come back, right?\u00a0 \u00a0We'd visit, of course, wouldn't we?\u00a0  I couldn't be certain about the answer to that. I leaned my cheek against my knee, staring at the physical tokens of my parents' love. I'd known this path I'd chosen was going to be hard. And, after all, I was thinking about the worst-case scenario\u2014the very worst I could live through. I touched the scrapbook again, flipping the front cover over. Little metal corners were already in place to hold the first picture. It wasn't a half-bad idea, to make some record of my life here. I felt a strange urge to get started. Maybe I didn't have that long left in Forks. I toyed with the wrist strap on the camera, wondering about the first picture on the roll. Could it possibly turn out anything close to the original?\u00a0 \u00a0I doubted it. But he didn't seem worried that it would be blank. I chuckled to myself, thinking of his carefree laughter last night. The chuckle died away. So much had changed, and so abruptly. It made me feel a little bit dizzy, like I was standing on an edge, a precipice somewhere much too high. I didn't want to think about that anymore. I grabbed the camera and headed up the stairs. My room hadn't really changed all that much in the seventeen years since my mother had been here. The walls were still light blue, the same yellowed lace curtains hung in front of the window. There was a bed, rather than a crib, but she would recognize the quilt draped untidily over the top\u2014it had been a gift from Gran. Regardless, I snapped a picture of my room. There wasn't much else I could do tonight\u2014it was too dark outside\u2014and the feeling was growing stronger, it was almost a\u00a0 compulsion now. I would record everything about Forks before I had to leave it. Change was coming. I could feel it. It wasn't a pleasant prospect, not when life was perfect the way it was. I took my time coming back down the stairs, camera in hand, trying to ignore the butterflies in my stomach as I thought of the strange distance I didn't want to see in Edward's eyes. He would get over this. Probably he was worried that I would be upset when he asked me to leave. I would let him work through it without meddling. And I would be prepared when he asked. I had the camera ready as I leaned around the corner, being sneaky. I was sure there was no chance that I had caught Edward by surprise, but he didn't look up. I felt a brief shiver as something icy twisted in my stomach; I ignored that and took the picture. They both looked at me then. Charlie frowned. Edward's face was empty, expressionless. \"What are you doing, Bella?\u00a0 \" Charlie complained. \"Oh, come on.\" I pretended to smile as I went to sit on the floor in front of the sofa where Charlie lounged. \"You know Mom will be calling soon to ask if I'm using my presents. I have to get to work before she can get her feelings hurt.\" \"Why are you taking pictures of me, though?\u00a0 \" he grumbled. \"Because you're so handsome,\" I replied, keeping it light. \"And because, since you\u00a0 bought the camera, you're obligated to be one of my subjects.\" He mumbled something unintelligible. \"Hey, Edward,\" I said with admirable indifference. \"Take one of me and my dad together.\"  I threw the camera toward him, carefully avoiding his eyes, and knelt beside the arm of the sofa where Charlie's face was. Charlie sighed. \"You need to smile, Bella,\" Edward murmured. I did my best, and the camera flashed. \"Let me take one of you kids,\" Charlie suggested. I knew he was just trying to shift the camera's focus from himself. Edward stood and lightly tossed him the camera. I went to stand beside Edward, and the arrangement felt formal and strange to me. He put one hand lightly on my shoulder, and I wrapped my arm more securely around his waist. I wanted to look at his face, but I was afraid to. \"Smile, Bella,\" Charlie reminded me again. I took a deep breath and smiled. The flash blinded me. \"Enough pictures for tonight,\" Charlie said then, shoving the camera into a crevice of the sofa cushions and rolling over it. \"You don't have to use the whole roll now.\" Edward dropped his hand from my shoulder and twisted casually out of my arm. He sat back down in the armchair. I hesitated, and then went to sit against the sofa again. I was suddenly so frightened that my hands were shaking. I pressed them into my stomach to hide them, put my chin on my knees and stared at the TV screen in front of me, seeing nothing. When the show ended, I hadn't moved an inch. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Edward stand. \"I'd better get home,\" he said. Charlie didn't look up from the commercial. \"See ya.\" I got awkwardly to my feet\u2014I was stiff from sitting so still\u2014and followed Edward out the front door. He went straight to his car. \"Will you stay?\u00a0 \" I asked, no hope in my voice. I expected his answer, so it didn't hurt as much. \"Not tonight.\" I didn't ask for a reason. He got in his car and drove away while I stood there, unmoving. I barely noticed that it was raining. I waited, without knowing what I waited for, until the door opened behind me. \"Bella, what are you doing?\u00a0 \" Charlie asked, surprised to see me standing there alone and dripping. \"Nothing.\" I turned and trudged back to the house. It was a long night, with little in the way of rest. I got up as soon as there was a faint light outside my window. I dressed for school mechanically, waiting for the clouds to brighten. When I had eaten a bowl of cereal, I decided that it was light enough for pictures. I took one of my truck, and then the front of the house. I turned and snapped a few of the forest by Charlie's house. Funny how it didn't seem sinister like it used to. I realized I would miss this\u2014the green, the timelessness, the mystery of the woods. All of it. I put the camera in my school bag before I left. I tried to concentrate on my new project rather than the fact that Edward apparently hadn't gotten over things during the night. Along with the fear, I was beginning to feel impatience. How long could this last?\u00a0  It lasted through the morning. He walked silently beside me, never seeming to actually look at me. I tried to concentrate on my classes, but not even English could hold my attention. Mr. Berty had to repeat his question about Lady Capulet twice before I realized he was talking to me. Edward whispered the correct answer under his breath and then went back to ignoring me. At lunch, the silence continued. I felt like I was going to start screaming at any moment, so, to distract myself, I leaned across the table's invisible line and spoke to Jessica. \"Hey, Jess?\u00a0 \" \"What's up, Bella?\u00a0 \" \"Could you do me a favor?\u00a0 \" I asked, reaching into my bag. \"My mom wants me to get some pictures of my friends for a scrapbook. So, take some pictures of everybody, okay?\u00a0 \" I handed her the camera. \"Sure,\" she said, grinning, and turned to snap a candid shot of Mike with his mouth full. A predictable picture war ensued. I watched them hand the camera around the table, giggling and flirting and complaining about being on film. It seemed strangely childish. Maybe I just wasn't in the mood for normal human behavior today. \"Uh-oh,\" Jessica said apologetically as she returned the camera. \"I think we used all your film.\" \"That's okay. I think I already got pictures of everything else I needed.\" After school, Edward walked me back to the parking lot in silence. I had to work again, and for once, I was glad. Time with me obviously wasn't helping things. Maybe time alone would be better. I dropped my film off at the Thriftway on my way to Newton's, and then picked up the developed pictures after work. At home, I said a brief hi to Charlie, grabbed a granola bar from the kitchen, and hurried up to my room with the envelope of photographs tucked under my arm. I sat in the middle of my bed and opened the envelope with wary curiosity. Ridiculously, I still half expected the first print to be a blank. When I pulled it out, I gasped aloud. Edward looked just as beautiful as he did in real life, staring at me out of the picture with the warm eyes I'd missed for the past few days. It was almost uncanny that anyone could look so\u2026 so\u2026 beyond description. No thousand words could equal this picture. I flipped through the rest of the stack quickly once, and then laid three of them out on the bed side by side. The first was the picture of Edward in the kitchen, his warm eyes touched with tolerant amusement. The second was Edward and Charlie, watching ESPN. The difference in Edward's expression was severe. His eyes were careful here, reserved. Still breathtakingly beautiful, but his face was colder, more like a sculpture, less alive. The last was the picture of Edward and me standing awkwardly side by side. Edward's face was the same as the last, cold and statue-like. But that wasn't the most troubling part of this photograph. The contrast between the two of us was painful. He looked like a god. I looked very average, even for a human, almost shamefully plain. I flipped the picture over with a feeling of disgust. Instead of doing my homework, I stayed up to put my pictures into the album. With a ballpoint pen I scrawled captions under all the pictures, the names and the dates. I got to the picture of Edward and me, and, without looking at it too long, I folded it in half and stuck it under the metal tab, Edward-side up. When I was done, I stuffed the second set of prints in a fresh envelope and penned a long thank-you letter to Renee. Edward still hadn't come over. I didn't want to admit that he was the reason I'd stayed up so late, but of course he was. I tried to remember the last time he'd stayed away like this, without an excuse, a phone call\u2026 He never had. Again, I didn't sleep well. School followed the silent, frustrating, terrifying pattern of the last two days. I felt relief when I saw Edward waiting for me in the parking lot, but it faded quickly. He was no different, unless maybe more remote. It was hard to even remember the reason for all this mess. My birthday already felt like the distant past. If only Alice would come back. Soon. Before this got any more out of hand.  But I couldn't count on that. I decided that, if I couldn't talk to him today, really talk, then I was going to see Carlisle tomorrow. I had to do something. After school, Edward and I were going to talk it out, I promised myself. I wasn't accepting any excuses. He walked me to my truck, and I steeled myself to make my demands. \"Do you mind if I come over today?\u00a0 \" he asked before we got to the truck, beating me to the punch. \"Of course not.\" \"Now?\u00a0 \" he asked again, opening my door for me. \"Sure,\" I kept my voice even, though I didn't like the urgency in his tone. \"I was just going to drop a letter for Renee in the mailbox on the way. I'll meet you there.\" He looked at the fat envelope on the passenger seat. Suddenly, he reached over me and snagged it. \"I'll do it,\" he said quietly. \"And I'll still beat you there.\" He smiled my favorite crooked smile, but it was wrong. It didn't reach his eyes. \"Okay,\" I agreed, unable to smile back. He shut the door, and headed toward his car. He did beat me home. He was parked in Charlie's spot when I pulled up in front of the house. That was a bad sign. He didn't plan to stay, then. I shook my head and took a deep breath, trying to locate some courage. He got out of his car when I stepped out of the truck, and came to meet me. He reached to take my book bag from me. That was normal. But he shoved it back onto the seat. That was not normal. \"Come for a walk with me,\" he suggested in an unemotional voice, taking my hand. I didn't answer. I couldn't think of a way to protest, but I instantly knew that I wanted to. I didn't like this. This is bad, this is very bad, the voice in my head repeated again and again. But he didn't wait for an answer. He pulled me along toward the east side of the yard, where the forest encroached. I followed unwillingly, trying to think through the panic. It was what I wanted, I reminded myself. The chance to talk it all through. So why was the panic choking me?\u00a0  We'd gone only a few steps into the trees when he stopped. We were barely on the trail\u2014I could still see the house. Some walk. Edward leaned against a tree and stared at me, his expression unreadable. \"Okay, let's talk,\" I said. It sounded braver than it felt. He took a deep breath. \"Bella, we're leaving.\" I took a deep breath, too. This was an acceptable option. I thought I was prepared. But I still had to ask. \"Why now?\u00a0 \u00a0Another year\u2014\" \"Bella, it's time. How much longer could we stay in Forks, after all?\u00a0 \u00a0Carlisle can barely pass for thirty, and he's claiming thirty-three now. We'd have to start over soon regardless.\" His answer confused me. I thought the point of leaving was to let his family live in peace. Why did we have to leave if they were going?\u00a0 \u00a0I stared at him, trying to understand what he meant. He stared back coldly. With a roll of nausea, I realized I'd misunderstood. \"When you say we\u2014,\" I whispered. \"I mean my family and myself.\" Each word separate and distinct. I shook my head back and forth mechanically, trying to clear it. He waited without any sign of impatience. It took a few minutes before I could speak. \"Okay,\" I said. \"I'll come with you.\" \"You can't, Bella. Where we're going\u2026 It's not the right place for you.\" \"Where you are is the right place for me.\" \"I'm no good for you, Bella.\" \"Don't be ridiculous.\" I wanted to sound angry, but it just sounded like I was begging. \"You're the very best part of my life.\" \"My world is not for you,\" he said grimly. \"What happened with Jasper\u2014that was nothing, Edward! Nothing!\" \"You're right,\" he agreed. \"It was exactly what was to be expected.\" \"You promised! In Phoenix, you promised that you would stay\u2014\" \"As long as that was best for you,\" he interrupted to correct me. \"No! This is about my soul, isn't it?\u00a0 \" I shouted, furious, the words exploding out of me\u2014somehow it still sounded like a plea. \"Carlisle told me about that, and I don't care,\u00a0 Edward. I don't care! You can have my soul. I don't want it without you\u2014it's yours already!\" He took a deep breath and stared, unseeingly, at the ground for a long moment. His mouth twisted the tiniest bit. When he finally looked up, his eyes were different, harder\u2014like the liquid gold had frozen solid. \"Bella, I don't want you to come with me.\" He spoke the words slowly and precisely, his cold eyes on my face, watching as I absorbed what he was really saying. There was a pause as I repeated the words in my head a few times, sifting through them for their real intent. \"You\u2026 don't\u2026 want me?\u00a0 \" I tried out the words, confused by the way they sounded, placed in that order. \"No.\" I stared, uncomprehending, into his eyes. He stared back without apology. His eyes were like topaz\u2014hard and clear and very deep. I felt like I could see into them for miles and miles, yet nowhere in their bottomless depths could I see a contradiction to the word he'd spoken. \"Well, that changes things.\" I was surprised by how calm and reasonable my voice sounded. It must be because I was so numb. I couldn't realize what he was telling me. It still didn't make any sense. He looked away into the trees as he spoke again. \"Of course, I'll always love you\u2026 in a way. But what happened the other night made me realize that it's time for a change. Because I'm\u2026 tired of pretending to be something I'm not, Bella. I am not human.\" He looked back, and the icy planes of his perfect face were not human. \"I've let this go on much too long, and I'm sorry for that.\" \"Don't.\" My voice was just a whisper now; awareness was beginning to seep through me, trickling like acid through my veins. \"Don't do this.\" He just stared at me, and I could see from his eyes that my words were far too late. He already had.  \"You're not good for me, Bella.\" He turned his earlier words around, and so I had no argument. How well I knew that I wasn't good enough for him. I opened my mouth to say something, and then closed it again. He waited patiently, his face wiped clean of all emotion. I tried again. \"If\u2026 that's what you want.\" He nodded once. My whole body went numb. I couldn't feel anything below the neck. \"I would like to ask one favor, though, if that's not too much,\" he said. I wonder what he saw on my face, because something flickered across his own face in response. But, before I could identify it, he'd composed his features into the same serene mask. \"Anything,\" I vowed, my voice faintly stronger. As I watched, his frozen eyes melted. The gold became liquid again, molten, burning down into mine with an intensity that was overwhelming. \"Don't do anything reckless or stupid,\" he ordered, no longer detached. \"Do you understand what I'm saying?\u00a0 \" I nodded helplessly. His eyes cooled, the distance returned. \"I'm thinking of Charlie, of course. He needs you. Take care of yourself\u2014for him.\" I nodded again. \"I will,\" I whispered. He seemed to relax just a little. \"And I'll make you a promise in return,\" he said. \"I promise that this will be the last time you'll see me. I won't come back. I won't put you through anything like this again. You can go on with your life without any more interference from me. It will be as if I'd never existed.\" My knees must have started to shake, because the trees were suddenly wobbling. I could hear the blood pounding faster than normal behind my ears. His voice sounded farther away. He smiled gently. \"Don't worry. You're human\u2014your memory is no more than a sieve. Time heals all wounds for your kind.\" \"And your memories?\u00a0 \" I asked. It sounded like there was something stuck in my throat, like I was choking. \"Well\"\u2014he hesitated for a short second\u2014\"I won't forget. But my kind\u2026 we're very easily distracted.\" He smiled; the smile was tranquil and it did not touch his eyes. He took a step away from me. \"That's everything, I suppose. We won't bother you again.\" The plural caught my attention. That surprised me; I would have thought I was beyond noticing anything. \"Alice isn't coming back,\" I realized. I don't know how he heard me\u2014the words made no sound\u2014but he seemed to understand. He shook his head slowly, always watching my face. \"No. They're all gone. I stayed behind to tell you goodbye.\" \"Alice is gone?\u00a0 \" My voice was blank with disbelief. \"She wanted to say goodbye, but I convinced her that a clean break would be better for you.\" I was dizzy; it was hard to concentrate. His words swirled around in my head, and I heard the doctor at the hospital in Phoenix, last spring, as he showed me the X-rays. You can see it's a clean break, his finger traced along the picture of my severed bone. That's good. It will heal more easily, more quickly. I tried to breathe normally. I needed to concentrate, to find a way out of this nightmare. \"Goodbye, Bella,\" he said in the same quiet, peaceful voice. \"Wait!\" I choked out the word, reaching for him, willing my deadened legs to carry me forward. I thought he was reaching for me, too. But his cold hands locked around my wrists and pinned them to my sides. He leaned down, and pressed his lips very lightly to my forehead for the briefest instant. My eyes closed. \"Take care of yourself,\" he breathed, cool against my skin. There was a light, unnatural breeze. My eyes flashed open. The leaves on a small vine maple shuddered with the gentle wind of his passage. He was gone. With shaky legs, ignoring the fact that my action was useless, I followed him into the forest. The evidence of his path had disappeared instantly. There were no footprints, the leaves were still again, but I walked forward without thinking. I could not do anything else. I had to keep moving. If I stopped looking for him, it was over. Love, life, meaning\u2026 over. I walked and walked. Time made no sense as I pushed slowly through the thick undergrowth. It was hours passing, but also only seconds. Maybe it felt like time had frozen because the forest looked the same no matter how far I went. I started to worry that I was traveling in a circle, a very small circle at that, but I kept going. I stumbled often, and, as it grew darker and darker, I fell often, too. Finally, I tripped over something\u2014it was black now, I had no idea what caught my foot\u2014and I stayed down. I rolled onto my side, so that I could breathe, and curled up on the wet <em>bracken</em>. As I lay there, I had a feeling that more time was passing than I realized. I couldn't remember how long it had been since nightfall. Was it always so dark here at night?\u00a0 \u00a0Surely, as a rule, some little bit of moonlight would filter down through the clouds, through the chinks in the canopy of trees, and find the ground. Not tonight. Tonight the sky was utterly black. Perhaps there was no moon tonight\u2014a lunar eclipse, a new moon. A new moon. I shivered, though I wasn't cold. It was black for a long time before I heard them calling. Someone was shouting my name. It was muted, muffled by the wet growth that surrounded me, but it was definitely my name. I didn't recognize the voice. I thought about answering, but I was dazed, and it took a long time to come to the conclusion that I should answer. By then, the calling had stopped. Sometime later, the rain woke me up. I don't think I'd really fallen asleep; I was just lost in an unthinking stupor, holding with all my strength to the numbness that kept me from realizing what I didn't want to know. The rain bothered me a little. It was cold. I unwrapped my arms from around my legs to cover my face.  It was then that I heard the calling again. It was farther away this time, and sometimes it sounded like several voices were calling at once. I tried to breathe deeply. I remembered that I should answer, but I didn't think they would be able to hear me. Would I be able to shout loud enough?\u00a0  Suddenly, there was another sound, startlingly close. A kind of snuffling, an animal sound. It sounded big. I wondered if I should feel afraid. I didn't\u2014just numb. It didn't matter. The snuffling went away. The rain continued, and I could feel the water pooling up against my cheek. I was trying to gather the strength to turn my head when I saw the light. At first it was just a dim glow reflecting off the bushes in the distance. It grew brighter and brighter, illuminating a large space unlike the focused beam of a flashlight. The light broke through the closest brush, and I could see that it was a propane lantern, but that was all I could see\u2014the brightness blinded me for a moment. \"Bella.\" The voice was deep and unfamiliar, but full of recognition. He wasn't calling my name to search, he was acknowledging that I was found. I stared up\u2014impossibly high it seemed\u2014at the dark face that I could now see above me. I was vaguely aware that the stranger probably only looked so tall because my head was still on the ground. \"Have you been hurt?\u00a0 \" I knew the words meant something, but I could only stare, bewildered. How could the meaning matter at this point?\u00a0  \"Bella, my name is Sam Uley.\" There was nothing familiar about his name. \"Charlie sent me to look for you.\" Charlie?\u00a0 \u00a0That struck a chord, and I tried to pay more attention to what he was saying. Charlie mattered, if nothing else did. The tall man held out a hand. I gazed at it, not sure what I was supposed to do. His black eyes appraised me for a second, and then he shrugged. In a quick and supple notion, he pulled me up from the ground and into his arms. I hung there, limp, as he loped swiftly through the wet forest. Some part of me knew this should upset me\u2014being carried away by a stranger. But there was nothing left in me to upset. It didn't seem like too much time passed before there were lights and the deep babble of many male voices. Sam Uley slowed as he approached the commotion. \"I've got her!\" he called in a booming voice. The babble ceased, and then picked up again with more intensity. A confusing swirl of faces moved over me. Sam's voice was the only one that made sense in the chaos, perhaps because my ear was against his chest. \"No, I don't think she's hurt,\" he told someone. \"She just keeps saying 'He's gone.' \" \u00a0Was I saying that out loud?\u00a0 \u00a0I bit down on my lip. \"Bella, honey, are you all right?\u00a0 \" That was one voice I would know anywhere\u2014even distorted, as it was now, with worry. \"Charlie?\u00a0 \" My voice sounded strange and small. \"I'm right here, baby.\" There was a shifting under me, followed by the leathery smell of my dad's sheriff jacket. Charlie staggered under my weight. \"Maybe I should hold on to her,\" Sam Uley suggested. \"I've got her,\" Charlie said, a little breathless. He walked slowly, struggling. I wished I could tell him to put me down and let me walk, but I couldn't find my voice. There were lights everywhere, held by the crowd walking with him. It felt like a parade. Or a funeral procession. I closed my eyes. \"We're almost home now, honey,\" Charlie mumbled now and then. I opened my eyes again when I heard the door unlock. We were on the porch of our house, and the tall dark man named Sam was holding the door for Charlie, one arm extended toward us, as if he was preparing to catch me when Charlie's arms failed. But Charlie managed to get me through the door and to the couch in the living room. \"Dad, I'm all wet,\" I objected feebly. \"That doesn't matter.\" His voice was gruff. And then he was talking to someone else. \"Blankets are in the cupboard at the top of the stairs.\" \"Bella?\u00a0 \" a new voice asked. I looked at the gray-haired man leaning over me, and recognition came after a few slow seconds. \"Dr. Gerandy?\u00a0 \" I mumbled. \"That's right, dear,\" he said. \"Are you hurt, Bella?\u00a0 \" It took me a minute to think that through. I was confused by the memory of Sam Uley's similar question in the woods. Only Sam had asked something else: Have you been hurt?\u00a0 \u00a0he'd said. The difference seemed significant somehow. Dr. Gerandy was waiting. One grizzled eyebrow rose, and the wrinkles on his forehead deepened.  \"I'm not hurt,\" I lied. The words, were true enough for what he'd asked. His warm hand touched my forehead, and his fingers pressed against the inside of my wrist. I watched his lips as he counted to himself, his eyes on his watch. \"What happened to you?\u00a0 \" he asked casually. I froze under his hand, tasting panic in the back of my throat. \"Did you get lost in the woods?\u00a0 \" he prodded. I was aware of several other people listening. Three tall men with dark faces\u2014from La Push, the Quileute Indian reservation down on the coastline, I guessed\u2014Sam Uley among them, were standing very close together and staring at me. Mr. Newton was there with Mike and Mr. Weber, Angela's father; they all were watching me more surreptitiously than the strangers. Other deep voices rumbled from the kitchen and outside the front door. Half the town must have been looking for me. Charlie was the closest. He leaned in to hear my answer. \"Yes,\" I whispered. \"I got lost.\" The doctor nodded, thoughtful, his fingers probing gently against the glands under my jaw. Charlie's face hardened. \"Do you feel tired?\u00a0 \" Dr. Gerandy asked. I nodded and closed my eyes obediently. \"I don't think there's anything wrong with her,\" I heard the doctor mutter to Charlie after a moment. \"Just exhaustion. Let her sleep it off, and I'll come check on her tomorrow,\" he paused. He must have looked at his watch, because he added, \"Well, later today actually.\" There was a creaking sound as they both pushed off from the couch to get to their feet. \"Is it true?\u00a0 \" Charlie whispered. Their voices were farther away now. I strained to hear. \"Did they leave?\u00a0 \" \"Dr. Cullen asked us not to say anything,\" Dr. Gerandy answered. \"The offer was very sudden; they had to choose immediately. Carlisle didn't want to make a big production out of leaving.\" \"A little warning might have been nice,\" Charlie grumbled. Dr. Gerandy sounded uncomfortable when he replied. \"Yes, well, in this situation, some warning might have been called for.\" I didn't want to listen anymore. I felt around for the edge of the quilt someone had laid on top of me, and pulled it over my ear. I drifted in and out of alertness. I heard Charlie whisper thanks to the volunteers as, one by one, they left. I felt his fingers on my forehead, and then the weight of another blanket. The phone rang a few times, and he hurried to catch it before it could wake me. He muttered reassurances in a low voice to the callers. \"Yeah, we found her. She's okay. She got lost. She's fine now,\" he said again and again. I heard the springs in the armchair groan when he settled himself in for the night. A few minutes later, the phone rang again. Charlie moaned as he struggled to his feet, and then he rushed, stumbling, to the kitchen I pulled my head deeper under the blankets, not wanting to listen to the same conversation again. \"Yeah,\" Charlie said, and yawned. His voice changed, it was much more alert when he spoke again. \"Where?\u00a0 '\" There was a pause. \"You're sure it's outside the reservation?\u00a0 \" Another short pause. \"But what could be burning out there?\u00a0 \" He sounded both worried and mystified. \"Look, I'll call down there and check it out.\" I listened with more interest as he punched in a number. \"Hey, Billy, it's Charlie\u2014sorry I'm calling so early\u2026 no, she's fine. She's sleeping\u2026 Thanks, but that's not why I called. I just got a call from Mrs. Stanley, and she says that from her second-story window she can see fires out on the sea cliffs, but I didn't really\u2026 Oh!\" Suddenly there was an edge in his voice\u2014irritation\u2026 or anger. \"And why are they doing that?\u00a0 \u00a0Uh huh. Really?\u00a0 \" He said it sarcastically. \"Well, don't apologize to me. Yeah, yeah. Just make sure the flames don't spread\u2026 I know, I know, I'm surprised they got them lit at all in this weather.\" Charlie hesitated, and then added grudgingly. \"Thanks for sending Sam and the other boys up. You were right\u2014they do know the forest better than we do. It was Sam who found her, so I owe you one\u2026 Yeah, I'll talk to you later,\" he agreed, still sour, before hanging up. Charlie muttered something incoherent as he shuffled back to the living room. \"What's wrong?\u00a0 \" I asked. He hurried to my side. \"I'm sorry I woke you, honey.\" \"Is something burning?\u00a0 \" \"It's nothing,\" he assured me. \"Just some bonfires out on the cliffs.\" \"Bonfires?\u00a0 \" I asked. My voice didn't sound curious. It sounded dead. Charlie frowned. \"Some of the kids from the reservation being rowdy,\" he explained. \"Why?\u00a0 \" I wondered dully. I could tell he didn't want to answer. He looked at the floor under his knees. \"They're celebrating the news.\" His tone was bitter. There was only one piece of news I could think of, try as I might not to. And then the pieces snapped together. \"Because the Cullens left,\" I whispered. \"They don't like the Cullens in La Push\u2014I'd forgotten about that.\" The Quileutes had their superstitions about the \"cold ones,\" the blood-drinkers that were enemies to their tribe, just like they had their legends of the great flood and wolf-men ancestors. Just stories, folklore, to most of them. Then there were the few that believed. Charlie's good friend Billy Black believed, though even Jacob, his own son, thought he was full of stupid superstitions. Billy had warned me to stay away from the Cullens\u2026 The name stirred something inside me, something that began to claw its way toward the surface, something I knew I didn't want to face. \"It's ridiculous,\" Charlie spluttered. We sat in silence for a moment. The sky was no longer black outside the window. Somewhere behind the rain, the sun was beginning to rise. \"Bella?\u00a0 \" Charlie asked. I looked at him uneasily. \"He left you alone in the woods?\u00a0 \" Charlie guessed. I deflected his question. \"How did you know where to find me?\u00a0 \" My mind shied away from the inevitable awareness that was coming, coming quickly now. \"Your note,\" Charlie answered, surprised. He reached into the back pocket of his jeans and pulled out a much-abused piece of paper. It was dirty and damp, with multiple creases from being opened and refolded many times. He unfolded it again, and held it up as evidence. The messy handwriting was remarkably close to my own. Going for a walk with Edward, up the path, it said. Back soon, B. \"When you didn't come back, I called the Cullens, and no one answered,\" Charlie said in a low voice. \"Then I called the hospital, and Dr. Gerandy told me that Carlisle was gone.\" \"Where did they go?\u00a0 \" I mumbled. He stared at me. \"Didn't Edward tell you?\u00a0 \" I shook my head, recoiling. The sound of his name unleashed the thing that was clawing inside of me\u2014a pain that knocked me breathless, astonished me with its force. Charlie eyed me doubtfully as he answered. \"Carlisle took a job with a big hospital in Los Angeles. I guess they threw a lot of money at him.\" Sunny L.A. The last place they would really go. I remembered my nightmare with the mirror\u2026 the bright sunlight shimmering off of his skin\u2014 Agony ripped through me with the memory of his face. \"I want to know if Edward left you alone out there in the middle of the woods,\" Charlie insisted. His name sent another wave of torture through me. I shook my head, frantic, desperate to escape the pain. \"It was my fault. He left me right here on the trail, in sight of the house\u2026 but I tried to follow him.\" Charlie started to say something; childishly, I covered my ears. \"I can't talk about this anymore, Dad. I want to go to my room.\" Before he could answer, I scrambled up from the couch and lurched my way up the stairs. Someone had been in the house to leave a note for Charlie, a note that would lead him to find me. From the minute that I'd realized this, a horrible suspicion began to grow in my head. I rushed to my room, shutting and locking the door behind me before I ran to the CD player by my bed. Everything looked exactly the same as I'd left it. I pressed down on the top of the CD player. The latch unhooked, and the lid slowly swung open. It was empty. The album Renee had given me sat on the floor beside the bed, just where I'd put it last. I lifted the cover with a shaking hand. I didn't have to flip any farther than the first page. The little metal corners no longer held a picture in place. The page was blank except for my own handwriting scrawled across the bottom: Edward Cullen, Charlie's kitchen, Sept. 13th. I stopped there. I was sure that he would have been very thorough. It will be as if I'd never existed, he'd promised me. I felt the smooth wooden floor beneath my knees, and then the palms of my hands, and then it was pressed against the skin of my cheek. I hoped that I was fainting, but, to my disappointment, I didn't lose consciousness. The waves of pain that had only lapped at me before now reared high up and washed over my head, pulling me under. I did not resurface.  OCTOBER NOVEMBER DECEMBER JANUARY",
