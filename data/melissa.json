The UNHCR says tens of thousands of people are stuck at the borders and in urgent need of help.  The U.N. refugee agency says the situation at the Libya-Tunisia border is chaotic. It says 14,000 people crossed the border Monday, the highest number to date.  The agency says it is crucial to move tens of thousands of people away from the overcrowded border to avoid a humanitarian crisis. But transportation is scarce.  UNHCR spokeswoman <em>Melissa</em> Fleming says the agency has erected 1,500 tents, which can shelter 12,000 people. And she says two airlifts planned for Thursday will deliver tents and supplies for up to 10,000 people. \u201cWe have now visited the border entry point to Tunisia. What is unfortunate is that thousands of people are waiting on the Libyan side of the border to enter. Some for as long as three days. They are obliged to spend the night outside in the bitter cold without shelter. We are very concerned that a large number of sub-Saharan Africans are not being allowed into Tunisia at this point. We are in negotiation with self-appointed volunteers from the local community who are guarding the border,\" she said. Fleming says nearly 70,000 people have crossed from Libya into Egypt since February 19. She says the majority are Egyptians.  She says the UNHCR is particularly worried about thousands of refugees and asylum-seekers stuck inside Libya. She says the refugees come mainly from Iraq, Palestine, Somalia, Sudan and Eritrea. She says they have been living in Libya for a long time but now are desperate to leave. Fleming reads a recent message sent by a refugee to UNHCR staff in Libya describing the fearful conditions under which he and his family are living. She says refugees and migrants from sub-Saharan Africa are particularly vulnerable. \u201cWe are under attack by local people who are saying that we are mercenaries killing people. Let me say that they did not want to see black people. There is racism. We need help. Please, please, please, where is the humanity? Where is the United Nations? I am crying. I need help. Our home was burnt down. Ten Somalis were killed in Libya in the last seven days. Why is nobody concerned about the Somali migrants in Libya? We are victims of racism and ruthless exploitation,\" she said. Fleming says the UNHCR offers assistance to those refugees who are able to reach its office in Tripoli. She says the agency\u2019s 24-hour hotline continues to receive desperate calls from refugees in Libya and their family members outside. She says they say they feel trapped, threatened and hunted.",

            "en": "Now that the health care reform bill is signed into law, Dell is looking to offer local state governments a set of IT services designed to help meet new federal regulations regarding issues such as Medicaid. Since its acquisition of Perot, Dell is moving deeper into the IT services field, especially in the health care and government markets. Dell is looking to offer state governments a health care check-up.  On June 9, Dell officially launched its latest IT services initiative, called Dell State Health Services. Spending on IT health care is expected to increase about 4 percent in 2010, according to Gartner, and Dell and other service vendors are looking to expand their offerings in the wake of federal health care reform. In this case, Dell is targeting state governments that have to deal with an onslaught of new federal health care regulations, such as changes to Medicaid and electronic health care records. With Dell State Health Services, Dell is looking to offer IT consulting, as well as a host of hardware and software products, call center integration and data center services. While Dell has been pushing IT services and consulting for many years, its 2009 acquisition of Perot Systems for $3.9 billion gave Dell a firmer foothold in this market to better compete against the likes of IBM, Hewlett-Packard and IT outsourcing firms such as Infosys. With Perot, Dell also bought a company with deep ties to a number of specific vertical markets, including health care, local and state government and manufacturing. The federal health care bill allows Dell, as well as other IT companies, a way to tie in their health care and government consulting services. When it announced the State Health Services program, Dell also pointed to its own example of helping Massachusetts implement its Massachusetts Commonwealth Care Health Plan, which looked to reduce the number of uninsured in the state, while offering small businesses a way to buy health care coverage for their employees. The type of health care exchanges Massachusetts created at the state level are similar to the types of federal health care exchanges that are part of the government\u2019s health care overhaul.  For Massachusetts, Dell created hardware and software systems that addressed issues with medical billing, financial data, patient data and call center integration to make the exchange in that state work.  \"Dell is already providing consulting services to several states, and we look forward to putting our expertise in providing solutions to the nation\u2019s only state insurance exchange, as well as our experience supporting the health care and government industries, to work for other states,\" <em>Melissa</em> Boudreault, the director of Dell State Health Services, wrote in a statement.  Earlier in June, Dell announced a partnership with Practice Fusion to deliver new types of electronic health records to small medical practices.",
