Liverpool-born Tim Hetherington, 40, and American Chris Hondros, 41, died on Wednesday while covering the conflict in the besieged city of Misrata. Two other journalists were injured, including Briton Guy Martin. The men's bodies were put aboard the Ionian Spirit, a ferry being used to take food and medicine to Misrata. Misrata is the only rebel-held city in western Libya and has been under attack from forces loyal to Col Muammar Gaddafi for weeks. It is understood Mr Hetherington and Mr Hondros were among a group of journalists pulling back from near the front line, during a lull in the fighting, when they suffered their injuries. Mr Hetherington's family said he was killed by a rocket-propelled grenade. Tributes In addition to taking aid, the ferry used to transport the bodies is also being used to evacuate the injured and foreigners fleeing Misrata. The bodies were taken to Benghazi, the de facto rebel capital, in eastern Libya. The Associated Press news agency said representatives from the UK and the US were to take custody of the bodies in Benghazi and arrange their evacuation from Libya. The two photojournalists wounded alongside their colleagues remain in Misrata's hospital.  Mr Martin, a Cornish photographer who was working with Panos Pictures agency, was hit by <em>shrapnel</em> and remains in intensive care, although reports say his condition has improved after surgery on his leg. New York-based photographer Michael Christopher Brown, who is also being treated for <em>shrapnel</em> injuries, is said to be up and walking. Tributes poured in on Thursday for Mr Hetherington and Mr Hondros, who were both well-respected war photographers. Mr Hetherington, who had dual UK and US citizenship, was best known for his work in Afghanistan and won the World Press Photo of the Year Award in 2007. He also co-directed the Oscar-nominated documentary Restrepo, which followed US troops in Afghanistan. New-York based Mr Hondros was working for Getty Images and his previous awards include the Robert Capa Gold Medal for war photography. The Libyan government has expressed \"sadness\" over the photographers' deaths but spokesman Moussa Ibrahim said there were always casualties in war, adding: \"People die from our side, from their side, people get caught in the middle.\" The conflict in Libya began with an uprising against Col Muammar Gaddafi's 42-year rule in mid-February and it has developed into a battle for a territory. Nato is currently in charge of a no-fly zone and coalition operations have been largely confined to air attacks. On Thursday, the US sanctioned the use of armed drones over Libya to give \"precision capability\" to the military operation",

            "en": "Thailand-Cambodia Border Uneasy Calm After Clashes      Thai officials say they have resumed discussions with Cambodia to try to establish a ceasefire in a disputed border area. Military clashes over the weekend left at least seven people dead and sent thousands of villagers fleeing the area. Thai and Cambodian authorities say there has been no new fighting in their disputed border area for more than a day after four days of heavy shooting. Thai officials in Si Sa Ket province say the two sides also resumed talks and have agreed to stop the fighting. Colonel Chinnakaj Rattanajitti is a Thai military spokesman for the area. He says they had talks and agreed to stop the shooting. To avoid [further] violence, both parties will think twice before taking any actions. Before doing anything, he says, they will consult and coordinate with supervisors at all levels.\u00a0  Cambodian authorities were not immediately available to confirm any agreement. Colonel Chinnakaj added despite what he called an oral agreement to stop fighting, there is no formal ceasefire. Cambodian and Thai soldiers exchanged artillery fire during the weekend in territory surrounding the 900-year-old Hindu temple known as Preah Vihear in Cambodia and Phra Viharn in Thailand. At least seven people on both sides were killed and scores injured in the worst fighting there in years. Both sides blamed the other for starting the fighting. The border line was never settled and both Thailand and Cambodia claim the area around the temple and have soldiers stationed near it, leading to occasional shoot-outs. Cambodian authorities say the temple, a United Nations World Heritage site, was hit by Thai shells and damaged. The exchange of artillery fire also damaged homes and schools near the border and sent thousands of villagers fleeing for safety. At the Kantharalak district office a camp is set up for villagers who fled the fighting. Fifty-eight-year-old Juntee Patthapin says she and her children have been here since Friday when <em>shrapnel</em> rained down on her village, damaging houses and setting a rubber plantation on fire. She says her husband goes back to the village daily to feed their fish and chickens and guard their home, but she and the children will go back only when Thai authorities say it is safe. She says it is risky to go back because they do not know when the Cambodian military is going to start shooting. Like many of the Thai villagers she supports Thailand's claim to the disputed territory, but also wants the fighting to stop. For now, villagers welcome the uneasy calm and express hope that it will last so they can return to normal life.",
