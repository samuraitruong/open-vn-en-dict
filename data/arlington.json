Kennedy was assassinated while riding in his motorcade in downtown Dallas, Texas. Kennedy, who is the youngest man elected U.S. president, was killed by gunshots on November 22, 1963 as he rode in an open-top car. He was 46 years old. His wife, Jacqueline Kennedy, was by his side when the bullets struck. Kennedy was pronounced dead at a Dallas hospital, and vice president Lyndon Johnson was sworn in as president the same day. The assassination remains an iconic historical moment, remembered vividly by many Americans alive at the time. Investigators have concluded Lee Harvey Oswald fired the fatal shots. He was arrested shortly after the shooting, but never faced trial.\u00a0 Two days after the assassination, Dallas night club owner Jack Ruby shot and killed Oswald as he was being led through a police garage. Kennedy's death has spawned conspiracy theories, with some doubting the official explanation of the president's death. His body was returned to Washington and buried at <em>Arlington</em> National Cemetery, overlooking the nation's capital. An eternal flame marks his grave site. The Kennedys, including the president's siblings and children, have remained subjects of public interest.",

            "en": "Prepared remarks of President Obama\u2019s back to school event        Here are prepared remarks that President Obama is to deliver at noon ET Tuesday a Wakefield High School in <em>Arlington</em>, Virginia. Source: The White House Hello everyone - how's everybody doing today? I'm here with students at  Wakefield High School in <em>Arlington</em>, Virginia. And we've got students tuning in from all across  America, kindergarten through twelfth grade. I'm glad you all could join us today. I know that for many of you, today is the first day of school. And for those of you in kindergarten, or starting middle or high school, it's your first day in a new school, so it's understandable if you're a little nervous. I imagine there are some seniors out there who are feeling pretty good right now, with just one more  year to go. And no matter what  grade you're in, some of you are probably wishing it were still summer, and you could've stayed in bed just a little longer this morning.  I know that feeling. When I was young, my family lived in Indonesia for a few years, and my mother didn't have the money to send me where all the American kids went to school. So she decided to teach me extra lessons herself, Monday through Friday - at 4:30 in the morning. Now I wasn't too happy about getting up that early. A lot of times, I'd fall asleep right there at the kitchen table. But whenever I'd complain, my mother would just give me one of those looks and say, \"This is no picnic for me either, buster.\"   So I know some of you are still adjusting to being back at school. But I'm here today because I have something important to discuss with you. I'm here because I want to talk with you about your education and what's expected of all of you in this new school year. Now I've given a lot of speeches about education. And I've talked a lot about responsibility. I've talked about your teachers' responsibility for inspiring you, and pushing you to learn. I've talked about your parents' responsibility for making sure you stay on track, and get your homework done, and don't spend every waking hour in front of the TV or with that Xbox. I've talked a lot about your government's responsibility for setting high standards, supporting teachers and principals, and turning around schools that aren't working where students aren't getting the opportunities they deserve.  But at the end of the day, we can have the most dedicated teachers, the most supportive parents, and the best schools in the world - and none of it will matter unless all of you fulfill your responsibilities. Unless you show up to those schools; pay attention to those teachers; listen to your parents, grandparents and other adults; and put in the hard work it takes to succeed. And that's what I want to focus on today: the responsibility each of you has for your education. I want to start with the responsibility you have to yourself. Every single one of you has something you're good at. Every single one of you has something to offer. And you have a responsibility to yourself to discover what that is. That's the opportunity an education can provide. Maybe you could be a good writer - maybe even good enough to write a book or articles in a newspaper - but you might not know it until you write a paper for your English class. Maybe you could be an innovator or an inventor - maybe even good enough to come up with the next iPhone or a new medicine or vaccine - but you might not know it until you do a project for your science class. Maybe you could be a mayor or a Senator or a Supreme Court Justice, but you might not know that until you join student government or the debate team. And no matter what you want to do with your life - I guarantee that you'll need an education to do it. You want to be a doctor, or a teacher, or a police officer? You want to be a nurse or an architect, a lawyer or a mc\u00e1c ember of our military? You're going to need a good education for every single one of those careers. You can't drop out of school and just drop into a good job. You've got to work for it and train for it and learn for it. And this isn't just important for your own life and your own future. What you make of your education will decide nothing less than the future of this country. What you're learning in school today will determine whether we as a nation can meet our greatest challenges in the future. You'll need the knowledge and problem-solving skills you learn in science and math to cure diseases like cancer and AIDS, and to develop new energy technologies and protect our environment. You'll need the insights and critical thinking skills you gain in history and social studies to fight poverty and homelessness, crime and discrimination, and make our nation more fair and more free. You'll need the creativity and ingenuity you develop in all your classes to build new companies that will create new jobs and boost our economy. We need every single one of you to develop your talents, skills and intellect so you can help solve our most difficult problems. If you don't do that - if you quit on school - you're not just quitting on yourself, you're quitting on your country.   Now I know it's not always easy to do well in school. I know a lot of you have challenges in your lives right now that can make it hard to focus on your schoolwork. I get it. I know what that's like. My father left my family when I was two years old, and I was raised by a single mother who struggled at times to pay the bills and wasn't always able to give us things the other kids had. There were times when I missed having a father in my life. There were times when I was lonely and felt like I didn't fit in.  So I wasn't always as focused as I should have been. I did some things I'm not proud of, and got in more trouble than I should have. And my life could have easily taken a turn for the worse. But I was fortunate. I got a lot of second chances and had the opportunity to go to college, and law school, and follow my dreams. My wife, our First Lady Michelle Obama, has a similar story. Neither of her parents had gone to college, and they didn't have much. But they worked hard, and she worked hard, so that she could go to the best schools in this country   Some of you might not have those advantages. Maybe you don't have adults in your life who give you the support that you need. Maybe someone in your family has lost their job, and there's not enough money to go around. Maybe you live in a neighborhood where you don't feel safe, or have friends who are pressuring you to do things you know aren't right. But at the end of the day, the circumstances of your life - what you look like, where you come from, how much money you have, what you've got going on at home - that's no excuse for neglecting your homework or having a bad attitude. That's no excuse for talking back to your teacher, or cutting class, or dropping out of school. That's no excuse for not trying. Where you are right now doesn't have to determine where you'll end up. No one's written your destiny for you. Here in  America, you write your own destiny. You make your own future. That's what young people like you are doing every day, all across America. Young people like Jazmin Perez, from Roma, Texas. Jazmin didn't speak English when she first started school. Hardly anyone in her hometown went to college, and neither of her parents had gone either.  But she worked hard, earned good grades, got a scholarship to Brown University, and is now in graduate school, studying public health, on her way to being Dr. Jazmin Perez. I'm thinking about Andoni Schultz, from Los Altos, California, who's fought brain cancer since he was three  He's endured all sorts of treatments and surgeries, one of which affected his mc\u00e1c emory, so it took him much longer - hundreds of extra hours - to do his schoolwork  But he never fell behind, and he's headed to college this fall. And then there's Shantell Steve, from my hometown of  Chicago, Illinois  Even when bouncing from foster home to foster home in the toughest neighborhoods, she managed to get a job at a local health center; start a program to keep young people out of gangs; and she's on track to graduate high school with honors and go on to college. Jazmin, Andoni and Shantell aren't any different from any of you. They faced challenges in their lives just like you do. But they refused to give up. They chose to take responsibility for their education and set goals for themselves. And I expect all of you to do the same. That's why today, I'm calling on each of you to set your own goals for your education - and to do everything you can to meet them Your goal can be something as simple as doing all your homework, paying attention in class, or spending time each day reading a book  Maybe you'll decide to get involved in an extracurricular activity, or volunteer in your community  Maybe you'll decide to stand up for kids who are being teased or bullied because of who they are or how they look, because you believe, like I do, that all kids deserve a safe environment to study and learn Maybe you'll decide to take better care of yourself so you can be more ready to learn. And along those lines, I hope you'll all wash your hands a lot, and stay home from school when you don't feel well, so we can keep people from getting the flu this fall and winter.  Whatever you resolve to do, I want you to commit to it. I want you to really work at it. I know that sometimes, you get the sense from TV that you can be rich and successful without any hard work -- that your ticket to success is through rapping or basketball or being a reality TV star, when chances are, you're not going to be any of those things. But the truth is, being successful is hard. You won't love every subject you study. You won't click with every teacher. Not every homework assignment will sec\u00e1c em completely relevant to your life right this minute. And you won't necessarily succeed at everything the first time you try. That's OK. Some of the most successful people in the world are the ones who've had the most failures JK Rowling's first Harry Potter book was rejected twelve times before it was finally published  Michael Jordan was cut from his high school basketball team, and he lost hundreds of games and missed thousands of shots during his career. But he once said, \"I have failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.\" These people succeeded because they understand that you can't let your failures define you - you have to let them teach you You have to let them show you what to do differently next time. If you get in trouble, that doesn't mean you're a troublemaker, it means you need to try harder to behave. If you get a bad grade, that doesn't mean you're stupid, it just means you need to spend more time studying  No one's born being good at things, you become good at things through hard work You're not a varsity athlete the first time you play a new sport. You don't hit every note the first time you sing a song. You've got to practice It's the same with your schoolwork. You might have to do a math problem a few times before you get it right, or read something a few times before you understand it, or do a few drafts of a paper before it's good enough to hand in. Don't be afraid to ask questions. Don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it. I do that every day. Asking for help isn't a sign of weakness, it's a sign of strength It shows you have the courage to admit when you don't know something, and to learn something new. So find an adult you trust - a parent, grandparent or teacher; a coach or counselor - and ask them to help you stay on track to meet your goals. And even when you're struggling, even when you're discouraged, and you feel like other people have given up on you - don't ever give up on yourself. Because when you give up on yourself, you give up on your country The story of America isn't about people who quit when things got tough. It's about people who kept going, who tried harder, who loved their country too much to do anything less than their best. It's the story of students who sat where you sit 250 years ago, and went on to wage a revolution and found this nation  Students who sat where you sit 75 years ago who overcame a Depression and won a world war; who fought for civil rights and put a man on the moon. Students who sat where you sit 20 years ago who founded Google, Twitter and Facebook and changed the way we communicate with each other So today, I want to ask you, what's your contribution going to be? What problems are you going to solve? What discoveries will you make?  What will a president who comes here in twenty or fifty or one hundred years say about what all of you did for this country? Your families, your teachers, and I are doing everything we can to make sure you have the education you need to answer these questions I'm working hard to fix up your classrooms and get you the books, equipment and computers you need to learn. But you've got to do your part too. So I expect you to get serious this year I expect you to put your best effort into everything you do. I expect great things from each of you. So don't let us down - don't let your family or your country or yourself down. Make us all proud. I know you can do it. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America.",

            "en": "It\u2019s Not Always Women and Children First          MONDAY, March 1 (HealthDay News) \u2014 In a life-and-death situation, how much time people have to react has a lot to do with whether they behave selfishly or selflessly, if a new critique of the infamous Titanic and Lusitania ocean liner disasters is any indication. The comparative look at who survived two of the 20th century\u2019s most infamous shipping calamities suggests that the so-called \u201ceconomic theory\u201d of human behavior \u2014 namely, that in the face of disaster, rational self-preservation trumps social norms and rules \u2014 does not always hold water.  \u201cWhat would you do?\u201d asked study co-author Benno Torgler, a professor of economics and finance at the Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia. \u201cWould you attempt to save your own life at whatever cost to others, or would you help others and put your life at stake for others? One would think that selfish and self-preserving behavior predominates. However, we provide evidence \u2026 that this is not always the case.\u201d To discern what makes threatened people tick, the researchers compared data on passenger and crew members and their reactions to the two maritime disasters. Manifests indicate that passenger composition was similar on the ships, with 62 percent to 65 percent of the passengers male. In both instances, Torgler and his team noted, the ship captains ordered their crew to save female passengers and children first \u2014 because of a scarcity of lifeboats on the Titanic and because of too little time to launch lifeboats on the Lusitania. Younger, stronger and more agile passengers would have been expected to have a better chance of surviving both sinkings, the researchers noted. That\u2019s not, however, what they found. On the Titanic, survival more closely tracked the crew\u2019s directive, which reflected accepted social norms: females 16 to 35 years of age had a much higher probability of surviving the disaster than did men of a similar age. In terms of economic class and social power, first-class passengers were found to have better survival rates than their poorer shipmates. On the Lusitania, on the other hand, both men and women aged 16 to 35 had a greater chance of survival than did younger or older passengers. And bearers of first-class passage actually were less likely to survive than third-class passengers. The researchers concluded that, on the Lusitania, a \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d pattern was in play, whereas prevailing social protocols and captain orders were enforced on the Titanic and respected by crew and passengers alike. A report on their findings is published in this week\u2019s online issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. What accounts for the differences in behavior? Torgler and his colleagues think it was mainly a question of timing. The Lusitania, they pointed out, sank just 18 minutes after it was torpedoed by a German U-boat on May 7, 1915, killing more than 1,198 people from a manifest of 1,258 passengers and 691 crew members. By contrast, the Titanic stayed afloat for two hours and 40 minutes after striking ice on the night of April 14, 1912. Although 1,512 people died in that disaster \u2014 from among 1,300 passengers and 886 crew onboard \u2014 the extra coping time afforded the Titanic\u2019s crew and passengers a sort of psychological buffer against selfishness, according to the researchers. People on the Titanic were better able to resist the powerful instinct to save oneself by using superior physical prowess to flee \u2014 a mindset that seemed to prevail on the much more quickly doomed Lusitania, the researchers said. On the Titanic, time appeared to favor adoption of respect for social norms, which favored women, while fostering a better of exchange of lifesaving advice that probably favored those in the upper class with the best access to such information, they said. What\u2019s more, the added time also would have allowed for the dissipation of adrenaline, which triggers a fight-or-flight reaction that, by contrast, would have been in play throughout the entire Lusitania sinking.  \u201cTime seems to be a crucial element,\u201d noted Torgler. \u201cIf people have time to interact and communicate, social norms and helping behavior emerges. Children, families with children and women in general have then a higher probability of surviving, while men have a higher willingness to surrender a seat on a lifeboat.\u201d Other factors, however, might also have influenced behavior on the two ships, the researchers acknowledged. For example, the fact that Lusitania passengers already knew of the gruesome fate of the Titanic just three years earlier could have contributed to a less restrained reaction. Differing ship structures and the fact that the Lusitania incident occurred in a wartime context also might have affected passenger thinking, they said. Yet Torgler and his colleagues suggest that, in general, their observations could help planners devise more effective disaster-reaction strategies by broadening the understanding of how people juggle survival instincts with social pressures when confronting extreme situations. For his part, Robert J. Gatchel, a professor of clinical health psychology at the University of Texas at <em>Arlington</em>, agreed that timing does affect behavior during a disaster, while noting that other issues of perception are almost certainly also at play.  \u201cOn the Titanic, there was clearly a predetermined perception that it was unsinkable,\u201d he remarked. \u201cThere was all the pre-travel publicity about that. So the passengers probably had a feeling that \u2018Yeah, we\u2019re evacuating the ship but it\u2019s not really going to go down, and we\u2019re doing it for a precautionary reason.\u2019 There was probably a perception that this wasn\u2019t really a disaster, at least at first. So instead of an immediate fight-or-flight response, there was a perception of control, for better or worse. And we know that that perception will reduce stress and affect behavior,\u201d Gatchel said.  \u201cOn the other hand, people on the Lusitania were no longer under the illusion that these big ships could not go down. They knew of the great publicity of the Titanic, and they didn\u2019t want to be part of another incident like that. So they lost their sense of control, which increased stress levels. And then it became a free-for-all in terms of survival of the fittest. And I\u2019m also sure just in terms of the cadence of the voice of the officers the urgency to get off was greater, if for no other reason than because another torpedo could be fired. So, I think probably general panic was not only among the passengers but among the officers themselves,\u201d Gatchel said.",
