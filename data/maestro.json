            "en": "Mobile phone usage kick starts brain energy consumption    Although there is no statistical proof that mobile phone usage causes tumors and the like, it has been discovered that there is certainly chemicals in the brain that are affected. Just fifty minutes on your cell phone causes an increase in brain glucose, or sugar, metabolism.   Glucose is the form of sugar that travels in your bloodstream to fuel the mitochondrial furnaces responsible for your brain power. Glucose is the only fuel normally used by brain cells. Because neurons cannot store glucose, they depend on the bloodstream to deliver a constant supply of this precious fuel.   This blood sugar is obtained from carbohydrates: the starches and sugars you eat in the form of grains and legumes, fruits and vegetables. Too much sugar or refined carbohydrates at one time, however, can actually deprive your brain of glucose, depleting its energy supply and compromising the brain's power to concentrate, remember, and learn. Mental activity requires a lot of energy.   Dr. Nora D. Volkow, the director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, led a team who took 47 healthy people and scanned their brains while they held cell phones to their ears. They used PET imaging (positron emission tomography) to measure how their brains used glucose, which again, is the primary fuel used by brain cells. Only the areas of the brain closest to the phone's antenna were activated, primarily the orbit frontal cortex and temporal pole.   Brain cells need two times more energy than the other cells in the body.  Neurons, the cells that communicate with each other, have a high demand for energy because they're always in a state of metabolic activity. Even during sleep, neurons are still at work repairing and rebuilding their worn out structural components.   They are manufacturing enzymes and neurotransmitters that must be transported out to the very ends of their nerve branches, some that can be several inches, or feet, away.   Most demanding of a neuron's energy, however, are the bioelectric signals responsible for communication throughout the nervous system. This nerve transmission consumes one-half of all the brain's energy (nearly 10% of the whole body's energy).     It isn't clear that this increased brain activity is necessarily harmful in either the long or the short term. However, brain tumors use glucose to grow so an increase in glucose activity may not be good. In addition, cell phone use increases among kids, their smaller, still-developing brains may face an increased risk from the radio frequency emissions.     Aside, a Motorola sponsored study found cell phones give people a newfound personal power, enabling unprecedented mobility and allowing them to conduct their business on the go. Interesting enough, gender differences can be found in phone use. Women see their cell phone as a means of expression and social communication, while males tend to use it as an interactive toy. Some men view the cell phone as a status symbol, competing with other males for the most high tech toy and even using the cell phone to seduce the opposite sex. The fact is that much more research needs to be done to truly examine cell phone impact on physiology.   Dr. Rolando F. Del <em>Maestro</em> of the Montreal Neurological Institute concludes:  \"In people who are using cell phones a lot, this suggests to me you would be wise to use a hands-free system, if you possibly can. It just makes logical sense that if something is changing brain metabolism, you probably don't want that near your ear.\"  Source: Journal of American Medical Association Written by Sy Kraft, B.A.  Copyright: Medical News Today",

Some of them are holidays while others are celebrated during working days. A day that is dedicated to the hard work that is input by the teacher all year long, a day that is a complete tribute to the teachers all around India. In India teacher\u2019s day is celebrated on 5th of September. Teacher\u2019s Day is a dedication to Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, who was a staunch believer of education and was one of the most well known diplomat, scholar, president of India and above all a teacher. As a tribute to this great teacher, his birthday has been observed as teachers' day and this led to its origin.  This day is just a mere reflection of Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan's love for and attachment to the teaching profession. As a matter of fact Dr. Radhakrishnan himself asked his admirers to celebrate his birthday not as his birthday but as the teacher's day. His work varied on philosophical, theological, ethical, educational, social and cultural subjects. He contributed numerous articles to different well-known journals, which, are of immense value and seems to surprise various readers because of the depth in the meaning of the articles. Teacher's day is now one of the occasion that is looked forward by the teachers and students alike as on this occasion its not only when teachers are praised but also around various schools students dress up as a representation of their teachers and take various lectures that are assigned to the teachers they represent. On this day students realize what it means to be a teacher and what it means to control the future of several students in their classes and also teachers are reminded what it felt like when they were the students. Apart from the fun aspect everybody should pay their respects to the great Dr. Radhakrishnan. Since that day this event have become a regular event. Apart from the fun aspect of the day it is also a day when one can look back and admire and get inspired by Dr. Radhakrishnan, a small town cunning boy, who grew up to become one of the most respected politicians in the history of democracy of India. Teachers' Days Celebrated in Working Days India September 5 is Teacher's Day in India. It is the birthday of second President of India and teacher Dr. Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan. When Dr. Radhakrishnan became the president of India in 1962, some of his students and friends approached him and requested him to allow them to celebrate 5 September, his birthday. In reply, Dr. Radhakrishnan said, \"Instead of celebrating my birthday separately, it would be my proud privilege if September 5 is observed as \"Teachers Day\". This is not a holiday in India. It is considered a \"celebration\" day, where teachers and students report to school as usual but the usual activities and classes are replaced by activities of celebration, thanking and remembrance. At some schools on this day, the responsibility of teaching is taken up by the senior students as an appreciation for their teachers. Traditionally, people in India have given tremendous respect and honor to teachers. An old Indian saying (usually taught to children), ranks teacher in the third place, even before God: \"'Maata, Pitha, Guru, Daivam'\", meaning Mother, Father and Teacher is God.
