            "en": "Scientists have taken another big step toward identifying the genetic flaws which may cause autism, a type of neurological development disorder. In the latest development, laboratory mice have been genetically engineered to produce autism-like behaviors. Researchers have known that certain genetic defects are associated with autism. One of the most common is known as a deletion, when a child inherits only one gene or group of genes, instead of the normally inherited pair, one from each parent. In particular, there is a cluster of 27 genes on chromosome 16. Children with autism may have only one copy of those genes, instead of the usual two. Scientists at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory used mice that were genetically engineered to have this same kind of deletion defect. Then, they observed the mice. \"What we found was really, really amazing,\" says senior author Alea A. Mills. \"They have a number of features that are used to diagnose children with autism. They're <em>hyperactive</em>, they have repetitive behaviors, and they have a lot of sleeping deficits.\" Mills said they also studied the brains of the laboratory mice. Co-author Mark Henkleman, of the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto ran MRI scans on the mice. \"And what he found was that there were eight different regions of the brain that were severely affected. Interestingly, one of these regions of the brain is the hypothalamus,\" Mills says. And previous research has linked the hypothalamus with some repetitive behaviors that are characteristic of autism. So is this deletion - a missing second copy of this 27-gene cluster - the \"cause\" of autism? Mills says it's not that simple. \"There are a number of different genetic changes that have been found [to be] associated with autism. There could be a network of interacting players, but I don't think there will be a single region [of the genome] that is responsible for all cases of autism, from what we're seeing.\" \u00a0Still, putting together pieces of the genetic puzzle surrounding autism may help researchers understand the disorder better, and that might lead someday to new therapies. And the development of mice with autism-like behaviors may help scientists in the process. The research paper by Alea Mills and colleagues is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.",

            "en": "Teens With Psychosocial Disorders Prone to Internet Addiction         By: Madeline Ellis Published: Thursday, 8 October 2009 In recent years, there has been an explosion of Internet use, and it\u2019s easy to understand why. The Internet provides affordable up-to-date information on almost any topic imaginable, around-the-clock entertainment, social networking sites that allow for both public and anonymous communication, and email or online chat that lets us keep in contact with family and friends, even if they\u2019re in another time zone. Most people are able to integrate online time into their lives in a balanced healthy manner, but others develop a stronger dependency, often replacing work, school, friends and even family with countless hours surfing the Web, instant messaging and blogging, or playing Internet video games. In fact, it is estimated that as many as 10 percent of Internet users may be considered addicted. Experts say that people who abuse the Internet are typically struggling with other problems, like anxiety or depression, and new research lends credence to that theory. To access the risk factors for Internet addiction, Cheng-Fang Yen, MD, PhD, of Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital in Taiwan, and colleagues conducted a prospective study of 2,293 seventh-graders, whose average age was 12, from 10 junior high schools in southern Taiwan in September of 2005. The students were asked to fill out questionnaires that assessed whether they had attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression, social phobia or abnormal feelings of hostility. Then, 6, 12 and 24 months later, they were asked about their Internet usage, including the number of hours they spent on the Internet and the sorts of sites they frequented.  After two years, roughly 11 percent of the students were addicted to the Internet. Males, those who spent more than 20 hours a week on the Internet and teens who played online games were more likely to be deemed addicted. But the greatest risk factors were found to be ADHD and hostility. Boys and girls with ADHD had a 72 percent increased risk of developing unhealthy dependence on the Internet and those who exhibited significant hostility had a 67 percent increased risk. Girls with social phobias and those suffering depression were also at greater risk, though these factors did not affect boys. Michael Gilbert, senior fellow at the Center for the Digital Future at University of Southern California's Annenberg School for Communication, says it makes perfect sense why the Internet would appeal to children with these issues. \u201cIf you have a child that is <em>hyperactive</em>, the Internet can move at their pace. If you have a child that is depressed or has social phobia, they can get in touch with other kids dealing with the same kinds of issues,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can go into artificial worlds, like \u2018Second Life,\u2019 where they can live out fantasies or take on different personas. For kids who have anger or hostility, the Internet gives them a chance to play out their aggression there.\u201d The study authors say that because computer use is a way of life in the United States, the potential exists for childhood computer addiction to become a major public health problem, a sentiment echoed by the authors of an editorial accompanying the study in the October Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine. \u201cWoven as it is into the fabric of today\u2019s society, the potential for Internet use to lead to overuse and ultimately to addiction is concerning,\u201d wrote Drs. Dimitri A. Christakis and Megan A. Moreno of the University of Washington in Seattle. As the Internet becomes more intertwined in everyday life, eliminating its use is unrealistic, making prevention all the more critical. Experts say parents of teens should monitor the time their children spend on the Internet and the sites they visit and pediatricians and mental health professionals should ask their teenage patients about their Internet usage. This is especially important for children with mental health conditions. Internet addiction is not currently recognized as a separate disorder by the American Psychiatric Association. There is debate about whether to include Internet addiction as a separate illness in the next edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, due in 2012, which determines which mental illnesses are covered by insurance.",
