            "en": "3          3. PHENOMENON When I opened my eyes in the morning, something was different.  It was the light. It was still the gray-green light of a cloudy day in the forest, but it was clearer somehow. I realized there was no fog veiling my window. I jumped up to look outside, and then groaned in horror. A fine layer of snow covered the yard, dusted the top of my truck, and whitened the road. But that wasn't the worst part. All the rain from yesterday had frozen solid \u2014 coating the needles on the trees in fantastic, gorgeous patterns, and making the driveway a deadly ice slick. I had enough trouble not falling down when the ground was dry; it might be safer for me to go back to bed now. Charlie had left for work before I got downstairs. In a lot of ways, living with Charlie was like having my own place, and I found myself reveling in the aloneness instead of being lonely. I threw down a quick bowl of cereal and some orange juice from the carton. I felt excited to go to school, and that scared me. I knew it wasn't the stimulating learning environment I was anticipating, or seeing my new set of friends. If I was being honest with myself, I knew I was eager to get to school because I would see Edward Cullen. And that was very, very stupid. I should be avoiding him entirely after my brainless and embarrassing babbling yesterday. And I was suspicious of him; why should he lie about his eyes? I was still frightened of the hostility I sometimes felt emanating from him, and I was still tongue-tied whenever I pictured his perfect face. I was well aware that my league and his league were spheres that did not touch. So I \u00a0shouldn't be at all anxious to see him today. It took every ounce of my concentration to make it down the icy brick driveway alive. I almost lost my balance when I finally got to the truck, but I managed to cling to the side mirror and save myself. Clearly, today was going to be nightmarish. Driving to school, I distracted myself from my fear of falling and my unwanted speculations about Edward Cullen by thinking about Mike and Eric, and the obvious difference in how teenage boys responded to me here. I was sure I looked exactly the same as I had in Phoenix. Maybe it was just that the boys back home had watched me pass slowly through all the awkward phases of adolescence and still thought of me that way.  Perhaps it was because I was a novelty here, where novelties were few and far between. Possibly my crippling clumsiness was seen as endearing rather than pathetic, casting me as a damsel in distress. Whatever the reason, Mike's puppy dog behavior and Eric's apparent rivalry with him were disconcerting. I wasn't sure if I didn't prefer being ignored.  My truck seemed to have no problem with the black ice that covered the roads. I drove very slowly, though, not wanting to carve a path of destruction through Main Street. When I got out of my truck at school, I saw why I'd had so little trouble. Something silver caught my eye, and I walked to the back of the truck \u2014 carefully holding the side for support \u2014 to examine my tires.  There were thin chains crisscrossed in diamond shapes around them. Charlie had gotten up who knows how early to put snow chains on my truck.  My throat suddenly felt tight. I wasn't used to being taken care of, and Charlie's unspoken concern caught me by surprise.  I was standing by the back corner of the truck, struggling to fight back the sudden wave of emotion the snow chains had brought on, when I heard an odd sound. It was a high-pitched screech, and it was fast becoming painfully loud. I looked up, startled. I saw several things simultaneously. Nothing was moving in slow motion, the way it does in the movies. Instead, the adrenaline rush seemed to make my brain work much faster, and I was able to absorb in clear detail several things at once. Edward Cullen was standing four cars down from me, staring at me in horror. His face stood out from a sea of faces, all frozen in the same mask of shock. But of more immediate importance was the dark blue van that was skidding, tires locked and squealing against the brakes, spinning wildly across the ice of the parking lot. It was going to hit the back corner of my truck, and I was standing between them. I didn't even have time to close my eyes. Just before I heard the shattering crunch of the van folding around the truck bed, something hit me, hard, but not from the direction I was expecting. My head cracked against the icy blacktop, and I felt something solid and cold pinning me to the ground. I was lying on the pavement behind the tan car I'd parked next to. But I didn't have a chance to notice anything else, because the van was still coming. It had curled gratingly around the end of the truck and, still spinning and sliding, was about to collide with me again. A low oath made me aware that someone was with me, and the voice was impossible not to recognize. Two long, white hands shot out protectively in front of me, and the van shuddered to a stop a foot from my face, the large hands fitting providentially into a deep dent in the side of the van's body. Then his hands moved so fast they blurred. One was suddenly gripping under the body of the van, and something was dragging me, swinging my legs around like a rag doll's, till they hit the tire of the tan car. A groaning metallic thud hurt my ears, and the van settled, glass popping, onto the asphalt \u2014 exactly where, a second ago, my legs had been. It was absolutely silent for one long second before the screaming began.  In the abrupt bedlam, I could hear more than one person shouting my name. But more clearly than all the yelling, I could hear Edward Cullen's low, frantic voice in my ear. \"Bella? Are you all right?\" \"I'm fine.\" My voice sounded strange. I tried to sit up, and realized he was holding me against the side of his body in an iron grasp. \"Be careful,\" he warned as I struggled. \"I think you hit your head pretty hard.\" I became aware of a throbbing ache centered above my left ear. \"Ow,\" I said, surprised. \"That's what I thought.\" His voice, amazingly, sounded like he was suppressing laughter. \"How in the\u2026\" I trailed off, trying to clear my head, get my bearings. \"How did you get over here so fast?\" \"I was standing right next to you, Bella,\" he said, his tone serious again. I turned to sit up, and this time he let me, releasing his hold around my waist and sliding as far from me as he could in the limited space. I looked at his concerned, innocent expression and was disoriented again by the force of his gold-colored eyes. What was I asking him? And then they found us, a crowd of people with tears streaming down their faces, shouting at each other, shouting at us. \"Don't move,\" someone instructed. \"Get Tyler out of the van!\" someone else shouted. There was a flurry of activity around us. I tried to get up, but Edward's cold hand pushed my shoulder down. \"Just stay put for now.\" \"But it's cold,\" I complained. It surprised me when he chuckled under his breath. There was an edge to the sound. \"You were over there,\" I suddenly remembered, and his chuckle stopped short. \"You were by your car.\" His expression turned hard. \"No, I wasn't.\" \"I saw you.\" All around us was chaos. I could hear the gruffer voices of adults arriving on the scene. But I obstinately held on to our argument; I was right, and he was going to admit it. \"Bella, I was standing with you, and I pulled you out of the way.\" He unleashed the full, devastating power of his eyes on me, as if trying to communicate something crucial. \"No.\" I set my jaw. The gold in his eyes blazed. \"Please, Bella.\" \"Why?\" I demanded. \"Trust me,\" he pleaded, his soft voice overwhelming. I could hear the sirens now. \"Will you promise to explain everything to me later?\" \"Fine,\" he snapped, abruptly exasperated. \"Fine,\" I repeated angrily. It took six EMTs and two teachers \u2014 Mr. Varner and Coach Clapp \u2014 to shift the van far enough away from us to bring the stretchers in. Edward vehemently refused his, and I tried to do the same, but the traitor told them I'd hit my head and probably had a concussion. I almost died of humiliation when they put on the neck brace. It looked like the entire school was there, watching soberly as they loaded me in the back of the ambulance. Edward got to ride in the front. It was maddening.  To make matters worse, Chief Swan arrived before they could get me safely away. \"Bella!\" he yelled in panic when he recognized me on the stretcher. \"I'm completely fine, Char \u2014 Dad,\" I sighed. \"There's nothing wrong with me.\" He turned to the closest EMT for a second opinion. I tuned him out to consider the jumble of inexplicable images churning chaotically in my head. When they'd lifted me away from the car, I had seen the deep dent in the tan car's bumper \u2014 a very distinct dent that fit the contours of Edward's shoulders\u2026 as if he had braced himself against the car with enough force to damage the metal frame\u2026 And then there was his family, looking on from the distance, with expressions that ranged from disapproval to fury but held no hint of concern for their brother's safety. I tried to think of a logical solution that could explain what I had just seen \u2014 a solution that excluded the assumption that I was insane. Naturally, the ambulance got a police escort to the county hospital. I felt ridiculous the whole time they were unloading me. What made it worse was that Edward simply glided through the hospital doors under his own power. I ground my teeth together. They put me in the emergency room, a long room with a line of beds separated by pastel-patterned curtains. A nurse put a pressure cuff on my arm and a thermometer under my tongue. Since no one bothered pulling the curtain around to give me some privacy, I decided I wasn't obligated to wear the stupid-looking neck brace anymore. When the nurse walked away, I quickly unfastened the Velcro and threw it under the bed. There was another flurry of hospital personnel, another stretcher brought to the bed next to me. I recognized Tyler Crowley from my Government class beneath the bloodstained bandages wrapped tightly around his head.  Tyler looked a hundred times worse than I felt. But he was staring anxiously at me. \"Bella, I'm so sorry!\" \"I'm fine, Tyler \u2014 you look awful, are you all right?\" As we spoke, nurses began unwinding his soiled bandages, exposing a myriad of shallow slices all over his forehead and left cheek. He ignored me. \"I thought I was going to kill you! I was going too fast, and I hit the ice wrong\u2026\" He winced as one nurse started dabbing at his face. \"Don't worry about it; you missed me.\" \"How did you get out of the way so fast? You were there, and then you were gone\u2026\" \"Umm\u2026 Edward pulled me out of the way.\" He looked confused. \"Who?\" \"Edward Cullen \u2014 he was standing next to me.\" I'd always been a terrible liar; I didn't sound convincing at all. \"Cullen? I didn't see him\u2026 wow, it was all so fast, I guess. Is he okay?\" \"I think so. He's here somewhere, but they didn't make him use a stretcher.\" I knew I wasn't crazy. What had happened? There was no way to explain away what I'd seen. They wheeled me away then, to X-ray my head. I told them there was nothing wrong, and I was right. Not even a concussion. I asked if I could leave, but the nurse said I had to talk to a doctor first. So I was trapped in the ER, waiting, harassed by Tyler's constant apologies and promises to make it up to me. No matter how many times I tried to convince him I was fine, he continued to torment himself. Finally, I closed my eyes and ignored him. He kept up a remorseful mumbling. \"Is she sleeping?\" a musical voice asked. My eyes flew open. Edward was standing at the foot of my bed, smirking. I glared at him. It wasn't easy \u2014 it would have been more natural to ogle. \"Hey, Edward, I'm really sorry \u2014\" Tyler began. Edward lifted a hand to stop him. \"No blood, no foul,\" he said, flashing his brilliant teeth. He moved to sit on the edge of Tyler's bed, facing me. He smirked again. \"So, what's the verdict?\" he asked me. \"There's nothing wrong with me at all, but they won't let me go,\" I complained. \"How come you aren't strapped to a gurney like the rest of us?\" \"It's all about who you know,\" he answered. \"But don't worry, I came to spring you.\" Then a doctor walked around the corner, and my mouth fell open. He was young, he was blond\u2026 and he was handsomer than any movie star I'd ever seen. He was pale, though, and tired-looking, with circles under his eyes. From Charlie's description, this had to be Edward's father. \"So, Miss Swan,\" Dr. Cullen said in a remarkably appealing voice, \"how are you feeling?\" \"I'm fine,\" I said, for the last time, I hoped. He walked to the lightboard on the wall over my head, and turned it on. \"Your X-rays look good,\" he said. \"Does your head hurt? Edward said you hit it pretty hard.\" \"It's fine,\" I repeated with a sigh, throwing a quick scowl toward Edward. The doctor's cool fingers probed lightly along my skull. He noticed when I winced. \"Tender?\" he asked. \"Not really.\" I'd had worse. I heard a chuckle, and looked over to see Edward's patronizing smile. My eyes narrowed. \"Well, your father is in the waiting room \u2014 you can go home with him now. But come back if you feel dizzy or have trouble with your eyesight at all.\" \"Can't I go back to school?\" I asked, imagining Charlie trying to be attentive. \"Maybe you should take it easy today.\" I glanced at Edward. \"Does he get to go to school?\" \"Someone has to spread the good news that we survived,\" Edward said <em>smugly</em>. \"Actually,\" Dr. Cullen corrected, \"most of the school seems to be in the waiting room.\" \"Oh no,\" I moaned, covering my face with my hands. Dr. Cullen raised his eyebrows. \"Do you want to stay?\" \"No, no!\" I insisted, throwing my legs over the side of the bed and hopping down quickly. Too quickly \u2014 I staggered, and Dr. Cullen caught me. He looked concerned. \"I'm fine,\" I assured him again. No need to tell him my balance problems had nothing to do with hitting my head. \"Take some Tylenol for the pain,\" he suggested as he steadied me.  \"It doesn't hurt that bad,\" I insisted. \"It sounds like you were extremely lucky,\" Dr. Cullen said, smiling as he signed my chart with a flourish. \"Lucky Edward happened to be standing next to me,\" I amended with a hard glance at the subject of my statement. \"Oh, well, yes,\" Dr. Cullen agreed, suddenly occupied with the papers in front of him. Then he looked away, at Tyler, and walked to the next bed. My intuition flickered; the doctor was in on it. \"I'm afraid that you'll have to stay with us just a little bit longer,\" he said to Tyler, and began checking his cuts. As soon as the doctor's back was turned, I moved to Edward's side. \"Can I talk to you for a minute?\" I hissed under my breath. He took a step back from me, his jaw suddenly clenched. \"Your father is waiting for you,\" he said through his teeth \u2013  I glanced at Dr. Cullen and Tyler. \"I'd like to speak with you alone, if you don't mind,\" I pressed. He glared, and then turned his back and strode down the long room. I nearly had to run to keep up. As soon as we turned the corner into a short hallway, he spun around to face me. \"What do you want?\" he asked, sounding annoyed. His eyes were cold. His unfriendliness intimidated me. My words came out with less severity than I'd intended. \"You owe me an explanation,\" I reminded him. \"I saved your life \u2014 I don't owe you anything.\" I flinched back from the resentment in his voice. \"You promised.\" \"Bella, you hit your head, you don't know what you're talking about.\" His tone was cutting. My temper flared now, and I glared defiantly at him. \"There's nothing wrong with my head.\" He glared back. \"What do you want from me, Bella?\" \"I want to know the truth,\" I said. \"I want to know why I'm lying for you.\" \"What do you think happened?\" he snapped. It came out in a rush. \"All I know is that you weren't anywhere near me \u2014 Tyler didn't see you, either, so don't tell me I hit my head too hard. That van was going to crush us both \u2014 and it didn't, and your hands left dents in the side of it \u2014 and you left a dent in the other car, and you're not hurt at all \u2014 and the van should have smashed my legs, but you were holding it up\u2026\" I could hear how crazy it sounded, and I couldn't continue. I was so mad I could feel the tears coming; I tried to force them back by grinding my teeth together. He was staring at me incredulously. But his face was tense, defensive. \"You think I lifted a van off you?\" His tone questioned my sanity, but it only made me more suspicious. It was like a perfectly delivered line by a skilled actor. I merely nodded once, jaw tight. \"Nobody will believe that, you know.\" His voice held an edge of derision now. \"I'm not going to tell anybody.\" I said each word slowly, carefully controlling my anger. Surprise flitted across his face. \"Then why does it matter?\" \"It matters to me,\" I insisted. \"I don't like to lie \u2014 so there'd better be a good reason why I'm doing it.\" \"Can't you just thank me and get over it?\" \"Thank you.\" I waited, fuming and expectant. \"You're not going to let it go, are you?\" \"No.\" \"In that case\u2026 I hope you enjoy disappointment.\" We scowled at each other in silence. I was the first to speak, trying to keep myself focused. I was in danger of being distracted by his livid, glorious face. It was like trying to stare down a destroying angel. \"Why did you even bother?\" I asked frigidly. He paused, and for a brief moment his stunning face was unexpectedly vulnerable. \"I don't know,\" he whispered. And then he turned his back on me and walked away. I was so angry, it took me a few minutes until I could move. When I could walk, I made my way slowly to the exit at the end of the hallway. The waiting room was more unpleasant than I'd feared. It seemed like every face I knew in Forks was there, staring at me. Charlie rushed to my side; I put up my hands. \"There's nothing wrong with me,\" I assured him sullenly. I was still aggravated, not in the mood for chitchat. \"What did the doctor say?\" \"Dr. Cullen saw me, and he said I was fine and I could go home.\" I sighed. Mike and Jessica and Eric were all there, beginning to converge on us. \"Let's go,\" I urged. Charlie put one arm behind my back, not quite touching me, and led me to the glass doors of the exit. I waved sheepishly at my friends, hoping to convey that they didn't need to worry anymore. It was a huge relief\u2014 the first time I'd ever felt that way \u2014 to get into the cruiser. We drove in silence. I was so wrapped up in my thoughts that I barely knew Charlie was there. I was positive that Edward's defensive behavior in the hall was a confirmation of the bizarre things I still could hardly believe I'd witnessed. When we got to the house, Charlie finally spoke. \"Um\u2026 you'll need to call Ren\u00e9e.\" He hung his head, guilty. I was appalled. \"You told Mom!\" \"Sorry.\" I slammed the cruiser's door a little harder than necessary on my way out. My mom was in hysterics, of course. I had to tell her I felt fine at least thirty times before she would calm down. She begged me to come home \u2014 forgetting the fact that home was empty at the moment \u2014 but her pleas were easier to resist than I would have thought. I was consumed by the mystery Edward presented. And more than a little obsessed by Edward himself. Stupid, stupid, stupid. I wasn't as eager to escape Forks as I should be, as any normal, sane person would be. I decided I might as well go to bed early that night. Charlie continued to watch me anxiously, and it was getting on my nerves. I stopped on my way to grab three Tylenol from the bathroom. They did help, and, as the pain eased, I drifted to sleep. That was the first night I dreamed of Edward Cullen.",

            "en": "12        12. BALANCING \"Billy!\" Charlie called as soon as he got out of the car. I turned toward the house, beckoning to Jacob as I ducked under the porch. I heard Charlie greeting them loudly behind me. \"I'm going to pretend I didn't see you behind the wheel, Jake,\" he said disapprovingly. \"We get permits early on the rez,\" Jacob said while I unlocked the door and flicked on the porch light. \"Sure you do,\" Charlie laughed. \"I have to get around somehow.\" I recognized Billy's resonant voice easily, despite the years. The sound of it made me feel suddenly younger, a child. I went inside, leaving the door open behind me and turning on lights before I hung up my jacket. Then I stood in the door, watching anxiously as Charlie and Jacob helped Billy out of the car and into his wheelchair. I backed out of the way as the three of them hurried in, shaking off the rain. \"This is a surprise,\" Charlie was saying. \"It's been too long,\" Billy answered. \"I hope it's not a bad time.\" His dark eyes flashed up to me again, their expression unreadable. \"No, it's great. I hope you can stay for the game.\" Jacob grinned. \"I think that's the plan \u2014 our TV broke last week.\" Billy made a face at his son. \"And, of course, Jacob was anxious to see Bella again,\" he added. Jacob scowled and ducked his head while I fought back a surge of remorse. Maybe I'd been too convincing on the beach. \"Are you hungry?\" I asked, turning toward the kitchen. I was eager to escape Billy's searching gaze. \"Naw, we ate just before we came,\" Jacob answered. \"How about you, Charlie?\" I called over my shoulder as I fled around the corner. \"Sure,\" he replied, his voice moving in the direction of the front room and the TV. I could hear Billy's chair follow. The grilled cheese sandwiches were in the frying pan and I was slicing up a tomato when I sensed someone behind me. \"So, how are things?\" Jacob asked. \"Pretty good.\" I smiled. His enthusiasm was hard to resist. \"How about you? Did you finish your car?\" \"No.\" He frowned. \"I still need parts. We borrowed that one.\" He pointed with his thumb in the direction of the front yard. \"Sorry. I haven't seen any\u2026 what was it you were looking for?\" \"Master cylinder.\" He grinned. \"Is something wrong with the truck?\" he added suddenly. \"No.\" \"Oh. I just wondered because you weren't driving it.\" I stared down at the pan, pulling up the edge of a sandwich to check the bottom side. \"I got a ride with a friend.\" \"Nice ride.\" Jacob's voice was admiring. \"I didn't recognize the driver, though. I thought I knew most of the kids around here.\" I nodded noncommittally, keeping my eyes down as I flipped sandwiches. \"My dad seemed to know him from somewhere.\" \"Jacob, could you hand me some plates? They're in the cupboard over the sink.\" \"Sure.\" He got the plates in silence. I hoped he would let it drop now. \"So who was it?\" he asked, setting two plates on the counter next to me. I sighed in defeat. \"Edward Cullen.\" To my surprise, he laughed. I glanced up at him. He looked a little embarrassed. \"Guess that explains it, then,\" he said. \"I wondered why my dad was acting so strange.\" \"That's right.\" I faked an innocent expression. \"He doesn't like the Cullens.\" \"Superstitious old man,\" Jacob muttered under his breath. \"You don't think he'd say anything to Charlie?\" I couldn't help asking, the words coming out in a low rush.  Jacob stared at me for a moment, and I couldn't read the expression in his dark eyes. \"I doubt it,\" he finally answered. \"I think Charlie chewed him out pretty good last time. They haven't spoken much since \u2014 tonight is sort of a reunion, I think. I don't think he'd bring it up again.\" \"Oh,\" I said, trying to sound indifferent. I stayed in the front room after I carried the food out to Charlie, pretending to watch the game while Jacob chattered at me. I was really listening to the men's conversation, watching for any sign that Billy was about to rat me out, trying to think of ways to stop him if he began. It was a long night. I had a lot of homework that was going undone, but I was afraid to leave Billy alone with Charlie. Finally, the game ended. \"Are you and your friends coming back to the beach soon?\" Jacob asked as he pushed his father over the lip of the threshold. \"I'm not sure,\" I hedged. \"That was fun, Charlie,\" Billy said. \"Come up for the next game,\" Charlie encouraged. \"Sure, sure,\" Billy said. \"We'll be here. Have a good night.\" His eyes shifted to mine, and his smile disappeared. \"You take care, Bella,\" he added seriously. \"Thanks,\" I muttered, looking away. I headed for the stairs while Charlie waved from the doorway. \"Wait, Bella,\" he said. I cringed. Had Billy gotten something in before I'd joined them in the living room? But Charlie was relaxed, still grinning from the unexpected visit. \"I didn't get a chance to talk to you tonight. How was your day?\" \"Good.\" I hesitated with one foot on the first stair, searching for details I could safely share. \"My badminton team won all four games.\" \"Wow, I didn't know you could play badminton.\" \"Well, actually I can't, but my partner is really good,\" I admitted . \"Who is it?\" he asked with token interest. \"Um\u2026 Mike Newton,\" I told him reluctantly. \"Oh yeah \u2014 you said you were friends with the Newton kid.\" He perked up. \"Nice family.\" He mused for a minute. \"Why didn't you ask him to the dance this weekend?\" \"Dad!\" I groaned. \"He's kind of dating my friend Jessica. Besides, you know I can't dance.\" \"Oh yeah,\" he muttered. Then he smiled at me apologetically. \"So I guess it's good you'll be gone Saturday\u2026 I've made plans to go fishing with the guys from the station. The weather's supposed to be real warm. But if you wanted to put your trip off till someone could go with you, I'd stay home. I know I leave you here alone too much.\" \"Dad, you're doing a great job.\" I smiled, hoping my relief didn't show. \"I've never minded being alone \u2014 I'm too much like you.\" I winked at him, and he smiled his crinkly-eyed smile. I slept better that night, too tired to dream again. When I woke to the pearl gray morning, my mood was blissful. The tense evening with Billy and Jacob seemed harmless enough now; I decided to forget it completely.  I caught myself whistling while I was pulling the front part of my hair back into a barrette, and later again as I skipped down the stairs. Charlie noticed. \"You're cheerful this morning,\" he commented over breakfast. I shrugged. \"It's Friday.\" I hurried so I would be ready to go the second Charlie left. I had my bag ready, shoes on, teeth brushed, but even though I rushed to the door as soon as I was sure Charlie would be out of sight, Edward was faster. He was waiting in his shiny car, windows down, engine off. I didn't hesitate this time, climbing in the passenger side quickly, the sooner to see his face. He grinned his crooked smile at me, stopping my breath and my heart. I couldn't imagine how an angel could be any more glorious. There was nothing about him that could be improved upon. \"How did you sleep?\" he asked. I wondered if he had any idea how appealing his voice was. \"Fine. How was your night?\" \"Pleasant.\" His smile was amused; I felt like I was missing an inside joke. \"Can I ask what you did?\" I asked. \"No.\" He grinned. \"Today is still mine.\" He wanted to know about people today: more about Ren\u00e9e, her hobbies, what we'd done in our free time together. And then the one grandmother I'd known, my few school friends \u2014 embarrassing me when he asked about boys I'd dated. I was relieved that I'd never really dated anyone, so that particular conversation couldn't last long. He seemed as surprised as Jessica and Angela by my lack of romantic history. \"So you never met anyone you wanted?\" he asked in a serious tone that made me wonder what he was thinking about. I was grudgingly honest. \"Not in Phoenix.\" His lips pressed together into a hard line. We were in the cafeteria at this point. The day had sped by in the blur that was rapidly becoming routine. I took advantage of his brief pause to take a bite of my bagel. \"I should have let you drive yourself today,\" he announced, apropos of nothing, while I chewed. \"Why?\" I demanded. \"I'm leaving with Alice after lunch.\" \"Oh.\" I blinked, bewildered and disappointed. \"That's okay, it's not that far of a walk.\" He frowned at me impatiently. \"I'm not going to make you walk home. We'll go get your truck and leave it here for you.\" \"I don't have my key with me,\" I sighed. \"I really don't mind walking.\" What I minded was losing my time with him. He shook his head. \"Your truck will be here, and the key will be in the ignition \u2014 unless you're afraid someone might steal it.\" He laughed at the thought. \"All right,\" I agreed, pursing my lips. I was pretty sure my key was in the pocket of a pair of jeans I wore Wednesday, under a pile of clothes in the laundry room. Even if he broke into my house, or whatever he was planning, he'd never find it. He seemed to feel the challenge in my consent. He smirked, overconfident. \"So where are you going?\" I asked as casually as I could manage. \"Hunting,\" he answered grimly. \"If I'm going to be alone with you tomorrow, I'm going to take whatever precautions I can.\" His face grew morose\u2026 and pleading. \"You can always cancel, you know.\" I looked down, afraid of the persuasive power of his eyes. I refused to be convinced to fear him, no matter how real the danger might be. It doesn't matter, I repeated in my head.  \"No,\" I whispered, glancing back at his face. \"I can't.\" \"Perhaps you're right,\" he murmured bleakly. His eyes seemed to darken in color as I watched. I changed the subject. \"What time will I see you tomorrow?\" I asked, already depressed by the thought of him leaving now. \"That depends\u2026 it's a Saturday, don't you want to sleep in?\" he offered. \"No,\" I answered too fast. He restrained a smile.  \"The same time as usual, then,\" he decided. \"Will Charlie be there?\" \"No, he's fishing tomorrow.\" I beamed at the memory of how conveniently things had worked out. His voice turned sharp. \"And if you don't come home, what will he think?\" \"I have no idea,\" I answered coolly. \"He knows I've been meaning to do the laundry. Maybe he'll think I fell in the washer.\" He scowled at me and I scowled back. His anger was much more impressive than mine. \"What are you hunting tonight?\" I asked when I was sure I had lost the glowering contest. \"Whatever we find in the park. We aren't going far.\" He seemed bemused by my casual reference to his secret realities. \"Why are you going with Alice?\" I wondered. \"Alice is the most\u2026 supportive.\" He frowned as he spoke. \"And the others?\" I asked timidly. \"What are they?\" His brow puckered for a brief moment. \"Incredulous, for the most part.\" I peeked quickly behind me at his family. They sat staring off in different directions, exactly the same as the first time I'd seen them. Only now they were four; their beautiful, bronze-haired brother sat across from me, his golden eyes troubled. \"They don't like me,\" I guessed. \"That's not it,\" he disagreed, but his eyes were too innocent. \"They don't understand why I can't leave you alone.\" I grimaced. \"Neither do I, for that matter.\" Edward shook his head slowly, rolling his eyes toward the ceiling before he met my gaze again. \"I told you \u2014 you don't see yourself clearly at all. You're not like anyone I've ever known. You fascinate me.\" I glared at him, sure he was teasing now. He smiled as he deciphered my expression. \"Having the advantages I do,\" he murmured, touching his forehead discreetly, \"I have a better than average grasp of human nature. People are predictable. But you\u2026 you never do what I expect. You always take me by surprise.\" I looked away, my eyes wandering back to his family, embarrassed and dissatisfied. His words made me feel like a science experiment. I wanted to laugh at myself for expecting anything else. \"That part is easy enough to explain,\" he continued. I felt his eyes on my face but I couldn't look at him yet, afraid he might read the chagrin in my eyes. \"But there's more\u2026 and it's not so easy to put into words \u2014\" I was still staring at the Cullens while he spoke. Suddenly Rosalie, his blond and breathtaking sister, turned to look at me. No, not to look \u2014 to glare, with dark, cold eyes. I wanted to look away, but her gaze held me until Edward broke off mid-sentence and made an angry noise under his breath. It was almost a hiss. Rosalie turned her head, and I was relieved to be free. I looked back at Edward \u2014 and I knew he could see the confusion and fear that widened my eyes. His face was tight as he explained. \"I'm sorry about that. She's just worried. You see\u2026 it's dangerous for more than just me if, after spending so much time with you so publicly\u2026\" He looked down. \"If?\" \"If this ends\u2026 badly.\" He dropped his head into his hands, as he had that night in Port Angeles. His anguish was plain; I yearned to comfort him, but I was at a loss to know how.  My hand reached toward him involuntarily; quickly, though, I dropped it to the table, fearing that my touch would only make things worse. I realized slowly that his words should frighten me. I waited for that fear to come, but all I could seem to feel was an ache for his pain. And frustration \u2014 frustration that Rosalie had interrupted whatever he was about to say. I didn't know how to bring it up again. He still had his head in his hands. I tried to speak in a normal voice. \"And you have to leave now?\" \"Yes.\" He raised his face; it was serious for a moment, and then his mood shifted and he smiled. \"It's probably for the best. We still have fifteen minutes of that wretched movie left to endure in Biology \u2014 I don't think I could take any more.\" I started. Alice \u2014 her short, inky hair in a halo of spiky disarray around her exquisite, elfin face \u2014 was suddenly standing behind his shoulder. Her slight frame was willowy, graceful even in absolute stillness. He greeted her without looking away from me. \"Alice.\" \"Edward,\" she answered, her high soprano voice almost as attractive as his. \"Alice, Bella \u2014 Bella, Alice,\" he introduced us, gesturing casually with his hand, a wry smile on his face. \"Hello, Bella.\" Her brilliant obsidian eyes were unreadable, but her smile was friendly. \"It's nice to finally meet you.\" Edward flashed a dark look at her. \"Hi, Alice,\" I murmured shyly. \"Are you ready?\" she asked him. His voice was aloof. \"Nearly. I'll meet you at the car.\" She left without another word; her walk was so fluid, so sinuous that I felt a sharp pang of jealousy. \"Should I say 'have fun,' or is that the wrong sentiment?\" I asked, turning back to him. \"No, 'have fun' works as well as anything.\" He grinned. \"Have fun, then.\" I worked to sound wholehearted. Of course I didn't fool him. \"I'll try.\" He still grinned. \"And you try to be safe, please.\" \"Safe in Forks \u2014 what a challenge.\" \"For you it is a challenge.\" His jaw hardened. \"Promise.\" \"I promise to try to be safe,\" I recited. \"I'll do the laundry tonight \u2014 that ought to be fraught with peril.\" \"Don't fall in,\" he mocked. \"I'll do my best.\" He stood then, and I rose, too. \"I'll see you tomorrow,\" I sighed. \"It seems like a long time to you, doesn't it?\" he mused. I nodded glumly.  \"I'll be there in the morning,\" he promised, smiling his crooked smile. He reached across the table to touch my face, lightly brushing along my cheekbone again. Then he turned and walked away. I stared after him until he was gone. I was sorely tempted to ditch the rest of the day, at the very least Gym, but a warning instinct stopped me. I knew that if I disappeared now, Mike and others would assume I was with Edward. And Edward was worried about the time we'd spent together publicly\u2026 if things went wrong. I refused to dwell on the last thought, concentrating instead on making things safer for him. I intuitively knew \u2014 and sensed he did, too \u2014 that tomorrow would be pivotal. Our relationship couldn't continue to balance, as it did, on the point of a knife. We would fall off one edge or the other, depending entirely upon his decision, or his instincts. My decision was made, made before I'd ever consciously chosen, and I was committed to seeing it through. Because there was nothing more terrifying to me, more excruciating, than the thought of turning away from him. It was an impossibility. I went to class, feeling dutiful. I couldn't honestly say what happened in Biology; my mind was too preoccupied with thoughts of tomorrow. In Gym, Mike was speaking to me again; he wished me a good time in Seattle. I carefully explained that I'd canceled my trip, worried about my truck.  \"Are you going to the dance with Cullen?\" he asked, suddenly sulky. \"No, I'm not going to the dance at all.\" \"What are you doing, then?\" he asked, too interested. My natural urge was to tell him to butt out. Instead, I lied brightly. \"Laundry, and then I have to study for the Trig test or I'm going to fail.\" \"Is Cullen helping you study?\" \"Edward,\" I emphasized, \"is not going to help me study. He's gone away somewhere for the weekend.\" The lies came more naturally than usual, I noted with surprise. \"Oh.\" He perked up. \"You know, you could come to the dance with our group anyway \u2014 that would be cool. We'd all dance with you,\" he promised. The mental image of Jessica's face made my tone sharper than necessary. \"I'm not going to the dance, Mike, okay?\" \"Fine.\" He sulked again. \"I was just offering.\" When the school day had finally ended, I walked to the parking lot without enthusiasm. I did not especially want to walk home, but I couldn't see how he would have retrieved my truck.  Then again, I was starting to believe that nothing was impossible for him. The latter instinct proved correct \u2014 my truck sat in the same space he'd parked his Volvo in this morning. I shook my head, incredulous, as I opened the unlocked door and saw the key in the ignition. There was a piece of white paper folded on my seat. I got in and closed the door before I unfolded it. Two words were written in his elegant script. Be safe. The sound of the truck roaring to life frightened me. I laughed at myself. When I got home, the handle of the door was locked, the dead bolt unlocked, just as I'd left it this morning. Inside, I went straight to the laundry room. It looked just the same as I'd left it, too. I dug for my jeans and, after finding them, checked the pockets. Empty. Maybe I'd hung my key up after all, I thought, shaking my head. Following the same instinct that had prompted me to lie to Mike, I called Jessica on the pretense of wishing her luck at the dance. When she offered the same wish for my day with Edward, I told her about the cancellation. She was more disappointed than really necessary for a third-party observer to be. I said goodbye quickly after that. Charlie was absentminded at dinner, worried over something at work, I guessed, or maybe a basketball game, or maybe he was just really enjoying the lasagna \u2014 it was hard to tell with Charlie. \"You know, Dad\u2026\" I began, breaking into his reverie. \"What's that, Bell?\" \"I think you're right about Seattle. I think I'll wait until Jessica or someone else can go with me.\" \"Oh,\" he said, surprised. \"Oh, okay. So, do you want me to stay home?\" \"No, Dad, don't change your plans. I've got a million things to do\u2026 homework, laundry\u2026 I need to go to the library and the grocery store. I'll be in and out all day\u2026 you go and have fun.\" \"Are you sure?\" \"Absolutely, Dad. Besides, the freezer is getting dangerously low on fish \u2014 we're down to a two, maybe three years' supply.\" \"You're sure easy to live with, Bella.\" He smiled. \"I could say the same thing about you,\" I said, laughing. The sound of my laughter was off, but he didn't seem to notice. I felt so guilty for deceiving him that I almost took Edward's advice and told him where I would be. Almost. After dinner, I folded clothes and moved another load through the dryer. Unfortunately it was the kind of job that only keeps hands busy. My mind definitely had too much free time, and it was getting out of control. I fluctuated between anticipation so intense that it was very nearly pain, and an insidious fear that picked at my resolve. I had to keep reminding myself that I'd made my choice, and I wasn't going back on it. I pulled his note out of my pocket much more often than necessary to absorb the two small words he'd written. He wants me to be safe, I told myself again and again. I would just hold on to the faith that, in the end, that desire would win out over the others. And what was my other choice \u2014 to cut him out of my life? Intolerable. Besides, since I'd come to Forks, it really seemed like my life was about him. But a tiny voice in the back of my mind worried, wondering if it would hurt very much\u2026 if it ended badly. I was relieved when it was late enough to be acceptable for bedtime. I knew I was far too stressed to sleep, so I did something I'd never done before. I deliberately took unnecessary cold medicine \u2014 the kind that knocked me out for a good eight hours. I normally wouldn't condone that type of behavior in myself, but tomorrow would be complicated enough without me being loopy from sleep deprivation on top of everything else. While I waited for the drugs to kick in, I dried my clean hair till it was impeccably straight, and fussed over what I would wear tomorrow. With everything ready for the morning, I finally lay in my bed. I felt hyper; I couldn't stop twitching. I got up and rifled through my shoebox of CDs until I found a collection of Chopin's nocturnes. I put that on very quietly and then lay down again, concentrating on relaxing individual parts of my body. Somewhere in the middle of that exercise, the cold pills took effect, and I gladly sank into unconsciousness.  I woke early, having slept soundly and dreamlessly thanks to my gratuitous drug use. Though I was well rested, I slipped right back into the same hectic frenzy from the night before. I dressed in a rush, smoothing my collar against my neck, fidgeting with the tan sweater till it hung right over my jeans. I sneaked a swift look out the window to see that Charlie was already gone. A thin, cottony layer of clouds veiled the sky. They didn't look very lasting. I ate breakfast without tasting the food, hurrying to clean up when I was done. I peeked out the window again, but nothing had changed. I had just finished brushing my teeth and was heading back downstairs when a quiet knock sent my heart thudding against my rib cage. I flew to the door; I had a little trouble with the simple dead bolt, but I yanked the door open at last, and there he was. All the agitation dissolved as soon as I looked at his face, calm taking its place. I breathed a sigh of relief \u2014 yesterday's fears seemed very foolish with him here. He wasn't smiling at first \u2014 his face was somber. But then his expression lightened as he looked me over, and he laughed.  \"Good morning,\" he chuckled. \"What's wrong?\" I glanced down to make sure I hadn't forgotten anything important, like shoes, or pants. \"We match.\" He laughed again. I realized he had a long, light tan sweater on, with a white collar showing underneath, and blue jeans. I laughed with him, hiding a secret twinge of regret \u2014 why did he have to look like a runway model when I couldn't? I locked the door behind me while he walked to the truck. He waited by the passenger door with a martyred expression that was easy to understand. \"We made a deal,\" I reminded him <em>smugly</em>, climbing into the driver's seat, and reaching over to unlock his door. \"Where to?\" I asked. \"Put your seat belt on \u2014 I'm nervous already.\" I gave him a dirty look as I complied. \"Where to?\" I repeated with a sigh. \"Take the one-on-one north,\" he ordered. It was surprisingly difficult to concentrate on the road while feeling his gaze on my face. I compensated by driving more carefully than usual through the still-sleeping town. \"Were you planning to make it out of Forks before nightfall?\" \"This truck is old enough to be your car's grandfather \u2014 have some respect,\" I retorted. We were soon out of the town limits, despite his negativity. Thick underbrush and green-swathed trunks replaced the lawns and houses. \"Turn right on the one-ten,\" he instructed just as I was about to ask. I obeyed silently. \"Now we drive until the pavement ends.\" I could hear a smile in his voice, but I was too afraid of driving off the road and proving him right to look over and be sure. \"And what's there, at the pavement's end?\" I wondered. \"A trail.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \"We're hiking?\" Thank goodness I'd worn tennis shoes. \"Is that a problem?\" He sounded as if he'd expected as much. \"No.\" I tried to make the lie sound confident. But if he thought my truck was slow\u2026 \"Don't worry, it's only five miles or so, and we're in no hurry.\" Five miles. I didn't answer, so that he wouldn't hear my voice crack in panic. Five miles of treacherous roots and loose stones, trying to twist my ankles or otherwise incapacitate me. This was going to be humiliating. We drove in silence for a while as I contemplated the coming horror. \"What are you thinking?\" he asked impatiently after a few moments. I lied again. \"Just wondering where we're going.\" \"It's a place I like to go when the weather is nice.\" We both glanced out the windows at the thinning clouds after he spoke. \"Charlie said it would be warm today.\" \"And did you tell Charlie what you were up to?\" he asked. \"Nope.\" \"But Jessica thinks we're going to Seattle together?\" He seemed cheered by the idea. \"No, I told her you canceled on me \u2014 which is true.\" \"No one knows you're with me?\" Angrily, now. \"That depends\u2026 I assume you told Alice?\" \"That's very helpful, Bella,\" he snapped. I pretended I didn't hear that. \"Are you so depressed by Forks that it's made you suicidal?\" he demanded when I ignored him. \"You said it might cause trouble for you\u2026 us being together publicly,\" I reminded him. \"So you're worried about the trouble it might cause me\u2014 if you don't come home?\" His voice was still angry, and bitingly sarcastic. I nodded, keeping my eyes on the road. He muttered something under his breath, speaking so quickly that I couldn't understand. We were silent for the rest of the drive. I could feel the waves of infuriated disapproval rolling off of him, and I could think of nothing to say. And then the road ended, constricting to a thin foot trail with a small wooden marker. I parked on the narrow shoulder and stepped out, afraid because he was angry with me and I didn't have driving as an excuse not to look at him. It was warm now, warmer than it had been in Forks since the day I'd arrived, almost muggy under the clouds. I pulled off my sweater and knotted it around my waist, glad that I'd worn the light, sleeveless shirt \u2014 especially if I had five miles of hiking ahead of me. I heard his door slam, and looked over to see that he'd removed his sweater, too. He was facing away from me, into the unbroken forest beside my truck. \"This way,\" he said, glancing over his shoulder at me, eyes still annoyed. He started into the dark forest. \"The trail?\" Panic was clear in my voice as I hurried around the truck to catch up to him. \"I said there was a trail at the end of the road, not that we were taking it.\" \"No trail?\" I asked desperately. \"I won't let you get lost.\" He turned then, with a mocking smile, and I stifled a gasp. His white shirt was sleeveless, and he wore it unbuttoned, so that the smooth white skin of his throat flowed uninterrupted over the marble contours of his chest, his perfect musculature no longer merely hinted at behind concealing clothes. He was too perfect, I realized with a piercing stab of despair. There was no way this godlike creature could be meant for me. He stared at me, bewildered by my tortured expression. \"Do you want to go home?\" he said quietly, a different pain than mine saturating his voice. \"No.\" I walked forward till I was close beside him, anxious not to waste one second of whatever time I might have with him. \"What's wrong?\" he asked, his voice gentle. \"I'm not a good hiker,\" I answered dully. \"You'll have to be very patient.\" \"I can be patient \u2014 if I make a great effort.\" He smiled, holding my glance, trying to lift me out of my sudden, unexplained dejection. I tried to smile back, but the smile was unconvincing. He scrutinized my face. \"I'll take you home,\" he promised. I couldn't tell if the promise was unconditional, or restricted to an immediate departure. I knew he thought it was fear that upset me, and I was grateful again that I was the one person whose mind he couldn't hear. \"If you want me to hack five miles through the jungle before sundown, you'd better start leading the way,\" I said acidly. He frowned at me, struggling to understand my tone and expression. He gave up after a moment and led the way into the forest. It wasn't as hard as I had feared. The way was mostly flat, and he held the damp ferns and webs of moss aside for me. When his straight path took us over fallen trees or boulders, he would help me, lifting me by the elbow, and then releasing me instantly when I was clear. His cold touch on my skin never failed to make my heart thud erratically. Twice, when that happened, I caught a look on his face that made me sure he could somehow hear it. I tried to keep my eyes away from his perfection as much as possible, but I slipped often. Each time, his beauty pierced me through with sadness. For the most part, we walked in silence. Occasionally he would ask a random question that he hadn't gotten to in the past two days of interrogation. He asked about my birthdays, my grade school teachers, my childhood pets \u2014 and I had to admit that after killing three fish in a row, I'd given up on the whole institution. He laughed at that, louder than I was used to \u2014 bell-like echoes bouncing back to us from the empty woods. The hike took me most of the morning, but he never showed any sign of impatience. The forest spread out around us in a boundless labyrinth of ancient trees, and I began to be nervous that we would never find our way out again. He was perfectly at ease, comfortable in the green maze, never seeming to feel any doubt about our direction. After several hours, the light that filtered through the canopy transformed, the murky olive tone shifting to a brighter jade. The day had turned sunny, just as he'd foretold. For the first time since we'd entered the woods, I felt a thrill of excitement \u2014 which quickly turned to impatience. \"Are we there yet?\" I teased, pretending to scowl. \"Nearly.\" He smiled at the change in my mood. \"Do you see the brightness ahead?\" I peered into the thick forest. \"Um, should I?\" He smirked. \"Maybe it's a bit soon for your eyes.\" \"Time to visit the optometrist,\" I muttered. His smirk grew more pronounced. But then, after another hundred yards, I could definitely see a lightening in the trees ahead, a glow that was yellow instead of green. I picked up the pace, my eagerness growing with every step. He let me lead now, following noiselessly. I reached the edge of the pool of light and stepped through the last fringe of ferns into the loveliest place I had ever seen. The meadow was small, perfectly round, and filled with wildflowers \u2014 violet, yellow, and soft white. Somewhere nearby, I could hear the bubbling music of a stream. The sun was directly overhead, filling the circle with a haze of buttery sunshine. I walked slowly, awestruck, through the soft grass, swaying flowers, and warm, gilded air. I halfway turned, wanting to share this with him, but he wasn't behind me where I thought he'd be. I spun around, searching for him with sudden alarm. Finally I spotted him, still under the dense shade of the canopy at the edge of the hollow, watching me with cautious eyes. Only then did I remember what the beauty of the meadow had driven from my mind \u2014 the enigma of Edward and the sun, which he'd promised to illustrate for me today. I took a step back toward him, my eyes alight with curiosity. His eyes were wary, reluctant. I smiled encouragingly and beckoned to him with my hand, taking another step back to him. He held up a hand in warning, and I hesitated, rocking back onto my heels. Edward seemed to take a deep breath, and then he stepped out into the bright glow of the midday sun.",

            "en": "These violent delights have violent ends And in their triumph die, like fire and powder, Which, as they kiss, consume        These violent delights have violent ends, And in their triumph die, like fire and powder, Which, as they kiss, consume. Romeo and Juliet, Act II, Scene VI PREFACE I FELT LIKE I WAS TRAPPED IN ONE OF THOSE TERRIFYING nightmares, the one where you have to run, run till your lungs burst, but you can't make your body move fast enough. My legs seemed to move slower and slower as I fought my way through the callous crowd, but the hands on the huge clock tower didn't slow. With relentless, uncaring force, they turned inexorably toward the end \u2014the end of everything. But this was no dream, and, unlike the nightmare, I wasn't running for my life; I was racing to save something infinitely more precious. My own life meant little to me today. Alice had said there was a good chance we would both die here. Perhaps the outcome would be different if she weren't trapped by the brilliant sunlight; only I was free to run across this bright, crowded square. And I couldn't run fast enough. So it didn't matter to me that we were surrounded by our extraordinarily dangerous enemies. As the clock began to toll out the hour, vibrating under the soles of my sluggish feet, I knew I was too late\u2014and I was glad something bloodthirsty waited in the wings. For in failing at this, I forfeited any desire to live. The clock tolled again, and the sun beat down from the exact center point of the sky. 1. PARTY I WAS NINETY-NINE POINT NINE PERCENT SURE I WAS dreaming. The reasons I was so certain were that, first, I was standing in a bright shaft of sunlight\u2014the kind of blinding clear sun that never shone on my drizzly new hometown in Forks, Washington\u2014and second, I was looking at my Grandma Marie. Gran had been dead for six years now, so that was solid evidence toward the dream theory. Gran hadn't changed much; her face looked just the same as I remembered it. The skin was soft and withered, bent into a thousand tiny creases that clung gently to the bone underneath. Like a dried apricot, but with a puff of thick white hair standing out in a cloud around it. Our mouths\u2014hers a wizened picker \u2014spread into the same surprised half-smile at just the same time. Apparently, she hadn't been expecting to see me, either. I was about to ask her a question; I had so many\u2014What was she doing here in my dream? What had she been up to in the past six years? Was Pop okay, and had they found each other, wherever they were?\u2014but she opened her mouth when I did, so I stopped to let her go first. She paused, too, and then we both smiled at the little awkwardness. \"Bella!\" It wasn't Gran who called my name, and we both turned to see the addition to our small reunion. I didn't have to look to know who it was; this was a voice I would know anywhere\u2014know, and respond to, whether I was awake or asleep\u2026 or even dead, I'd bet. The voice I'd walk through fire for\u2014or, less dramatically, slosh every day through the cold and endless rain for. Edward. Even though I was always thrilled to see him\u2014 conscious or otherwise\u2014and even though I was almost positive that I was dreaming, I panicked as Edward walked toward us through the glaring sunlight. I panicked because Gran didn't know that I was in love with a vampire\u2014nobody knew that\u2014so how was I supposed to explain the fact that the brilliant sunbeams were shattering off his skin into a thousand rainbow shards like he was made of crystal or diamond? Well, Gran, you might have noticed that my boyfriend glitters. It's just something he does in the sun. Don't worry about it\u2026 What was he doing? The whole reason he lived in Forks, the rainiest place in the world, was so that he could be outside in the daytime without exposing his family's secret. Yet here he was, strolling gracefully toward me\u2014with the most beautiful smile on his angel's face\u2014as if I were the only one here. In that second, I wished that I was not the one exception to his mysterious talent; I usually felt grateful that I was the only person whose thoughts he couldn't hear just as clearly as if they were spoken aloud. But now I wished he could hear me, too, so that he could hear the warning I was screaming in my head. I shot a panicked glance back at Gran, and saw that it was too late. She was just turning to stare back at me, her eyes as alarmed as mine. Edward\u2014still smiling so beautifully that my heart felt like it was going to swell up and burst through my chest\u2014put his arm around my shoulder and turned to face my grandmother. Gran's expression surprised me. Instead of looking horrified, she was staring at me sheepishly, as if waiting for a scolding. And she was standing in such a strange position\u2014one arm held awkwardly away from her body, stretched out and then curled around the air. Like she had her arm around someone I couldn't see, someone invisible\u2026 Only then, as I looked at the bigger picture, did I notice the huge gilt frame that enclosed my grandmother's form. Uncomprehending, I raised the hand that wasn't wrapped around Edward's waist and reached out to touch her. She mimicked the movement exactly, mirrored it. But where our fingers should have met, there was nothing but cold glass\u2026 With a dizzying jolt, my dream abruptly became a nightmare. There was no Gran. That was me. Me in a mirror. Me\u2014ancient, creased, and withered. Edward stood beside me, casting no reflection, excruciatingly lovely and forever\u00a0 seventeen. He pressed his icy, perfect lips against my wasted cheek. \"Happy birthday,\" he whispered. I woke with a start \u2014my eyelids popping open wide\u2014and gasped. Dull gray light, the familiar light of an overcast morning, took the place of the blinding sun in my dream. Just a dream, I told myself. It was only a dream. I took a deep breath, and then jumped again when my alarm went off. The little calendar in the corner of the clock's display informed me that today was September thirteenth. Only a dream, but prophetic enough in one way, at least. Today was my birthday. I was officially eighteen years old. I'd been dreading this day for months. All through the perfect summer\u2014the happiest summer I had ever had, the happiest summer anyone anywhere had ever had, and the rainiest summer in the history of the Olympic Peninsula\u2014this bleak date had lurked in ambush, waiting to spring. And now that it had hit, it was even worse than I'd feared it would be. I could feel it\u2014I was older. Every day I got older, but this was different, worse, quantifiable. I was eighteen.  And Edward never would be. When I went to brush my teeth, I was almost surprised that the face in the mirror hadn't changed. I stared at myself, looking for some sign of impending wrinkles in my ivory skin. The only creases were the ones on my forehead, though, and I knew that if I could manage to relax, they would disappear. I couldn't. My eyebrows stayed lodged in a worried line over my anxious brown eyes. It was just a dream, I reminded myself again. Just a dream\u2026 but also my worst\u00a0 nightmare. I skipped breakfast, in a hurry to get out of the house as quickly as possible. I wasn't entirely able to avoid my dad, and so I had to spend a few minutes acting cheerful. I honestly tried to be excited about the gifts I'd asked him not to get me, but every time I had to smile, it felt like I might start crying. I struggled to get a grip on myself as I drove to school. The vision of Gran\u2014I would not think of it as me\u2014was hard to get out of my head. I couldn't feel anything but despair until I pulled into the familiar parking lot behind Forks High School and spotted Edward leaning motionlessly against his polished silver Volvo, like a marble tribute to some forgotten pagan god of beauty. The dream had not done him justice. And he was waiting there for me, just the same as every other day. Despair momentarily vanished; wonder took its place. Even after half a year with him, I still couldn't believe that I deserved this degree of good fortune. His sister Alice was standing by his side, waiting for me, too. Of course Edward and Alice weren't really related (in Forks the story was that all the Cullen siblings were adopted by Dr. Carlisle Culler and his wife, Esme, both plainly too young to have teenage children), but their skin was precisely the same pale shade, their eyes had the same strange golden tint, with the same deep, bruise-like shadows beneath them. Her face, like his, was also startlingly beautiful. To someone in the know\u2014someone like me\u2014these similarities marked them for what they were. The sight of Alice waiting there\u2014her tawny eyes brilliant with excitement, and a small silver-wrapped square in her hands\u2014made me frown. I'd told Alice I didn't want anything, anything, not gifts or even attention, for my birthday. Obviously, my wishes were being ignored. I slammed the door of my '53 Chevy truck\u2014a shower of rust specks fluttered down to the wet blacktop \u2014and walked slowly toward where they waited. Alice skipped forward to meet me, her pixie face glowing under her spiky black hair. \"Happy birthday, Bella!\" \"Shh!\" I hissed, glancing around the lot to make sure no one had heard her. The last thing I wanted was some kind of celebration of the black event. She ignored me. \"Do you want to open your present now or later?\" she asked eagerly as we made our way to where Edward still waited. \"No presents,\" I protested in a mumble. She finally seemed to process my mood. \"Okay\u2026 later, then. Did you like the scrapbook your mom sent you? And the camera from Charlie?\" I sighed. Of course she would know what my birthday presents were. Edward wasn't the only member of his family with unusual skills. Alice would have \"seen\" what my parents were planning as soon as they'd decided that themselves. \"Yeah. They're great.\" \"I think it's a nice idea. You're only a senior once. Might as well document the\u00a0 experience.\" \"How many times have you been a senior?\" \"That's different.\" We reached Edward then, and he held out his hand for mine. I took it eagerly, forgetting, for a moment, my glum mood. His skin was, as always, smooth, hard, and very cold. He gave my fingers a gentle squeeze. I looked into his liquid topaz eyes, and my heart gave a not-quite-so-gentle squeeze of its own. Hearing the stutter in my heartbeats, he smiled again. He lifted his free hand and traced one cool fingertip around the outside of my lips as he spoke. \"So, as discussed, I am not allowed to wish you a happy birthday, is that correct?\" \"Yes. That is correct.\" I could never quite mimic the flow of his perfect, formal articulation. It was something that could only be picked up in an earlier century. \"Just checking.\" He ran his hand through his tousled bronze hair. \"You might have changed your mind.\u00a0 Most people seem to enjoy things like birthdays and gifts.\" Alice laughed, and the sound was all silver, a wind chime. \"Of course you'll enjoy it. Everyone is supposed to be nice to you today and give you your way, Bella. What's the worst that could happen?\" She meant it as a rhetorical question. \"Getting older,\" I answered anyway, and my voice was not as steady as I wanted it to be. Beside me, Edward's smile tightened into a hard line. \"Eighteen isn't very old,\" Alice said. \"Don't women usually wait till they're twenty-nine to get upset over birthdays?\" \"It's older than Edward,\" I mumbled. He sighed. \"Technically,\" she said, keeping her tone light. \"Just by one little year, though.\" And I supposed\u2026 if I could be sure of the future I wanted, sure that I would get to spend forever with Edward, and Alice and the rest of the Cullens (preferably not as a wrinkled little old lady)\u2026 then a year or two one direction or the other wouldn't matter to me so much. But Edward was dead set against any future that changed me. Any future that made me like him\u2014that made me immortal, too. An impasse, he called it. I couldn't really see Edward's point, to be honest. What was so great about mortality? Being a vampire didn't look like such a terrible thing\u2014not the way the Cullens did it, anyway. \"What time will you be at the house?\" Alice continued, changing the subject. From her expression, she was up to exactly the kind of thing I'd been hoping to avoid. \"I didn't know I had plans to be there.\" \"Oh, be fair, Bella!\" she complained. \"You aren't going to ruin all our fun like that, are you?\" \"I thought my birthday was about what I want.\" \"I'll get her from Charlie's right after school,\" Edward told her, ignoring me altogether. \"I have to work,\" I protested. \"You don't, actually,\" Alice told me <em>smugly</em>. \"I already spoke to Mrs. Newton about it. She's trading your shifts. She said to tell you 'Happy Birthday.'\" \"I\u2014I still can't come over,\" I stammered, scrambling for an excuse. \"I, well, I haven't watched Romeo and Juliet yet for English.\" Alice snorted. \"You have Romeo and Juliet memorized.\" \"But Mr. Berty said we needed to see it performed to fully appreciate it\u2014that's how Shakespeare intended it to be presented.\" Edward rolled his eyes. \"You've already seen the movie,\" Alice accused. \"But not the nineteen-sixties version. Mr. Berty said it was the best.\" Finally, Alice lost the smug smile and glared at me. \"This can be easy, or this can be hard, Bella, but one way or the other\u2014\" Edward interrupted her threat. \"Relax, Alice. If Bella wants to watch a movie, then she can. It's her birthday.\" \"So there,\" I added. \u00a0\"I'll bring her over around seven,\" he continued. \"That will give you more time to set up.\" Alice's laughter chimed again. \"Sounds good. See you tonight, Bella! It'll be fun, you'll see.\" She grinned\u2014the wide smile exposed all her perfect, glistening teeth\u2014then pecked me on the cheek and danced off toward her first class before I could respond. \"Edward, please\u2014\" I started to beg, but he pressed one cool finger to my lips. \"Let's discuss it later. We're going to be late for class.\" No one bothered to stare at us as we took our usual seats in the back of the classroom (we had almost every class together now\u2014it was amazing the favors Edward could get the female administrators to do for him). Edward and I had been together too long now to be an object of gossip anymore. Even Mike Newton didn't bother to give me the glum stare that used to make me feel a little guilty. He smiled now instead, and I was glad he seemed to have accepted that we could only be friends. Mike had changed over the summer\u2014his face had lost some of the roundness, making his cheekbones more prominent, and he was wearing his pale blond hair a new way; instead of bristly, it was longer and gelled into a carefully casual disarray. It was easy to see where his inspiration came from\u2014but Edward's look wasn't something that could be achieved through imitation. As the day progressed, I considered ways to get out of whatever was going down at the Cullen house tonight. It would be bad enough to have to celebrate when I was in the mood to mourn. But, worse than that, this was sure to involve attention and gifts. Attention is never a good thing, as any other accident-prone klutz would agree. No one wants a spotlight when they're likely to fall on their face. And I'd very pointedly asked\u2014well, ordered really\u2014that no one give me any presents this year. It looked like Charlie and Renee weren't the only ones who had decided to overlook that. I'd never had much money, and that had never bothered me. Renee had raised me on a kindergarten teacher's salary. Charlie wasn't getting rich at his job, either\u2014he was the police chief here in the tiny town of Forks. My only personal income came from the three days a week I worked at the local sporting goods store. In a town this small, I was lucky to have a job. Every penny I made went into my microscopic college fund. (College was Plan B. I was still hoping for Plan A, but Edward was just so stubborn about leaving me human\u2026) Edward had a lot of money\u2014I didn't even want to think about how much. Money meant next to nothing to Edward or the rest of the Cullens. It was just something that accumulated when you had unlimited time on your hands and a sister who had an uncanny ability to predict trends in the stock market. Edward didn't seem to understand why I objected to him spending money on me\u2014why it made me uncomfortable if he took me to an expensive restaurant in Seattle, why he wasn't allowed to buy me a car that could reach speeds over fifty-five miles an hour, or why I wouldn't let him pay my college tuition (he was ridiculously enthusiastic about Plan B). Edward thought I was being unnecessarily difficult. But how could I let him give me things when I had nothing to reciprocate with? He, for some unfathomable reason, wanted to be with me. Anything he gave me on top of that just threw us more out of balance. As the day went on, neither Edward nor Alice brought my birthday up again, and I began to relax a little. We sat at our usual table for lunch. A strange kind of truce existed at that table. The three of us\u2014Edward, Alice, and I\u2014sat on the extreme southern end of the table. Now that the \"older\" and somewhat scarier (in Emmett's case, certainly) Cullen siblings had graduated, Alice and Edward did not seem quite so intimidating, and we did not sit here alone. My other friends, Mike and Jessica (who were in the awkward post-breakup friendship phase), Angela and Ben (whose relationship had survived the summer), Eric, Conner, Tyler, and Lauren (though that last one didn't really count in the friend category) all sat at the same table, on the other side of an invisible line. That line dissolved on sunny days when Edward and Alice always skipped school, and then the conversation would swell out effortlessly to include me.  Edward and Alice didn't find this minor ostracism odd or hurtful the way I would have. They barely noticed it. People always felt strangely ill at ease with the Cullens, almost afraid for some reason they couldn't explain to themselves. I was a rare exception to that rule. Sometimes it bothered Edward how very comfortable I was with being close to him. He thought he was hazardous to my health\u2014an opinion I rejected vehemently whenever he voiced it. \u00a0The afternoon passed quickly. School ended, and Edward walked me to my truck as he usually did. But this time, he held the passenger door open for me. Alice must have been taking his car home so that he could keep me from making a run for it. I folded my arms and made no move to get out of the rain. \"It's my birthday, don't I get to drive?\" \"I'm pretending it's not your birthday, just as you wished.\" \"If it's not my birthday, then I don't have to go to your house tonight\u2026\" \"All right.\" He shut the passenger door and walked past me to open the driver's side. \"Happy birthday.\" \"Shh,\" I shushed him halfheartedly. I climbed in the opened door, wishing he'd taken the other offer. Edward played with the radio while I drove, shaking his head in disapproval. \"Your radio has horrible reception.\" I frowned. I didn't like it when he picked on my truck. The truck was great\u2014it had\u00a0 personality. \"You want a nice stereo? Drive your own car.\" I was so nervous about Alice's plans, on top of my already gloomy mood, that the words came out sharper than I'd meant them. I was hardly ever bad-tempered with Edward, and my tone made him press his lips together to keep from smiling. When I parked in front of Charlie's house, he reached over to take my face in his hands. He handled me very carefully, pressing just the tips of his fingers softly against my temples, my cheekbones, my jaw line. Like I was especially breakable. Which was exactly the case\u2014compared with him, at least. \"You should be in a good mood, today of all days,\" he whispered. His sweet breath fanned across my face. \"And if I don't want to be in a good mood?\" I asked, my breathing uneven. His golden eyes smoldered. \"Too bad.\" My head was already spinning by the time he leaned closer and pressed his icy lips against mine. As he intended, no doubt, I forgot all about my worries, and concentrated on remembering how to inhale and exhale. His mouth lingered on mine, cold and smooth and gentle, until I wrapped my arms around his neck and threw myself into the kiss with a little too much enthusiasm. I could feel his lips curve upward as he let go of my face and reached back to unlock my grip on him. Edward had drawn many careful lines for our physical relationship, with the intent being to keep me alive. Though I respected the need for maintaining a safe distance between my skin and his razor-sharp, venom-coated teeth, I tended to forget about trivial things like that when he was kissing me. \"Be good, please,\" he breathed against my cheek. He pressed his lips gently to mine one more time and then pulled away, folding my arms across my stomach. My pulse was thudding in my ears. I put one hand over my heart. It drummed hyperactively under my palm. \u00a0\"Do you think I'll ever get better at this?\" I wondered, mostly to myself. \"That my heart might someday stop trying to jump out of my chest whenever you touch me?\" \"I really hope not,\" he said, a bit smug. I rolled my eyes. \"Let's go watch the Capulets and Montagues hack each other up, all right?\" \"Your wish, my command.\" Edward sprawled across the couch while I started the movie, fast-forwarding through the opening credits. When I perched on the edge of the sofa in front of him, he wrapped his arms around my waist and pulled me against his chest. It wasn't exactly as comfortable as a sofa cushion would be, what with his chest being hard and cold\u2014and perfect\u2014as an ice sculpture, but it was definitely preferable. He pulled the old afghan off the back of the couch and draped it over me so I wouldn't freeze beside his body. \"You know, I've never had much patience with Romeo,\" he commented as the movie started. \"What's wrong with Romeo?\" I asked, a little offended. Romeo was one of my favorite fictional characters. Until I'd met Edward, I'd sort of had a thing for him. \"Well, first of all, he's in love with this Rosaline\u2014don't you think it makes him seem a little fickle? And then, a few minutes after their wedding, he kills Juliet's cousin. That's not very brilliant. Mistake after mistake. Could he have destroyed his own happiness any more thoroughly?\" I sighed. \"Do you want me to watch this alone?\" \"No, I'll mostly be watching you, anyway.\" His fingers traced patterns across the skin of my arm, raising goose bumps. \"Will you cry?\" \"Probably,\" I admitted, \"if I'm paying attention.\" \"I won't distract you then.\" But I felt his lips on my hair, and it was very distracting. The movie eventually captured my interest, thanks in large part to Edward whispering Romeo's lines in my ear\u2014his irresistible, velvet voice made the actor's voice sound weak and coarse by comparison. And I did cry, to his amusement, when Juliet woke and found her new husband dead. \"I'll admit, I do sort of envy him here,\" Edward said, drying the tears with a lock of my hair. \"She's very pretty.\" He made a disgusted sound. \"I don't envy him the girl\u2014just the ease of the suicide,\" he clarified in a teasing tone. \"You humans have it so easy! All you have to do is throw down one tiny vial of plant extracts\u2026\" \"What?\" I gasped. \"It's something I had to think about once, and I knew from Carlisle's experience that it wouldn't be simple. I'm not even sure how many ways Carlisle tried to kill himself in the beginning\u2026 after he realized what he'd become\u2026\" His voice, which had grown serious, turned light again. \"And he's clearly still in excellent health.\" I twisted around so that I could read his face. \"What are you talking about?\" I demanded. \"What do you mean, this something you had to think about once?\" \"Last spring, when you were\u2026 nearly killed\u2026\" He paused to take a deep breath, snuggling to return to his teasing tone. \"Of course I was trying to focus on finding you alive, but part of my mind was making contingency plans. Like I said, it's not as easy for me as it is for a human.\" For one second, the memory of my last trip to Phoenix washed through my head and made me feel dizzy. I could see it all so clearly\u2014the blinding sun, the heat waves coming off the concrete as I ran with desperate haste to find the sadistic vampire who wanted to torture me to death. James, waiting in the mirrored room with my mother as his hostage\u2014or so I'd thought. I hadn't known it was all a ruse. Just as James hadn't known that Edward was racing to save me; Edward made it in time, but it had been a close one. Unthinkingly, my fingers traced the crescent-shaped scar on my hand that was always just a few degrees cooler than the rest of my skin. I shook my head\u2014as if I could shake away the bad memories\u2014and tried to grasp what Edward meant. My stomach plunged uncomfortably. \"Contingency plans?\" I repeated. \"Well, I wasn't going to live without you.\" He rolled his eyes as if that fact were\u00a0\u00a0 childishly obvious. \"But I wasn't sure how to do it\u2014I knew Emmett and Jasper would never help\u2026 so I was thinking maybe I would go to Italy and do something to provoke the Volturi.\" I didn't want to believe he was serious, but his golden eyes were brooding, focused on something far away in the distance as he contemplated ways to end his own life. Abruptly, I was furious. \"What is a Volturi?\" I demanded. \u00a0\"The Volturi are a family,\" he explained, his eyes still remote. \"A very old, very powerful family of our kind. They are the closest thing our world has to a royal family, I suppose. Carlisle lived with them briefly in his early years, in Italy, before he settled in America\u2014do you remember the story?\" \"Of course I remember.\" I would never forget the first time I'd gone to his home, the huge white mansion buried deep in the forest beside the river, or the room where Carlisle\u2014Edward's father in so many real ways\u2014kept a wall of paintings that illustrated his personal history. The most vivid, most wildly colorful canvas there, the largest, was from Carlisle's time in Italy. Of course I remembered the calm quartet of men, each with the exquisite face of a seraph, painted into the highest balcony overlooking the swirling mayhem of color. Though the painting was centuries old, Carlisle\u2014the blond angel\u2014remained unchanged. And I remembered the three others, Carlisle's early acquaintances. Edward had never used the name Volturi for the beautiful trio, two black-haired, one snow white. He'd called them Aro, Caius, and Marcus, nighttime patrons of the arts\u2026 \"Anyway, you don't irritate the Volturi,\" Edward went on, interrupting ray reverie. \"Not unless you want to die\u2014or whatever it is we do.\" His voice was so calm, it made him sound almost bored by the prospect. My anger turned to horror. I took his marble face between my hands and held it very tightly. \"You must never, never, never think of anything like that again!\" I said. \"No matter what might ever happen to me, you are not allowed to hurt yourself!\" \"I'll never put you in danger again, so it's a moot point.\" \"Put me in danger! I thought we'd established that all the bad luck is my fault?\" I was getting angrier.\u00a0 \"How dare you even think like that?\" The idea of Edward ceasing to exist, even if I were dead, was impossibly painful. \"What would you do, if the situation were reversed?\" he asked. \"That's not the same thing.\" He didn't seem to understand the difference. He chuckled. \"What if something did happen to you?\" I blanched at the thought. \"Would you want me to go off myself?\" A trace of pain touched his perfect features. \"I guess I see your point\u2026 a little,\" he admitted. \"But what would I do without you?\" \"Whatever you were doing before I came along and complicated your existence.\" He sighed. \"You make that sound so easy.\" \"It should be. I'm not really that interesting.\" He was about to argue, but then he let it go. \"Moot point,\" he reminded me. Abruptly, he pulled himself up into a more formal posture, shifting me to the side so that we were no longer touching. \"Charlie?\" I guessed. Edward smiled. After a moment, I heard the sound of the police cruiser pulling into the driveway. I reached out and took his hand firmly. My dad could deal with that much. Charlie came in with a pizza box in his hands. \"Hey, kids.\" He grinned at me. \"I thought you'd like a break from cooking and washing dishes for your birthday. Hungry?\" \"Sure. Thanks, Dad.\" Charlie didn't comment on Edward's apparent lack of appetite. He was used to Edward passing on dinner. \"Do you mind if I borrow Bella for the evening?\" Edward asked when Charlie and I were done. I looked at Charlie hopefully. Maybe he had some concept of birthdays as stay-at-home, family affairs\u2014this was my first birthday with him, the first birthday since my mom, Renee, had remarried and gone to live in Florida, so I didn't know what he would expect. \"That's fine\u2014the Mariners are playing the Sox tonight,\" Charlie explained, and my hope disappeared. \"So I won't be any kind of company\u2026 Here.\" He scooped up the camera he'd gotten me on Renee's suggestion (because I would need pictures to fill up my scrap-book), and threw it to me. He ought to know better than that\u2014I'd always been coordination ally challenged. The camera glanced off the tip of my finger, and tumbled toward the floor. Edward snagged it before it could crash onto the linoleum. \"Nice save,\" Charlie noted. \"If they're doing something fun at the Cullens' tonight, Bella, you should take some pictures. You know how your mother gets\u2014she'll be wanting to see the pictures faster than you can take them.\" \"Good idea, Charlie,\" Edward said, handing me the camera. I turned the camera on Edward, and snapped the first picture. \"It works.\" \"That's good. Hey, say hi to Alice for me. She hasn't been over in a while.\" Charlie's mouth pulled down at one corner. \"It's been three days, Dad,\" I reminded him. Charlie was crazy about Alice. He'd become attached last spring when she'd helped me through my awkward convalescence; Charlie would be forever grateful to her for saving him from the horror of an almost-adult daughter who needed help showering. \"I'll tell her.\" \"Okay. You kids have fun tonight.\" It was clearly a dismissal. Charlie was already edging toward the living room and the TV. Edward smiled, triumphant, and took my hand to pull me from the kitchen. When we got to the truck, he opened the passenger door for me again, and this time I didn't argue. I still had a hard time finding the obscure turnoff to his house in the dark. Edward drove north through Forks, visibly chafing at the speed limit enforced by my prehistoric Chevy. The engine groaned even louder than usual as he pushed it over fifty. \"Take it easy,\" I warned him. \"You know what you would love? A nice little Audi coupe. Very quiet, lots of power\u2026\" \"There's nothing wrong with my truck. And speaking of expensive nonessentials, if you know what's good for you, you didn't spend any money on birthday presents.\" \"Not a dime,\" he said virtuously. \"Good.\" \"Can you do me a favor?\" \"That depends on what it is.\" He sighed, his lovely face serious. \"Bella, the last real birthday any of us had was Emmett in 1935. Cut us a little slack, and don't be too difficult tonight. They're all very excited.\" It always startled me a little when he brought up things like that. \"Fine, I'll behave.\" \"I probably should warn you\u2026\" \"Please do.\" \"When I say they're all excited\u2026 I do mean all of them.\" \"Everyone?\" I choked. \"I thought Emmett and Rosalie were in Africa.\" The rest of Forks was under the impression that the older Cullens had gone off to college this year, to Dartmouth, but I knew better. \"Emmett wanted to be here.\" \"But\u2026 Rosalie?\" \"I know, Bella. Don't worry, she'll be on her best behavior.\" I didn't answer. Like I could just not worry, that easy. Unlike Alice, Edward's other \"adopted\" sister, the golden blond and exquisite Rosalie, didn't like me much. Actually, the feeling was a little bit stronger than just dislike. As far as Rosalie was concerned, I was an unwelcome intruder into her family's secret life. I felt horribly guilty about the present situation, guessing that Rosalie and Emmett's prolonged absence was my fault, even as I furtively enjoyed not having to see her Emmett, Edward's playful bear of a brother, I did miss. He was in many ways just like the big brother I'd always wanted\u2026 only much, much more terrifying. Edward decided to change the subject. \"So, if you won't let me get you the Audi, isn't there anything that you'd like for your birthday?\" The words came out in a whisper. \"You know what I want.\" A deep frown carved creases into his marble forehead. He obviously wished he'd stuck to the subject of Rosalie. It felt like we'd had this argument a lot today. \"Not tonight, Bella. Please.\" \"Well, maybe Alice will give me what I want.\" Edward growled\u2014a deep, menacing sound. \"This isn't going to be your last birthday, Bella,\" he vowed. \"That's not fair!\" I thought I heard his teeth clench together. We were pulling up to the house now. Bright light shined from every window on the first two floors. A long line of glowing Japanese lanterns hung from the porch eaves, reflecting a soft radiance on the huge cedars that surrounded the house. Big bowls of flowers\u2014pink roses\u2014lined the wide stairs up to the front doors. I moaned. Edward took a few deep breaths to calm himself. \"This is a party,\" he reminded me. \"Try to be a good sport.\" \"Sure,\" I muttered. He came around to get my door, and offered me his hand. \"I have a question.\" He waited warily. \"If I develop this film,\" I said, toying with the camera in my hands, \"will you show up in the picture?\" Edward started laughing. He helped me out of the car, pulled me up the stairs, and was still laughing as he opened the door for me. They were all waiting in the huge white living room; when I walked through the door, they greeted me with a loud chorus of \"Happy birthday, Bella!\" while I blushed and looked down. Alice, I assumed, had covered every flat surface with pink candles and dozens of crystal bowls filled with hundreds of roses. There was a table with a white cloth draped over it next to Edward's grand piano, holding a pink birthday cake, more roses, a stack of glass plates, and a small pile of silver-wrapped presents. It was a hundred times worse than I'd imagined. Edward, sensing my distress, wrapped an encouraging arm around my waist and kissed the top of my head. Edward's parents, Carlisle and Esme\u2014impossibly youthful and lovely as ever\u2014were the closest to the door. Esme hugged me carefully, her soft, caramel-colored hair brushing against my cheek as she kissed my forehead, and then Carlisle put his arm around my shoulders. \"Sorry about this, Bella,\" he stage-whispered. \"We couldn't rein Alice in.\" Rosalie and Emmett stood behind them. Rosalie didn't smile, but at least she didn't glare. Emmett's face was stretched into a huge grin. It had been months since I'd seen them; I'd forgotten how gloriously beautiful Rosalie was\u2014it almost hurt to look at her. And had Emmett always been so\u2026 big? \"You haven't changed at all,\" Emmett said with mock disappointment. \"I expected a perceptible difference, but here you are, red-faced just like always.\" \"Thanks a lot, Emmett,\" I said, blushing deeper. He laughed, \"I have to step out for a second\"\u2014he paused to wink conspicuously at Alice\u2014\"Don't do anything funny while I'm gone.\" \"I'll try.\" Alice let go of Jasper's hand and skipped forward, all her teeth sparkling in the bright light. Jasper smiled, too, but kept his distance. He leaned, long and blond, against the post at the foot of the stairs. During the days we'd had to spend cooped up together in Phoenix, I'd thought he'd gotten over his aversion to me. But he'd gone back to exactly how he'd acted before\u2014avoiding me as much as possible\u2014the moment he was free from that temporary obligation to protect me. I knew it wasn't personal, just a precaution, and I tried not to be overly sensitive about it. Jasper had more trouble sticking to the Cullens' diet than the rest of them; the scent of human blood was much harder for him to resist than the others\u2014he hadn't been trying as long. \"Time to open presents,\" Alice declared. She put her cool hand under my elbow and towed me to the table with the cake and the shiny packages. I put on my best martyr face. \"Alice, I know I told you I didn't want anything\u2014\" \"But I didn't listen,\" she interrupted, smug. \"Open it.\" She took the camera from my hands and replaced it with a big, square silver box. The box was so light that it felt empty. The tag on top said that it was from Emmett, Rosalie, and Jasper. Self-consciously, I tore the paper off and then stared at the box it concealed. It was something electrical, with lots of numbers in the name. I opened the box, hoping for further illumination. But the box was empty. \"Um\u2026 thanks.\" Rosalie actually cracked a smile. Jasper laughed. \"It's a stereo for your truck,\" he explained. \"Emmett's installing it right now so that you can't return it.\" Alice was always one step ahead of me. \"Thanks, Jasper, Rosalie,\" I told them, grinning as I remembered Edward's complaints about my radio this afternoon\u2014all a setup, apparently. \"Thanks, Emmett!\" I called more loudly. I heard his booming laugh from my truck, and I couldn't help laughing, too. \"Open mine and Edward's next,\" Alice said, so excited her voice was a high-pitched trill. She held a small, flat square in her hand. I turned to give Edward a basilisk glare. \"You promised.\" Before he could answer, Emmett bounded through the door. \"Just in time!\" he crowed. He pushed in behind Jasper, who had also drifted closer than usual to get a good look. \"I didn't spend a dime,\" Edward assured me. He brushed a strand of hair from my face, leaving my skin tingling from his touch. I inhaled deeply and turned to Alice. \"Give it to me,\" I sighed. Emmett chuckled with delight. I took the little package, rolling my eyes at Edward while I stuck my finger under the edge of the paper and jerked it under the tape. \"Shoot,\" I muttered when the paper sliced my finger; I pulled it out to examine the damage. A single drop of blood oozed from the tiny cut. It all happened very quickly then. \"No!\" Edward roared. He threw himself at me, flinging me back across the table. It fell, as I did, scattering the cake and the presents, the flowers and the plates. I landed in the mess of shattered crystal. Jasper slammed into Edward, and the sound was like the crash of boulders in a rock slide. There was another noise, a grisly snarling that seemed to be coming from deep in Jasper's chest. Jasper tried to shove past Edward, snapping his teeth just inches from Edward's face. Emmett grabbed Jasper from behind in the next second, locking him into his massive steel grip, but Jasper struggled on, his wild, empty eyes focused only on me. Beyond the shock, there was also pain. I'd tumbled down to the floor by the piano, with my arms thrown out instinctively to catch my fall, into the jagged shards of glass. Only now did I feel the searing, stinging pain that ran from my wrist to the crease inside my elbow. Dazed and disoriented, I looked up from the bright red blood pulsing out of my arm\u2014into the fevered eyes of the six suddenly ravenous vampires.",

            "en": "Ch\u1ea1ng V\u1ea1ng - Twilight            2. OPEN BOOK The next day was better\u2026 and worse. It was better because it wasn't raining yet, though the clouds were dense and opaque. It was easier because I knew what to expect of my day. Mike came to sit by me in English, and walked me to my next class, with Chess Club Eric glaring at him all the while; that was nattering. People didn't look at me quite as much as they had yesterday. I sat with a big group at lunch that included Mike, Eric, Jessica, and several other people whose names and faces I now remembered. I began to feel like I was treading water, instead of drowning in it.  It was worse because I was tired; I still couldn't sleep with the wind echoing around the\u00a0 house. It was worse because Mr. Varner called on me in Trig when my hand wasn't raised and I had the wrong answer. It was miserable because I had to play volleyball, and the one time I didn't cringe out of the way of the ball, I hit my teammate in the head with it. And it was worse because Edward Cullen wasn't in school at all. \u00a0All morning I was dreading lunch, fearing his bizarre glares. Part of me wanted to confront him and demand to know what his problem was. While I was lying sleepless in my bed, I even imagined what I would say. But I knew myself too well to think I would really have the guts to do it. I made the Cowardly Lion look like the terminator. But when I walked into the cafeteria with Jessica \u2014 trying to keep my eyes from sweeping the place for him, and failing entirely \u2014 I saw that his four siblings of sorts were sitting together at the same table, and he was not with them. Mike intercepted us and steered us to his table. Jessica seemed elated by the attention, and her friends quickly joined us. But as I tried to listen to their easy chatter, I was terribly uncomfortable, waiting nervously for the moment he would arrive. I hoped that he would simply ignore me when he came, and prove my suspicions false. He didn't come, and as time passed I grew more and more tense. I walked to Biology with more confidence when, by the end of lunch, he still hadn't showed. Mike, who was taking on the qualities of a golden retriever, walked faithfully by my side to class. I held my breath at the door, but Edward Cullen wasn't there, either. I exhaled and went to my seat. Mike followed, talking about an upcoming trip to the beach. He lingered by my desk till the bell rang. Then he smiled at me wistfully and went to sit by a girl with braces and a bad perm. It looked like I was going to have to do something about Mike, and it wouldn't be easy. In a town like this, where everyone lived on top of everyone else, diplomacy was essential. I had never been enormously tactful; I had no practice dealing with overly friendly boys. I was relieved that I had the desk to myself, that Edward was absent. I told myself that repeatedly. But I couldn't get rid of the nagging suspicion that I was the reason he wasn't there. It was ridiculous, and egotistical, to think that I could affect anyone that strongly. It was impossible. And yet I couldn't stop worrying that it was true. When the school day was finally done, and the blush was fading out of my cheeks from the volleyball incident, I changed quickly back into my jeans and navy blue sweater. I hurried from the girls' locker room, pleased to find that I had successfully evaded my retriever friend for the moment. I walked swiftly out to the parking lot. It was crowded now with fleeing students. I got in my truck and dug through my bag to make sure I had what I needed. Last night I'd discovered that Charlie couldn't cook much besides fried eggs and bacon. So I requested that I be assigned kitchen detail for the duration of my stay. He was willing enough to hand over the keys to the banquet hall. I also found out that he had no food in the house. So I had my shopping list and the cash from the jar in the cupboard labeled FOOD MONEY, and I was on my way to the Thriftway. I gunned my deafening engine to life, ignoring the heads that turned in my direction, and backed carefully into a place in the line of cars that were waiting to exit the parking lot. As I waited, trying to pretend that the earsplitting rumble was coming from someone else's car, I saw the two Cullens and the Hale twins getting into their car. It was the shiny new Volvo. Of course. I hadn't noticed their clothes before \u2014 I'd been too mesmerized by their faces. Now that I looked, it was obvious that they were all dressed exceptionally well; simply, but in clothes that subtly hinted at designer origins. With their remarkable good looks, the style with which they carried themselves, they could have worn dishrags and pulled it off. It seemed excessive for them to have both looks and money.  But as far as I could tell, life worked that way most of the time. It didn't look as if it bought them any acceptance here.  No, I didn't fully believe that. The isolation must be their desire; I couldn't imagine any door that wouldn't be opened by that degree of beauty. They looked at my noisy truck as I passed them, just like everyone else.  I kept my eyes straight forward and was relieved when I finally was free of the school grounds.  The Thriftway was not far from the school, just a few streets south, off the highway. It was nice to be inside the supermarket; it felt normal. I did the shopping at home, and I fell into the pattern of the familiar task gladly. The store was big enough inside that I couldn't hear the tapping of the rain on the roof to remind me where I was. When I got home, I unloaded all the groceries, stuffing them in wherever I could find an open space. I hoped Charlie wouldn't mind. I wrapped potatoes in foil and stuck them in the oven to bake, covered a steak in marinade and balanced it on top of a carton of eggs in the fridge.  When I was finished with that, I took my book bag upstairs. Before starting my homework, I changed into a pair of dry sweats, pulled my damp hair up into a pony-tail, and checked my e-mail for the first time. I had three messages. \"Bella,\" my mom wrote\u2026  Write me as soon as you get in. Tell me how your flight was. Is it raining? I miss you\u00a0 already. I'm almost finished packing for Florida, but I can't find my pink blouse. Do you know where I put it? Phil says hi.  Mom. I sighed and went to the next. It was sent eight hours after the first. \"Bella,\" she wrote\u2026 Why haven't you e-mailed me yet? What are you waiting for? Mom. The last was from this morning. Isabella, If I haven't heard from you by 5:30 p.m. today I'm calling Charlie. I checked the clock. I still had an hour, but my mom was well known for jumping the gun. Mom, Calm down. I'm writing right now. Don't do anything rash. Bella. I sent that, and began again. Mom, Everything is great. Of course it's raining. I was waiting for something to write about. School isn't bad, just a little repetitive. I met some nice kids who sit by me at lunch. Your blouse is at the dry cleaners - you were supposed to pick it up Friday. Charlie bought me a truck, can you believe it? I love it. It's old, but really sturdy, which is good, you know, for me. I miss you, too. I'll write again soon, but I'm not going to check my e-mail every five minutes. Relax, breathe. I love you. Bella. I had decided to read Wuthering Heights \u2014 the novel we were currently studying in English \u2014 yet again for the fun of it, and that's what I was doing when Charlie came home. I'd lost track of the time, and I hurried downstairs to take the potatoes out and put the steak in to broil. \"Bella?\" my father called out when he heard me on the stairs. Who else? I thought to myself. \"Hey, Dad, welcome home.\" \"Thanks.\" He hung up his gun belt and stepped out of his boots as I bustled about the kitchen. As far as I was aware, he'd never shot the gun on the job. But he kept it ready. When I came here as a child, he would always remove the bullets as soon as he walked in the door. I guess he considered me old enough now not to shoot myself by accident, and not depressed enough to shoot myself on purpose.  \"What's for dinner?\" he asked warily. My mother was an imaginative cook, and her experiments weren't always edible. I was surprised, and sad, that he seemed to remember that far back. \"Steak and potatoes,\" I answered, and he looked relieved. He seemed to feel awkward standing in the kitchen doing nothing; he lumbered into the living room to watch TV while I worked. We were both more comfortable that way. I made a salad while the steaks cooked, and set the table. I called him in when dinner was ready, and he sniffed appreciatively as he walked into the room. \"Smells good, Bell.\" \"Thanks.\" We ate in silence for a few minutes. It wasn't uncomfortable. Neither of us was bothered by the quiet. In some ways, we were well suited for living together. \"So, how did you like school? Have you made any friends?\" he asked as he was taking seconds. \"Well, I have a few classes with a girl named Jessica. I sit with her friends at lunch. And there's this boy, Mike, who's very friendly. Everybody seems pretty nice.\" With one outstanding exception. \"That must be Mike Newton. Nice kid \u2014 nice family. His dad owns the sporting goods store just outside of town. He makes a good living off all the backpackers who come through here.\" \" Do you know the Cullen family?\" I asked hesitantly.  \"Dr. Cullen's family? Sure. Dr. Cullen's a great man.\" \"They\u2026 the kids\u2026 are a little different. They don't seem to fit in very well at school.\" Charlie surprised me by looking angry. \"People in this town,\" he muttered.\u201dDr. Cullen is a brilliant surgeon who could probably work in any hospital in the world, make ten times the salary he gets here,\" he continued, getting louder.\u201dWe're lucky to have him \u2014 lucky that his wife wanted to live in a small town. He's an asset to the community, and all of those kids are well behaved and polite. I had my doubts, when they first moved in, with all those adopted teenagers. I thought we might have some problems with them. But they're all very mature \u2014 I haven't had one speck of trouble from any of them. That's more than I can say for the children of some folks who have lived in this town for generations. And they stick together the way a family should \u2014 camping trips every other weekend\u2026  Just because they're newcomers, people have to talk.\" It was the longest speech I'd ever heard Charlie make. He must feel strongly about whatever people were saying. I backpedaled.\u201dThey seemed nice enough to me. I just noticed they kept to themselves. They're all very attractive,\" I added, trying to be more complimentary. \"You should see the doctor,\" Charlie said, laughing.\u201dIt's a good thing he's happily married. A lot of the nurses at the hospital have a hard time concentrating on their work with him around.\" We lapsed back into silence as we finished eating. He cleared the table while I started on the dishes. He went back to the TV, and after I finished washing the dishes by hand \u2014 no\u00a0 dishwasher \u2014 I went upstairs unwillingly to work on my math homework. I could feel a tradition in the making. That night it was finally quiet. I fell asleep quickly, exhausted. The rest of the week was uneventful. I got used to the routine of my classes. By Friday I was able to recognize, if not name, almost all the students at school. In Gym, the kids on my team learned not to pass me the ball and to step quickly in front of me if the other team tried to take advantage of my weakness. I happily stayed out of their way. Edward Cullen didn't come back to school. Every day, I watched anxiously until the rest of the Cullens entered the cafeteria without him. Then I could relax and join in the lunchtime conversation. Mostly it centered around a trip to the La Push Ocean Park in two weeks that Mike was putting together. I was invited, and I had agreed to go, more out of politeness than desire. Beaches should be hot and dry. By Friday I was perfectly comfortable entering my Biology class, no longer worried that Edward would be there. For all I knew, he had dropped out of school. I tried not to think about him, but I couldn't totally suppress the worry that I was responsible for his continued absence, ridiculous as it seemed. My first weekend in Forks passed without incident. Charlie, unused to spending time in the usually empty house, worked most of the weekend. I cleaned the house, got ahead on my homework, and wrote my mom more bogusly cheerful e-mail. I did drive to the library Saturday, but it was so poorly stocked that I didn't bother to get a card; I would have to make a date to visit Olympia or Seattle soon and find a good bookstore. I wondered idly what kind of gas mileage the truck got\u2026 and shuddered at the thought. The rain stayed soft over the weekend, quiet, so I was able to sleep well. People greeted me in the parking lot Monday morning. I didn't know all their names, but I waved back and smiled at everyone. It was colder this morning, but happily not raining. In English, Mike took his accustomed seat by my side. We had a pop quiz on Wuthering Heights. It was straightforward, very easy. All in all, I was feeling a lot more comfortable than I had thought I would feel by this point. More comfortable than I had ever expected to feel here. When we walked out of class, the air was full of swirling bits of white. I could hear people shouting excitedly to each other. The wind bit at my cheeks, my nose. \"Wow,\" Mike said.\u201dIt's snowing.\" I looked at the little cotton fluffs that were building up along the sidewalk and swirling erratically past my face.  \"Ew.\" Snow. There went my good day. He looked surprised.\u201dDon't you like snow?\" \"No. That means it's too cold for rain.\" Obviously.\u201dBesides, I thought it was supposed to come down in flakes \u2014 you know, each one unique and all that. These just look like the ends of Q-tips.\" \"Haven't you ever seen snow fall before?\" he asked incredulously. \"Sure I have.\" I paused.\u201dOn TV.\" Mike laughed. And then a big, squishy ball of dripping snow smacked into the back of his head. We both turned to see where it came from. I had my suspicions about Eric, who was walking away, his back toward us \u2014 in the wrong direction for his next class. Mike appatently had the same notion.  He bent over and began scraping together a pile of the white mush. \"I'll see you at lunch, okay?\" I kept walking as I spoke.\u201dOnce people start throwing wet stuff, I go inside.\" He just nodded, his eyes on Eric's retreating figure. Throughout the morning, everyone chattered excitedly about the snow; apparently it was the first snowfall of the new year. I kept my mouth shut. Sure, it was drier than rain \u2014 until it melted in your socks. I walked alertly to the cafeteria with Jessica after Spanish. Mush balls were flying everywhere. I kept a binder in my hands, ready to use it as a shield if necessary. Jessica thought I was hilarious, but something in my expression kept her from lobbing a snowball at me herself. Mike caught up to us as we walked in the doors, laughing, with ice melting the spikes in his hair. He and Jessica were talking animatedly about the snow fight as we got in line to buy food. I glanced toward that table in the corner out of habit. And then I froze where I stood. There were five people at the table. Jessica pulled on my arm. \"Hello? Bella? What do you want?\" I looked down; my ears were hot. I had no reason to feel self-conscious, I reminded myself. I hadn't done anything wrong. \"What's with Bella?\" Mike asked Jessica. \"Nothing,\" I answered.\u201dI'll just get a soda today.\" I caught up to the end of the line. \"Aren't you hungry?\" Jessica asked. \"Actually, I feel a little sick,\" I said, my eyes still on the floor. I waited for them to get their food, and then followed them to a table, my eyes on my feet. I sipped my soda slowly, my stomach churning. Twice Mike asked, with unnecessary concern, how I was feeling. I told him it was nothing, but I was wondering if I should play it up and escape to the nurse's office for the next hour. Ridiculous. I shouldn't have to run away.  I decided to permit myself one glance at the Cullen family's table. If he was glaring at me, I would skip Biology, like the coward I was. I kept my head down and glanced up under my lashes. None of them were looking this way. I lifted my head a little. They were laughing. Edward, Jasper, and Emmett all had their hair entirely saturated with melting snow. Alice and Rosalie were leaning away as Emmett shook his dripping hair toward them. They were enjoying the snowy day, just like everyone else \u2014 only they looked more like a scene from a movie than the rest of us. But, aside from the laughter and playfulness, there was something different, and I couldn't quite pinpoint what that difference was. I examined Edward the most carefully. His skin was less pale, I decided \u2014 flushed from the snow fight maybe \u2014 the circles under his eyes much less noticeable. But there was something more. I pondered, staring, trying to isolate the change. \"Bella, what are you staring at?\" Jessica intruded, her eyes following my stare. At that precise moment, his eyes flashed over to meet mine. I dropped my head, letting my hair fall to conceal my face. I was sure, though, in the instant our eyes met, that he didn't look harsh or unfriendly as he had the last time I'd seen him. He looked merely curious again, unsatisfied in some way. \"Edward Cullen is staring at you,\" Jessica giggled in my ear. \"He doesn't look angry, does he?\" I couldn't help asking. \"No,\" she said, sounding confused by my question.\u201dShould he be?\" \"I don't think he likes me,\" I confided. I still felt queasy. I put my head down on my arm. \"The Cullens don't like anybody\u2026 well, they don't notice anybody enough to like them. But he's still staring at you.\" \"Stop looking at him,\" I hissed. She snickered, but she looked away. I raised my head enough to make sure that she did, contemplating violence if she resisted. Mike interrupted us then \u2014 he was planning an epic battle of the blizzard in the parking lot after school and wanted us to join. Jessica agreed enthusiastically. The way she looked at Mike left little doubt that she would be up for anything he suggested. I kept silent. I would have to hide in the gym until the parking lot cleared. For the rest of the lunch hour I very carefully kept my eyes at my own table. I decided to honor the bargain I'd made with myself. Since he didn't look angry, I would go to Biology. My stomach did frightened little flips at the thought of sitting next to him again. I didn't really want to walk to class with Mike as usual \u2014 he seemed to be a popular target for the snowball snipers \u2014 but when we went to the door, everyone besides me groaned in unison. It was raining, washing all traces of the snow away in clear, icy ribbons down the side of the walkway. I pulled my hood up, secretly pleased. I would be free to go straight home after Gym. Mike kept up a string of complaints on the way to building four. Once inside the classroom, I saw with relief that my table was still empty. Mr. Banner was walking around the room, distributing one microscope and box of slides to each table. Class didn't start for a few minutes, and the room buzzed with conversation. I kept my eyes away from the door, doodling idly on the cover of my notebook. I heard very clearly when the chair next to me moved, but my eyes stayed carefully focused on the pattern I was drawing. \"Hello,\" said a quiet, musical voice. I looked up, stunned that he was speaking to me. He was sitting as far away from me as the desk allowed, but his chair was angled toward me. His hair was dripping wet, disheveled \u2014 even so, he looked like he'd just finished shooting a commercial for hair gel. His dazzling face was friendly, open, a slight smile on his flawless lips. But his eyes were careful. \"My name is Edward Cullen,\" he continued.\u201dI didn't have a chance to introduce myself last week. You must be Bella Swan.\" My mind was spinning with confusion. Had I made up the whole thing? He was perfectly polite now. I had to speak; he was waiting. But I couldn't think of anything conventional to say. \"H-how do you know my name?\" I stammered.  He laughed a soft, enchanting laugh. \"Oh, I think everyone knows your name. The whole town's been waiting for you to arrive.\" I grimaced. I knew it was something like that. \"No,\" I persisted stupidly.\u201dI meant, why did you call me Bella?\" He seemed confused.\u201dDo you prefer Isabella?\" \"No, I like Bella,\" I said.\u201dBut I think Charlie \u2014 I mean my dad \u2014 must call me Isabella behind my back \u2014 that's what everyone here seems to know me as,\" I tried to explain, feeling like an utter moron. \"Oh.\" He let it drop. I looked away awkwardly.  Thankfully, Mr. Banner started class at that moment. I tried to concentrate as he explained the lab we would be doing today. The slides in the box were out of order. Working as lab partners, we had to separate the slides of onion root tip cells into the phases of mitosis they represented and label them accordingly. We weren't supposed to use our books. In twenty minutes, he would be coming around to see who had it right. \"Get started,\" he commanded. \"Ladies first, partner?\" Edward asked. I looked up to see him smiling a crooked smile so beautiful that I could only stare at him like an idiot. \"Or I could start, if you wish.\" The smile faded; he was obviously wondering if I was mentally competent. \"No,\" I said, flushing.\u201dI'll go ahead.\" I was showing off, just a little. I'd already done this lab, and I knew what I was looking for. It should be easy. I snapped the first slide into place under the microscope and adjusted it quickly to the 40X objective. I studied the slide briefly. My assessment was confident.\u201dProphase.\" \"Do you mind if I look?\" he asked as I began to remove the slide. His hand caught mine, to stop me, as he asked. His fingers were ice-cold, like he'd been holding them in a snowdrift before class. But that wasn't why I jerked my hand away so quickly. When he touched me, it stung my hand as if an electric current had passed through us. \"I'm sorry,\" he muttered, pulling his hand back immediately. However, he continued to reach for the microscope. I watched him, still staggered, as he examined the slide for an even shorter time than I had. \"Prophase,\" he agreed, writing it neatly in the first space on our worksheet. He swiftly switched out the first slide for the second, and then glanced at it cursorily. \"Anaphase,\" he murmured, writing it down as he spoke.  I kept my voice indifferent.\u201dMay I?\" He smirked and pushed the microscope to me. I looked through the eyepiece eagerly, only to be disappointed. Dang it, he was right. \"Slide three?\" I held out my hand without looking at him. He handed it to me; it seemed like he was being careful not to touch my skin again. I took the most fleeting look I could manage. \"Interphase.\" I passed him the microscope before he could ask for it. He took a swift peek, and then wrote it down. I would have written it while he looked, but his clear, elegant script intimidated me. I didn't want to spoil the page with my clumsy scrawl. We were finished before anyone else was close. I could see Mike and his partner comparing two slides again and again, and another group had their book open under the table. Which left me with nothing to do but try to not look at him\u2026 unsuccessfully. I glanced up, and he was staring at me, that same inexplicable look of frustration in his eyes. Suddenly I identified that subtle difference in his face. \"Did you get contacts?\" I blurted out unthinkingly. He seemed puzzled by my unexpected question.\u201dNo.\" \"Oh,\" I mumbled.\u201dI thought there was something different about your eyes.\" He shrugged, and looked away. In fact, I was sure there was something different. I vividly remembered the flat black color of his eyes the last time he'd glared at me \u2014 the color was striking against the background of his pale skin and his auburn hair. Today, his eyes were a completely different color: a strange ocher, darker than butterscotch, but with the same golden tone. I didn't understand how that could be, unless he was lying for some reason about the contacts. Or maybe Forks was making me crazy in the literal sense of the word. I looked down. His hands were clenched into hard fists again. Mr. Banner came to our table then, to see why we weren't working. He looked over our shoulders to glance at the completed lab, and then stared more intently to check the answers. \"So, Edward, didn't you think Isabella should get a chance with the microscope?\" Mr. Banner asked. \"Bella,\" Edward corrected automatically.\u201dActually, she identified three of the five.\" Mr. Banner looked at me now; his expression was skeptical. \"Have you done this lab before?\" he asked. I smiled sheepishly.\u201dNot with onion root.\" \"Whitefish blastula?\" \"Yeah.\" Mr. Banner nodded.\u201dWere you in an advanced placement program in Phoenix?\" \"Yes.\" \"Well,\" he said after a moment,\u201dI guess it's good you two are lab partners.\" He mumbled something else as he walked away. After he left, I began doodling on my notebook again. \"It's too bad about the snow, isn't it?\" Edward asked. I had the feeling that he was forcing himself to make small talk with me. Paranoia swept over me again. It was like he had heard my conversation with Jessica at lunch and was trying to prove me wrong. \"Not really,\" I answered honestly, instead of pretending to be normal like everyone else. I was still trying to dislodge the stupid feeling of suspicion, and I couldn't concentrate. \"You don't like the cold.\" It wasn't a question. \"Or the wet.\" \"Forks must be a difficult place for you to live,\" he mused. \"You have no idea,\" I muttered darkly. He looked fascinated by what I said, for some reason I couldn't imagine. His face was such a distraction that I tried not to look at it any more than courtesy absolutely demanded. \"Why did you come here, then?\" No one had asked me that \u2014 not straight out like he did, demanding. \"It's\u2026 complicated.\" \"I think I can keep up,\" he pressed. I paused for a long moment, and then made the mistake of meeting his gaze. His dark gold eyes confused me, and I answered without thinking. \"My mother got remarried,\" I said. \"That doesn't sound so complex,\" he disagreed, but he was suddenly sympathetic.\u201dWhen did that happen?\" \"Last September.\" My voice sounded sad, even to me. \"And you don't like him,\" Edward surmised, his tone still kind. \"No, Phil is fine. Too young, maybe, but nice enough.\" \"Why didn't you stay with them?\" I couldn't fathom his interest, but he continued to stare at me with penetrating eyes, as if my dull life's story was somehow vitally important. \"Phil travels a lot. He plays ball for a living.\" I half-smiled. \"Have I heard of him?\" he asked, smiling in response. \"Probably not. He doesn't play well. Strictly minor league. He moves around a lot.\" \"And your mother sent you here so that she could travel with him.\" He said it as an assumption again, not a question. My chin raised a fraction.\u201dNo, she did not send me here. I sent myself.\" His eyebrows knit together.\u201dI don't understand,\" he admitted, and he seemed unnecessarily frustrated by that fact. I sighed. Why was I explaining this to him? He continued to stare at me with obvious curiosity. \"She stayed with me at first, but she missed him. It made her unhappy\u2026 so I decided it was time to spend some quality time with Charlie.\" My voice was glum by the time I finished. \"But now you're unhappy,\" he pointed out.  \"And?\" I challenged. \"That doesn't seem fair.\" He shrugged, but his eyes were still intense. I laughed without humor.\u201dHasn't anyone ever told you? Life isn't fair.\" \"I believe I have heard that somewhere before,\" he agreed dryly. \"So that's all,\" I insisted, wondering why he was still staring at me that way. His gaze became appraising.\u201dYou put on a good show,\" he said slowly. \"But I'd be willing to bet that you're suffering more than you let anyone see.\" I grimaced at him, resisting the impulse to stick out my tongue like a five-year-old, and looked away. \"Am I wrong?\" I tried to ignore him. \"I didn't think so,\" he murmured <em>smugly</em>. \"Why does it matter to you?\" I asked, irritated. I kept my eyes away, watching the teacher make his rounds. \"That's a very good question,\" he muttered, so quietly that I wondered if he was talking to himself. However, after a few seconds of silence, I decided that was the only answer I was going to get. I sighed, scowling at the blackboard. \"Am I annoying you?\" he asked. He sounded amused. I glanced at him without thinking\u2026 and told the truth again.\u201dNot exactly. I'm more annoyed at myself. My face is so easy to read \u2014 my mother always calls me her open book.\" I frowned. \"On the contrary, I find you very difficult to read.\" Despite everything that I'd said and he'd guessed, he sounded like he meant it. \"You must be a good reader then,\" I replied. \"Usually.\" He smiled widely, flashing a set of perfect, ultrawhite teeth. Mr. Banner called the class to order then, and I turned with relief to listen. I was in disbelief that I'd just explained my dreary life to this bizarre, beautiful boy who may or may not despise me. He'd seemed engrossed in our conversation, but now I could see, from the corner of my eye, that he was leaning away from me again, his hands gripping the edge of the table with unmistakable tension. I tried to appear attentive as Mr. Banner illustrated, with transparencies on the overhead projector, what I had seen without difficulty through the microscope. But my thoughts were unmanageable. When the bell finally rang, Edward rushed as swiftly and as gracefully from the room as he had last Monday. And, like last Monday, I stared after him in amazement. Mike skipped quickly to my side and picked up my books for me. I imagined him with a wagging tail. \"That was awful,\" he groaned.\u201dThey all looked exactly the same. You're lucky you had Cullen for a partner.\" \"I didn't have any trouble with it,\" I said, stung by his assumption. I regretted the snub instantly.\u201dI've done the lab before, though,\" I added before he could get his feelings hurt. \"Cullen seemed friendly enough today,\" he commented as we shrugged into our raincoats. He didn't seem pleased about it. I tried to sound indifferent.\u201dI wonder what was with him last Monday.\" I couldn't concentrate on Mike's chatter as we walked to Gym, and RE. didn't do much to hold my attention, either. Mike was on my team today. He chivalrously covered my position as well as his own, so my woolgathering was only interrupted when it was my turn to serve; my team ducked warily out of the way every time I was up. The rain was just a mist as I walked to the parking lot, but I was happier when I was in the dry cab. I got the heater running, for once not caring about the mind-numbing roar of the engine. I unzipped my jacket, put the hood down, and fluffed my damp hair out so the heater could dry it on the way home. I looked around me to make sure it was clear. That's when I noticed the still, white figure. Edward Cullen was leaning against the front door of the Volvo, three cars down from me, and staring intently in my direction. I swiftly looked away and threw the truck into reverse, almost hitting a rusty Toyota Corolla in my haste. Lucky for the Toyota, I stomped on the brake in time. It was just the sort of car that my truck would make scrap metal of. I took a deep breath, still looking out the other side of my car, and cautiously pulled out again, with greater success. I stared straight ahead as I passed the Volvo, but from a peripheral peek, I would swear I saw him laughing.",
