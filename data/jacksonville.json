            "en": "24           24. AN IMPASSE My eyes opened to a bright, white light. I was in an unfamiliar room, a white room. The wall beside me was covered in long vertical blinds; over my head, the glaring lights blinded me. I was propped up on a hard, uneven bed \u2014 a bed with rails. The pillows were flat and lumpy. There was an annoying beeping sound somewhere close by. I hoped that meant I was still alive. Death shouldn't be this uncomfortable.  My hands were all twisted up with clear tubes, and something was taped across my face, under my nose. I lifted my hand to rip it off. \"No, you don't.\" And cool fingers caught my hand. \"Edward?\" I turned my head slightly, and his exquisite face was just inches from mine, his chin resting on the edge of my pillow. I realized again that I was alive, this time with gratitude and elation. \"Oh, Edward, I'm so sorry!\" \"Shhhh,\" he shushed me. \"Everything's all right now.\" \"What happened?\" I couldn't remember clearly, and my mind rebelled against me as I tried to recall. \"I was almost too late. I could have been too late,\" he whispered, his voice tormented. \"I was so stupid, Edward. I thought he had my mom.\" \"He tricked us all.\" \"I need to call Charlie and my mom,\" I realized through the haze. \"Alice called them. Ren\u00e9e is here \u2014 well, here in the hospital. She's getting something to eat right now.\" \"She's here?\" I tried to sit up, but the spinning in my head accelerated, and his hand pushed me gently down onto the pillows. \"She'll be back soon,\" he promised. \"And you need to stay still.\" \"But what did you tell her?\" I panicked. I had no interest in being soothed. My mom was here and I was recovering from a vampire attack. \"Why did you tell her I'm here?\" \"You fell down two flights of stairs and through a window.\" He paused.\u00a0 \"You have to admit, it could happen.\" I sighed, and it hurt. I stared down at my body under the sheet, the huge lump that was my leg. \"How bad am I?\" I asked. \"You have a broken leg, four broken ribs, some cracks in your skull, bruises covering every inch of your skin, and you've lost a lot of blood.  They gave you a few transfusions. I didn't like it \u2014 it made you smell all wrong for a while.\" \"That must have been a nice change for you.\" \"No, I like how you smell.\" \"How did you do it?\" I asked quietly. He knew what I meant at once. \"I'm not sure.\" He looked away from my wondering eyes, lifting my gauze-wrapped hand from the bed and holding it gently in his, careful not to disrupt the wire connecting me to one of the monitors. I waited patiently for the rest. He sighed without returning my gaze. \"It was impossible\u2026 to stop,\" he whispered. \"Impossible. But I did.\" He looked up finally, with half a smile. \"I must love you.\" \"Don't I taste as good as I smell?\" I smiled in response. That hurt my face. \"Even better \u2014 better than I'd imagined.\" \"I'm sorry,\" I apologized. He raised his eyes to the ceiling. \"Of all the things to apologize for.\" \"What should I apologize for?\" \"For very nearly taking yourself away from me forever.\" \"I'm sorry,\" I apologized again. \"I know why you did it.\" His voice was comforting. \"It was still irrational, of course. You should have waited for me, you should have told me.\" \"You wouldn't have let me go.\" \"No,\" he agreed in a grim tone, \"I wouldn't.\" Some very unpleasant memories were beginning to come back to me. I shuddered, and then winced. He was instantly anxious. \"Bella, what's wrong?\" \"What happened to James?\" \"After I pulled him off you, Emmett and Jasper took care of him.\" There was a fierce note of regret in his voice. This confused me. \"I didn't see Emmett and Jasper there.\" \"They had to leave the room\u2026 there was a lot of blood.\" \"But you stayed.\" \"Yes, I stayed.\" \"And Alice, and Carlisle\u2026\" I said in wonder. \"They love you, too, you know.\" A flash of painful images from the last time I'd seen Alice reminded me of something. \"Did Alice see the tape?\" I asked anxiously. \"Yes.\" A new sound darkened his voice, a tone of sheer hatred. \"She was always in the dark, that's why she didn't remember.\" \"I know. She understands now.\" His voice was even, but his face was black with fury. I tried to reach his face with my free hand, but something stopped me. I glanced down to see the IV pulling at my hand. \"Ugh.\" I winced. \"What is it?\" he asked anxiously \u2014 distracted, but not enough. The bleakness did not entirely leave his eyes. \"Needles,\" I explained, looking away from the one in my hand. I concentrated on a warped ceiling tile and tried to breathe deeply despite the ache in my ribs. \"Afraid of a needle,\" he muttered to himself under his breath, shaking his head. \"Oh, a sadistic vampire, intent on torturing her to death, sure, no problem, she runs off to meet him. An IV, on the other hand\u2026\" I rolled my eyes. I was pleased to discover that this reaction, at least, was pain-free. I decided to change the subject. \"Why are you here?\" I asked. He stared at me, first confusion and then hurt touching his eyes. His brows pulled together as he frowned. \"Do you want me to leave?\" \"No!\" I protested, horrified by the thought. \"No, I meant, why does my mother think you're here? I need to have my story straight before she gets back.\" \"Oh,\" he said, and his forehead smoothed back into marble. \"I came to Phoenix to talk some sense into you, to convince you to come back to Forks.\" His wide eyes were so earnest and sincere, I almost believed him myself. \"You agreed to see me, and you drove out to the hotel where I was staying with Carlisle and Alice \u2014 of course I was here with parental supervision,\" he inserted virtuously, \"but you tripped on the stairs on the way to my room and\u2026 well, you know the rest. You don't need to remember any details, though; you have a good excuse to be a little muddled about the finer points.\" I thought about it for a moment. \"There are a few flaws with that story. Like no broken windows.\" \"Not really,\" he said. \"Alice had a little bit too much fun fabricating evidence. It's all been taken care of very convincingly \u2014 you could probably sue the hotel if you wanted to. You have nothing to worry about,\" he promised, stroking my cheek with the lightest of touches. \"Your only job now is to heal.\" I wasn't so lost to the soreness or the fog of medication that I didn't respond to his touch. The beeping of the monitor jumped around erratically \u2014 now he wasn't the only one who could hear my heart misbehave. \"That's going to be embarrassing,\" I muttered to myself. He chuckled, and a speculative look came into his eye. \"Hmm, I wonder\u2026\" He leaned in slowly; the beeping noise accelerated wildly before his lips even touched me. But when they did, though with the most gentle of pressure, the beeping stopped altogether. He pulled back abruptly, his anxious expression turning to relief as the monitor reported the restarting of my heart. \"It seems that I'm going to have to be even more careful with you than usual.\" He frowned. \"I was not finished kissing you,\" I complained. \"Don't make me come over there.\" He grinned, and bent to press his lips lightly to mine. The monitor went wild. But then his lips were taut. He pulled away. \"I think I hear your mother,\" he said, grinning again. \"Don't leave me,\" I cried, an irrational surge of panic flooding through me. I couldn't let him go \u2014 he might disappear from me again. He read the terror in my eyes for a short second. \"I won't,\" he promised solemnly, and then he smiled. \"I'll take a nap.\" He moved from the hard plastic chair by my side to the turquoise faux-leather recliner at the foot of my bed, leaning it all the way back, and closing his eyes. He was perfectly still. \"Don't forget to breathe,\" I whispered sarcastically. He took a deep breath, his eyes still closed. I could hear my mother now. She was talking to someone, maybe a nurse, and she sounded tired and upset. I wanted to jump out of the bed and run to her, to calm her, promise that everything was fine. But I wasn't in any sort of shape for jumping, so I waited impatiently. The door opened a crack, and she peeked through. \"Mom!\" I whispered, my voice full of love and relief. She took in Edward's still form on the recliner, and tiptoed to my bedside. \"He never leaves, does he?\" she mumbled to herself. \"Mom, I'm so glad to see you!\" She bent down to hug me gently, and I felt warm tears falling on my cheeks. \"Bella, I was so upset!\" \"I'm sorry, Mom. But everything's fine now, it's okay,\" I comforted her. \"I'm just glad to finally see your eyes open.\" She sat on the edge of my bed. I suddenly realized I didn't have any idea when it was. \"How long have they been closed?\" \"It's Friday, hon, you've been out for a while.\" \"Friday?\" I was shocked. I tried to remember what day it had been when\u2026 but I didn't want to think about that. \"They had to keep you sedated for a while, honey \u2014 you've got a lot of injuries.\" \"I know.\" I could feel them. \"You're lucky Dr. Cullen was there. He's such a nice man\u2026 very young, though. And he looks more like a model than a doctor\u2026\" \"You met Carlisle?\" \"And Edward's sister Alice. She's a lovely girl.\" \"She is,\" I agreed wholeheartedly. She glanced over her shoulder at Edward, lying with his eyes closed in the chair. \"You didn't tell me you had such good friends in Forks.\" I cringed, and then moaned. \"What hurts?\" she demanded anxiously, turning back to me. Edward's eyes flashed to my face. \"It's fine,\" I assured them. \"I just have to remember not to move.\" He lapsed back into his phony slumber. I took advantage of my mother's momentary distraction to keep the subject from returning to my less-than-candid behavior. \"Where's Phil?\" I asked quickly. \"Florida \u2014 oh, Bella! You'll never guess! Just when we were about to leave, the best news!\" \"Phil got signed?\" I guessed. \"Yes! How did you guess! The Suns, can you believe it?\" \"That's great, Mom,\" I said as enthusiastically as I could manage, though I had little idea what that meant. \"And you'll like <em>Jacksonville</em> so much,\" she gushed while I stared at her vacantly. \"I was a little bit worried when Phil started talking about Akron, what with the snow and everything, because you know how I hate the cold, but now <em>Jacksonville</em>! It's always sunny, and the humidity really isn't that bad. We found the cutest house, yellow, with white trim, and a porch just like in an old movie, and this huge oak tree, and it's just a few minutes from the ocean, and you'll have your own bathroom \u2014\" \"Wait, Mom!\" I interrupted. Edward still had his eyes closed, but he looked too tense to pass as asleep. \"What are you talking about? I'm not going to Florida. I live in Forks.\" \"But you don't have to anymore, silly,\" she laughed. \"Phil will be able to be around so much more now\u2026 we've talked about it a lot, and what I'm going to do is trade off on the away games, half the time with you, half the time with him.\" \"Mom.\" I hesitated, wondering how best to be diplomatic about this. \"I want to live in Forks. I'm already settled in at school, and I have a couple of girlfriends\" \u2014 she glanced toward Edward again when I reminded her of friends, so I tried another direction \u2014 \"and Charlie needs me. \u00a0He's just all alone up there, and he can't cook at all.\" \"You want to stay in Forks?\" she asked, bewildered. The idea was inconceivable to her. And then her eyes flickered back toward Edward.  \"Why?\" \"I told you \u2014 school, Charlie \u2014 ouch!\" I'd shrugged. Not a good idea. .  Her hands fluttered helplessly over me, trying to find a safe place to pat. She made do with my forehead; it was unbandaged. \"Bella, honey, you hate Forks,\" she reminded me. \"It's not so bad.\" She frowned and looked back and forth between Edward and me, this time very deliberately. \"Is it this boy?\" she whispered. I opened my mouth to lie, but her eyes were scrutinizing my face, and I knew she would see through that. \"He's part of it,\" I admitted. No need to confess how big a part. \"So, have you had a chance to talk with Edward?\" I asked. \"Yes.\" She hesitated, looking at his perfectly still form. \"And I want to talk to you about that.\" Uh-oh. \"What about?\" I asked. \"I think that boy is in love with you,\" she accused, keeping her voice low. \"I think so, too,\" I confided. \"And how do you feel about him?\" She only poorly concealed the raging curiosity in her voice. I sighed, looking away. As much as I loved my mom, this was not a conversation I wanted to have with her. \"I'm pretty crazy about him.\" There \u2014 that sounded like something a teenager with her first boyfriend might say. \"Well, he seems very nice, and, my goodness, he's incredibly good-looking, but you're so young, Bella\u2026\" Her voice was unsure; as far as I could remember, this was the first time since I was eight that she'd come close to trying to sound like a parental authority. I recognized the reasonable-but-firm tone of voice from talks I'd had with her about men. \"I know that, Mom. Don't worry about it. It's just a crush,\" I soothed her. \"That's right,\" she agreed, easily pleased. Then she sighed and glanced guiltily over her shoulder at the big, round clock on the wall. \"Do you need to go?\" She bit her lip. \"Phil's supposed to call in a little while\u2026 I didn't know you were going to wake up\u2026\" \"No problem, Mom.\" I tried to tone down the relief so she wouldn't get her feelings hurt. \"I won't be alone.\" \"I'll be back soon. I've been sleeping here, you know,\" she announced, proud of herself. \"Oh, Mom, you don't have to do that! You can sleep at home \u2014 I'll never notice.\" The swirl of painkillers in my brain was making it hard to concentrate even now, though, apparently, I'd been sleeping for days. \"I was too nervous,\" she admitted sheepishly. \"There's been some crime in the \u00a0neighborhood, and I don't like being there alone.\" \"Crime?\" I asked in alarm. \"Someone broke into that dance studio around the corner from the house and burned it to the ground \u2014 there's nothing left at all! And they left a stolen car right out front. Do you remember when you used to dance there, honey?\" \"I remember.\" I shivered, and winced. \"I can stay, baby, if you need me.\" \"No, Mom, I'll be fine. Edward will be with me.\" She looked like that might be why she wanted to stay. \"I'll be back tonight.\" It sounded as much like a warning as it sounded like a promise, and she glanced at Edward again as she said it. \"I love you, Mom.\" \"I love you, too, Bella. Try to be more careful when you walk, honey, I don't want to lose you.\" Edward's eyes stayed closed, but a wide grin flashed across his face. A nurse came bustling in then to check all my tubes and wires. My mother kissed my forehead, patted my gauze-wrapped hand, and left. The nurse was checking the paper readout on my heart monitor. \"Are you feeling anxious, honey? Your heart rate got a little high there.\" \"I'm fine,\" I assured her. \"I'll tell your RN that you're awake. She'll be in to see you in a minute.\" As soon as she closed the door, Edward was at my side. \"You stole a car?\" I raised my eyebrows. He smiled, unrepentant. \"It was a good car, very fast.\" \"How was your nap?\" I asked. \"Interesting.\" His eyes narrowed. \"What?\" He looked down while he answered. \"I'm surprised. I thought Florida\u2026 and your mother\u2026 well, I thought that's what you would want.\" I stared at him uncomprehendingly. \"But you'd be stuck inside all day in Florida. You'd only be able to come out at night, just like a real vampire.\" He almost smiled, but not quite. And then his face was grave. \"I would stay in Forks, Bella. Or somewhere like it,\" he explained. \"Someplace where I couldn't hurt you anymore.\" It didn't sink in at first. I continued to stare at him blankly as the words one by one clicked into place in my head like a ghastly puzzle. I was barely conscious of the sound of my heart accelerating, though, as my breathing became hyperventilation, I was aware of the sharp aching in my protesting ribs. He didn't say anything; he watched my face warily as the pain that had nothing to do with broken bones, pain that was infinitely worse, threatened to crush me. And then another nurse walked purposefully into the room. Edward sat still as stone as she took in my expression with a practiced eye before turning to the monitors. \"Time for more pain meds, sweetheart?\" she asked kindly, tapping the IV feed. \"No, no,\" I mumbled, trying to keep the agony out of my voice. \"I don't need anything.\" I couldn't afford to close my eyes now. \"No need to be brave, honey. It's better if you don't get too stressed out; you need to rest.\" She waited, but I just shook my head. \"Okay,\" she sighed. \"Hit the call button when you're ready.\" She gave Edward a stern look, and threw one more anxious glance at the machinery, before leaving. His cool hands were on my face; I stared at him with wild eyes. \"Shhh, Bella, calm down.\" \"Don't leave me,\" I begged in a broken voice. \"I won't,\" he promised. \"Now relax before I call the nurse back to sedate you.\" But my heart couldn't slow. \"Bella.\" He stroked my face anxiously. \"I'm not going anywhere. I'll be right here as long as you need me.\" \"Do you swear you won't leave me?\" I whispered. I tried to control the gasping, at least. My ribs were throbbing. He put his hands on either side of my face and brought his face close to mine. His eyes were wide and serious. \"I swear.\" The smell of his breath was soothing. It seemed to ease the ache of my breathing. He continued to hold my gaze while my body slowly relaxed and the beeping returned to a normal pace. His eyes were dark, closer to black than gold today. \"Better?\" he asked. \"Yes,\" I said cautiously. He shook his head and muttered something unintelligible. I thought I picked out the word \"overreaction.\" \"Why did you say that?\" I whispered, trying to keep my voice from shaking. \"Are you tired of having to save me all the time? Do you want me to go away?\" \"No, I don't want to be without you, Bella, of course not. Be rational.  And I have no problem with saving you, either \u2014 if it weren't for the fact that I was the one putting you in danger\u2026 that I'm the reason that you're here.\" \"Yes, you are the reason.\" I frowned. \"The reason I'm here \u2014 alive.\" \"Barely.\" His voice was just a whisper. \"Covered in gauze and plaster and hardly able to move.\" \"I wasn't referring to my most recent near-death experience,\" I said, growing irritated. \"I was thinking of the others \u2014 you can take your pick. If it weren't for you, I would be rotting away in the Forks cemetery.\" He winced at my words, but the haunted look didn't leave his eyes. \"That's not the worst part, though,\" he continued to whisper. He acted as if I hadn't spoken. \"Not seeing you there on the floor\u2026 crumpled and broken.\" His voice was choked. \"Not thinking I was too late. Not even hearing you scream in pain \u2014 all those unbearable memories that I'll carry with me for the rest of eternity. No, the very worst was feeling\u2026 knowing that I couldn't stop. Believing that I was going to kill you myself.\" \"But you didn't.\" \"I could have. So easily.\" I knew I needed to stay calm\u2026 but he was trying to talk himself into leaving me, and the panic fluttered in my lungs, trying to get out.  \"Promise me,\" I whispered. \"What?\" \"You know what.\" I was starting to get angry now. He was so stubbornly determined to dwell on the negative. He heard the change in my tone. His eyes tightened. \"I don't seem to be strong enough to stay away from you, so I suppose that you'll get your way\u2026 whether it kills you or not,\" he added roughly. \"Good.\" He hadn't promised, though \u2014 a fact that I had not missed. The panic was only barely contained; I had no strength left to control the anger. \"You told me how you stopped\u2026 now I want to know why,\" I demanded. \"Why?\" he repeated warily. \"Why you did it. Why didn't you just let the venom spread? By now I would be just like you.\" Edward's eyes seemed to turn flat black, and I remembered that this was something he'd never intended me to know. Alice must have been preoccupied by the things she'd learned about herself\u2026 or she'd been very careful with her thoughts around him \u2014 clearly, he'd had no idea that she'd filled me in on the mechanics of vampire conversions. He was surprised, and infuriated. His nostrils flared, his mouth looked as if it was chiseled from stone. He wasn't going to answer, that much was clear. \"I'll be the first to admit that I have no experience with relationships,\" I said. \"But it just seems logical\u2026 a man and woman have to be somewhat equal\u2026 as in, one of them can't always be swooping in and saving the other one. They have to save each other equally.\" He folded his arms on the side of my bed and rested his chin on his arms. His expression was smooth, the anger reined in. Evidently he'd decided he wasn't angry with me. I hoped I'd get a chance to warn Alice before he caught up with her. \"You have saved me,\" he said quietly. \"I can't always be Lois Lane,\" I insisted. \"I want to be Superman, too.\" \"You don't know what you're asking.\" His voice was soft; he stared intently at the edge of the pillowcase. \"I think I do.\" \"Bella, you don't know. I've had almost ninety years to think about this, and I'm still not sure.\" \"Do you wish that Carlisle hadn't saved you?\" \"No, I don't wish that.\" He paused before continuing. \"But my life was over. I wasn't giving anything up.\" \"You are my life. You're the only thing it would hurt me to lose.\" I was getting better at this. It was easy to admit how much I needed him. He was very calm, though. Decided. \"I can't do it, Bella. I won't do that to you.\" \"Why not?\" My throat rasped and the words weren't as loud as I'd meant them to be. \"Don't tell me it's too hard! After today, or I guess it was a few days ago\u2026 anyway, after that, it should be nothing.\" He glared at me. \"And the pain?\" he asked. I blanched. I couldn't help it. But I tried to keep my expression from showing how clearly I remembered the feeling\u2026 the fire in my veins. \"That's my problem,\" I said. \"I can handle it.\" \"It's possible to take bravery to the point where it becomes insanity.\" \"It's not an issue. Three days. Big deal.\" Edward grimaced again as my words reminded him that I was more informed than he had ever intended me to be. I watched him repress the anger, watched as his eyes grew speculative. \"Charlie?\" he asked curtly. \"Ren\u00e9e?\" Minutes passed in silence as I struggled to answer his question. I opened my mouth, but no sound came out. I closed it again. He waited, and his expression became triumphant because he knew I had no true answer. \"Look, that's not an issue either,\" I finally muttered; my voice was as unconvincing as it always was when I lied. \"Ren\u00e9e has always made the choices that work for her \u2014 she'd want me to do the same. And Charlie's resilient, he's used to being on his own. I can't take care of them forever. I have my own life to live.\" \"Exactly,\" he snapped. \"And I won't end it for you.\" \"If you're waiting for me to be on my deathbed, I've got news for you! I was just there!\" \"You're going to recover,\" he reminded me. I took a deep breath to calm myself, ignoring the spasm of pain it triggered. I stared at him, and he stared back. There was no compromise in his face. \"No,\" I said slowly. \"I'm not.\" His forehead creased. \"Of course you are. You may have a scar or two\u2026\" \"You're wrong,\" I insisted. \"I'm going to die.\" \"Really, Bella.\" He was anxious now. \"You'll be out of here in a few days. Two week at most.\" I glared at him. \"I may not die now\u2026 but I'm going to die sometime. Every minute of the day, I get closer. And I'm going to get old.\" He frowned as what I was saying sunk in, pressing his long fingers to his temples and closing his eyes. \"That's how it's supposed to happen. How it should happen. How it would have happened if I didn't exist \u2014 and I shouldn't exist.\" I snorted. He opened his eyes in surprise. \"That's stupid. That's like going to someone who's just won the lottery, taking their money, and saying, 'Look, let's just go back to how things should be. It's better that way.' And I'm not buying it.\" \"I'm hardly a lottery prize,\" he growled. \"That's right. You're much better.\" He rolled his eyes and set his lips. \"Bella, we're not having this discussion anymore. I refuse to damn you to an eternity of night and that's the end of it.\" \"If you think that's the end, then you don't know me very well,\" I warned him. \"You're not the only vampire I know.\" His eyes went black again. \"Alice wouldn't dare.\" And for a moment he looked so frightening that I couldn't help but believe it \u2014 I couldn't imagine someone brave enough to cross him. \"Alice already saw it, didn't she?\" I guessed. \"That's why the things she says upset you. She knows I'm going to be like you\u2026 someday.\" \"She's wrong. She also saw you dead, but that didn't happen, either.\" \"You'll never catch me betting against Alice.\" We stared at each other for a very long time. It was quiet except for the whirring of the machines, the beeping, the dripping, the ticking of the big clock on the wall. Finally, his expression softened. \"So where does that leave us?\" I wondered. He chuckled humorlessly. \"I believe it's called an impasse.\" I sighed. \"Ouch,\" I muttered. \"How are you feeling?\" he asked, eyeing the button for the nurse. \"I'm fine,\" I lied. \"I don't believe you,\" he said gently. \"I'm not going back to sleep.\" \"You need rest. All this arguing isn't good for you.\" \"So give in,\" I hinted. \"Nice try.\" He reached for the button. \"No!\" He ignored me. \"Yes?\" the speaker on the wall squawked. \"I think we're ready for more pain medication,\" he said calmly, ignoring my furious expression. \"I'll send in the nurse.\" The voice sounded very bored. \"I won't take it,\" I promised. He looked toward the sack of fluids hanging beside my bed. \"I don't think they're going to ask you to swallow anything.\" My heart rate started to climb. He read the fear in my eyes, and sighed in frustration. \"Bella, you're in pain. You need to relax so you can heal. Why are you being so difficult?  They're not going to put any more needles in you now.\" \"I'm not afraid of the needles,\" I mumbled. \"I'm afraid to close my eyes.\" Then he smiled his crooked smile, and took my face between his hands. \"I told you I'm not going anywhere. Don't be afraid. As long as it makes you happy, I'll be here.\" I smiled back, ignoring the ache in my cheeks. \"You're talking about forever, you know.\" \"Oh, you'll get over it \u2014 it's just a crush.\" I shook my head in disbelief\u2014 it made me dizzy. \"I was shocked when Ren\u00e9e swallowed that one. I know you know better.\" \"That's the beautiful thing about being human,\" he told me. \"Things change.\" My eyes narrowed. \"Don't hold your breath.\" He was laughing when the nurse came in, brandishing a syringe. \"Excuse me,\" she said brusquely to Edward. He got up and crossed to the end of the small room, leaning against the wall. He folded his arms and waited. I kept my eyes on him, still apprehensive. He met my gaze calmly. \"Here you go, honey.\" The nurse smiled as she injected the medicine into my tube. \"You'll feel better now.\" \"Thanks,\" I mumbled, unenthusiastic. It didn't take long. I could feel the drowsiness trickling through my bloodstream almost immediately. \"That ought to do it,\" she muttered as my eyelids drooped. She must have left the room, because something cold and smooth touched my face. \"Stay.\" The word was slurred. \"I will,\" he promised. His voice was beautiful, like a lullaby. \"Like I said, as long as it makes you happy\u2026 as long as it's what's best for you.\" I tried to shake my head, but it was too heavy. \"S not the same thing,\" I mumbled. He laughed. \"Don't worry about that now, Bella. You can argue with me when you wake up.\" I think I smiled. '\"Kay.\" I could feel his lips at my ear. \"I love you,\" he whispered. \"Me, too.\" \"I know,\" he laughed quietly. I turned my head slightly\u2026 searching. He knew what I was after. His lips touched mine gently. \"Thanks,\" I sighed. \"Anytime.\" I wasn't really there at all anymore. But I fought against the stupor weakly. There was just one more thing I wanted to tell him. \"Edward?\" I struggled to pronounce his name clearly. \"Yes?\" \"I'm betting on Alice,\" I mumbled. And then the night closed over me.",

            "en": "4         4. WAKING UP TIME PASSES. EVEN WHEN IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE. EVEN when each tick of the second hand aches like the pulse of blood behind a bruise. It passes unevenly, in strange lurches and dragging lulls, but pass it does. Even for me. CHARLIE'S FIST CAME DOWN ON THE TABLE. \"THAT'S IT, Bella! I'm sending you home.\" I looked up from my cereal, which I was pondering rather than eating, and stared at Charlie in shock. I hadn't been following the conversation\u2014actually, I hadn't been aware that we were having a conversation\u2014and I wasn't sure what he meant. \"I am home,\" I mumbled, confused. \"I'm sending you to Renee, to <em>Jacksonville</em>,\" he clarified. Charlie watched with exasperation as I slowly grasped the meaning of his words. \"What did I do?\" I felt my face crumple. It was so unfair. My behavior had been above reproach for the past four months. After that first week, which neither of us ever mentioned, I hadn't missed a day of school or work. My grades were perfect. I never broke curfew\u2014I never went anywhere from which to break curfew in the first place. I only very rarely served leftovers. Charlie was scowling. \"You didn't do anything. That's the problem. You never do anything.\" \"You want me to get into trouble?\" I wondered, my eyebrows pulling together in mystification. I made an effort to pay attention. It wasn't easy. I was so used to tuning everything out, my ears felt stopped up. \"Trouble would be better than this\u2026 this moping around all the time!\" That stung a bit. I'd been careful to avoid all forms of moroseness, moping included. \"I am not moping around.\" \"Wrong word,\" he grudgingly conceded. \"Moping would be better\u2014that would be doing something. You're just\u2026 lifeless, Bella. I think that's the word I want.\" This accusation struck home. I sighed and tried to put some animation into my response. \"I'm sorry, Dad.\" My apology sounded a little flat, even to me. I'd thought I'd been fooling him. Keeping Charlie from suffering was the whole point of all this effort. How depressing to think that the effort had been wasted. \"I don't want you to apologize.\" I sighed. \"Then tell me what you do want me to do.\" \"Bella,\" he hesitated, scrutinizing my reaction to his next words. \"Honey, you're not the first person to go through this kind of thing, you know.\" \"I know that.\" My accompanying grimace was limp and unimpressive. .  \"Listen, honey. I think that\u2014that maybe you need some help.\" \"Help?\" He paused, searching for the words again. \"When your mother left,\" he began, frowning, \"and took you with her.\" He inhaled deeply. \"Well, that was a really bad time for me.\" \"I know, Dad,\" I mumbled. \"But I handled it,\" he pointed out. \"Honey, you're not handling it. I waited, I hoped it would get better.\" He stared at me and I looked down quickly. \"I think we both know it's not getting better.\" \"I'm fine.\" He ignored me. \"Maybe, well, maybe if you talked to someone about it. A professional.\" \"You want me to see a shrink?\" My voice was a shade sharper as I realized what he was getting at. \"Maybe it would help.\" \"And maybe it wouldn't help one little bit.\" I didn't know much about psychoanalysis, but I was pretty sure that it didn't work unless the subject was relatively honest. Sure, I could tell the truth\u2014if I wanted to spend the rest of my life in a padded cell. He examined my obstinate expression, and switched to another line of attack. \"It's beyond me, Bella. Maybe your mother\" \"Look,\" I said in a flat voice. \"I'll go out tonight, if you want. I'll call Jess or Angela.\" \"That's not what I want,\" he argued, frustrated. \"I don't think I can live through seeing you try harder. I've never seen anyone trying so hard. It hurts to watch.\" I pretended to be dense, looking down at the table. \"I don't understand, Dad. First you're mad because I'm not doing anything, and then you say you don't want me to go out.\" \"I want you to be happy\u2014no, not even that much. I just want you not to be miserable. I think you'll have a better chance if you get out of Forks.\" My eyes flashed up with the first small spark of feeling I'd had in too long to contemplate. \"I'm not leaving,\" I said. \"Why not?\" he demanded. \"I'm in my last semester of school\u2014it would screw everything up.\" \"You're a good student\u2014you'll figure it out.\" \"I don't want to crowd Mom and Phil.\" \"Your mother's been dying to have you back.\" \"Florida is too hot.\" His fist came down on the table again. \"We both know what's really going on here, Bella, and it's not good for you.\" He took a deep breath. \"It's been months. No calls, no letters, no contact. You can't keep waiting for him.\" I glowered at him. The heat almost, but not quite, reached my face. It had been a long time since I'd blushed with any emotion. This whole subject was utterly forbidden, as he was well aware. \"I'm not waiting for anything. I don't expect anything,\" I said in a low monotone. \"Bella\u2014,\" Charlie began, his voice thick. \"I have to get to school,\" I interrupted, standing up and yanking my untouched breakfast from the table. I dumped my bowl in the sink without pausing to wash it out. I couldn't deal with any more conversation. \"I'll make plans with Jessica,\" I called over my shoulder as I strapped on my school bag, not meeting his eyes. \"Maybe I won't be home for dinner. We'll go to Port Angeles and watch a movie.\" I was out the front door before he could react. In my haste to get away from Charlie, I ended up being one of the first ones to school. The plus side was that I got a really good parking spot. The downside was that I had free time on my hands, and I tried to avoid free time at all costs. Quickly, before I could start thinking about Charlie's accusations, I pulled out my Calculus book. I flipped it open to the section we should be starting today, and tried to make sense of it. Reading math was even worse than listening to it, but I was getting better at it. In the last several months, I'd spent ten times the amount of time on Calculus than I'd ever spent on math before. As a result, I was managing to keep in the range of a low A. I knew Mr. Varner felt my improvement was all due to his superior teaching methods. And if that made him happy, I wasn't going to burst his bubble. I forced myself to keep at it until the parking lot was full, and I ended up rushing to English. We were working on Animal Farm, an easy subject matter. I didn't mind communism; it was a welcome change from the exhausting romances that made up most of the curriculum. I settled into my seat, pleased by the distraction of Mr. Berty's lecture. Time moved easily while I was in school. The bell rang all too soon. I started repacking my bag. \"Bella?\" I recognized Mike's voice, and I knew what his next words would be before he said them. \"Are you working tomorrow?\" I looked up. He was leaning across the aisle with an anxious expression. Every Friday he asked me the same question. Never mind that I hadn't taken so much as a sick day. Well, with one exception, months ago. But he had no reason to look at me with such concern. I was a model employee. \"Tomorrow is Saturday, isn't it?\" I said. Having just had it pointed out to me by Charlie, I realized how lifeless my voice really sounded. \"Yeah, it is,\" he agreed. \"See you in Spanish.\" He waved once before turning his back. He didn't bother walking me to class anymore. I trudged off to Calculus with a grim expression. This was the class where I sat next to Jessica. It had been weeks, maybe months, since Jess had even greeted me when I passed her in the hall. I knew I had offended her with my antisocial behavior, and she was sulking. It wasn't going to be easy to talk to her now\u2014especially to ask her to do me a favor. I weighed my options carefully as I loitered outside the classroom, procrastinating. I wasn't about to face Charlie again without some kind of social interaction to report. I knew I couldn't lie, though the thought of driving to Port Angeles and back alone\u2014being sure my odometer reflected the correct mileage, just in case he checked\u2014was very tempting. Jessica's mom was the biggest gossip in town, and Charlie was bound to run into Mrs. Stanley sooner rather than later. When he did, he would no doubt mention the trip. Lying was out. With a sigh, I shoved the door open. Mr. Varner gave me a dark look\u2014he'd already started the lecture. I hurried to my seat. Jessica didn't look up as I sat next to her. I was glad that I had fifty minutes to mentally prepare myself. This class flew by even faster than English. A small part of that speed was due to my goody-goody preparation this morning in the truck\u2014but mostly it stemmed from the fact that time always sped up when I was looking forward to something unpleasant. I grimaced when Mr. Varner dismissed the class five minutes early. He smiled like he was being nice.  \"Jess?\" My nose wrinkled as I cringed, waiting for her to turn on me. She twisted in her seat to face me, eyeing me incredulously. \"Are you talking to me, Bella?\" \"Of course.\" I widened my eyes to suggest innocence. \"What? Do you need help with Calculus?\" Her tone was a tad sour. \"No.\" I shook my head. \"Actually, I wanted to know if you would\u2026 go to the movies with me tonight? I really need a girls' night out.\" The words sounded stiff, like badly delivered lines, and she looked suspicious. \"Why are you asking me?\" she asked, still unfriendly. \"You're the first person I think of when I want girl time.\" I smiled, and I hoped the smile looked genuine. It was probably true. She was at least the first person I thought of when I wanted to avoid Charlie. It amounted to the same thing. She seemed a little mollified. \"Well, I don't know.\" \"Do you have plans?\" \"No\u2026 I guess I can go with you. What do you want to see?\" \"I'm not sure what's playing,\" I hedged. This was the tricky part. I racked my brain for a clue\u2014hadn't I heard someone talk about a movie recently? Seen a poster? \"How about that one with the female president?\" She looked at me oddly. \"Bella, that one's been out of the theater forever.\" \"Oh.\" I frowned. \"Is there anything you'd like to see?\" Jessica's natural bubbliness started to leak out in spite of herself as she thought out loud. \"Well, there's that new romantic comedy that's getting great reviews. I want to see that one. And my dad just saw Dead End and he really liked it.\" I grasped at the promising title. \"What's that one about?\" \"Zombies or something. He said it was the scariest thing he'd seen in years.\" \"That sounds perfect.\" I'd rather deal with real zombies than watch a romance. \"Okay.\" She seemed surprised by my response. I tried to remember if I liked scary movies, but I wasn't sure. \"Do you want me to pick you up after school?\" she offered. \"Sure.\" Jessica smiled at me with tentative friendliness before she left. My answering smile was just a little late, but I thought that she saw it. The rest of the day passed quickly, my thoughts focused on planning for tonight. I knew from experience that once I got Jessica talking, I would be able to get away with a few mumbled responses at the appropriate moments. Only minimal interaction would be required. The thick haze that blurred my days now was sometimes confusing. I was surprised when I found myself in my room, not clearly remembering the drive home from school or even opening the front door. But that didn't matter. Losing track of time was the most I asked from life. I didn't fight the haze as I turned to my closet. The numbness was more essential in some places than in others. I barely registered what I was looking at as I slid the door aside to reveal the pile of rubbish on the left side of my closet, under the clothes I never wore. My eyes did not stray toward the black garbage bag that held my present from that last birthday, did not see the shape of the stereo where it strained against the black plastic; I didn't think of the bloody mess my nails had been when I'd finished clawing it out of the dashboard. I yanked the old purse I rarely used off the nail it hung from, and shoved the door shut. Just then I heard a horn honking. I swiftly traded my wallet from my schoolbag into the purse. I was in a hurry, as if rushing would somehow make the night pass more quickly. I glanced at myself in the hall mirror before I opened the door, arranging my features carefully into a smile and trying to hold them there. \"Thanks for coming with me tonight,\" I told Jess as I climbed into the passenger seat, trying to infuse my tone with gratitude. It had been a while since I'd really thought about what I was saying to anyone besides Charlie. Jess was harder. I wasn't sure which were the right emotions to fake. \"Sure. So, what brought this on?\" Jess wondered as she drove down my street. \"Brought what on?\" \"Why did you suddenly decide\u2026 to go out?\" It sounded like she changed her question halfway through. I shrugged. \"Just needed a change.\" I recognized the song on the radio then, and quickly reached for the dial. \"Do you mind?\" I asked. \"No, go ahead.\" I scanned through the stations until I found one that was harmless. I peeked at Jess's expression as the new music filled the car. Her eyes squinted. \"Since when do you listen to rap?\" \"I don't know,\" I said. \"A while.\" \"You like this?\" she asked doubtfully. \"Sure.\" It would be much too hard to interact with Jessica normally if I had to work to tune out the music, too. I nodded my head, hoping I was in time with the beat. \"Okay\u2026\" She stared out the windshield with wide eyes. \"So what's up with you and Mike these days?\" I asked quickly. \"You see him more than I do.\" The question hadn't started her talking like I'd hoped it would. \"It's hard to talk at work,\" I mumbled, and then I tried again. \"Have you been out with anyone lately?\" \"Not really. I go out with Conner sometimes. I went out with Eric two weeks ago.\" She rolled her eyes, and I sensed a long story. I clutched at the opportunity. \"Eric Yorkie? Who asked who?\" She groaned, getting more animated. \"He did, of course! I couldn't think of a nice way to say no.\" \"Where did he take you?\" I demanded, knowing she would interpret my eagerness as interest. \"Tell me all about it.\" She launched into her tale, and I settled into my seat, more comfortable now. I paid strict attention, murmuring in sympathy and gasping in horror as called for. When she was finished with her Eric story, she continued into a Conner comparison without any prodding. The movie was playing early, so Jess thought we should hit the twilight showing and eat later. I was happy to go along with whatever she wanted; after all, I was getting what I wanted\u2014Charlie off my back. I kept Jess talking through the previews, so I could ignore them more easily. But I got nervous when the movie started. A young couple was walking along a beach, swinging hands and discussing their mutual affection with gooey falseness. I resisted the urge to cover my ears and start humming. I had not bargained for a romance. \"I thought we picked the zombie movie,\" I hissed to Jessica. \"This is the zombie movie.\" \"Then why isn't anyone getting eaten?\" I asked desperately. She looked at me with wide eyes that were almost alarmed. \"I'm sure that part's coming,\" she whispered. \"I'm getting popcorn. Do you want any?\" \"No, thanks.\" Someone shushed us from behind. I took my time at the concession counter, watching the clock and debating what percentage of a ninety-minute movie could be spent on romantic exposition. I decided ten minutes was more than enough, but I paused just inside the theater doors to be sure. I could hear horrified screams blaring from the speakers, so I knew I'd waited long enough. \"You missed everything,\" Jess murmured when I slid back into my seat. \"Almost everyone is a zombie now.\" \"Long line.\" I offered her some popcorn. She took a handful. The rest of the movie was comprised of gruesome zombie attacks and endless screaming from the handful of people left alive, their numbers dwindling quickly. I would have thought there was nothing in that to disturb me. But I felt uneasy, and I wasn't sure why at first. It wasn't until almost the very end, as I watched a haggard zombie shambling after the last shrieking survivor, that I realized what the problem was. The scene kept cutting between the horrified face of the heroine, and the dead, emotionless face of her pursuer, back and forth as it closed the distance. And I realized which one resembled me the most. I stood up. \"Where are you going? There's, like, two minutes left,\" Jess hissed. \"I need a drink,\" I muttered as I raced for the exit. I sat down on the bench outside the theater door and tried very hard not to think of the irony. But it was ironic, all things considered, that, in the end, I would wind up as a zombie. I hadn't seen that one coming. Not that I hadn't dreamed of becoming a mythical monster once\u2014just never a grotesque, animated corpse. I shook my head to dislodge that train of thought, feeling panicky. I couldn't afford to think about what I'd once dreamed of. It was depressing to realize that I wasn't the heroine anymore, that my story was over. Jessica came out of the theater doors and hesitated, probably wondering where the best place was to search for me. When she saw me, she looked relieved, but only for a moment. Then she looked irritated. \"Was the movie too scary for you?\" she wondered. \"Yeah,\" I agreed. \"I guess I'm just a coward.\" \"That's funny.\" She frowned. \"I didn't think you were scared\u2014I was screaming all the time, but I didn't hear you scream once. So I didn't know why you left.\" I shrugged. \"Just scared.\" She relaxed a little. \"That was the scariest movie I think I've ever seen. I'll bet we're going to have nightmares tonight.\" \"No doubt about that,\" I said, trying to keep my voice normal. It was inevitable that I would have nightmares, but they wouldn't be about zombies. Her eyes flashed to my face and away. Maybe I hadn't succeeded with the normal voice. \"Where do you want to eat?\" Jess asked. \"I don't care.\" \"Okay.\" Jess started talking about the male lead in the movie as we walked. I nodded as she gushed over his hotness, unable to remember seeing a non-zombie man at all. I didn't watch where Jessica was leading me. I was only vaguely aware that it was dark and quieter now. It took me longer than it should have to realize why it was quiet. Jessica had stopped babbling. I looked at her apologetically, hoping I hadn't hurt her feelings. Jessica wasn't looking at me. Her face was tense; she stared straight ahead and walked fast. As I watched, her eyes darted quickly to the right, across the road, and back again. I glanced around myself for the first time. We were on a short stretch of unlit sidewalk. The little shops lining the street were all locked up for the night, windows black. Half a block ahead, the streetlights started up again, and I could see, farther down, the bright golden arches of the McDonald's she was heading for. Across the street there was one open business. The windows were covered from inside and there were neon signs, advertisements for different brands of beer, glowing in front of them. The biggest sign, in brilliant green, was the name of the bar\u2014One-Eyed Pete's. I wondered if there was some pirate theme not visible from outside. The metal door was propped open; it was dimly lit inside, and the low murmur of many voices and the sound of ice clinking in glasses floated across the street. Lounging against the wall beside the door were four men. I glanced back at Jessica. Her eyes were fixed on the path ahead and she moved briskly. She didn't look frightened\u2014just wary, trying to not attract attention to herself. I paused without thinking, looking back at the four men with a strong sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. This was a different road, a different night, but the scene was so much the same. One of them was even short and dark. As I stopped and turned toward them, that one looked up in interest.  I stared back at him, frozen on the sidewalk. \"Bella?\" Jess whispered. \"What are you doing?\" I shook my head, not sure myself. \"I think I know them\u2026\" I muttered. What was I doing? I should be running from this memory as fast as I could, blocking the image of the four lounging men from my mind, protecting myself with the numbness I couldn't function without. Why was I stepping, dazed, into the street? It seemed too coincidental that I should be in Port Angeles with Jessica, on a dark street even. My eyes focused on the short one, trying to match the features to my memory of the man who had threatened me that night almost a year ago. I wondered if there was any way I would recognize the man, if it was really him. That particular part of that particular evening was just a blur. My body remembered it better than my mind did; the tension in my legs as I tried to decide whether to run or to stand my ground, the dryness in my throat as I struggled to build a decent scream, the tight stretch of skin across my knuckles as I clenched my hands into fists, the chills on the back of my neck when the dark-haired man called me \"sugar.\"\u2026 There was an indefinite, implied kind of menace to these men that had nothing to do with that other night. It sprung from the fact that they were strangers, and it was dark here, and they outnumbered us\u2014nothing more specific than that. But it was enough that Jessica's voice cracked in panic as she called after me. \"Bella, come on!\" I ignored her, walking slowly forward without ever making the conscious decision to move my feet. I didn't understand why, but the nebulous threat the men presented drew me toward them. It was a senseless impulse, but I hadn't felt any kind of impulse in so long\u2026 I followed it. Something unfamiliar beat through my veins. Adrenaline, I realized, long absent from my system, drumming my pulse faster and fighting against the lack of sensation. It was strange\u2014why the adrenaline when there was no fear? It was almost as if it were an echo of the last time I'd stood like this, on a dark street in Port Angeles with strangers. I saw no reason for fear. I couldn't imagine anything in the world that there was left to be afraid of, not physically at least. One of the few advantages of losing everything. I was halfway across the street when Jess caught up to me and grabbed my arm. \"Bella! You can't go in a bar!\" she hissed. \"I'm not going in,\" I said absently, shaking her hand off. \"I just want to see something\u2026\" \"Are you crazy?\" she whispered. \"Are you suicidal?\" That question caught my attention, and my eyes focused on her. \"No, I'm not.\" My voice sounded defensive, but it was true. I wasn't suicidal. Even in the beginning, when death unquestionably would have been a relief, I didn't consider it. I owed too much to Charlie. I felt too responsible for Renee. I had to think of them. And I'd made a promise not to do anything stupid or reckless. For all those reasons, I was still breathing. Remembering that promise. I felt a twinge of guilt.\u00a0 But what I was doing fight now didn't really count. It wasn't like I was taking a blade to my wrists. Jess's eyes were round, her mouth hung open. Her question about suicide had been rhetorical, I realized too late. \"Go eat,\" I encouraged her, waving toward the fast food. I didn't like the way she looked at me. \"I'll catch up in a minute.\" I turned away from her, back to the men who were watching us with amused, curious eyes. \"Bella, stop this right now!\" My muscles locked into place, froze me where I stood. Because it wasn't Jessica's voice that rebuked me now. It was a furious voice, a familiar voice, a beautiful voice\u2014soft like velvet even though it was irate. It was his voice\u2014I was exceptionally careful not to think his name\u2014and I was surprised that the sound of it did not knock me to my knees, did not curl me onto the pavement in a torture of loss. But there was no pain, none at all. In the instant that I heard his voice, everything was very clear. Like my head had\u00a0 suddenly surfaced out of some dark pool. I was more aware of everything\u2014sight, sound, the feel of the cold air that I hadn't noticed was blowing sharply against my face, the smells coming from the open bar door. I looked around myself in shock. \"Go back to Jessica,\" the lovely voice ordered, still angry. \"You promised\u2014nothing stupid.\" I was alone. Jessica stood a few feet from me, staring at me with frightened eyes. Against the wall, the strangers watched, confused, wondering what I was doing, standing there motionless in the middle of the street. I shook my head, trying to understand. I knew he wasn't there, and yet, he felt improbably close, close for the first time since\u2026 since the end. The anger in his voice was concern, the same anger that was once very familiar\u2014something I hadn't heard in what felt like a lifetime. \"Keep your promise.\" The voice was slipping away, as if the volume was being turned down on a radio. I began to suspect that I was having some kind of hallucination. Triggered, no doubt, by the memory\u2014the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, the strange familiarity of the situation. I ran through the possibilities quickly in my head. Option one: I was crazy. That was the layman's term for people who heard voices in their heads. Possible. Option two: My subconscious mind was giving me what it thought I wanted. This was wish fulfillment\u2014a momentary relief from pain by embracing the incorrect idea that he cared whether I lived or died. Projecting what he would have said if A) he were here, and B) he would be in any way bothered by something bad happening to me. Probable. I could see no option three, so I hoped it was the second option and this was just my subconscious running amuck, rather than something I would need to be hospitalized for. My reaction was hardly sane, though\u2014I was grateful. The sound of his voice was something that I'd feared I was losing, and so, more than anything else, I felt overwhelming gratitude that my unconscious mind had held onto that sound better than my conscious one had. I was not allowed to think of him. That was something I tried to be very strict about. Of course I slipped; I was only human. But I was getting better, and so the pain was something I could avoid for days at a time now. The tradeoff was the never-ending numbness. Between pain and nothing, I'd chosen nothing. I waited for the pain now. I was not numb\u2014my senses felt unusually intense after so many months of the haze\u2014but the normal pain held off. The only ache was the disappointment that his voice was fading. There was a second of choice. The wise thing would be to run away from this potentially destructive\u2014and certainly mentally unstable\u2014development. It would be stupid to encourage hallucinations. But his voice was fading. I took another step forward, testing. \"Bella, turn around,\" he growled. I sighed in relief. The anger was what I wanted to hear\u2014false, fabricated evidence that he cared, a dubious gift from my subconscious. Very few seconds had passed while I sorted this all out. My little audience watched, curious. It probably looked like I was just dithering over whether or not I was going to approach them. How could they guess that I was standing there enjoying an unexpected moment of insanity? \"Hi,\" one of the men called, his tone both confident and a bit sarcastic. He was fair-skinned and fair-haired, and he stood with the assurance of someone who thought of himself as quite good-looking. I couldn't tell whether he was or not. I was prejudiced. The voice in my head answered with an exquisite snarl. I smiled, and the confident man seemed to take that as encouragement. \"Can I help you with something? You look lost.\" He grinned and winked. I stepped carefully over the gutter, running with water that was black in the darkness. \"No. I'm not lost.\" Now that I was closer\u2014and my eyes felt oddly in focus\u2014I analyzed the short, dark man's face. It was not familiar in any way. I suffered a curious sensation of disappointment that this was not the terrible man who had tried to hurt me almost a year ago. The voice in my head was quiet now. The short man noticed my stare. \"Can I buy you a drink?\" he offered, nervous, seeming flattered that I'd singled him out to stare at. \"I'm too young,\" I answered automatically. He was baffled\u00a0 \u2014wondering why I had approached them. I felt compelled to explain. \"From across the street, you looked like someone I knew. Sorry, my mistake.\" The threat that had pulled me across the street had evaporated. These were not the dangerous men I remembered. They were probably nice guys. Safe. I lost interest. \"That's okay,\" the confident blonde said. \"Stay and hang out with us.\" \"Thanks, but I can't.\" Jessica was hesitating in the middle of the street, her eyes wide with outrage and betrayal. \"Oh, just a few minutes.\" I shook my head, and turned to rejoin Jessica. \"Let's go eat,\" I suggested, barely glancing at her. Though I appeared to be, for the moment, freed of the zombie abstraction, I was just as distant. My mind was preoccupied. The safe, numb deadness did not come back, and I got more anxious with every minute that passed without its return. \"What were you thinking?\" Jessica snapped. \"You don't know them\u2014they could have been psychopaths!\" I shrugged, wishing she would let it go. \"I just thought I knew the one guy.\" \"You are so odd, Bella Swan. I feel like I don't know who you are.\" \"Sorry.\" I didn't know what else to say to that. We walked to McDonald's in silence. I'd bet that she was wishing we'd taken her car instead of walking the short distance from the theater, so that she could use the drive-through. She was just as anxious now for this evening to be over as I had been from the beginning. I tried to start a conversation a few times while we ate, but Jessica was not cooperative. I must have really offended her. When we go back in the car, she tuned the stereo back to her favorite station and turned the volume too loud to allow easy conversation. I didn't have to struggle as hard as usual to ignore the music. Even though my mind, for once, was not carefully numb and empty, I had too much to think about to hear the lyrics. I waited for the numbness to return, or the pain. Because the pain must be coming. I'd broken my personal rules. Instead of shying away from the memories, I'd walked forward and greeted them. I'd heard his voice, so clearly, in my head. That was going to cost me, I was sure of it. Especially if I couldn't reclaim the haze to protect myself. I felt too alert, and that frightened me. But relief was still the strongest emotion in my body\u2014relief that came from the very core of my being. As much as I struggled not to think of him, I did not struggle to forget. I worried\u2014late in the night, when the exhaustion of sleep deprivation broke down my defenses\u2014that it was all slipping away. That my mind was a sieve, and I would someday not be able to remember the precise color of his eyes, the feel of his cool skin, or the texture of his voice. I could not think of them, but I must remember them. Because there was just one thing that I had to believe to be able to live\u2014I had to know that he existed. That was all. Everything else I could endure. So long as he existed. That's why I was more trapped in Forks than I ever had been before, why I'd fought with Charlie when he suggested a change. Honestly, it shouldn't matter; no one was ever coming back here. But if I were to go to <em>Jacksonville</em>, or anywhere else bright and unfamiliar, how could I be sure he was real? In a place where I could never imagine him, the conviction might fade\u2026 and that I could not live through. Forbidden to remember, terrified to forget; it was a hard line to walk. I was surprised when Jessica stopped the car in front of my house. The ride had not taken long, but, short as it seemed, I wouldn't have thought that Jessica could go that long without speaking. \"Thanks for going out with me, Jess,\" I said as I opened my door. \"That was\u2026fun.\" I hoped that fun was the appropriate word. \"Sure,\" she muttered. \"I'm sorry about\u2026 after the movie.\" \"Whatever, Bella.\" She glared out the windshield instead of looking at me. She seemed to be growing angrier rather than getting over it. \"See you Monday?\" \"Yeah. Bye.\" I gave up and shut the door. She drove away, still without looking at me. I'd forgotten her by the time I was inside. Charlie was waiting for me in the middle of the hall, his arms folded tight over his chest with his hands balled into fists. \"Hey, Dad,\" I said absentmindedly as I ducked around Charlie, heading for the stairs. I'd been thinking about him for too long, and I wanted to be upstairs before it caught up with me. \"Where have you been?\" Charlie demanded. I looked at my dad, surprised. \"I went to a movie in Port Angeles with Jessica. Like I told you this morning.\" \"Humph,\" he grunted. \"Is that okay?\u201d He studied my face, his eyes widening as if he saw something unexpected. \"Yeah, that's fine. Did you have fun?\" \"Sure,\" I said. \"We watched zombies eat people. It was great.\" His eyes narrowed. \"'Night, Dad.\" He let me pass. I hurried to my room. I lay in my bed a few minutes later, resigned as the pain finally made its appearance. It was a crippling thing, this sensation that a huge hole had been punched through my chest, excising my most vital organs and leaving ragged, unhealed gashes around the edges that continued to throb and bleed despite the passage of time. Rationally, I knew my lungs must still be intact, yet I gasped for air and my head spun like my efforts yielded me nothing. My heart must have been beating, too, but I couldn't hear the sound of my pulse in my ears; my hands felt blue with cold. I curled inward, hugging my ribs to hold myself together. I scrambled for my numbness, my denial, but it evaded me. And yet, I found I could survive. I was alert, I felt the pain\u2014the aching loss that radiated out from my chest, sending wracking waves of hurt through my limbs and head\u2014but it was manageable. I could live through it. It didn't feel like the pain had weakened over time, rather that I'd grown strong enough to bear it. Whatever it was that had happened tonight\u2014and whether it was the zombies, the\u00a0 adrenaline, or the hallucinations that were responsible\u2014it had woken me up. For the first time in a long time, I didn't know what to expect in the morning.",

            "en": "3. MOTIVES THE SUN WAS SO DEEPLY BURIED BEHIND THE CLOUDS that there was no way to tell if it had set or not. After the long flight \u2014 chasing the sun westward so that it seemed unmoving in the sky \u2014 it was especially disorienting; time seemed oddly variable. It took me by surprise when the forest gave way to the first buildings, signaling that we were nearly home. \u201cYou\u2019ve been very quiet,\u201d Edward observed. \u201cDid the plane make you sick?\u201d \u201cNo, I\u2019m okay.\u201d \u201cAre you sad to leave?\u201d \u201cMore relieved than sad, I think.\u201d He raised one eyebrow at me. I knew it was useless and \u2014 much as I hated to admit it \u2014 unnecessary to ask him to keep his eyes on the road. \u201cRen\u00e9e is so much more . . .perceptive than Charlie in some ways. It was making me jumpy.\u201d Edward laughed. \u201cYour mother has a very interesting mind. Almost childlike, but very insightful. She sees things differently than other people.\u201d Insightful. It was a good description of my mother \u2014 when she was paying attention. Most of the time Ren\u00e9e was so bewildered by her own life that she didn\u2019t notice much else. But this weekend she\u2019d been paying plenty of attention to me. Phil was busy \u2014 the high school baseball team he coached was in the playoffs \u2014 and being alone with Edward and me had only sharpened Ren\u00e9e\u2019s focus. As soon as the hugs and squeals of delight were out of the way, Ren\u00e9e began to watch. And as she\u2019d watched, her wide blue eyes had become first confused and then concerned. This morning we\u2019d gone for a walk along the beach. She wanted to show off all the beauties of her new home, still hoping, I think, that the sun might lure me away from Forks. She\u2019d also wanted to talk with me alone, and that was easily arranged. Edward had fabricated a term paper to give himself an excuse to stay indoors during the day. In my head, I went through the conversation again. . . . Ren\u00e9e and I ambled along the sidewalk, trying to stay in the range of the infrequent palm tree shadows. Though it was early, the heat was smothering. The air was so heavy with moisture that just breathing in and out was giving my lungs a workout. \u201cBella?\u201d my mother asked, looking out past the sand to the lightly crashing waves as she spoke. \u201cWhat is it, Mom?\u201d She sighed, not meeting my gaze. \u201cI\u2019m worried. . . .\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked, anxious at once. \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not me.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m worried about you . . . and Edward.\u201d Ren\u00e9e finally looked at me when she said his name, her face apologetic. \u201cOh,\u201d I mumbled, fixing my eyes on a pair of joggers as they passed us, drenched with sweat. \u201cYou two are more serious than I\u2019d been thinking,\u201d she went on. I frowned, quickly reviewing the last two days in my head. Edward and I had barely touched \u2014 in front of her, at least. I wondered if Ren\u00e9e was about to give me a lecture on responsibility, too. I didn\u2019t mind that the way I had with Charlie. It wasn\u2019t embarrassing with my mom. After all, I\u2019d been the one giving her that lecture time and time again in the last ten years. \u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s something . . . strange about the way you two are together,\u201d she murmured, her forehead creasing over her troubled eyes. \u201cThe way he watches you \u2014 it\u2019s so . . . protective. Like he\u2019s about to throw himself in front of a bullet to save you or something.\u201d I laughed, though I was still not able to meet her gaze. \u201cThat\u2019s a bad thing?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d She frowned as she struggled for the words. \u201cIt\u2019s just different . He\u2019s very intense about you . . . and very careful. I feel like I don\u2019t really understand your relationship. Like there\u2019s some secret I\u2019m missing. . . .\u201d \u201cI think you\u2019re imagining things, Mom,\u201d I said quickly, struggling to keep my voice light. There was a flutter in my stomach. I\u2019d forgotten how much my mother saw . Something about her simple view of the world cut through all the distractions and pierced right to the truth of things. This had never been a problem before. Until now, there had never been a secret I couldn\u2019t tell her. \u201cIt\u2019s not just him.\u201d She set her lips defensively. \u201cI wish you could see how you move around him.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u00a0\u201cThe way you move \u2014 you orient yourself around him without even thinking about it. When he moves, even a little bit, you adjust your position at the same time. Like magnets . . . or gravity. You\u2019re like a . . . satellite, or something. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d She pursed her lips and stared down. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me,\u201d I teased, forcing a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re reading mysteries again, aren\u2019t you? Or is it sci-fi this time?\u201d Ren\u00e9e flushed a delicate pink. \u201cThat\u2019s beside the point.\u201d \u201cFound anything good?\u201d \u201cWell, there was one \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t matter. We\u2019re talking about you right now.\u201d \u201cYou should stick to romance, Mom. You know how you freak yourself out.\u201d Her lips turned up at the corners. \u201cI\u2019m being silly, aren\u2019t I?\u201d For half a second I couldn\u2019t answer. Ren\u00e9e was so easily swayed. Sometimes it was a good thing, because not all of her ideas were practical. But it pained me to see how quickly she caved in to my trivializing, especially since she was dead right this time. She looked up, and I controlled my expression. \u201cNot silly \u2014 just being a mom.\u201d She laughed and then gestured grandly toward the white sands stretching to the blue water. \u201cAnd all this isn\u2019t enough to get you to move back in with your silly mom?\u201d I wiped my hand dramatically across my forehead, and then pretended to wring my hair out. \u201cYou get used to the humidity,\u201d she promised. \u201cYou can get used to rain, too,\u201d I countered. She elbowed me playfully and then took my hand as we walked back to her car. Other than her worries about me, she seemed happy enough. Content. She still looked at Phil with goo-goo eyes, and that was comforting. Surely her life was full and satisfying. Surely she didn\u2019t miss me that much, even now. . . . Edward\u2019s icy fingers brushed my cheek. I looked up, blinking, coming back to the present. He leaned down and kissed my forehead. \u201cWe\u2019re home, Sleeping Beauty. Time to awake.\u201d We were stopped in front of Charlie\u2019s house. The porch light was on and the cruiser was parked in the driveway. As I examined the house, I saw the curtain twitch in the living room window, flashing a line of yellow light across the dark lawn. I sighed. Of course Charlie was waiting to pounce. Edward must have been thinking the same thing, because his expression was stiff and his eyes remote as he came to get my door for me. \u201cHow bad?\u201d I asked. \u201cCharlie\u2019s not going to be difficult,\u201d Edward promised, his voice level with no hint of humor. \u201cHe missed you.\u201d My eyes narrowed in doubt. If that was the case, then why was Edward tensed as if for a battle? My bag was small, but he insisted on carrying it into the house. Charlie held the door open for us. \u201cWelcome home, kid!\u201d Charlie shouted like he really meant it. \u201cHow was <em>Jacksonville</em>?\u201d \u201cMoist. And buggy.\u201d \u201cSo Ren\u00e9e didn\u2019t sell you on the University of Florida?\u201d \u201cShe tried. But I\u2019d rather drink water than inhale it.\u201d Charlie\u2019s eyes flickered unwillingly to Edward. \u201cDid you have a nice time?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d Edward answered in a serene voice. \u201cRen\u00e9e was very hospitable.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s . . . um, good. Glad you had fun.\u201d Charlie turned away from Edward and pulled me in for an unexpected hug. \u201cImpressive,\u201d I whispered in his ear. He rumbled a laugh. \u201cI really missed you, Bells. The food around here sucks when you\u2019re gone.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll get on it,\u201d I said as he let me go. \u201cWould you call Jacob first? He\u2019s been bugging me every five minutes since six o\u2019clock this morning. I promised I\u2019d have you call him before you even unpacked.\u201d I didn\u2019t have to look at Edward to feel that he was too still, too cold beside me. So this was the cause of his tension. \u201cJacob wants to talk to me?\u201d \u201cPretty bad, I\u2019d say. He wouldn\u2019t tell me what it was about \u2014 just said it was important.\u201d The phone rang then, shrill and demanding. \u201cThat\u2019s him again, I\u2019d bet my next paycheck,\u201d Charlie muttered. \u201cI got it.\u201d I hurried to the kitchen. Edward followed after me while Charlie disappeared into the living room. I grabbed the phone mid-ring, and twisted around so that I was facing the wall. \u201cHello?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re back,\u201d Jacob said. His familiar husky voice sent a wave of wistfulness through me. A thousand memories spun in my head, tangling together \u2014 a rocky beach strewn with driftwood trees, a garage made of plastic sheds, warm sodas in a paper bag, a tiny room with one too-small shabby loveseat. The laughter in his deep-set black eyes, the feverish heat of his big hand around mine, the flash of his white teeth against his dark skin, his face stretching into the wide smile that had always been like a key to a secret door where only kindred spirits could enter. It felt sort of like homesickness, this longing for the place and person who had sheltered me through my darkest night. I cleared the lump from my throat. \u201cYes,\u201d I answered. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call me?\u201d Jacob demanded. His angry tone instantly got my back up. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve been in the house for exactly four seconds and your call interrupted Charlie telling me that you\u2019d called.\u201d \u201cOh. Sorry.\u201d \u201cSure. Now, why are you harassing Charlie?\u201d \u201cI need to talk to you.\u201d \u201cYeah, I figured out that part all by myself. Go ahead.\u201d There was a short pause. \u201cYou going to school tomorrow?\u201d I frowned to myself, unable to make sense of this question. \u201cOf course I am. Why wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d \u201cI dunno. Just curious.\u201d Another pause. \u201cSo what did you want to talk about, Jake?\u201d He hesitated. \u201cNothing really, I guess. I . . . wanted to hear your voice.\u201d \u201cYeah, I know. I\u2019m so glad you called me, Jake. I . . .\u201d But I didn\u2019t know what more to say. I wanted to tell him I was on my way to La Push right now. And I couldn\u2019t tell him that. \u201cI have to go,\u201d he said abruptly. \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you soon, okay?\u201d \u201cBut Jake \u2014\u201d He was already gone. I listened to the dial tone with disbelief. \u201cThat was short,\u201d I muttered. \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d Edward asked. His voice was low and careful. I turned slowly to face him. His expression was perfectly smooth \u2014 impossible to read. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I wonder what that was about.\u201d It didn\u2019t make sense that Jacob had been hounding Charlie all day just to ask me if I was going to school. And if he\u2019d wanted to hear my voice, then why did he hang up so quickly? \u201cYour guess is probably better than mine,\u201d Edward said, the hint of a smile tugging at the corner of his mouth. \u201cMmm,\u201d I murmured. That was true. I knew Jake inside and out. It shouldn\u2019t be that complicated to figure out his motivations. With my thoughts miles away \u2014 about fifteen miles away, up the road to La Push \u2014 I started combing through the fridge, assembling ingredients for Charlie\u2019s dinner. Edward leaned against the counter, and I was distantly aware that his eyes were on my face, but too preoccupied to worry about what he saw there. The school thing seemed like the key to me. That was the only real question Jake had asked. And he had to be after an answer to something, or he wouldn\u2019t have been bugging Charlie so persistently. Why would my attendance record matter to him, though? I tried to think about it in a logical way. So, if I hadn\u2019t been going to school tomorrow, what would be the problem with that, from Jacob\u2019s perspective? Charlie had given me a little grief about missing a day of school so close to finals, but I\u2019d convinced him that one Friday wasn\u2019t going to derail my studies. Jake would hardly care about that. My brain refused to come up with any brilliant insights. Maybe I was missing some vital piece of information. What could have changed in the past three days that was so important that Jacob would break his long streak of refusing to answer my phone calls and contact me? What difference could three days make? I froze in the middle of the kitchen. The package of icy hamburger in my hands slipped through my numb fingers. It took me a slow second to miss the thud it should have made against the floor. Edward had caught it and thrown it onto the counter. His arms were already around me, his lips at my ear. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I shook my head, dazed. Three days could change everything. Hadn\u2019t I just been thinking about how impossible college was? How I couldn\u2019t be anywhere near people after I\u2019d gone through the painful three-day conversion that would set me free from mortality, so that I could spend eternity with Edward? The conversion that would make me forever a prisoner to my own thirst. . . . Had Charlie told Billy that I\u2019d vanished for three days? Had Billy jumped to conclusions? Had Jacob really been asking me if I was still human? Making sure that the werewolves\u2019 treaty was unbroken \u2014 that none of the Cullens had dared to bite a human . . . bite, not kill . . . ? But did he honestly think I would come home to Charlie if that was the case? Edward shook me. \u201cBella?\u201d he asked, truly anxious now. \u201cI think . . . I think he was checking,\u201d I mumbled. \u201cChecking to make sure. That I\u2019m human, I mean.\u201d Edward stiffened, and a low hiss sounded in my ear. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to leave,\u201d I whispered. \u201cBefore. So that it doesn\u2019t break the treaty. We won\u2019t ever be able to come back.\u201d His arms tightened around me. \u201cI know.\u201d \u201cAhem.\u201d Charlie cleared his voice loudly behind us. I jumped, and then pulled free of Edward\u2019s arms, my face getting hot. Edward leaned back against the counter. His eyes were tight. I could see worry in them, and anger. \u00a0\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to make dinner, I can call for a pizza,\u201d Charlie hinted. \u201cNo, that\u2019s okay, I\u2019m already started.\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d Charlie said. He propped himself against the doorframe, folding his arms. I sighed and got to work, trying to ignore my audience. \u201cIf I asked you to do something, would you trust me?\u201d Edward asked, an edge to his soft voice. We were almost to school. Edward had been relaxed and joking just a moment ago, and now suddenly his hands were clenched tight on the steering wheel, his knuckles straining in an effort not to snap it into pieces. I stared at his anxious expression \u2014 his eyes were far away, like he was listening to distant voices. My pulse sped in response to his stress, but I answered carefully. \u201cThat depends.\u201d We pulled into the school lot. \u201cI was afraid you would say that.\u201d \u201cWhat do you want me to do, Edward?\u201d \u201cI want you to stay in the car.\u201d He pulled into his usual spot and turned the engine off as he spoke. \u201cI want you to wait here until I come back for you.\u201d \u201cBut . . .why ?\u201d That was when I saw him. He would have been hard to miss, towering over the students the way he did, even if he hadn\u2019t been leaning against his black motorcycle, parked illegally on the sidewalk. \u201cOh.\u201d Jacob\u2019s face was a calm mask that I recognized well. It was the face he used when he was determined to keep his emotions in check, to keep himself under control. It made him look like Sam, the oldest of the wolves, the leader of the Quileute pack. But Jacob could never quite manage the perfect serenity Sam always exuded. I\u2019d forgotten how much this face bothered me. Though I\u2019d gotten to know Sam pretty well before the Cullens had come back \u2014 to like him, even \u2014 I\u2019d never been able to completely shake the resentment I felt when Jacob mimicked Sam\u2019s expression. It was a stranger\u2019s face. He wasn\u2019t my Jacob when he wore it. \u201cYou jumped to the wrong conclusion last night,\u201d Edward murmured. \u201cHe asked about school because he knew that I would be where you were. He was looking for a safe place to talk to me. A place with witnesses.\u201d So I\u2019d misinterpreted Jacob\u2019s motives last night. Missing information, that was the problem. Information like why in the world Jacob would want to talk to Edward. \u201cI\u2019m not staying in the car,\u201d I said. Edward groaned quietly. \u201cOf course not. Well, let\u2019s get this over with.\u201d Jacob\u2019s face hardened as we walked toward him, hand in hand. I noticed other faces, too \u2014 the faces of my classmates. I noticed how their eyes widened as they took in all six foot seven inches of Jacob\u2019s long body, muscled up the way no normal sixteen-and-a-half-year-old ever had been. I saw those eyes rake over his tight black t-shirt \u2014 short-sleeved, though the day was unseasonably cool \u2014 his ragged, grease-smeared jeans, and the glossy black bike he leaned against. Their eyes didn\u2019t linger on his face \u2014 something about his expression had them glancing quickly away. And I noticed the wide berth everyone gave him, the bubble of space that no one dared to encroach on. With a sense of astonishment, I realized that Jacob looked dangerous to them. How odd. Edward stopped a few yards away from Jacob, and I could tell that he was uncomfortable having me so close to a werewolf. He drew his hand back slightly, pulling me halfway behind his body. \u201cYou could have called us,\u201d Edward said in a steel-hard voice. \u201cSorry,\u201d Jacob answered, his face twisting into a sneer. \u201cI don\u2019t have any leeches on my speed dial.\u201d \u201cYou could have reached me at Bella\u2019s house, of course.\u201d Jacob\u2019s jaw flexed, and his brows pulled together. He didn\u2019t answer. \u201cThis is hardly the place, Jacob. Could we discuss this later?\u201d \u201cSure, sure. I\u2019ll stop by your crypt after school.\u201d Jacob snorted. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with now?\u201d Edward looked around pointedly, his eyes resting on the witnesses who were just barely out of hearing range. A few people were hesitating on the sidewalk, their eyes bright with expectation. Like they were hoping a fight might break out to alleviate the tedium of another Monday morning. I saw Tyler Crowley nudge Austin Marks, and they both paused on their way to class. \u201cI already know what you came to say,\u201d Edward reminded Jacob in voice so low that I could barely make it out. \u201cMessage delivered. Consider us warned.\u201d Edward glanced down at me for a fleeting second with worried eyes. \u201cWarned?\u201d I asked blankly. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell her?\u201d Jacob asked, his eyes widening with disbelief. \u201cWhat, were you afraid she\u2019d take our side?\u201d \u201cPlease drop it, Jacob,\u201d Edward said in an even voice. \u201cWhy?\u201d Jacob challenged. I frowned in confusion. \u201cWhat don\u2019t I know? Edward?\u201d Edward just glared at Jacob as if he hadn\u2019t heard me. \u201cJake?\u201d Jacob raised his eyebrow at me. \u201cHe didn\u2019t tell you that his big . . .brother crossed the line Saturday night?\u201d he asked, his tone thickly layered with sarcasm. Then his eyes flickered back to Edward. \u201cPaul was totally justified in \u2014\u201d \u201cIt was no-man\u2019s land!\u201d Edward hissed. \u201cWas not!\u201d Jacob was fuming visibly. His hands trembled. He shook his head and sucked in two deep lungfuls of air. \u201cEmmett and Paul?\u201d I whispered. Paul was Jacob\u2019s most volatile pack brother. He was the one who\u2019d lost control that day in the woods \u2014 the memory of the snarling gray wolf was suddenly vivid in my head. \u201cWhat happened? Were they fighting?\u201d My voice strained higher in panic. \u201cWhy? Did Paul get hurt?\u201d \u201cNo one fought,\u201d Edward said quietly, only to me. \u201cNo one got hurt. Don\u2019t be anxious.\u201d Jacob was staring at us with incredulous eyes. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell her anything at all, did you? Is that why you took her away? So she wouldn\u2019t know that \u2014?\u201d \u201cLeave now.\u201d Edward cut him off mid-sentence, and his face was abruptly frightening \u2014 truly frightening. For a second, he looked like . . . like a vampire . He glared at Jacob with vicious, unveiled loathing. Jacob raised his eyebrows, but made no other move. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you told her?\u201d They faced each other in silence for a long moment. More students gathered behind Tyler and Austin. I saw Mike next to Ben \u2014 Mike had one hand on Ben\u2019s shoulder, like he was holding him in place. In the dead silence, all the details suddenly fell into place for me with a burst of intuition. Something Edward didn\u2019t want me to know. Something that Jacob wouldn\u2019t have kept from me. Something that had the Cullens and the wolves both in the woods, moving in hazardous proximity to each other. Something that would cause Edward to insist that I fly across the country. Something that Alice had seen in a vision last week \u2014 a vision Edward had lied to me about. Something I\u2019d been waiting for anyway. Something I knew would happen again, as much as I might wish it never would. It was never going to end, was it? I heard the quick gasp, gasp, gasp, gasp of the air dragging through my lips, but I couldn\u2019t stop it. It looked like the school was shaking, like there was an earthquake, but I knew it was my own trembling that caused the illusion. \u201cShe came back for me,\u201d I choked out. Victoria was never going to give up till I was dead. She would keep repeating the same pattern \u2014 feint and run, feint and run \u2014 until she found a hole through my defenders. Maybe I\u2019d get lucky. Maybe the Volturi would come for me first \u2014 they\u2019d kill me quicker, at least. Edward held me tight to his side, angling his body so that he was still between me and Jacob, and stroked my face with anxious hands. \u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he whispered to me. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll never let her get close to you, it\u2019s fine.\u201d Then he glared at Jacob. \u201cDoes that answer your question, mongrel?\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t think Bella has a right to know?\u201d Jacob challenged. \u201cIt\u2019s her life.\u201d Edward kept his voice muted; even Tyler, edging forward by inches, would be unable to hear. \u201cWhy should she be frightened when she was never in danger?\u201d \u201cBetter frightened than lied to.\u201d I tried to pull myself together, but my eyes were swimming in moisture. I could see it behind my lids \u2014 I could see Victoria\u2019s face, her lips pulled back over her teeth, her crimson eyes glowing with the obsession of her vendetta; she held Edward responsible for the demise of her love, James. She wouldn\u2019t stop until his love was taken from him, too. Edward wiped the tears from my cheek with his fingertips. \u201cDo you really think hurting her is better than protecting her?\u201d he murmured. \u201cShe\u2019s tougher than you think,\u201d Jacob said. \u201cAnd she\u2019s been through worse.\u201d Abruptly, Jacob\u2019s expression shifted, and he was staring at Edward with an odd, speculative expression. His eyes narrowed like he was trying to do a difficult math problem in his head. I felt Edward cringe. I glanced up at him, and his face was contorted in what could only be pain. For one ghastly moment, I was reminded of our afternoon in Italy, in the macabre tower room of the Volturi, where Jane had tortured Edward with her malignant gift, burning him with her thoughts alone. . . . The memory snapped me out of my near hysteria and put everything in perspective. Because I\u2019d rather Victoria killed me a hundred times over than watch Edward suffer that way again. \u201cThat\u2019s funny,\u201d Jacob said, laughing as he watched Edward\u2019s face. Edward winced, but smoothed his expression with a little effort. He couldn\u2019t quite hide the agony in his eyes. I glanced, wide-eyed, from Edward\u2019s grimace to Jacob\u2019s sneer. \u201cWhat are you doing to him?\u201d I demanded. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, Bella,\u201d Edward told me quietly. \u201cJacob just has a good memory, that\u2019s all.\u201d Jacob grinned, and Edward winced again. \u201cStop it! Whatever you\u2019re doing.\u201d \u201cSure, if you want.\u201d Jacob shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s his own fault if he doesn\u2019t like the things I remember, though.\u201d I glared at him, and he smiled back impishly \u2014 like a kid caught doing something he knows he shouldn\u2019t by someone who he knows won\u2019t punish him. \u201cThe principal\u2019s on his way to discourage loitering on school property,\u201d Edward murmured to me. \u201cLet\u2019s get to English, Bella, so you\u2019re not involved.\u201d \u201cOverprotective, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Jacob said, talking just to me. \u201cA little trouble makes life fun. Let me guess, you\u2019re not allowed to have fun, are you?\u201d Edward glowered, and his lips pulled back from his teeth ever so slightly. \u201cShut up, Jake,\u201d I said. Jacob laughed. \u201cThat sounds like a no . Hey, if you ever feel like having a life again, you could come see me. I\u2019ve still got your motorcycle in my garage.\u201d \u1eea  This news distracted me. \u201cYou were supposed to sell that. You promised Charlie you would.\u201d If I hadn\u2019t begged on Jake\u2019s behalf \u2014 after all, he\u2019d put weeks of labor into both motorcycles, and he deserved some kind of payback \u2014 Charlie would have thrown my bike in a Dumpster. And possibly set that Dumpster on fire. \u201cYeah, right. Like I would do that. It belongs to you, not me. Anyway, I\u2019ll hold on to it until you want it back.\u201d A tiny hint of the smile I remembered was suddenly playing around the edges of his lips. \u201cJake . . .\u201d He leaned forward, his face earnest now, the bitter sarcasm fading. \u201cI think I might have been wrong before, you know, about not being able to be friends. Maybe we could manage it, on my side of the line.\u00a0 Come see me.\u201d I was vividly conscious of Edward, his arms still wrapped protectively around me, motionless as a stone. I shot a look at his face \u2014 it was calm, patient. \u201cI, er, don\u2019t know about that, Jake.\u201d Jacob dropped the antagonistic fa\u00e7ade completely. It was like he\u2019d forgotten Edward was there, or at least he was determined to act that way. \u201cI miss you every day, Bella. It\u2019s not the same without you.\u201d \u201cI know and I\u2019m sorry, Jake, I just . . .\u201d He shook his head, and sighed. \u201cI know. Doesn\u2019t matter, right? I guess I\u2019ll survive or something. Who needs friends?\u201d He grimaced, trying to cover the pain with a thin attempt at bravado. Jacob\u2019s suffering had always triggered my protective side. It was not entirely rational \u2014 Jacob was hardly in need of any physical protection I could offer. But my arms, pinned beneath Edward\u2019s, yearned to reach out to him. To wrap around his big, warm waist in a silent promise of acceptance and comfort. Edward\u2019s shielding arms had become restraints. \u201cOkay, get to class,\u201d a stern voice sounded behind us. \u201cMove along, Mr. Crowley.\u201d \u201cGet to school, Jake,\u201d I whispered, anxious as soon as I recognized the principal\u2019s voice. Jacob went to the Quileute school, but he might still get in trouble for trespassing or the equivalent. Edward released me, taking just my hand and pulling me behind his body again. Mr. Greene pushed through the circle of spectators, his brows pressing down like ominous storm clouds over his small eyes. \u201cI mean it,\u201d he was threatening. \u201cDetention for anyone who\u2019s still standing here when I turn around again.\u201d The audience melted away before he was finished with his sentence. \u201cAh, Mr. Cullen. Do we have a problem here?\u201d \u201cNot at all, Mr. Greene. We were just on our way to class.\u201d \u201cExcellent. I don\u2019t seem to recognize your friend.\u201d Mr. Greene turned his glower on Jacob. \u201cAre you a new student here?\u201d Mr. Greene\u2019s eyes scrutinized Jacob, and I could see that he\u2019d come to the same conclusion everyone else had: dangerous. A troublemaker. \u201cNope,\u201d Jacob answered, half a smirk on his broad lips. \u201cThen I suggest you remove yourself from school property at once, young man, before I call the police.\u201d Jacob\u2019s little smirk became a full-blown grin, and I knew he was picturing Charlie showing up to arrest him. This grin was too bitter, too full of mocking to satisfy me. This wasn\u2019t the smile I\u2019d been waiting to see. Jacob said, \u201cYes, sir,\u201d and snapped a military salute before he climbed on his bike and kicked it to a start right there on the sidewalk. The engine snarled and then the tires squealed as he spun it sharply around. In a matter of seconds, Jacob raced out of sight. Mr. Greene gnashed his teeth together while he watched the performance. \u201cMr. Cullen, I expect you to ask your friend to refrain from trespassing again.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s no friend of mine, Mr. Greene, but I\u2019ll pass along the warning.\u201d Mr. Greene pursed his lips. Edward\u2019s perfect grades and spotless record were clearly a factor in Mr. Greene\u2019s assessment of the incident. \u201cI see. If you\u2019re worried about any trouble, I\u2019d be happy to \u2014\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to worry about, Mr. Greene. There won\u2019t be any trouble.\u201d \u201cI hope that\u2019s correct. Well, then. On to class. You, too, Miss Swan.\u201d Edward nodded, and pulled me quickly along toward the English building. \u201cDo you feel well enough to go to class?\u201d he whispered when we were past the principal. \u201cYes,\u201d I whispered back, not quite sure if this was a lie. Whether I felt well or not was hardly the most important consideration. I needed to talk to Edward right away, and English class wasn\u2019t the ideal place for the conversation I had in mind. But with Mr. Greene right behind us, there weren\u2019t a lot of other options. We got to class a little late and took our seats quickly. Mr. Berty was reciting a Frost poem. He ignored our entrance, refusing to let us break his rhythm. I yanked a blank page out of my notebook and started writing, my handwriting more illegible than normal thanks to my agitation. What happened? Tell me everything . And screw the protecting me crap, please. I shoved the note at Edward. He sighed, and then began writing. It took him less time than me, though he wrote an entire paragraph in his own personal calligraphy before he slipped the paper back. Alice saw that Victoria was coming back. I took you out of town merely as a precaution \u2014 there was never a chance that she would have gotten anywhere close to you. Emmett and Jasper very nearly had her, but Victoria seems to have some instinct for evasion. She escaped right down the Quileute boundary line as if she were reading it from a map. It didn\u2019t help that Alice\u2019s abilities were nullified by the Quileutes\u2019 involvement. To be fair, the Quileutes might have had her, too, if we hadn\u2019t gotten in the way. The big gray one thought Emmett was over the line, and he got defensive. Of course Rosalie reacted to that, and everyone left the chase to protect their companions. Carlisle and Jasper got things calmed down before it got out of hand. But by then, Victoria had slipped away. That\u2019s everything.  I frowned at the letters on the page. All of them had been in on it \u2014 Emmett, Jasper, Alice, Rosalie, and Carlisle. Maybe even Esme, though he hadn\u2019t mentioned her. And then Paul and the rest of the Quileute pack. It might so easily have turned into a fight, pitting my future family and my old friends against each other. Any one of them could have been hurt. I imagined the wolves would be in the most danger, but picturing tiny Alice next to one of the huge werewolves, fighting . . . I shuddered. Carefully, I scrubbed out the entire paragraph with my eraser and then I wrote over the top:\u00a0  What about Charlie? She could have been after him. Edward was shaking his head before I finished, obviously going to downplay any danger on Charlie\u2019s behalf. He held a hand out, but I ignored that and started again. You can\u2019t know that she wasn\u2019t thinking that, because you weren\u2019t here. Florida was a bad idea. He took the paper from underneath my hand. I wasn\u2019t about to send you off alone. With your luck, not even the black box would survive. That wasn\u2019t what I\u2019d meant at all; I hadn\u2019t thought of going without him. I\u2019d meant that we should have stayed here together. But I was sidetracked by his response, and a little miffed. Like I couldn\u2019t fly cross country without bringing the plane down. Very funny. So let\u2019s say my bad luck did crash the plane. What exactly were you going to do about it? Why is the plane crashing? He was trying to hide a smile now. The pilots are passed out drunk. Easy. I\u2019d fly the plane. Of course. I pursed my lips and tried again. Both engines have exploded and we\u2019re falling in a death spiral toward the earth. I\u2019d wait till we were close enough to the ground, get a good grip on you, kick out the wall, and jump. Then I\u2019d run you back to the scene of the accident, and we\u2019d stumble around like the two luckiest survivors in history. I stared at him wordlessly. \u201cWhat?\u201d he whispered. I shook my head in awe. \u201cNothing,\u201d I mouthed. I scrubbed out the disconcerting conversation and wrote one more line. You will tell me next time. I knew there would be a next time. The pattern would continue until someone lost. Edward stared into my eyes for a long moment. I wondered what my face looked like \u2014 it felt cold, so the blood hadn\u2019t returned to my cheeks. My eyelashes were still wet. He sighed and then nodded once. Thanks. The paper disappeared from under my hand. I looked up, blinking in surprise, just as Mr. Berty came down the aisle. \u201cIs that something you\u2019d like to share there, Mr. Cullen?\u201d Edward looked up innocently and held out the sheet of paper on top of his folder. \u201cMy notes?\u201d he asked, sounding confused. Mr. Berty scanned the notes \u2014 no doubt a perfect transcription of his lecture \u2014 and then walked away frowning. It was later, in Calculus \u2014 my one class without Edward \u2014 that I heard the gossip. \u201cMy money\u2019s on the big Indian,\u201d someone was saying. I peeked up to see that Tyler, Mike, Austin, and Ben had their heads bent together, deep in conversation. \u201cYeah,\u201d Mike whispered. \u201cDid you see the size of that Jacob kid? I think he could take Cullen down.\u201d Mike sounded pleased by the idea. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Ben disagreed. \u201cThere\u2019s something about Edward. He\u2019s always so . . . confident. I have a feeling he can take care of himself.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m with Ben,\u201d Tyler agreed. \u201cBesides, if that other kid messed Edward up, you know those big brothers of his would get involved.\u201d \u201cHave you been down to La Push lately?\u201d Mike asked. \u201cLauren and I went to the beach a couple of weeks ago, and believe me, Jacob\u2019s friends are all just as big as he is.\u201d \u201cHuh,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cToo bad it didn\u2019t turn into anything. Guess we\u2019ll never know how it would have turned out.\u201d \u201cIt didn\u2019t look over to me,\u201d Austin said. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll get to see.\u201d Mike grinned. \u201cAnyone in the mood for a bet?\u201d \u201cTen on Jacob,\u201d Austin said at once. \u201cTen on Cullen,\u201d Tyler chimed in. \u201cTen on Edward,\u201d Ben agreed. \u201cJacob,\u201d Mike said. \u201cHey, do you guys know what it was about?\u201d Austin wondered. \u201cThat might affect the odds.\u201d \u201cI can guess,\u201d Mike said, and then he shot a glance at me at the same time that Ben and Tyler did. From their expressions, none of them had realized I was in easy hearing distance.

            "en": "2-2songngu        2. STITCHES CARLISLE WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO STAYED calm. Centuries of\u00a0 experience in the emergency room were evident in his quiet, authoritative voice. \"Emmett, Rose, get Jasper outside.\" Unsmiling for once, Emmett nodded. \"Come on, Jasper.\" Jasper struggled against Emmett's unbreakable grasp, twisting around, reaching toward his brother with his bared teeth, his eyes still past reason. Edward's face was whiter than bone as he wheeled to crouch over me, taking a clearly defensive position. A low warning growl slid from between his clenched teeth. I could tell that he wasn't breathing. Rosalie, her divine face strangely smug, stepped in front of Jasper\u2014keeping a careful distance from his teeth\u2014and helped Emmett wrestle him through the glass door that Esme held open, one hand pressed over her mouth and nose. Esme's heart-shaped face was ashamed. \"I'm so sorry, Bella,\" she cried as she followed the others into the yard. \"Let me by, Edward,\" Carlisle murmured. A second passed, and then Edward nodded slowly and relaxed his stance. Carlisle knelt beside me, leaning close to examine my arm. I could feel the shock frozen on my face, and I tried to compose it. \"Here, Carlisle,\" Alice said, handing him a towel. He shook his head. \"Too much glass in the wound.\" He reached over and ripped a long, thin scrap from the bottom of the white tablecloth. He twisted it around my arm above the elbow to form a tourniquet. The smell of the blood was making me dizzy. My ears rang. \"Bella,\" Carlisle said softly. \"Do you want me to drive you to the hospital, or would you like me to take care of it here?\" \"Here, please,\" I whispered. If he took me to the hospital, there would be no way to keep this from Charlie. \"I'll get your bag,\" Alice said. \"Let's take her to the kitchen table,\" Carlisle said to Edward. Edward lifted me effortlessly, while Carlisle kept the pressure steady on my arm. \"How are you doing, Bella?\" Carlisle asked. \"I'm fine.\" My voice was reasonably steady, which pleased me. Edward's face was like stone. Alice was there. Carlisle's black bag was already on the table, a small but brilliant desk light plugged into the wall. Edward sat me gently into a chair, and Carlisle pulled up another. He went to work at once. Edward stood over me, still protective, still not breathing. \"Just go, Edward,\" I sighed. \"I can handle it,\" he insisted. But his jaw was rigid; his eyes burned with the intensity of the thirst he fought, so much worse for him than it was for the others. \"You don't need to be a hero,\" I said. \"Carlisle can fix me up without your help. Get some fresh air.\" I winced as Carlisle did something to my arm that stung. \"I'll stay,\" he said. \"Why are you so masochistic?\" I mumbled. Carlisle decided to intercede. \"Edward, you may as well go find Jasper before he gets too far. I'm sure he's upset with himself, and I doubt he'll listen to anyone but you right now.\" \"Yes,\" I eagerly agreed. \"Go find Jasper.\" \"You might as well do something useful,\" Alice added. Edward's eyes narrowed as we ganged up on him, but, finally, he nodded once and sprinted smoothly through the kitchen's back door. I was sure he hadn't taken a breath since I'd sliced my finger. A numb, dead feeling was spreading through my arm. Though it erased the sting, it reminded me of the gash, and I watched Carlisle's face carefully to distract me from what his hands were doing. His hair gleamed gold in the bright light as he bent over my arm. I could feel the faint stirrings of unease in the pit of my stomach, but I was determined not to let my usual squeamishness get the best of me. There was no pain now, just a gentle tugging sensation that I tried to ignore. No reason to get sick like a baby. If she hadn't been in my line of sight, I wouldn't have noticed Alice give up and steal out of the room. With a tiny, apologetic smile on her lips, she disappeared through the kitchen doorway. \"Well, that's everyone,\" I sighed. \"I can clear a room, at least.\" \"It's not your fault,\" Carlisle comforted me with a chuckle. \"It could happen to anyone.\" \"Could\" I repeated. \"But it usually just happens to me.\" He laughed again. His relaxed calm was only more amazing set in direct contrast with everyone else's reaction. I couldn't find any trace of anxiety in his face. He worked with quick, sure movements. The only sound besides our quiet breathing was the soft plink, plink as the tiny fragments of glass dropped one by one to the table. \"How can you do this?\" I demanded. \"Even Alice and Esme\u2026\" I trailed off, shaking my head in wonder. Though the rest of them had given up the traditional diet of vampires just as absolutely as Carlisle had, he was the only one who could bear the smell of my blood without suffering from the intense temptation. Clearly, this was much more difficult than he made it seem. \"Years and years of practice,\" he told me. \"I barely notice the scent anymore.\" \"Do you think it would be harder if you took a vacation from the hospital for a long time. And weren't around any blood?\" \"Maybe.\" He shrugged his shoulders, but his hands remained steady. \"I've never felt the need for an extended holiday.\" He flashed a brilliant smile in my direction. \"I enjoy my work too much.\" Plink, plink, plink. I was surprised at how much glass there seemed to be in my arm. I was tempted to glance at the growing pile, just to check the size, but I knew that idea would not be helpful to my no-vomiting strategy. \"What is it that you enjoy?\" I wondered. It didn't make sense to me\u2014the years of struggle and self-denial he must have spent to get to the point where he could endure this so easily. Besides, I wanted to keep him talking; the conversation kept my mind off the queasy feeling in my stomach. His dark eyes were calm and thoughtful as he answered. \"Hmm. What I enjoy the very most is when my\u2026 enhanced abilities let me save someone who would otherwise have been lost. It's pleasant knowing that, thanks to what I can do, some people's lives are better because I exist. Even the sense of smell is a useful diagnostic tool at times.\" One side of his mouth pulled up in half a smile. I mulled that over while he poked around, making sure all the glass splinters were gone. Then he rummaged in his bag for new tools, and I tried not to picture a needle and thread. \"You try very hard to make up for something that was never your fault,\" I suggested while a new kind of tugging started at the edges of my skin. \"What I mean is, it's not like you asked for this. You didn't choose this kind of life, and yet you have to work so hard to be good.\" \"I don't know that I'm making up for anything,\" he disagreed lightly. \"Like everything in life, I just had to decide what to do with what I was given.\" \"That makes it sound too easy.\" He examined my arm again. \"There,\" he said, snipping a thread. \"All done.\" He wiped an oversized Q-tip, dripping with some syrup-colored liquid, thoroughly across the operation site. The smell was strange; it made my head spin. The syrup stained my skin. \"In the beginning, though,\" I pressed while he taped another long piece of gauze securely in place, sealing it to my skin. \"Why did you even think to try a different way than the obvious one?\" His lips turned up in a private smile. \"Hasn't Edward told you this story?\" \"Yes. But I'm trying to understand what you were thinking\u2026\" His face was suddenly serious again, and I wondered if his thoughts had gone to the same place that mine had. Wondering what I would be thinking when\u2014I refused to think if\u2014it was me. n\u1ebfu \"You know my father was a clergyman,\" he mused as he cleaned the table carefully, rubbing everything down with wet gauze, and then doing it again. The smell of alcohol burned in my nose. \"He had a rather harsh view of the world, which I was already beginning to question before the time that I changed.\" Carlisle put all the dirty gauze and the glass slivers into an empty crystal bowl. I didn't understand what he was doing, even when he lit the match. Then he threw it onto the alcohol-soaked fibers, and the sudden blaze made me jump. \"Sorry,\" he apologized. \"That ought to do it\u2026 So I didn't agree with my father's particular brand of faith. But never, in the nearly four hundred years now since I was born, have I ever seen anything to make me doubt whether God exists in some form or the other. Not even the reflection in the mirror.\" I pretended to examine the dressing on my arm to hide my surprise at the direction our conversation had taken. Religion was the last thing I expected, all things considered. My own life was fairly devoid of belief. Charlie considered himself a Lutheran, because that's what his parents had been, but Sundays he worshipped by the river with a fishing pole in his hand. Renee tried out a church now and then, but, much like her brief affairs with tennis, pottery, yoga, and French classes, she moved on by the time I was aware of her newest fad.  \"I'm sure all this sounds a little bizarre, coming from a vampire.\" He grinned, knowing how their casual use of that word never failed to shock me. \"But I'm hoping that there is still a point to this life, even for us.\u00a0 It's a long shot, I'll admit,\" he continued in an offhand voice. \"By all accounts, we're damned regardless. But I hope, maybe foolishly, that we'll get some measure of credit for trying.\" \"I don't think that's foolish,\" I mumbled. I couldn't imagine anyone, deity included, who wouldn't be impressed by Carlisle. Besides, the only kind of heaven I could appreciate would have to include Edward. \"And I don't think anyone else would, either.\" \"Actually, you're the very first one to agree with me.\" \"The rest of them don't feel the same?\" I asked, surprised, thinking of only one person in particular. Carlisle guessed the direction of my thoughts again. \"Edward's with me up to a point. God and heaven exist\u2026 and so does hell. But he doesn't believe there is an afterlife for our kind.\" Carlisle's voice was very soft; he stared out the big window over the sink, into the darkness. \"You see, he thinks we've lost our souls.\" I immediately thought of Edward's words this afternoon: unless you want to die\u2014or whatever it is that we do. The light bulb flicked on over my head. \"That's the real problem, isn't it?\" I guessed. \"That's why he's being so difficult about me.\" \u00a0Carlisle spoke slowly. \"I look at my\u2026 son. His strength, his goodness, the brightness that shines out of him\u2014and it only fuels that hope, that faith, more than ever. How could there not be more for one such as Edward?\" I nodded in fervent agreement. \"But if I believed as he does\u2026\" He looked down at me with unfathomable eyes. \"If you believed as he did. Could you take away his soul?\" The way he phrased the question thwarted my answer. If he'd asked me whether I would risk my soul for Edward, the reply would be obvious. But would I risk Edward's soul? I pursed my lips unhappily. That wasn't a fair exchange. \"You see the problem.\" I shook my head, aware of the stubborn set of my chin. Carlisle sighed. \"It's my choice,\" I insisted. \"It's his, too.\" He held up his hand when he could see that I was about to argue. \"Whether he is responsible for doing that to you.\" \"He's not the only one able to do it.\" I eyed Carlisle speculatively. He laughed, abruptly lightening the mood. \"Oh, no! You're going to have to work this out with him.\" But then he sighed. \"That's the one part I can never be sure of. I think, in most other ways, that I've done the best I could with what I had to work with. But was it right to doom the others to this life? I can't decide.\" I didn't answer. I imagined what my life would be like if Carlisle had resisted the temptation to change his lonely existence\u2026 and shuddered. \"It was Edward's mother who made up my mind.\" Carlisle's voice was almost a whisper. He stared unseeingly out the black windows. \"His mother?\" Whenever I'd asked Edward about his parents, he would merely say that they had died long ago, and his memories were vague. I realized Carlisle's memory of them, despite the brevity of their contact, would be perfectly clear. \"Yes. Her name was Elizabeth. Elizabeth Masen. His father, Edward Senior, never regained consciousness in the hospital. He died in the first wave of the influenza. But Elizabeth was alert until almost the very end. Edward looks a great deal like her\u2014she had that same strange bronze shade to her hair, and her eyes were exactly the same color green.\" \"His eyes were green?\" I murmured, trying to picture it. \"Yes\u2026\" Carlisle's ocher eyes were a hundred years away now. \"Elizabeth worried obsessively over her son. She hurt her own chances of survival trying to nurse him from her sickbed. I expected that he would go first, he was so much worse off than she was. When the end came for her, it was very quick. It was just after sunset, and I'd arrived to relieve the doctors who'd been working all day. That was a hard time to pretend\u2014there was so much work to be done, and I had no need of rest. How I hated to go back to my house, to hide in the dark and pretend to sleep while so many were dying. \"I went to check Elizabeth and her son first. I'd grown attached\u2014always a dangerous thing to do considering the fragile nature of humans. I could see at once that she'd taken a bad turn. The fever was raging out of control, and her body was too weak to fight anymore. She didn't look weak, though, when she glared up at me from her cot. \"Save him!' she commanded me in the hoarse voice that was all her throat could manage. \"I'll do everything in my power,' I promised her, taking her hand. The fever was so high, she probably couldn't even tell how unnaturally cold mine felt. Everything felt cold to her skin. \"You must,\" she insisted, clutching at my hand with enough strength that I wondered if she wouldn't pull through the crisis after all. Her eyes were hard, like stones, like emeralds. 'You must do everything in your power. What others cannot do, that is what you must do for my Edward.\" \"It frightened me. She looked it me with those piercing eyes, and, for one instant, I felt certain that she knew my secret. Then the fever overwhelmed her, and she never regained consciousness. She died within an hour of making her demand. \"I'd spent decades considering the idea of creating a companion for myself. Just one other creature who could really know me, rather than what I pretended to be. But I could never justify it to myself\u2014doing what had been done to me. \"There Edward lay, dying. It was clear that he had only hours left. Beside him, his mother, her face somehow not yet peaceful, not even in death.\" Carlisle saw it all again, his memory unburned by the intervening century. I could see it clearly, too, as he spoke\u2014the despair of the hospital, the overwhelming atmosphere of death. Edward burning with fever, his life slipping away with each tick of the clock\u2026 I shuddered again, and forced the picture from my mind. \"Elizabeth's words echoed in my head. How could she guess what I could do? Could anyone really want that for her son? \"I looked at Edward. Sick as he was, he was still beautiful. There was something pure and good about his face. The kind of face I would have wanted my son to have. \"After all those years of indecision, I simply acted on a whim. I wheeled his mother to the morgue first, and then I came back for him. No one noticed that he was still breathing. There weren't enough hands, enough eyes, to keep track of half of what the patients needed. The morgue was empty\u2014of the living, at least. I stole him out the back door, and carried him across the rooftops back to my home. \"I wasn't sure what had to be done. I settled for recreating the wounds I'd received myself, so many centuries earlier in London. I felt bad about that later. It was more painful and lingering than necessary. \"I wasn't sorry, though. I've never been sorry that I saved Edward.\" He shook his head, coming back to the present. He smiled at me. \"I suppose I should take you home now.\" \"I'll do that,\" Edward said. He came through the shadowy dining room, walking slowly for him. His face was smooth, unreadable, but there was something wrong with his eyes\u2014something he was trying very hard to hide. I felt a spasm of unease in my stomach. \"Carlisle can take me,\" I said. I looked down at my shirt; the light blue cotton was soaked and spotted with my blood. My right shoulder was covered in thick pink frosting. \"I'm fine.\" Edward's voice was unemotional. \"You'll need to change anyway. You'd give Charlie a heart attack the way you look. I'll have Alice get you something.\" He strode out the kitchen door again. I looked at Carlisle anxiously. \"He's very upset.\" \"Yes,\" Carlisle agreed. \"Tonight is exactly the kind of thing that he fears the most. You being put in danger, because of what we are.\" \"It's not his fault.\" \"It's not yours, either.\" I looked away from his wise, beautiful eyes. I couldn't agree with that. Carlisle offered me his hand and helped me up from the table. I followed him out into the main room. Esme had come back; she was mopping the floor where I'd fallen\u2014with straight bleach from the smell of it. \"Esme, let me do that.\" I could feel that my face was bright red again. \"I'm already done.\" She smiled up at me. \"How do you feel?\" \"I'm fine,\" I assured her. \"Carlisle sews faster than any other doctor I've had.\" They both chuckled. Alice and Edward came in the back doors. Alice hurried to my side, but Edward hung back, his face indecipherable. \"C'mon,\" Alice said. \"I'll get you something less macabre to wear.\" She found me a shirt of Esme's that was close to the same color mine had been. Charlie wouldn't notice, I was sure. The long white bandage on my arm didn't look nearly as serious when I was no longer spattered in gore. Charlie was never surprised to see me bandaged. \"Alice,\" I whispered as she headed back to the door. \"Yes?\" She kept her voice low, too, and looked at me curiously, her head cocked to the side. \"How bad is it?\" I couldn't be sure if my whispering was a wasted effort. Even though we were upstairs, with the door closed, perhaps he could hear me. Her face tensed. \"I'm not sure yet.\" \"How's Jasper?\" She sighed. \"He's very unhappy with himself. It's all so much more of challenge for him, and he hates feeling weak.\" \"It's not his fault. You'll tell him that I'm not mad at him, not at all, won't you?\" \"Of course.\" Edward was waiting for me by the front door. As I got to the bottom of the staircase, he held it open without a word. \"Take your things!\" Alice cried as I walked warily toward Edward. She scooped up the two packages, one half-opened, and my camera from under the piano, and pressed them into my good arm. \"You can thank me later, when you've opened them.\" Esme and Carlisle both said a quiet goodnight. I could see them stealing quick glances at their impassive son, much like I was. It was a relief to be outside; I hurried past the lanterns and the roses, now unwelcome reminders.  Edward kept pace with me silently. He opened the passenger side for me, and I climbed in without complaint. On the dashboard was a big red ribbon, stuck to the new stereo. I pulled it off, throwing it to the floor. As Edward slid into the other side, I kicked the ribbon under my seat. He didn't look at me or the stereo. Neither of us switched it on, and the silence was somehow intensified by the sudden thunder of the engine. He drove too fast down the dark, serpentine lane. The silence was making me insane. \"Say something,\" I finally begged as he turned onto the freeway. \"What do you want me to say?\" he asked in a detached voice. I cringed at his remoteness. 'Tell me you forgive me.\" That brought a flicker of life to his face\u2014a flicker of anger. \"Forgive you? For what?\" \"If I'd been more careful, nothing would have happened.\" \"Bella, you gave yourself a paper cut\u2014that hardly deserves the death penalty.\" \"It's still my fault.\" My words opened up the floodgate. \"Your fault? If you'd cut yourself at Mike Newton's house, with Jessica there and Angela and your other normal friends, the worst that could possibly have happened would be what? Maybe they couldn't find you a bandage? If you'd tripped and knocked over a pile of glass plates on your own\u2014without someone throwing you into them\u2014even then, what's the worst? You'd get blood on the seats when they drove you to the emergency room? Mike Newton could have held your hand while they stitched you up\u2014and he wouldn't be righting the urge to kill you the whole time he was there. Don't try to take any of this on yourself, Bella. It will only make me more disgusted with myself.\" \"How the hell did Mike Newton end up in this conversation?\" I demanded. \"Mike Newton ended up in this conversation because Mike Newton would be a hell of a lot healthier for you to be with,\" he growled. \"I'd rather die than be with Mike Newton,\" I protested. \"I'd rather die than be with anyone but you.\" \"Don't be melodramatic, please.\" \"Well then, don't you be ridiculous.\" He didn't answer. He glared through the windshield, his expression black. I racked my brain for some way to salvage the evening. When we pulled up in front of my house, I still hadn't come up with anything. He killed the engine, but his hands stayed clenched around the steering wheel. \"Will you stay tonight?\" I asked. \"I should go home.\" The last thing I wanted was for him to go wallow in remorse. \"For my birthday,\" I pressed. \"You can't have it both ways\u2014either you want people to ignore your birthday or you don't. One or the other.\" His voice was stern, but not as serious as before. I breathed a silent sigh of relief. \"Okay. I've decided that I don't want you to ignore my birthday. I'll see you upstairs.\" I hopped out, reaching back in for my packages. He frowned. \"You don't have to take those.\" \"I want them,\" I responded automatically, and then wondered if he was using reverse psychology. \"No, you don't. Carlisle and Esme spent money on you.\" \"I'll live.\" I tucked the presents awkwardly under my good arm and slammed the door behind me. He was out of the truck and by my side in less than a second. \"Let me carry them, at least.\" he said as he took them away. \"I'll be in your room.\" I smiled. \"Thanks.\" \"Happy birthday,\" he sighed, and leaned down to touch his lips to mine. I reached up on my toes to make the kiss last longer when he pulled away. He smiled my favorite crooked smile, and then he disappeared into the darkness. The game was still on; as soon as I walked through the front door I could hear the announcer rambling over the babble of the crowd. \"Bell?\" Charlie called. \"Hey, Dad,\" I said as I came around the corner. I held my arm close to my side. The slight pressure burned, and I wrinkled my nose. The anesthetic was apparently losing its effectiveness. \"How was it?\" Charlie lounged across the sofa with his bare feet propped up on the arm.  What was left of his curly brown hair was crushed flat on one side. \"Alice went overboard. Flowers, cake, candles, presents\u2014the whole bit.\" \"What did they get you?\" \"A stereo for my truck.\" And various unknowns. \"Wow.\" \"Yeah,\" I agreed. \"Well, I'm calling it a night.\" \"I'll see you in the morning.\" I waved. \"See ya.\" \"What happened to your arm?\" I flushed and cursed silently. \"I tripped. It's nothing.\" \"Bella,\" he sighed, shaking his head. \"Goodnight, Dad.\" I hurried up to the bathroom, where I kept my pajamas for just such nights as these. I shrugged into the matching tank top and cotton pants that I'd gotten to replace the holey sweats I used to wear to bed, wincing as the movement pulled at the stitches. I washed my face one-handed, brushed my teeth, and then skipped to my room. He was sitting in the center of my bed, toying idly with one of the silver boxes. \"Hi,\" he said. His voice was sad. He was wallowing. I went to the bed, pushed the presents out of his hands, and climbed into his lap. \"Hi.\" I snuggled into his stone chest. \"Can I open my presents now?\" \"Where did the enthusiasm come from?\" he wondered. \"You made me curious.\" I picked up the long flat rectangle that must have been from Carlisle and Esme. \"Allow me,\" he suggested. He took the gift from my hand and tore the silver paper off with one fluid movement. He handed the rectangular white box back to me. \"Are you sure I can handle lifting the lid?\" I muttered, but he ignored me. Inside the box was a long thick piece of paper with an overwhelming amount of fine print. It took me a minute to get the gist of the information. \"We're going to <em>Jacksonville</em>?\" And I was excited, in spite of myself. It was a voucher for plane tickets, for both me and Edward. \"That's the idea.\" \"I can't believe it. Renee is going to flip! You don't mind, though, do you? It's sunny, you'll have to stay inside all day.\" \"I think I can handle it,\" he said, and then frowned. \"If I'd had any idea that you could respond to a gift this appropriately, I would have made you open it in front of Carlisle and Esme. I thought you'd complain.\" \"Well, of course it's too much. But I get to take you with me!\" He chuckled. \"Now I wish I'd spent money on your present. I didn't realize that you were capable of being reasonable.\" I set the tickets aside and reached for his present, my curiosity rekindled. He took it from me and unwrapped it like the first one. He handed back a clear CD jewel case, with a blank silver CD inside. \"What is it?\" I asked, perplexed. He didn't say anything; he took the CD and reached around me to put it in the CD player on the bedside table. He hit play, and we waited in silence. Then the music began. I listened, speechless and wide-eyed. I knew he was waiting for my reaction, but I couldn't talk. Tears welled up, and I reached up to wipe them away before they could spill over. \"Does your arm hurt?\" he asked anxiously. \"No, it's not my arm. It's beautiful, Edward. You couldn't have given me anything I would love more. I can't believe it.\" I shut up, so I could listen. It was his music, his compositions. The first piece on the CD was my lullaby. \"I didn't think you would let me get a piano so I could play for you here,\" he explained. \"You're right.\" \"How does your arm feel?\" \"Just fine.\" Actually, it was starting to blaze under the bandage. I wanted ice. I would have settled for his hand, but that would have given me away. \"I'll get you some Tylenol.\" \"I don't need anything,\" I protested, but he slid me off his lap and headed for the door. \"Charlie,\" I hissed. Charlie wasn't exactly aware that Edward frequently stayed over. In fact, he would have a stroke if that fact were brought to his attention. But I didn't feel too guilty for deceiving him.\u00a0\u00a0  It wasn't as if we were up to anything he wouldn't want me to be up to. Edward and his rules\u2026 \"He won't catch me,\" Edward promised as he disappeared silently out the door . . and returned, catching the door before it had swung back to touch the frame. He had the glass from the bathroom and the bottle of pills in one hand. I took the pills he handed me without arguing\u2014I knew I would lose the argument And my arm really was starting to bother me. My lullaby continued, soft and lovely, in the background. \"It's late,\" Edward noted. He scooped me up off the bed with one arm, and pulled the cover back with the other. He put me down with my head on my pillow and tucked the quilt around me. He lay down next to me\u2014on top of the blanket so I wouldn't get chilled\u2014and put his arm over me. I leaned my head against his shoulder and sighed happily. \"Thanks again,\" I whispered. \"You're welcome.\" It was quiet for a long moment as I listened to my lullaby drift to a close. Another song began. I recognized Esme's favorite. \"What are you thinking about?'\" I wondered in a whisper. He hesitated for a second before he told me. \"I was thinking about right and wrong, actually.\" I felt a chill tingle along my spine. \"Remember how I decided that I wanted you to not ignore my birthday?\" I asked quickly, hoping it wasn't too clear that I was trying to distract him. \"Yes,\" he agreed, wary. \"Well, I was thinking, since it's still my birthday, that I'd like you to kiss me again.\" \"You're greedy tonight.\" \"Yes, I am\u2014but please, don't do anything you don't want to do,\" I added, piqued. He laughed, and then sighed. \"Heaven forbid that I should do anything I don't want to do,\" he said in a strangely desperate tone as he put his hand under my chin and pulled my face up to his. The kiss began much the same as usual\u2014Edward was as careful as ever, and my heart began to overreact like it always did. And then something seemed to change. Suddenly his lips became much more urgent, his free hand twisted into my hair and held my face securely to his. And, though my hands tangled in his hair, too, and though I was clearly beginning to cross his cautious lines, for once he didn't stop me. His body was cold through the thin quilt, but I crushed myself against him eagerly. When he stopped it was abrupt; he pushed me away with gentle, firm hands. I collapsed back onto my pillow, gasping, my head spinning. Something tugged at my memory, elusive, on the edges. \"Sorry,\" he said, and he was breathless, too. \"That was out of line.\" \"I don't mind,\" I panted. He frowned at me in the darkness. \"Try to sleep. Bella.\" \"No, I want you to kiss me again.\" \"You're overestimating my self-control.\" \"Which is tempting you more, my blood or my body?\" I challenged. \"It's a tie.\" He grinned briefly in spite of himself, and then was serious again. \"Now. why don't you stop pushing your luck and go to sleep?\" \"Fine,\" I agreed, snuggling closer to him. I really did feel exhausted. It had been a long day in so many ways, yet I felt no sense of relief at its end. Almost as if something worse was coming tomorrow. It was a silly premonition\u2014what could be worse than today?' Just the shock catching up with me, no doubt. Trying to be sneaky about it, I pressed my injured arm against his shoulder, so his cool skin would sooth the burning. It felt better at once. I was halfway asleep, maybe more, when I realized what his kiss had reminded me of: last spring, when he'd had to leave me to throw James off my trail, Edward had kissed me goodbye, not knowing when\u2014or if\u2014we would see each other again. This kiss had the same almost painful edge for some reason I couldn't imagine. I shuddered into unconsciousness, as if I were already having a nightmare.",

            "en": "7 REPETITION        24. VOTE HE WAS NOT PLEASED, THAT MUCH WAS EASY TO READ in his face. But, without further argument, he took me in his arms and sprang lithely from my window, landing without the slightest jolt, like a cat. It was a little bit farther down than I'd imagined. \"All right then,\" he said, his voice seething with disapproval. \"Up you go.\" He helped me onto his back, and took off running. Even after all this time, it felt routine. Easy. Evidently this was something you never forgot, like riding a bicycle. It was so very quiet and dark as he ran through the forest, his breathing slow and even\u2014dark enough that the trees flying past us were nearly invisible, and only the rush of air in my face truly gave away our speed. The air was damp; it didn't burn my eyes the way the wind in the big plaza had, and that was comforting. As was the night, too, after that terrifying brightness. Like the thick quilt I'd played under as a child, the dark felt familiar and protecting. I remembered that running through the forest like this used to frighten me, that I used to have to close my eyes. It seemed a silly reaction to me now. I kept my eyes wide, my chin resting on his shoulder, my cheek against his neck. The speed was exhilarating. A hundred times better than the motorcycle. I turned my face toward him and pressed my lips into the cold stone skin of his neck. \"Thank you,\" he said, as the vague, black shapes of trees raced past us. \"Does that mean you've decided you're awake?\" I laughed. The sound was easy, natural, effortless. It sounded right. \"Not really. More that, either way, I'm not trying to wake up. Not tonight.\" \"I'll earn your trust back somehow,\" he murmured, mostly to himself. \"If it's my final act.\" \"I trust you,\" I assured him. \"It's me I don't trust.\" \"Explain that, please.\" He'd slowed to a walk\u2014I could only tell because the wind ceased\u2014and I guessed that we weren't far from the house. In fact, I thought I could make out the sound of the river rushing somewhere close by in the darkness. \"Well\u2014\" I struggled to find the right way to phrase it. \"I don't trust myself to be\u2026 enough. To deserve you. There's nothing about me that could hold you.\" He stopped and reached around to pull me from his back. His gentle hands did not release me; after he'd set me on my feet again, he wrapped his arms tightly around me, hugging me to his chest. \"Your hold is permanent and unbreakable,\" he whispered. \"Never doubt that.\" \u201cBut how could I not? \"You never did tell me\u2026\" he murmured. \"What?\" \"What your greatest problem is.\" \"I'll give you one guess.\" I sighed, and reached up to touch the tip of his nose with my index finger. He nodded. \"I'm worse than the Volturi,\" he said grimly. \"I guess I've earned that.\" I rolled my eyes. \"The worst the Volturi can do is kill me.\" He waited with tense eyes. \"You can leave me,\" I explained. \"The Volturi, Victoria\u2026 they're nothing compared to that.\" Even in the darkness, I could see the anguish twist his face\u2014it reminded me of his expression under Jane's torturing gaze; I felt sick, and regretted speaking the truth. \"Don't,\" I whispered, touching his face. \"Don't be sad.\" He pulled one corner of his mouth up halfheartedly, but the expression didn't touch his eyes. \"If there was only some way to make you see that I can't leave you,\" he whispered. \"Time, I suppose, will be the way to convince you.\" I liked the idea of time. \"Okay,\" I agreed. His face was still tormented. I tried to distract him with inconsequentials. \"So\u2014since you're staying. Can I have my stuff back?\" I asked, making my tone as light as I could manage. My attempt worked, to an extent: he laughed. But his eyes retained the misery. \"Your things were never gone,\" he told me. \"I knew it was wrong, since I promised you peace without reminders. It was stupid and childish, but I wanted to leave something of myself with you. The CD, the pictures, the tickets\u2014they're all under your floorboards.\" \"Really?\" He nodded, seeming slightly cheered by my obvious pleasure in this trivial fact. It wasn't enough to heal the pain in his face completely. \"I think,\" I said slowly, \"I'm not sure, but I wonder\u2026 I think maybe I knew it the whole time.\" \"What did you know?\" I only wanted to take away the agony in his eyes, but as I spoke the words, they sounded truer than I expected they would. \"Some part of me, my subconscious maybe, never stopped believing that you still cared whether I lived or died. That's probably why I was hearing the voices.\" There was a very deep silence for a moment. \"Voices?\" he asked flatly. \"Well, just one voice. Yours. It's a long story.\" The wary look on his face made me wish that I hadn't brought that up. Would he think I was crazy, like everyone else? Was everyone else right about that? But at least that expression\u2014the one that made him look like something was burning him\u2014faded. \"I've got time.\" His voice was unnaturally even. \"It's pretty pathetic.\" He waited. I wasn't sure how to explain. \"Do you remember what Alice said about extreme sports?\" He spoke the words without inflection or emphasis. \"You jumped off a cliff for fun.\" \"Er, right. And before that, with the motorcycle\u2014\" \"Motorcycle?\" he asked. I knew his voice well enough to hear something brewing behind the calm.  \"I guess I didn't tell Alice about that part.\" \"No.\" \"Well, about that\u2026 See, I found that\u2026 when I was doing something dangerous or stupid\u2026 I could remember you more clearly,\" I confessed, feeling completely mental. \"I could remember how your voice sounded when you were angry. I could hear it, like you were standing right there next to me. Mostly I tried not to think about you, but this didn't hurt so much\u2014it was like you were protecting me again. Like you didn't want me to be hurt. \"And, well, I wonder if the reason I could hear you so clearly was because, underneath it all. I always knew that you hadn't stopped loving me.\" Again, as I spoke, the words brought with them a sense of conviction. Of rightness. Some deep place inside me recognized truth. His words came out half-strangled. \"You\u2026 were\u2026 risking your life\u2026 to hear\u2014\" \"Shh,\" I interrupted him. \"Hold on a second. I think I'm having an epiphany here.\" I thought of that night in Port Angeles when I'd had my first delusion. I'd come up with two options. Insanity or wish fulfillment. I'd seen no third option. But what if\u2026 What if you sincerely believed something was true, but you were dead wrong? What if you were so stubbornly sure that you were right, that you wouldn't even consider the truth? Would the truth be silenced, or would it try to break through? Option three: Edward loved me. The bond forged between us was not one that could be broken by absence, distance, or time. And no matter how much more special or beautiful or brilliant or perfect than me he might be, he was as irreversibly altered as I was. As I would always belong to him, so would he always be mine. Was that what I'd been trying to tell myself? \"Oh!\" \"Bella?\" \"Oh. Okay. I see.\" \"Your epiphany?\" he asked, his voice uneven and strained. \"You love me,\" I marveled. The sense of conviction and Tightness washed through me again. Though his eyes were still anxious, the crooked smile I loved best flashed across his face. \"Truly, I do.\" My heart inflated like it was going to crack right through my ribs. It filled my chest and blocked my throat so that I could not speak. He really did want me the way I wanted him\u2014forever. It was only fear for my soul, for the human things he didn't want to take from me, that made him so desperate to leave me mortal. Compared to the fear that he didn't want me, this hurdle\u2014my soul\u2014seemed almost insignificant. He took my face tightly between his cool hands and kissed me until I was so dizzy the forest was spinning. Then he leaned his forehead against mine, and I was not the only one breathing harder than usual. \"You were better at it than I was, you know,\" he told me. \"Better at what?\" \"Surviving. You, at least, made an effort. You got up in the morning, tried to be normal for Charlie, followed the pattern of your life. When I wasn't actively tracking, I was\u2026 totally useless. I couldn't be around my family\u2014I couldn't be around anyone. I'm embarrassed to admit that I more or less curled up into a ball and let the misery have me.\" He grinned, sheepish. \"It was much more pathetic than hearing voices. And, of course, you know I do that, too.\" I was deeply relieved that he really seemed to understand\u2014comforted that this all made sense to him. At any rate, he wasn't looking at me like I was crazy. He was looking at me like\u2026 he loved me. \"I only heard one voice,\" I corrected him. He laughed and then pulled me tight against his right side and started to lead me forward. \"I'm just humoring you with this.\" He motioned broadly with his hand toward the \u00a0darkness in front of us as we walked. There was something pale and immense there\u2014the house, I realized. \"It doesn't matter in the slightest what they say.\" \"This affects them now, too.\" He shrugged indifferently. He led me through the open front door into the dark house and flipped the lights on. The room was just as I'd remembered it\u2014the piano and the white couches and the pale, massive staircase. No dust, no white sheets. Edward called out the names with no more volume than I'd use in regular conversation. \"Carlisle? Esme?\u00a0 Rosalie? Emmett? Jasper? Alice?\" They would hear. Carlisle was suddenly standing beside me, as if he'd been there all along. \"Welcome back, Bella.\" He smiled. \"What can we do for you this morning? I imagine, due to the hour, that this is not a purely social visit?\" I nodded. \"I'd like to talk to everyone at once, if that's okay. About something important.\" I couldn't help glancing up at Edward's face as I spoke. His expression was critical, but resigned. When I looked back to Carlisle, he was looking at Edward, too. \"Of course,\" Carlisle said. \"Why don't we talk in the other room?\" Carlisle led the way through the bright living room, around the corner to the dining room, turning on lights as he went. The walls were white, the ceilings high, like the living room. In the center of the room, under the low-hanging chandelier, was a large, polished oval table surrounded by eight chairs. Carlisle held out a chair for me at the head. I'd never seen the Cullens use the dining room table before\u2014it was just a prop. They didn't eat in the house. As soon as I turned to sit in the chair, I saw that we were not alone. Esme had followed Edward, and behind her the rest of the family filed in. Carlisle sat down on my right, and Edward on my left. Everyone else took their seats in silence. Alice was grinning at me, already in on the plot. Emmett and Jasper looked curious, and Rosalie smiled at me tentatively. My answering smile was just as timid. That was going to take some getting used to. Carlisle nodded toward me. \"The floor is yours.\" I swallowed. Their gazing eyes made me nervous. Edward took my hand under the table. I peeked at him, but he was watching the others, his face suddenly fierce. \"Well,\" I paused. \"I'm hoping Alice has already told you everything that happened in Volterra?\" \"Everything,\" Alice assured me. I threw her a meaningful look. \"And on the way?\" \"That, too,\" she nodded. \"Good,\" I sighed with relief. \"Then we're all on the same page.\" They waited patiently while I tried to order my thoughts. \"So, I have a problem,\" I began. \"Alice promised the Volturi that I would become one of you. They're going to send someone to check, and I'm sure that's a bad thing\u2014something to avoid. \"And so, now, this involves you all. I'm sorry about that.\" I looked at each one of their beautiful faces, saving the most beautiful for last. Edward's mouth was turned down into a grimace. \"But, if you don't want me, then I'm not going to force myself on you, whether Alice is willing or not.\" Esme opened her mouth to speak, but I held up one finger to stop her. \"Please, let me finish. You all know what I want. And I'm sure you know what Edward thinks, too. I think the only fair way to decide is for everyone to have a vote. If you decide you don't want me, then\u2026\u00a0 I guess I'll go back to Italy alone. I can't have them coming here.\" My forehead creased as I considered that. There was the faint rumble of a growl in Edward's chest. I ignored him. \"Taking into account, then, that I won't put any of you in danger either way, I want you to vote yes or no on the issue of me becoming a vampire.\" I half-smiled on the last word, and gestured toward Carlisle to begin. \"Just a minute,\" Edward interrupted. I glared at him through narrowed eyes. He raised his eyebrows at me, squeezing my hand. \"I have something to add before we vote.\" I sighed. \"About the danger Bella's referring to,\" he continued. \"I don't think we need to be overly anxious.\" His expression became more animated. He put his free hand on the shining table and leaned forward. \"You see,\" he explained, looking around the table while he spoke, \"there was more than one reason why I didn't want to shake Aro's hand there at the end. There's something they didn't think of, and I didn't want to cine them in.\" He grinned. \"Which was?\" Alice prodded. I was sure my expression was just as skeptical as hers. \"The Volturi are overconfident, and with good reason. When they decide to find someone, it's not really a problem. Do you remember Demetri?\" He glanced down at me. I shuddered. He took that as a yes. \"He finds people\u2014that's his talent, why they keep him. \"Now, the whole time we were with any of them, I was picking their brains for anything that might save us, getting as much information as possible. So I saw how Demetri's talent works. He's a tracker\u2014a tracker a thousand times more gifted than James was. His ability is loosely related to what I do, or what Aro does. He catches the\u2026 flavor? I don't know how to describe it\u2026 the tenor\u2026 of someone's mind, and then he follows that. It works over immense distances. \"But after Aro's little experiments, well\u2026\" Edward shrugged. \"You think he won't be able to find me,\" I said flatly. He was smug. \"I'm sure of it. He relies totally on that other sense. When it doesn't work with you, they'll all be blind.\" \"And how does that solve anything?\" \"Quite obviously, Alice will be able to tell when they're planning a visit, and I'll hide you. They'll be helpless,\" he said with fierce enjoyment. \"It will be like looking for a piece of straw in a haystack!\" He and Emmett exchanged a glance and a smirk. This made no sense. \"But they can find you,\" I reminded him. \"And I can take care of myself.\" Emmett laughed, and reached across the table toward his brother, extending a fist. \"Excellent plan, my brother,\" he said with enthusiasm. Edward stretched out his arm to smack Emmett's fist with his own. \"No,\" Rosalie hissed. \"Absolutely not,\" I agreed. \"Nice.\" Jasper's voice was appreciative. \"Idiots,\" Alice muttered. Esme just glared at Edward. I straightened up in my chair, focusing. This was my meeting. \"All right, then. Edward has offered an alternative for you to consider,\" I said coolly. \"Let's vote.\" I looked toward Edward this time; it would be better to get his opinion out of the way. \"Do you want me to join your family?\" His eyes were hard and black as flint. \"Not that way. You're staying human.\" I nodded once, keeping my face businesslike, and then moved on. \"Alice?\" \"Yes.\" \"Jasper?\" \"Yes,\" he said, voice grave. I was a little surprised\u2014I hadn't been at all sure of his vote\u2014but I suppressed my reaction and moved on. \"Rosalie?\" She hesitated, biting down on her full, perfect bottom lip. \"No.\" I kept my face blank and turned my head slightly to move on, but she held up both her hands, palms forward. \"Let me explain,\" she pleaded. \"I don't mean that I have any aversion to you as a sister. It's just that\u2026 this is not the life I would have chosen for myself. I wish there had been someone there to vote no for me.\" I nodded slowly, and then turned to Emmett. \"Hell, yes!\" He grinned. \"We can find some other way to pick a fight with this Demetri.\" I was still grimacing at that when I looked at Esme. \"Yes, of course, Bella. I already think of you as part of my family.\" \"Thank you, Esme,\" I murmured as I turned toward Carlisle. I was suddenly nervous, wishing I had asked for his vote first. I was sure that this was the vote that mattered most, the vote that counted more than any majority. Carlisle wasn't looking at me. \"Edward,\" he said. \"No,\" Edward growled. His jaw was strained tight, his lips curled back from his teeth. \"It's the only way that makes sense,\" Carlisle insisted. \"You've chosen not to live without her, and that doesn't leave me a choice.\" Edward dropped my hand, shoving away from the table. He stalked out of the room, snarling under his breath. \"I guess you know my vote.\" Carlisle sighed. I was still staring after Edward. \"Thanks,\" I mumbled. An earsplitting crash echoed from the other room. I flinched, and spoke quickly. \"That's all I needed. Thank you. For wanting to keep me. I feel exactly the same way about all of you, too.\" My voice was jagged with emotion by the end. Esme was at my side in a flash, her cold arms around me. \"Dearest Bella,\" she breathed. I hugged her back. Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed Rosalie looking down at the table, and I realized that my words could be construed in two ways. \"Well, Alice,\" I said when Esme released me. \"Where do you want to do this?\" Alice stared at me, her eyes widening with terror. \"No! No! NO!\" Edward roared, charging back into the room. He was in my face before I had time to blink, bending over me, his expression twisted in rage. \"Are you insane?\" he shouted. \"Have you utterly lost your mind?\" I cringed away, my hands over my ears. \"Um, Bella,\" Alice interjected in an anxious voice. \"I don't think I'm ready for that. I'll need to prepare\u2026\" \"You promised,\" I reminded her, glaring under Edward's arm. \"I know, but\u2026 Seriously, Bella! I don't have any idea how to not kill you.\" \"You can do it,\" I encouraged. \"I trust you.\" Edward snarled in fury. Alice shook her head quickly, looking panicked. \"Carlisle?\" I turned to look at him. Edward grabbed my face in his hand, forcing me to look at him. His other hand was out, palm toward Carlisle. Carlisle ignored that. \"I'm able to do it,\" he answered my question. I wished I could see his expression. \"You would be in no danger of me losing control.\" \"Sounds good.\" I hoped he could understand; it was hard to talk clearly the way Edward held my jaw. \"Hold on,\" Edward said between his teeth. \"It doesn't have to be now.\" \"There's no reason for it not to be now,\" I said, the words coming out distorted. \"I can think of a few.\" \"Of course you can,\" I said sourly. \"Now let go of me.\" He freed my face, and folded his arms across his chest. \"In about two hours, Charlie will be here looking for you. I wouldn't put it past him to involve the police.\" \"All three of them.\" But I frowned. This was always the hardest part. Charlie, Renee. Now Jacob, too. The people I would lose, the people I would hurt. I wished there was some way that I could be the only one to suffer, but I knew that was impossible. At the same time, I was hurting them more by staying human. Putting Charlie in constant danger through my proximity. Putting Jake in worse danger still by drawing his enemies across the land he felt bound to protect. And Renee\u2014I couldn't even risk a visit to see my own mother for fear of bringing my deadly problems along with me! I was a danger magnet; I'd accepted that about myself. Accepting this, I knew I needed to be able to take care of myself and protect the ones I loved, even if that meant that I couldn't be with them. I needed to be strong. \"In the interest of remaining inconspicuous,\" Edward said, still talking through his gritted teeth, but looking at Carlisle now, \"I suggest that we put this conversation off, at the very least until Bella finishes high school, and moves out of Charlie's house.\" \"That's a reasonable request, Bella,\" Carlisle pointed out. I thought about Charlie's reaction when he woke up this morning, if\u2014after all that life had put him through in the last week with Harry's loss, and then I had put him through with my unexplained disappearance\u2014he were to find my bed empty. Charlie deserved better than that. It was just a little more time; graduation wasn't so far away\u2026 I pursed my lips. \"I'll consider it.\" Edward relaxed. His jaw unclenched. \"I should probably take you home,\" he said, more calm now, but clearly in a hurry to get me out of here.  \"Just in case Charlie wakes up early.\" I looked at Carlisle. \"After graduation?\" \"You have my word.\" I took a deep breath, smiled, and turned back to Edward. \"Okay. You can take me home.\" Edward rushed me out of the house before Carlisle could promise me anything else. He took me out the back, so I didn't get to see what was broken in the living room. It was a quiet trip home. I was feeling triumphant, and a little smug. Scared stiff, too, of course, but I tried not to think about that part. It did me no good to worry about the \u00a0\u00a0pain\u2014the physical or the emotional\u2014so I wouldn't. Not until I absolutely had to. When we got to my house, Edward didn't pause. He dashed up the wall and through my window in half a second. Then he pulled my arms from around his neck and set me on the bed. I thought I had a pretty good idea of what he was thinking, but his expression surprised me. Instead of furious, it was calculating. He paced silently back and forth across my dark room while I watched with growing suspicion. \"Whatever you're planning, it's not going to work,\" I told him. \"Shh. I'm thinking.\" \"Ugh,\" I groaned, throwing myself back on the bed and pulling the quilt over my head. There was no sound, but suddenly he was there. He flipped the cover back so he could see me. He was lying next to me. His hand reached up to brush my hair from my cheek. \"If you don't mind, I'd much rather you didn't hide your face. I've lived without it for as long as I can stand. Now\u2026 tell me something.\" \"What?\" I asked, unwilling. \"If you could have anything in the world, anything at all, what would it be?\" I could feel the skepticism in my eyes. \"You.\" He shook his head impatiently. \"Something you don't already have.\" I wasn't sure where he was trying to lead me, so I thought carefully before I answered. I came up with something that was both true, and also probably impossible. \"I would want\u2026 Carlisle not to have to do it. I would want you to change me.\" I watched his reaction warily, expecting more of the fury I'd seen at his house. I was surprised that his expression didn't change. It was still calculating, thoughtful. \"What would you be willing to trade for that?\" I couldn't believe my ears. I gawked at his composed face and blurted out the answer before I could think about it. \"Anything.\" He smiled faintly, and then pursed his lips. \"Five years?\" My face twisted into an expression somewhere between chagrin and horror. \"You said anything,\" he reminded me. \"Yes, but\u2026 you'll use the time to find a way out of it. I have to strike while the iron is hot. Besides, it's just too dangerous to be human\u2014for me, at least. So, anything but that.\" He frowned. \"Three years?\" \"No!\" \"Isn't it worth anything to you at all? \" I thought about how much I wanted this. Better to keep a poker face, I decided, and not let him know how very much that was. It would give me more leverage. \"Six months?\" He rolled his eyes. \"Not good enough.\" \"One year, then,\" I said. \"That's my limit.\" \"At least give me two.\" \"No way. Nineteen I'll do. But I'm not going anywhere near twenty. If you're staying in your teens forever, then so am I.\" He thought for a minute. \"All right. Forget time limits. If you want me to be the one\u2014then you'll just have to meet one condition.\" \"Condition?\" My voice went flat. \"What condition?\" His eyes were cautious\u2014he spoke slowly. \"Marry me first.\" I stared at him, waiting\u2026 \"Okay. What's the punch line?\" He sighed. \"You're wounding my ego, Bella. I just proposed to you, and you think it's a joke.\" \"Edward, please be serious.\" \"I am one hundred percent serious.\" He gazed at me with no hint of humor in his face. \"Oh, c'mon,\" I said, an edge of hysteria in my voice. \"I'm only eighteen.\" \"Well, I'm nearly a hundred and ten. It's time I settled down.\" I looked away, out the dark window, trying to control the panic before it gave me away. \"Look, marriage isn't exactly that high on my list of priorities, you know? It was sort of the kiss of death for Renee and Charlie.\" \"Interesting choice of words.\" \"You know what I mean.\" He inhaled deeply. \"Please don't tell me that you're afraid of the commitment,\" his voice was disbelieving, and I understood what he meant. \"That's not it exactly,\" I hedged. \"I'm\u2026 afraid of Renee. She has some really intense opinions on getting married before you're thirty.\" \"Because she'd rather you became one of the eternal damned than get married.\" He laughed darkly. \"You think you're joking.\" \"Bella, if you compare the level of commitment between a marital union as opposed to bartering your soul in exchange for an eternity as a vampire\u2026\" He shook his head. \"If you're not brave enough to marry me, then\u2014\" \"Well,\" I interrupted. \"What if I did? What if I told you to take me to Vegas now? Would I be a vampire in three days?\" He smiled, his teeth flashing in the dark. \"Sure,\" he said, calling my bluff. \"I'll get my car.\" \"Dammit.\" I muttered. \"I'll give you eighteen months.\" \"No deal,\" he said, grinning. \"I like this condition.\" \"Fine. I'll have Carlisle do it when I graduate.\" \"If that's what you really want.\" He shrugged, and his smile became absolutely angelic. \"You're impossible,\" I groaned. \"A monster.\" He chuckled. \"Is that why you won't marry me?\" I groaned again. He leaned toward me; his night-dark eyes melted and smoldered and shattered my concentration. \" Please, Bella?\" he breathed. I forgot how to breathe for a moment. When I recovered, I shook my head quickly, trying to clear my suddenly clouded mind. \"Would this have gone better if I d had time to get a ring.'\" \"No! No rings!\" I very nearly shouted. \"Now you've done it,\" he whispered. \"Oops.\" \"Charlie's getting up; I'd better leave,\" Edward said with resignation. My heart stopped beating. He gauged my expression for a second. \"Would it be childish of me to hide in your closet, then?\" \"No,\" I whispered eagerly. \"Stay. Please.\" Edward smiled and disappeared. I seethed in the darkness as I waited for Charlie to check on me. Edward knew exactly what he was doing, and I was willing to bet that all the injured surprise was part of the ploy. Of course, I still had the Carlisle option, but now that I knew there was a chance that Edward would change me himself, I wanted it bad. He was such a cheater. My door cracked open. \"Morning, Dad.\" \"Oh, hey, Bella.\" He sounded embarrassed at getting caught. \"I didn't know you were awake.\" \"Yeah. I've just been waiting for you to wake up so I could take a shower.\" I started to get up. \"Hold on,\" Charlie said, flipping the light on. I blinked in the sudden brightness, and carefully kept my eyes away from the closet. \"Let's talk for a minute first.\" I couldn't control my grimace. I'd forgotten to ask Alice for a good excuse. \"You know you're in trouble.\" \"Yeah, I know.\" \"I just about went crazy these last three days. I come home from Harry's funeral, and you're gone.\u00a0 Jacob could only tell me that you'd run off with Alice Cullen, and that he thought you were in trouble.\u00a0 You didn't leave me a number, and you didn't call. I didn't know where you were or when\u2014or if\u2014you were coming back. Do you have any idea how\u2026 how\u2026\" He couldn't finish the sentence. He sucked in a sharp breath and moved on. \"Can you give me one reason why I shouldn't ship you off to <em>Jacksonville</em> this second?\" My eyes narrowed. So it was going to be threats, was it? Two could play at that game. I sat up, pulling the quilt around me. \"Because I won't go.\" \"Now just one minute, young lady\u2014\" \"Look, Dad, I accept complete responsibility for my actions, and you have the right to ground me for as long as you want. I will also do all the chores and laundry and dishes until you think I've learned my lesson. And I guess you're within your rights if you want to kick me out, too\u2014but that won't make me to go to Florida.\" His face turned bright red. He took a few deep breaths before he answered. \"Would you like to explain where you've been?\" Oh, crap. \"There was\u2026 an emergency.\" He raised his eyebrows in expectation of my brilliant explanation. I filled my cheeks with air and then blew it out noisily. \"I don't know what to tell you, Dad. It was mostly a misunderstanding. He said, she said. It got out of hand.\" He waited with a distrustful expression. \"See, Alice told Rosalie about me jumping off the cliff\u2026\" I was scrambling frantically to make this work, to keep it as close to the truth as possible so that my inability to lie convincingly would not undermine the excuse, but before I could go on, Charlie's expression reminded me that he didn't know anything about the cliff. Major oops. As if I wasn't already toast. \"I guess I didn't tell you about that,\" I choked out. \"It was nothing. Just messing around, swimming with Jake. Anyway, Rosalie told Edward, and he was upset. She sort of accidentally made it sound like I was trying to kill myself or something. He wouldn't answer his phone, so Alice dragged me to\u2026 L.A., to explain in person.\" I shrugged, desperately hoping that he would not be so distracted by my slip that he'd miss the brilliant explanation I'd provided. Charlie's face was frozen. \"Were you trying to kill yourself, Bella?\" \"No, of course not. Just having fun with Jake. Cliff diving. The La Push kids do it all the time. Like I said, nothing.\" Charlie's face heated up\u2014from frozen to hot with fury. \"What's it to Edward Cullen anyway?\" he barked. \"All this time, he's just left you dangling without a word\u2014\" I interrupted him. \"Another misunderstanding.\" His face flushed again. \"So is he back then?\" \"I'm not sure what the exact plan is. I think they all are.\" He shook his head, the vein in his forehead pulsing. \"I want you to stay away from him, Bella. I don't trust him. He's rotten for you. I won't let him mess you up like that again.\" \"Fine,\" I said curtly. Charlie rocked back onto his heels. \"Oh.\" He scrambled for a second, exhaling loudly in surprise. \"I thought you were going to be difficult.\" \"I am.\" I stared straight into his eyes. \"I meant, 'Fine, I'll move out.'\" His eyes bulged; his face turned puce. My resolve wavered as I started to worry about his health. He was no younger than Harry\u2026 \"Dad, I don't want to move out,\" I said in a softer tone. \"I love you. I know you're worried, but you need to trust me on this. And you're going to have to ease up on Edward if you want me to stay. Do you want me to live here or not?\" \"That's not fair, Bella. You know I want you to stay.\" \"Then be nice to Edward, because he's going to be where I am.\" I said it with confidence. The conviction of my epiphany was still strong. \"Not under my roof,\" Charlie stormed. I sighed a heavy sigh. \"Look, I'm not going to give you any more ultimatums tonight\u2014or I guess it's this morning. Just think about it for a few days, okay? But keep in mind that Edward and I are sort of a package deal.\" \"Bella\u2014\" \"Think it over,\" I insisted. \"And while you're doing that, could you give me some privacy? I really need a shower.\" Charlie's face was a strange shade of purple, but he left, slamming the door behind him. I heard him stomp furiously down the stairs. I threw off my quilt, and Edward was already there, sitting in the rocking chair as if he d been present through the whole conversation. \"Sorry about that,\" I whispered. \"It's not as if I don't deserve far worse,\" he murmured. \"Don't start anything with Charlie over me, please.\" \"Don't worry about it,\" I breathed as I gathered up my bathroom things and a set of clean clothes. \"I will start exactly as much as is necessary, and no more than that. Or are you trying to tell me I have nowhere to go?\" I widened my eyes with false alarm. \"You'd move in with a house full of vampires?\" \"That's probably the safest place for someone like me. Besides\u2026\" I grinned. \"If Charlie kicks me out, then there's no need for a graduation deadline, is there?\" His jaw tightened. \"So eager for eternal damnation,\" he muttered. \"You know you don't really believe that.\" \"Oh, don't I?\" he fumed. \"No. You don't.\" He glowered at me and started to speak, but I cut him off. \"If you really believed that you'd lost your soul, then when I found you in Volterra, you would have realized immediately what was happening, instead of thinking we were both dead together. But you didn't\u2014you said 'Amazing. Carlisle was right,'\" I reminded him, triumphant. \"There's hope in you, after all.\" For once, Edward was speechless. \"So let's both just be hopeful, all right?\" I suggested. \"Not that it matters. If you stay, I don't need heaven.\" He got up slowly, and came to put his hands on either side of my face as he stared into my eyes. \"Forever,\" he vowed, still a little staggered. \"That's all I'm asking for,\" I said, and stretched up on my toes so that I could press my lips to his.",
