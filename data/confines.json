But if it had to perish twice,  I think I know enough of hate  To say that for destruction ice  Is also great  And would suffice.  Robert Frost    PREFACE  All our attempts at subterfuge had been in vain.  With ice in my heart, I watched him prepare to defend me. His intense concentration betrayed no hint of doubt, though he was outnumbered. I knew that we could expect no help \u2014 at this moment, his family was fighting for their lives just as surely as he was for ours.    Would I ever learn the outcome of that other fight? Find out who the winners and the losers were?  Would I live long enough for that?  The odds of that didn\u2019t look so great.  Black eyes, wild with their fierce craving for my death, watched for the moment when my protector\u2019s attention would be diverted. The moment when I would surely die.  Somewhere, far, far away in the cold forest, a wolf howled.    1. ULTIMATUM  Bella,  I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re making Charlie carry notes to Billy like we\u2019re in second grade \u2014 if I wanted to talk to you I would answer them  You made the choice here, okay? You can\u2019t have it both ways when  What part of \u201cmortal enemies\u201d is too complicated for you to  Look, I know I\u2019m being a jerk, but there\u2019s just no way around  We can\u2019t be friends when you\u2019re spending all your time with a bunch of  It just makes it worse when I think about you too much, so don\u2019t write anymore  Yeah, I miss you, too. A lot. Doesn\u2019t change anything. Sorry.  Jacob     I ran my fingers across the page, feeling the dents where he had pressed the pen to the paper so hard that it had nearly broken through. I could picture him writing this \u2014 scrawling the angry letters in his rough handwriting, slashing through line after line when the words came out wrong, maybe even snapping the pen in his too-big hand; that would explain the ink splatters. I could imagine the frustration pulling his black eyebrows together and crumpling his forehead. If I\u2019d been there, I might have laughed. Don\u2019t give yourself a brain hemorrhage, Jacob, I would have told him. Just spit it out.     Laughing was the last thing I felt like doing now as I reread the words I\u2019d already memorized. His answer to my pleading note \u2014 passed from Charlie to Billy to him, just like second grade, as he\u2019d pointed out \u2014 was no surprise. I\u2019d known the essence of what it would say before I\u2019d opened it. What was surprising was how much each crossed-out line wounded me \u2014 as if the points of the letters had cutting edges. More than that, behind each angry beginning lurked a vast pool of hurt; Jacob\u2019s pain cut me deeper than my own.     While I was pondering this, I caught the unmistakable scent of a smoking burner rising from the kitchen. In another house, the fact that someone besides myself was cooking might not be a cause for panicking. I shoved the wrinkled paper into my back pocket and ran, making it downstairs in the nick of time. The jar of spaghetti sauce Charlie\u2019d stuck in the microwave was only on its first revolution when I yanked the door open and pulled it out.     \u201cWhat did I do wrong?\u201d Charlie demanded.  \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to take the lid off first, Dad. Metal\u2019s bad for microwaves.\u201d I swiftly removed the lid as I spoke, poured half the sauce into a bowl, and then put the bowl inside the microwave and the jar back in the fridge; I fixed the time and pressed start.  Charlie watched my adjustments with pursed lips. \u201cDid I get the noodles right?\u201d  I looked in the pan on the stove \u2014 the source of the smell that had alerted me. \u201cStirring helps,\u201d I said mildly. I found a spoon and tried to de-clump the mushy hunk that was scalded to the bottom.  Charlie sighed.     \u201cSo what\u2019s all this about?\u201d I asked him.  He folded his arms across his chest and glared out the back windows into the sheeting rain. \u201cDon\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d he grumbled.  I was mystified. Charlie cooking? And what was with the surly attitude? Edward wasn\u2019t here yet; usually my dad reserved this kind of behavior for my boyfriend\u2019s benefit, doing his best to illustrate the theme of \u201cunwelcome\u201d with every word and posture. Charlie\u2019s efforts were unnecessary \u2014 Edward knew exactly what my dad was thinking without the show.      The word boyfriend had me chewing on the inside of my cheek with a familiar tension while I stirred. It wasn\u2019t the right word, not at all. I needed something more expressive of eternal commitment. . . . But words like destiny and fate sounded hokey when you used them in casual conversation.     Edward had another word in mind, and that word was the source of the tension I felt. It put my teeth on edge just to think it to myself. Fianc\u00e9e. Ugh. I shuddered away from the thought.  \u201cDid I miss something? Since when do you make dinner?\u201d I asked Charlie. The pasta lump bobbed in the boiling water as I poked it. \u201cOr try to make dinner, I should say.\u201d  Charlie shrugged. \u201cThere\u2019s no law that says I can\u2019t cook in my own house.\u201d     \u201cYou would know,\u201d I replied, grinning as I eyed the badge pinned to his leather jacket.  \u201cHa. Good one.\u201d He shrugged out of the jacket as if my glance had reminded him he still had it on, and hung it on the peg reserved for his gear. His gun belt was already slung in place \u2014 he hadn\u2019t felt the need to wear that to the station for a few weeks. There had been no more disturbing disappearances to trouble the small town of Forks, Washington, no more sightings of the giant, mysterious wolves in the ever-rainy woods. . . .      I prodded the noodles in silence, guessing that Charlie would get around to talking about whatever was bothering him in his own time. My dad was not a man of many words, and the effort he had put into trying to orchestrate a sit-down dinner with me made it clear there were an uncharacteristic number of words on his mind.  I glanced at the clock routinely - something I did every few minutes around this time. Less than a half hour to go now.    Afternoons were the hardest part of my day. Ever since my former best friend (and werewolf), Jacob Black, had informed on me about the motorcycle I\u2019d been riding on the sly \u2014 a betrayal he had devised in order to get me grounded so that I couldn\u2019t spend time with my boyfriend (and vampire), Edward Cullen \u2014 Edward had been allowed to see me only from seven till nine-thirty p.m., always inside the <em>confines</em> of my home and under the supervision of my dad\u2019s unfailingly crabby glare.     This was an escalation from the previous, slightly less stringent grounding that I\u2019d earned for an unexplained three-day disappearance and one episode of cliff diving.     Of course, I still saw Edward at school, because there wasn\u2019t anything Charlie could do about that. And then, Edward spent almost every night in my room, too, but Charlie wasn\u2019t precisely aware of that. Edward\u2019s ability to climb easily and silently through my second-story window was almost as useful as his ability to read Charlie\u2019s mind.     Though the afternoon was the only time I spent away from Edward, it was enough to make me restless, and the hours always dragged. Still, I endured my punishment without complaining because \u2014 for one thing \u2014 I knew I\u2019d earned it, and \u2014 for another \u2014 because I couldn\u2019t bear to hurt my dad by moving out now, when a much more permanent separation hovered, invisible to Charlie, so close on my horizon.    My dad sat down at the table with a grunt and unfolded the damp newspaper there; within seconds he was clucking his tongue in disapproval.  \u201cI don\u2019t know why you read the news, Dad. It only ticks you off.\u201d  He ignored me, grumbling at the paper in his hands. \u201cThis is why everyone wants to live in a small town! Ridiculous.\u201d  \u201cWhat have big cities done wrong now?\u201d  \u201cSeattle\u2019s making a run for murder capital of the country. Five unsolved homicides in the last two weeks. Can you imagine living like that?\u201d      \u201cI think Phoenix is actually higher up the homicide list, Dad. I have lived like that.\u201d And I\u2019d never come close to being a murder victim until after I moved to his safe little town. In fact, I was still on several hit lists. . . . The spoon shook in my hands, making the water tremble. \u201cWell, you couldn\u2019t pay me enough,\u201d Charlie said.     I gave up on saving dinner and settled for serving it; I had to use a steak knife to cut a portion of spaghetti for Charlie and then myself, while he watched with a sheepish expression. Charlie coated his helping with sauce and dug in. I disguised my own clump as well as I could and followed his example without much enthusiasm. We ate in silence for a moment. Charlie was still scanning the news, so I picked up my much-abused copy of Wuthering Heights from where I\u2019d left it this morning at breakfast, and tried to lose myself in turn-of-the-century England while I waited for him to start talking.     I was just to the part where Heathcliff returns when Charlie cleared his throat and threw the paper to the floor.  \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Charlie said. \u201cI did have a reason for doing this.\u201d He waved his fork at the gluey spread.  \u201cI wanted to talk to you.\u201d  I laid the book aside; the binding was so destroyed that it slumped flat to the table. \u201cYou could have just asked.\u201d  He nodded, his eyebrows pulling together. \u201cYeah. I\u2019ll remember that next time. I thought taking dinner off your hands would soften you up.\u201d     I laughed. \u201cIt worked \u2014 your cooking skills have me soft as a marshmallow. What do you need, Dad?\u201d  \u201cWell, it\u2019s about Jacob.\u201d  I felt my face harden. \u201cWhat about him?\u201d I asked through stiff lips.  \u201cEasy, Bells. I know you\u2019re still upset that he told on you, but it was the right thing. He was being responsible.\u201d  \u201cResponsible,\u201d I repeated scathingly, rolling my eyes. \u201cRight. So, what about Jacob?\u201d  The careless question repeated inside my head, anything but trivial.What about Jacob? What was I going to do about him? My former best friend who was now . . . what? My enemy? I cringed.    Charlie\u2019s face was suddenly wary. \u201cDon\u2019t get mad at me, okay?\u201d  \u201cMad?\u201d  \u201cWell, it\u2019s about Edward, too.\u201d  My eyes narrowed.  Charlie\u2019s voice got gruffer. \u201cI let him in the house, don\u2019t I?\u201d  \u201cYou do,\u201d I admitted. \u201cFor brief periods of time. Of course, you might let me out of the house for brief periods now and then, too,\u201d I continued \u2014 only jokingly; I knew I was on lockdown for the duration of the school year. \u201cI\u2019ve been pretty good lately.\u201d  \u201cWell, that\u2019s kind of where I was heading with this. . . .\u201d And then Charlie\u2019s face stretched into an unexpected eye-crinkling grin; for a second he looked twenty years younger.     I saw a dim glimmer of possibility in that smile, but I proceeded slowly. \u201cI\u2019m confused, Dad. Are we talking about Jacob, or Edward, or me being grounded?\u201d  The grin flashed again. \u201cSort of all three.\u201d  \u201cAnd how do they relate?\u201d I asked, cautious.  \u201cOkay.\u201d He sighed, raising his hands as if in surrender. \u201cSo I\u2019m thinking maybe you deserve a parole for good behavior. For a teenager, you\u2019re amazingly non-whiney.\u201d  My voice and eyebrows shot up. \u201cSeriously? I\u2019m free?\u201d  Where was this coming from? I\u2019d been positive I would be under house arrest until I actually moved out, and Edward hadn\u2019t picked up any wavering in Charlie\u2019s thoughts. . . .     Charlie held up one finger. \u201cConditionally.\u201d  The enthusiasm vanished. \u201cFantastic,\u201d I groaned.  \u201cBella, this is more of a request than a demand, okay? You\u2019re free. But I\u2019m hoping you\u2019ll use that freedom . . . judiciously.\u201d  \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d  He sighed again. \u201cI know you\u2019re satisfied to spend all of your time with Edward \u2014\u201d  \u201cI spend time with Alice, too,\u201d I interjected. Edward\u2019s sister had no hours of visitation; she came and went as she pleased. Charlie was putty in her capable hands.  \u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you have other friends besides the Cullens, Bella. Or you used to.\u201d     We stared at each other for a long moment.  \u201cWhen was the last time you spoke to Angela Weber?\u201d he threw at me.  \u201cFriday at lunch,\u201d I answered immediately.  Before Edward\u2019s return, my school friends had polarized into two groups. I liked to think of those groups as good vs.evil. Us and them worked, too. The good guys were Angela, her steady boyfriend Ben Cheney, and Mike Newton; these three had all very generously forgiven me for going crazy when Edward left. Lauren Mallory was the evil core of the them side, and almost everyone else, including my first friend in Forks, Jessica Stanley, seemed content to go along with her anti-Bella agenda.     With Edward back at school, the dividing line had become even more distinct.  Edward\u2019s return had taken its toll on Mike\u2019s friendship, but Angela was unswervingly loyal, and Ben followed her lead. Despite the natural aversion most humans felt toward the Cullens, Angela sat dutifully beside Alice every day at lunch. After a few weeks, Angela even looked comfortable there. It was difficult not to be charmed by the Cullens \u2014 once one gave them the chance to be charming.  \u201cOutside of school?\u201d Charlie asked, calling my attention back.     \u201cI haven\u2019t seen anyone outside of school, Dad. Grounded, remember? And Angela has a boyfriend, too. She\u2019s always with Ben.If I\u2019m really free,\u201d I added, heavy on the skepticism, \u201cmaybe we could double.\u201d  \u201cOkay. But then . . .\u201d He hesitated. \u201cYou and Jake used to be joined at the hip, and now \u2014\u201d  I cut him off. \u201cCan you get to the point, Dad? What\u2019s your condition \u2014 exactly?\u201d  \u201cI don\u2019t think you should dump all your other friends for your boyfriend, Bella,\u201d he said in a stern voice.  \u201cIt\u2019s not nice, and I think your life would be better balanced if you kept some other people in it. What happened last September . . .\u201d  I flinched.      \u201cWell,\u201d he said defensively. \u201cIf you\u2019d had more of a life outside of Edward Cullen, it might not have been like that.\u201d  \u201cIt would have been exactly like that,\u201d I muttered.  \u201cMaybe, maybe not.\u201d  \u201cThe point?\u201d I reminded him.  \u201cUse your new freedom to see your other friends, too. Keep it balanced.\u201d  I nodded slowly. \u201cBalance is good. Do I have specific time quotas to fill, though?\u201d  He made a face, but shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make this complicated. Just don\u2019t forget your friends . . .\u201d      It was a dilemma I was already struggling with. My friends. People who, for their own safety, I would never be able to see again after graduation.  So what was the better course of action? Spend time with them while I could? Or start the separation now to make it more gradual? I quailed at the idea of the second option.  \u201c. . . particularly Jacob,\u201d Charlie added before I could think things through more than that. A greater dilemma than the first. It took me a moment to find the right words. \u201cJacob might be . . . difficult.\u201d  \u201cThe Blacks are practically family, Bella,\u201d he said, stern and fatherly again. \u201cAnd Jacob has been a very, very good friend to you.\u201d  \u201cI know that.\u201d  \u201cDon\u2019t you miss him at all?\u201d Charlie asked, frustrated.    My throat suddenly felt swollen; I had to clear it twice before I answered. \u201cYes, I do miss him,\u201d I admitted, still looking down. \u201cI miss him a lot.\u201d  \u201cThen why is it difficult?\u201d It wasn\u2019t something I was at liberty to explain. It was against the rules for normal people \u2014human people like me and Charlie \u2014 to know about the clandestine world full of myths and monsters that existed secretly around us. I knew all about that world \u2014 and I was in no small amount of trouble as a result. I wasn\u2019t about to get Charlie in the same trouble. \u201cWith Jacob there is a . . . conflict,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cA conflict about the friendship thing, I mean. Friendship doesn\u2019t always seem to be enough for Jake.\u201d      I wound my excuse out of details that were true but insignificant, hardly crucial compared to the fact that Jacob\u2019s werewolf pack bitterly hated Edward\u2019s vampire family \u2014 and therefore me, too, as I fully intended to join that family. It just wasn\u2019t something I could work out with him in a note, and he wouldn\u2019t answer my calls. But my plan to deal with the werewolf in person had definitely not gone over well with the vampires.    \u201cIsn\u2019t Edward up for a little healthy competition?\u201d Charlie\u2019s voice was sarcastic now.  I leveled a dark look at him. \u201cThere\u2019s no competition.\u201d  \u201cYou\u2019re hurting Jake\u2019s feelings, avoiding him like this. He\u2019d rather be just friends than nothing.\u201d  Oh, now I was avoiding him?  \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Jake doesn\u2019t want to be friends at all.\u201d The words burned in my mouth. \u201cWhere\u2019d you get that idea, anyway?\u201d  Charlie looked embarrassed now. \u201cThe subject might have come up today with Billy. . . .\u201d  \u201cYou and Billy gossip like old women,\u201d I complained, stabbing my fork viciously into the congealed spaghetti on my plate.     \u201cBilly\u2019s worried about Jacob,\u201d Charlie said. \u201cJake\u2019s having a hard time right now. . . . He\u2019s depressed.\u201d  I winced, but kept my eyes on the blob.  \u201cAnd then you were always so happy after spending the day with Jake.\u201d Charlie sighed.  \u201cI\u2019m happy now,\u201d I growled fiercely through my teeth.  The contrast between my words and tone broke through the tension. Charlie burst into laughter, and I had to join in.  \u201cOkay, okay,\u201d I agreed. \u201cBalance.\u201d  \u201cAnd Jacob,\u201d he insisted.  \u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d      \u201cGood. Find that balance, Bella. And, oh, yeah, you\u2019ve got some mail,\u201d Charlie said, closing the subject with no attempt at subtlety. \u201cIt\u2019s by the stove.\u201d  I didn\u2019t move, my thoughts twisting into snarls around Jacob\u2019s name. It was most likely junk mail; I\u2019d just gotten a package from my mom yesterday and I wasn\u2019t expecting anything else.  Charlie shoved his chair away from the table and stretched as he got to his feet. He took his plate to the sink, but before he turned the water on to rinse it, he paused to toss a thick envelope at me. The letter skidded across the table and thunked into my elbow.      \u201cEr, thanks,\u201d I muttered, puzzled by his pushiness. Then I saw the return address \u2014 the letter was from the University of Alaska Southeast. \u201cThat was quick. I guess I missed the deadline on that one, too.\u201d  Charlie chuckled.  I flipped the envelope over and then glared up at him. \u201cIt\u2019s open.\u201d  \u201cI was curious.\u201d  \u201cI\u2019m shocked, Sheriff. That\u2019s a federal crime.\u201d  \u201cOh, just read it.\u201d  I pulled out the letter, and a folded schedule of courses.  \u201cCongratulations,\u201d he said before I could read anything. \u201cYour first acceptance.\u201d  \u201cThanks, Dad.\u201d     \u201cWe should talk about tuition. I\u2019ve got some money saved up \u2014\u201d  \u201cHey, hey, none of that. I\u2019m not touching your retirement, Dad. I\u2019ve got my college fund.\u201d What was left of it \u2014 and there hadn\u2019t been much to begin with.  Charlie frowned. \u201cSome of these places are pretty pricey, Bells. I want to help. You don\u2019t have to go to all the way to Alaska just because it\u2019s cheaper.\u201d     It wasn\u2019t cheaper, not at all. But it was far away, and Juneau had an average of three hundred twenty-one overcast days per year. The first was my prerequisite, the second was Edward\u2019s.  \u201cI\u2019ve got it covered. Besides, there\u2019s lots of financial aid out there. It\u2019s easy to get loans.\u201d I hoped my bluff wasn\u2019t too obvious. I hadn\u2019t actually done a lot of research on the subject.     \u201cSo . . . ,\u201d Charlie began, and then he pursed his lips and looked away.  \u201cSo what?\u201d  \u201cNothing. I was just . . .\u201d He frowned. \u201cJust wondering what . . . Edward\u2019s plans are for next year?\u201d  \u201cOh.\u201d  \u201cWell?\u201d  Three quick raps on the door saved me. Charlie rolled his eyes and I jumped up.  \u201cComing!\u201d I called while Charlie mumbled something that sounded like, \u201cGo away.\u201d I ignored him and went to let Edward in.     I wrenched the door out of my way \u2014 ridiculously eager \u2014 and there he was, my personal miracle. Time had not made me immune to the perfection of his face, and I was sure that I would never take any aspect of him for granted. My eyes traced over his pale white features: the hard square of his jaw, the softer curve of his full lips \u2014 twisted up into a smile now, the straight line of his nose, the sharp angle of his cheekbones, the smooth marble span of his forehead \u2014 partially obscured by a tangle of rain-darkened bronze hair. . . .     I saved his eyes for last, knowing that when I looked into them I was likely to lose my train of thought. They were wide, warm with liquid gold, and framed by a thick fringe of black lashes. Staring into his eyes always made me feel extraordinary \u2014 sort of like my bones were turning spongy. I was also a little lightheaded, but that could have been because I\u2019d forgotten to keep breathing. Again.  It was a face any male model in the world would trade his soul for. Of course, that might be exactly the asking price: one soul.  No. I didn\u2019t believe that. I felt guilty for even thinking it, and was glad \u2014 as I was often glad \u2014 that I was the one person whose thoughts were a mystery to Edward.     I reached for his hand, and sighed when his cold fingers found mine. His touch brought with it the strangest sense of relief \u2014 as if I\u2019d been in pain and that pain had suddenly ceased.  \u201cHey.\u201d I smiled a little at my anticlimactic greeting.  He raised our interlaced fingers to brush my cheek with the back of his hand. \u201cHow was your afternoon?\u201d  \u201cSlow.\u201d  \u201cFor me, as well.\u201d  He pulled my wrist up to his face, our hands still twisted together. His eyes closed as his nose skimmed along the skin there, and he smiled gently without opening them. Enjoying the bouquet while resisting the wine, as he\u2019d once put it.    I knew that the scent of my blood \u2014 so much sweeter to him than any other person\u2019s blood, truly like wine beside water to an alcoholic \u2014 caused him actual pain from the burning thirst it engendered. But he didn\u2019t seem to shy away from it as much as he once had. I could only dimly imagine the Herculean effort behind this simple gesture.",

            "en": "18         18. THE HUNT They emerged one by one from the forest edge, ranging a dozen meters apart. The first male into the clearing fell back immediately, allowing the other male to take the front, orienting himself around the tall, dark-haired man in a manner that clearly displayed who led the pack. The third was a woman; from this distance, all I could see of her was that her hair was a startling shade of red. They closed ranks before they continued cautiously toward Edward's family, exhibiting the natural respect of a troop of predators as it encounters a larger, unfamiliar group of its own kind. As they approached, I could see how different they were from the Cullens. Their walk was catlike, a gait that seemed constantly on the edge of shifting into a crouch. They dressed in the ordinary gear of backpackers:\u00a0 jeans and casual button-down shirts in heavy, weatherproof fabrics. The clothes were frayed, though, with wear, and they were barefoot. Both men had cropped hair, but the woman's brilliant orange hair was filled with leaves and debris from the woods. Their sharp eyes carefully took in the more polished, urbane stance of Carlisle, who, flanked by Emmett and Jasper, stepped guardedly forward to meet them. Without any seeming communication between them, they each straightened into a more casual, erect bearing. The man in front was easily the most beautiful, his skin olive-toned beneath the typical pallor, his hair a glossy black. He was of a medium build, hard-muscled, of course, but nothing next to Emmett's brawn. He smiled an easy smile, exposing a flash of gleaming white teeth. The woman was wilder, her eyes shifting restlessly between the men facing her, and the loose grouping around me, her chaotic hair quivering in the slight breeze. Her posture was distinctly feline. The second male hovered unobtrusively behind them, slighter than the leader, his light brown hair and regular features both nondescript. His eyes, though completely still, somehow seemed the most vigilant. Their eyes were different, too. Not the gold or black I had come to expect, but a deep burgundy color that was disturbing and sinister. The dark-haired man, still smiling, stepped toward Carlisle.  \"We thought we heard a game,\" he said in a relaxed voice with the slightest of French accents. \"I'm Laurent, these are Victoria and James.\" He gestured to the vampires beside him. \"I'm Carlisle. This is my family, Emmett and Jasper, Rosalie, Esme and Alice, Edward and Bella.\" He pointed us out in groups, deliberately not calling attention to individuals. I felt a shock when he said my name. \"Do you have room for a few more players?\" Laurent asked sociably. Carlisle matched Laurent's friendly tone. \"Actually, we were just finishing up. But we'd certainly be interested another time. Are you planning to stay in the area for long?\" \"We're headed north, in fact, but we were curious to see who was in the neighborhood. We haven't run into any company in a long time.\" \"No, this region is usually empty except for us and the occasional visitor, like yourselves.\" The tense atmosphere had slowly subsided into a casual conversation; I guessed that Jasper was using his peculiar gift to control the situation. \"What's your hunting range?\" Laurent casually inquired. Carlisle ignored the assumption behind the inquiry. \"The Olympic Range here, up and down the Coast Ranges on occasion. We keep a permanent residence nearby. There's another permanent settlement like ours up near Denali.\" Laurent rocked back on his heels slightly. \"Permanent? How do you manage that?\" There was honest curiosity in his voice. \"Why don't you come back to our home with us and we can talk comfortably?\" Carlisle invited. \"It's a rather long story.\" James and Victoria exchanged a surprised look at the mention of the word \"home,\" but Laurent controlled his expression better. \"That sounds very interesting, and welcome.\" His smile was genial. \"We've been on the hunt all the way down from Ontario, and we haven't had the chance to clean up in a while.\" His eyes moved appreciatively over Carlisle's refined appearance. \"Please don't take offense, but we'd appreciate it if you'd refrain from hunting in this immediate area. We have to stay inconspicuous, you understand,\" Carlisle explained. \"Of course.\" Laurent nodded. \"We certainly won't encroach on your territory. We just ate outside of Seattle, anyway,\" he laughed. A shiver ran up my spine. \"We'll show you the way if you'd like to run with us \u2014 Emmett and Alice, you can go with Edward and Bella to get the Jeep,\" he casually added. Three things seemed to happen simultaneously while Carlisle was speaking. My hair ruffled with the light breeze, Edward stiffened, and the second male, James, suddenly whipped his head around, scrutinizing me, his nostrils flaring. A swift rigidity fell on all of them as James lurched one step forward into a crouch. Edward bared his teeth, crouching in defense, a feral snarl ripping from his throat. It was nothing like the playful sounds I'd heard from him this morning; it was the single most menacing thing I had ever heard, and chills ran from the crown of my head to the back of my heels. \"What's this?\" Laurent exclaimed in open surprise. Neither James nor Edward relaxed their aggressive poses. James feinted slightly to the side, and Edward shifted in response. \"She's with us.\" Carlisle's firm rebuff was directed toward James. Laurent seemed to catch my scent less powerfully than James, but awareness now dawned on his face. \"You brought a snack?\" he asked, his expression incredulous as he took an involuntary step forward. Edward snarled even more ferociously, harshly, his lip curling high above his glistening, bared teeth. Laurent stepped back again. \"I said she's with us,\" Carlisle corrected in a hard voice. \"But she's human,\" Laurent protested. The words were not at all aggressive, merely astounded. \"Yes.\" Emmett was very much in evidence at Carlisle's side, his eyes on James. James slowly straightened out of his crouch, but his eyes never left me, his nostrils still wide. Edward stayed tensed like a lion in front of me. When Laurent spoke, his tone was soothing \u2014 trying to defuse the sudden hostility. \"It appears we have a lot to learn about each other.\" \"Indeed.\" Carlisle's voice was still cool. \"But we'd like to accept your invitation.\" His eyes flicked toward me and back to Carlisle. \"And, of course, we will not harm the human girl. We won't hunt in your range, as I said.\" James glanced in disbelief and aggravation at Laurent and exchanged another brief look with Victoria, whose eyes still flickered edgily from face to face. Carlisle measured Laurent's open expression for a moment before he spoke. \"We'll show you the way. Jasper, Rosalie, Esme?\" he called. They gathered together, blocking me from view as they converged. Alice was instantly at my side, and Emmett fell back slowly, his eyes locked on James as he backed toward us. \"Let's go, Bella.\" Edward's voice was low and bleak. This whole time I'd been rooted in place, terrified into absolute immobility. Edward had to grip my elbow and pull sharply to break my trance. Alice and Emmett were close behind us, hiding me. I stumbled alongside Edward, still stunned with fear. I couldn't hear if the main group had left yet. Edward's impatience was almost tangible as we moved at human speed to the forest edge. Once we were into the trees, Edward slung me over his back without breaking stride. I gripped as tightly as possible as he took off, the others close on his heels. I kept my head down, but my eyes, wide with fright, wouldn't close. They plunged through the now-black forest like wraiths. The sense of exhilaration that usually seemed to possess Edward as he ran was completely absent, replaced by a fury that consumed him and drove him still faster. Even with me on his back, the others trailed behind. We reached the Jeep in an impossibly short time, and Edward barely slowed as he flung me in the backseat. \"Strap her in,\" he ordered Emmett, who slid in beside me. Alice was already in the front seat, and Edward was starting the engine. It roared to life and we swerved backward, spinning around to face the winding road. Edward was growling something too fast for me to understand, but it sounded a lot like a string of profanities. The jolting trip was much worse this time, and the darkness only made it more frightening. Emmett and Alice both glared out the side windows. We hit the main road, and though our speed increased, I could see much better where we were going. And we were headed south, away from Forks. \"Where are we going?\" I asked. No one answered. No one even looked at me. \"Dammit, Edward! Where are you taking me?\" \"We have to get you away from here \u2014 far away \u2014 now.\" He didn't look back, his eyes on the road. The speedometer read a hundred and five miles an hour. \"Turn around! You have to take me home!\" I shouted. I struggled with the stupid harness, tearing at the straps. \"Emmett,\" Edward said grimly. And Emmett secured my hands in his steely grasp. \"No! Edward! No, you can't do this.\" \"I have to, Bella, now please be quiet.\" \"I won't! You have to take me back \u2014 Charlie will call the FBI! They'll be all over your family \u2014 Carlisle and Esme! They'll have to leave, to hide forever!\" \"Calm down, Bella.\" His voice was cold. \"We've been there before.\" \"Not over me, you don't! You're not ruining everything over me!\" I struggled violently, with total futility. Alice spoke for the first time. \"Edward, pull over.\" He flashed her a hard look, and then sped up. \"Edward, let's just talk this through.\" \"You don't understand,\" he roared in frustration. I'd never heard his voice so loud; it was deafening in the <em>confines</em> of the Jeep. The speedometer neared one hundred and fifteen. \"He's a tracker, Alice, did you see that? He's a tracker!\" I felt Emmett stiffen next to me, and I wondered at his reaction to the word. It meant something more to the three of them than it did to me; I wanted to understand, but there was no opening for me to ask. \"Pull over, Edward.\" Alice's tone was reasonable, but there was a ring of authority in it I'd never heard before. The speedometer inched passed one-twenty. \"Do it, Edward.\" \"Listen to me, Alice. I saw his mind. Tracking is his passion, his obsession \u2014 and he wants her, Alice \u2014 her, specifically. He begins the hunt tonight.\" \"He doesn't know where \u2014\" He interrupted her. \"How long do you think it will take him to cross her scent in town? His plan was already set before the words were out of Laurent's mouth.\" I gasped, knowing where my scent would lead. \"Charlie! You can't leave him there! You can't leave him!\" I thrashed against the harness. \"She's right,\" Alice said. The car slowed slightly. \"Let's just look at our options for a minute,\" Alice coaxed. The car slowed again, more noticeably, and then suddenly we screeched to a stop on the shoulder of the highway. I flew against the harness, and then slammed back into the seat. \"There are no options,\" Edward hissed. \"I'm not leaving Charlie!\" I yelled. He ignored me completely. \"We have to take her back,\" Emmett finally spoke. \"No.\" Edward was absolute. \"He's no match for us, Edward. He won't be able to touch her.\" \"He'll wait.\" Emmett smiled. \"I can wait, too.\" \"You didn't see \u2014 you don't understand. Once he commits to a hunt, he's unshakable. We'd have to kill him.\" Emmett didn't seem upset by the idea. \"That's an option.\" \"And the female. She's with him. If it turns into a fight, the leader will go with them, too.\" \"There are enough of us.\" \"There's another option,\" Alice said quietly. Edward turned on her in fury, his voice a blistering snarl. \"There \u2014 is \u2014 no \u2014 other \u2014 option!\" Emmett and I both stared at him in shock, but Alice seemed unsurprised. The silence lasted for a long minute as Edward and Alice stared each other down. I broke it. \"Does anyone want to hear my plan?\" \"No,\" Edward growled. Alice glared at him, finally provoked. \"Listen,\" I pleaded. \"You take me back.\" \"No,\" he interrupted. I glared at him and continued. \"You take me back. I tell my dad I want to go home to Phoenix. I pack my bags. We wait till this tracker is watching, and then we run. He'll follow us and leave Charlie alone. Charlie won't call the FBI on your family. Then you can take me any damned place you want.\" They stared at me, stunned. \"It's not a bad idea, really.\" Emmett's surprise was definitely an insult. \"It might work \u2014 and we simply can't leave her father unprotected. You know that,\" Alice said. Everyone looked at Edward. \"It's too dangerous \u2014 I don't want him within a hundred miles of her.\" Emmett was supremely confident. \"Edward, he's not getting through us.\" Alice thought for a minute. \"I don't see him attacking. He'll try to wait for us to leave her alone.\" \"It won't take long for him to realize that's not going to happen.\" \"I demand that you take me home.\" I tried to sound firm. Edward pressed his fingers to his temples and squeezed his eyes shut. \"Please,\" I said in a much smaller voice. He didn't look up. When he spoke, his voice sounded worn. \"You're leaving tonight, whether the tracker sees or not. You tell Charlie that you can't stand another minute in Forks. Tell him whatever story works. Pack the first things your hands touch, and then get in your truck. I don't care what he says to you. You have fifteen minutes. Do you hear me? Fifteen minutes from the time you cross the doorstep.\" The Jeep rumbled to life, and he spun us around, the tires squealing. The needle on the speedometer started to race up the dial.  \"Emmett?\" I asked, looking pointedly at my hands. \"Oh, sorry.\" He let me loose. A few minutes passed in silence, other than the roar of the engine. Then Edward spoke again. \"This is how it's going to happen. When we get to the house, if the tracker is not there, I will walk her to the door. Then she has fifteen minutes.\" He glared at me in the rearview mirror. \"Emmett, you take the outside of the house. Alice, you get the truck. I'll be inside as long as she is. After she's out, you two can take the Jeep home and tell Carlisle.\" \"No way,\" Emmett broke in. \"I'm with you.\" \"Think it through, Emmett. I don't know how long I'll be gone.\" \"Until we know how far this is going to go, I'm with you.\" Edward sighed. \"If the tracker is there,\" he continued grimly, \"we keep driving.\" \"We're going to make it there before him,\" Alice said confidently. Edward seemed to accept that. Whatever his problem with Alice was, he didn't doubt her now. \"What are we going to do with the Jeep?\" she asked. His voice had a hard edge. \"You're driving it home.\" \"No, I'm not,\" she said calmly. The unintelligible stream of profanities started again. \"We can't all fit in my truck,\" I whispered. Edward didn't appear to hear me. \"I think you should let me go alone,\" I said even more quietly. He heard that. \"Bella, please just do this my way, just this once,\" he said between clenched teeth. \"Listen, Charlie's not an imbecile,\" I protested. \"If you're not in town tomorrow, he's going to get suspicious.\" \"That's irrelevant. We'll make sure he's safe, and that's all that matters.\" \"Then what about this tracker? He saw the way you acted tonight. He's going to think you're with me, wherever you are.\" Emmett looked at me, insultingly surprised again. \"Edward, listen to her,\" he urged. \"I think she's right.\" \"Yes, she is,\" Alice agreed. \"I can't do that.\" Edward's voice was icy. \"Emmett should stay, too,\" I continued. \"He definitely got an eyeful of Emmett.\" \"What?\" Emmett turned on me. \"You'll get a better crack at him if you stay,\" Alice agreed. Edward stared at her incredulously. \"You think I should let her go alone?\" \"Of course not,\" Alice said. \"Jasper and I will take her.\" \"I can't do that,\" Edward repeated, but this time there was a trace of defeat in his voice. The logic was working on him. I tried to be persuasive. \"Hang out here for a week \u2014\" I saw his expression in the mirror and amended \"\u2014 a few days. Let Charlie see you haven't kidnapped me, and lead this James on a wild-goose chase. Make\u00a0 sure he's completely off my trail. Then come and meet me. Take a roundabout route, of course, and then Jasper and Alice can go home.\" I could see him beginning to consider it. \"Meet you where?\" \"Phoenix.\" Of course. \"No. He'll hear that's where you're going,\" he said impatiently. \"And you'll make it look like that's a ruse, obviously. He'll know that we'll know that he's listening. He'll never believe I'm actually going where I say I am going.\" \"She's diabolical,\" Emmett chuckled. \"And if that doesn't work?\" \"There are several million people in Phoenix,\" I informed him. \"It's not that hard to find a phone book.\" \"I won't go home.\" \"Oh?\" he inquired, a dangerous note in his voice. \"I'm quite old enough to get my own place.\" \"Edward, we'll be with her,\" Alice reminded him. \"What are you going to do in Phoenix?\" he asked her scathingly. \"Stay indoors.\" \"I kind of like it.\" Emmett was thinking about cornering James, no doubt. \"Shut up, Emmett.\" \"Look, if we try to take him down while she's still around, there's a much better chance that someone will get hurt \u2014 she'll get hurt, or you will, trying to protect her. Now, if we get him alone\u2026\" He trailed off with a slow smile. I was right. The Jeep was crawling slowly along now as we drove into town. Despite my brave talk, I could feel the hairs on my arms standing up. I thought about Charlie, alone in the house, and tried to be courageous. \"Bella.\" Edward's voice was very soft. Alice and Emmett looked out their windows. \"If you let anything happen to yourself\u2014 anything at all \u2014 I'm holding you personally responsible. Do you understand that?\" \"Yes,\" I gulped. He turned to Alice. \"Can Jasper handle this?\" \"Give him some credit, Edward. He's been doing very, very well, all things considered.\" \"Can you handle this?\" he asked. And graceful little Alice pulled back her lips in a horrific grimace and let loose with a guttural snarl that had me cowering against the seat in terror. Edward smiled at her. \"But keep your opinions to yourself,\" he muttered suddenly.",
