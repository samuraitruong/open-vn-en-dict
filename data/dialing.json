            "en": "21          21. PHONE CALL I could feel it was too early again when I woke, and I knew I was getting the schedule of my days and nights slowly reversed. I lay in my bed and listened to the quiet voices of Alice and Jasper in the other room. That they were loud enough for me to hear at all was strange. I rolled till my feet touched the floor and then staggered to the living room. The clock on the TV said it was just after two in the morning. Alice and Jasper were sitting together on the sofa, Alice sketching again while Jasper looked over her shoulder. They didn't look up when I entered, too engrossed in Alice's work. I crept to Jasper's side to peek. \"Did she see something more?\" I asked him quietly. \"Yes. Something's brought him back to the room with the VCR, but it's light now.\" I watched as Alice drew a square room with dark beams across its low ceiling. The walls were paneled in wood, a little too dark, out of date.  The floor had a dark carpet with a pattern in it. There was a large window against the south wall, and an opening through the west wall led to the living room. One side of that entrance was stone \u2014 a large tan stone fireplace that was open to both rooms. The focus of the room from this perspective, the TV and VCR, balanced on a too-small wooden stand, were in the southwest corner of the room. An aged sectional sofa curved around in front of the TV, a round coffee table in front of it. \"The phone goes there,\" I whispered, pointing. Two pairs of eternal eyes stared at me. \"That's my mother's house.\" Alice was already off the couch, phone in hand, <em>dialing</em>. I stared at the precise rendering of my mother's family room. Uncharacteristically, Jasper slid closer to me. He lightly touched his hand to my shoulder, and the physical contact seemed to make his calming influence stronger. The panic stayed dull, unfocused. Alice's lips were trembling with the speed of her words, the low buzzing impossible to decipher. I couldn't concentrate. \"Bella,\" Alice said. I looked at her numbly. \"Bella, Edward is coming to get you. He and Emmett and Carlisle are going to take you somewhere, to hide you for a while.\" \"Edward is coming?\" The words were like a life vest, holding my head above the flood. \"Yes, he's catching the first flight out of Seattle. We'll meet him at the airport, and you'll leave with him.\" \"But, my mother\u2026 he came here for my mother, Alice!\" Despite Jasper, the hysteria bubbled up in my voice. \"Jasper and I will stay till she's safe.\" \"I can't win, Alice. You can't guard everyone I know forever. Don't you see what he's doing? He's not tracking me at all. He'll find someone, he'll hurt someone I love\u2026 Alice, I can't \u2014\" \"We'll catch him, Bella,\" she assured me. \"And what if you get hurt, Alice? Do you think that's okay with me? Do you think it's only my human family he can hurt me with?\" Alice looked meaningfully at Jasper. A deep, heavy fog of lethargy washed over me, and my eyes closed without my permission. My mind struggled against the fog, realizing what was happening. I forced my eyes open and stood up, stepping away from Jasper's hand. \"I don't want to go back to sleep,\" I snapped. I walked to my room and shut the door, slammed it really, so I could be free to go to pieces privately. This time Alice didn't follow me. For three and a half hours I stared at the wall, curled in a ball, rocking. My mind went around in circles, trying to come up with some way out of this nightmare. There was no escape, no reprieve. I could see only one possible end looming darkly in my future. The only question was how many other people would be hurt before I reached it. The only solace, the only hope I had left, was knowing that I would see Edward soon. Maybe, if I could just see his face again, I would also be able to see the solution that eluded me now. When the phone rang, I returned to the front room, a little ashamed of my behavior. I hoped I hadn't offended either of them, that they would know how grateful I was for the sacrifices they were making on my account. Alice was talking as rapidly as ever, but what caught my attention was that, for the first time, Jasper was not in the room. I looked at the clock \u2014 it was five-thirty in the morning. \"They're just boarding their plane,\" Alice told me. \"They'll land at nine-forty-five.\" Just a few more hours to keep breathing till he was here. \"Where's Jasper?\" \"He went to check out.\" \"You aren't staying here?\" \"No, we're relocating closer to your mother's house.\" My stomach twisted uneasily at her words. But the phone rang again, distracting me. She looked surprised, but I was already walking forward, reaching hopefully for the phone. \"Hello?\" Alice asked. \"No, she's right here.\" She held the phone out to me. Your mother, she mouthed. \"Hello?\" \"Bella? Bella?\" It was my mother's voice, in a familiar tone I had heard a thousand times in my childhood, anytime I'd gotten too close to the edge of the sidewalk or strayed out of her sight in a crowded place. It was the sound of panic. I sighed. I'd been expecting this, though I'd tried to make my message as unalarming as possible without lessening the urgency of it. \"Calm down, Mom,\" I said in my most soothing voice, walking slowly away from Alice. I wasn't sure if I could lie as convincingly with her eyes on me. \"Everything is fine, okay? Just give me a minute and I'll explain everything, I promise.\" I paused, surprised that she hadn't interrupted me yet. \"Mom?\" \"Be very careful not to say anything until I tell you to.\" The voice I heard now was as unfamiliar as it was unexpected. It was a man's tenor voice, a very pleasant, generic voice \u2014 the kind of voice that you heard in the background of luxury car commercials. He spoke very quickly. \"Now, I don't need to hurt your mother, so please do exactly as I say, and she'll be fine.\" He paused for a minute while I listened in mute horror. \"That's very good,\" he congratulated. \"Now repeat after me, and do try to sound natural. Please say, 'No, Mom, stay where you are.'\" \"No, Mom, stay where you are.\" My voice was barely more than a whisper. \"I can see this is going to be difficult.\" The voice was amused, still light and friendly. \"Why don't you walk into another room now so your face doesn't ruin everything? There's no reason for your mother to suffer. As you're walking, please say, 'Mom, please listen to me.' Say it now.\" \"Mom, please listen to me,\" my voice pleaded. I walked very slowly to the bedroom, feeling Alice's worried stare on my back. I shut the door behind me, trying to think clearly through the terror that gripped my brain. \"There now, are you alone? Just answer yes or no.\"  \"Yes.\" \"But they can still hear you, I'm sure.\" \"Yes.\" \"All right, then,\" the agreeable voice continued, \"say, 'Mom, trust me.'\" \"Mom, trust me.\" \"This worked out rather better than I expected. I was prepared to wait, but your mother arrived ahead of schedule. It's easier this way, isn't it? Less suspense, less anxiety for you.\" I waited. \"Now I want you to listen very carefully. I'm going to need you to get away from your friends; do you think you can do that? Answer yes or no.\" \"No.\" \"I'm sorry to hear that. I was hoping you would be a little more creative than that. Do you think you could get away from them if your mother's life depended on it? Answer yes or no.\" Somehow, there had to be a way. I remembered that we were going to the airport. Sky Harbor International Airport: crowded, confusingly laid out\u2026 \"Yes.\" \"That's better. I'm sure it won't be easy, but if I get the slightest hint that you have any company, well, that would be very bad for your mother,\" the friendly voice promised. \"You must know enough about us by now to realize how quickly I would know if you tried to bring anyone along with you. And how little time I would need to deal with your mother if that was the case. Do you understand? Answer yes or no.\" \"Yes.\" My voice broke. \"Very good, Bella. Now this is what you have to do. I want you to go to your mother's house. Next to the phone there will be a number. Call it, and I'll tell you where to go from there.\" I already knew where I would go, and where this would end. But I would follow his instructions exactly. \"Can you do that? Answer yes or no.\" \"Yes.\" \"Before noon, please, Bella. I haven't got all day,\" he said politely. \"Where's Phil?\" I asked tersely. \"Ah, be careful now, Bella. Wait until I ask you to speak, please.\" I waited. \"It's important, now, that you don't make your friends suspicious when you go back to them.  Tell them that your mother called, and that you talked her out of coming home for the time being. Now repeat after me, 'Thank you, Mom.' Say it now.\" \"Thank you, Mom.\" The tears were coming. I tried to fight them back. \"Say, 'I love you, Mom, I'll see you soon.' Say it now.\" \"I love you, Mom.\" My voice was thick. \"I'll see you soon,\" I promised. \"Goodbye, Bella. I look forward to seeing you again.\" He hung up. I held the phone to my ear. My joints were frozen with terror \u2014 I couldn't unbend my fingers to drop it. I knew I had to think, but my head was filled with the sound of my mother's panic. Seconds ticked by while I fought for control.  Slowly, slowly, my thoughts started to break past that brick wall of pain. To plan. For I had no choices now but one: to go to the mirrored room and die. I had no guarantees, nothing to give to keep my mother alive. I could only hope that James would be satisfied with winning the game, that beating Edward would be enough. Despair gripped me; there was no way to bargain, nothing I could offer or withhold that could influence him. But I still had no choice. I had to try. I pushed the terror back as well as I could. My decision was made. It did no good to waste time agonizing over the outcome. I had to think clearly, because Alice and Jasper were waiting for me, and evading them was absolutely essential, and absolutely impossible. I was suddenly grateful that Jasper was gone. If he had been here to feel my anguish in the last five minutes, how could I have kept them from being suspicious? I choked back the dread, the anxiety, tried to stifle it. I couldn't afford it now. I didn't know when he would return. I concentrated on my escape. I had to hope that my familiarity with the airport would turn the odds in my favor. Somehow, I had to keep Alice away\u2026 I knew Alice was in the other room waiting for me, curious. But I had to deal with one more thing in private, before Jasper was back. I had to accept that I wouldn't see Edward again, not even one last glimpse of his face to carry with me to the mirror room. I was going to hurt him, and I couldn't say goodbye. I let the waves of torture wash over me, have their way for a time. Then I pushed them back, too, and went to face Alice. The only expression I could manage was a dull, dead look. I saw her alarm and I didn't wait for her to ask. I had just one script and I'd never manage improvisation now. \"My mom was worried, she wanted to come home. But it's okay, I convinced her to stay away.\" My voice was lifeless. \"We'll make sure she's fine, Bella, don't worry.\" I turned away; I couldn't let her see my face. My eye fell on a blank page of the hotel stationery on the desk. I went to it slowly, a plan forming. There was an envelope there, too. That was good. \"Alice,\" I asked slowly, without turning, keeping my voice level. \"If I write a letter for my mother, would you give it to her? Leave it at the house, I mean.\" \"Sure, Bella.\" Her voice was careful. She could see me coming apart at the seams. I had to keep my emotions under better control.  I went into the bedroom again, and knelt next to the little bedside table to write. \"Edward,\" I wrote. My hand was shaking, the letters were hardly legible. I love you. I am so sorry. He has my mom, and I have to try. I know it may not work. I am so very, very sorry. Don't be angry with Alice and Jasper. If I get away from them it will be a miracle. Tell them thank you for me. Alice especially, please.  And please, please, don't come after him. That's what he wants. I think.  I can't bear it if anyone has to be hurt because of me, especially you. Please, this is the only thing I can ask you now. For me. I love you. Forgive me. Bella I folded the letter carefully, and sealed it in the envelope. Eventually he would find it. I only hoped he would understand, and listen to me just this once. And then I carefully sealed away my heart.",

            "en": "6            6. SWITZERLAND AS I DROVE HOME , I WASN\u2019T PAYING MUCH ATTENTION TO the road that shimmered wetly in the sun. I was thinking about the flood of information Jacob had shared with me, trying to sort it out, to force it all to make sense. Despite the overload, I felt lighter. Seeing Jacob smile, having all the secrets thrashed out . . . it didn\u2019t make things perfect, but it made them better. I was right to have gone. Jacob needed me. And obviously, I thought as I squinted into the glare, there was no danger. It came out of nowhere. One minute there was nothing but bright highway in my rearview mirror. The next minute, the sun was glinting off a silver Volvo right on my tail. \u201cAw, crap,\u201d I whimpered. I considered pulling over. But I was too much of a coward to face him right away. I\u2019d been counting on some prep time . . . and having Charlie nearby as a buffer. At least that would force him to keep his voice down. The Volvo followed inches behind me. I kept my eyes on the road ahead. Chicken through and through, I drove straight to Angela\u2019s without once meeting the gaze I could feel burning a hole in my mirror. He followed me until I pulled to the curb in front of the Webers\u2019 house. He didn\u2019t stop, and I didn\u2019t look up as he passed. I didn\u2019t want to see the expression on his face. I ran up the short concrete walk to Angela\u2019s door as soon as he was out of sight. Ben answered the door before I could finish knocking, like he\u2019d been standing right behind it. \u201cHey, Bella!\u201d he said, surprised. \u201cHi, Ben. Er, is Angela here?\u201d I wondered if Angela had forgotten our plans, and cringed at the thought of going home early. \u201cSure,\u201d Ben said just as Angela called, \u201cBella!\u201d and appeared at the top of the stairs. Ben peered around me as we both heard the sound of a car on the road; the sound didn\u2019t scare me \u2014 this engine stuttered to a stop, followed by the loud pop of a backfire. Nothing like the purr of the Volvo. This must be the visitor Ben had been waiting for. \u201cAustin\u2019s here,\u201d Ben said as Angela reached his side. A horn honked on the street. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll see you later,\u201d Ben promised. \u201cMiss you already.\u201d He threw his arm around Angela\u2019s neck and pulled her face down to his height so that he could kiss her enthusiastically. After a second of this, Austin honked again. \u201c\u2019Bye, Ang! Love you!\u201d Ben shouted as he dashed past me. Angela swayed, her face slightly pink, then recovered herself and waved until Ben and Austin were out of sight. Then she turned to me and grinned ruefully. \u201cThank you for doing this, Bella,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom the bottom of my heart. Not only are you saving my hands from permanent injury, you also just spared me two long hours of a plot-less, badly dubbed martial arts film.\u201d She sighed in relief. \u201cHappy to be of service.\u201d I was feeling a bit less panicked, able to breathe a little more evenly. It felt so ordinary here. Angela\u2019s easy human dramas were oddly reassuring. It was nice to know that life was normal somewhere . I followed Angela up the stairs to her room. She kicked toys out of the way as she went. The house was unusually quiet. \u201cWhere\u2019s your family?\u201d \u201cMy parents took the twins to a birthday party in Port Angeles. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re really going to help me with this. Ben\u2019s pretending he has tendonitis.\u201d She made a face. \u201cI don\u2019t mind at all,\u201d I said, and then I walked into Angela\u2019s room and saw the stacks of waiting envelopes. \u00a0\u201cOh!\u201d I gasped. Angela turned to look at me, apologies in her eyes. I could see why she\u2019d been putting this off, and why Ben had weaseled out. \u201cI thought you were exaggerating,\u201d I admitted. \u201cI wish. Are you sure you want to do this?\u201d \u201cPut me to work. I\u2019ve got all day.\u201d Angela divided a pile in half and put her mother\u2019s address book between us on her desk. For a while we concentrated, and there was just the sound of our pens scratching quietly across the paper. \u201cWhat\u2019s Edward doing tonight?\u201d she asked after a few minutes. My pen dug into the envelope I was working on. \u201cEmmet\u2019s home for the weekend. They\u2019re supposed to be hiking.\u201d \u201cYou say that like you\u2019re not sure.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky Edward has his brothers for all the hiking and camping. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do if Ben didn\u2019t have Austin for the guy stuff.\u201d \u201cYeah, the outdoors thing is not really for me. And there\u2019s no way I\u2019d ever be able to keep up.\u201d Angela laughed. \u201cI prefer the indoors myself.\u201d She focused on her pile for a minute. I wrote out four more addresses. There was never any pressure to fill a pause with meaningless chatter around Angela. Like Charlie, she was comfortable with silence. But, like Charlie, she was also too observant sometimes. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d she asked in a low voice now. \u201cYou seem . . . anxious.\u201d I smiled sheepishly. \u201cIs it that obvious?\u201d \u201cNot really.\u201d She was probably lying to make me feel better. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to talk about it unless you want to,\u201d she assured me. \u201cI\u2019ll listen if you think it will help.\u201d I was about to say thanks, but no thanks . After all, there were just too many secrets I was bound to keep. I really couldn\u2019t discuss my problems with someone human. That was against the rules. And yet, with a strange, sudden intensity, that\u2019s exactly what I wanted. I wanted to talk to a normal human girlfriend. I wanted to moan a little bit, like any other teenage girl. I wanted my problems to be that simple. It would also be nice to have someone outside the whole vampire-werewolf mess to put things in perspective. Someone unbiased. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll mind my own business,\u201d Angela promised, smiling down at the address she was working on. \u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I am anxious. It\u2019s . . . it\u2019s Edward.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d It was so easy to talk to Angela. When she asked a question like that, I could tell that she wasn\u2019t just morbidly curious or looking for gossip, like Jessica would have been. She cared that I was upset. \u201cOh, he\u2019s mad at me.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s hard to imagine,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s he mad about?\u201d I sighed. \u201cDo you remember Jacob Black?\u201d \u201cAh,\u201d she said. \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s jealous.\u201d \u201cNo, not jealous . . .\u201d I should have kept my mouth shut. There was no way to explain this right. But I wanted to keep talking anyway. I hadn\u2019t realized I was so starved for human conversation. \u201cEdward thinks Jacob is . . . a bad influence, I guess. Sort of . . . dangerous. You know how much trouble I got in a few months back. . . . It\u2019s all ridiculous, though.\u201d I was surprised to see Angela shaking her head. \u201cWhat?\u201d I asked. \u201cBella, I\u2019ve seen how Jacob Black looks at you. I\u2019d bet the real problem is jealousy.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not like that with Jacob.\u201d \u201cFor you, maybe. But for Jacob . . .\u201d I frowned. \u201cJacob knows how I feel. I\u2019ve told him everything.\u201d \u201cEdward\u2019s only human, Bella. He\u2019s going to react like any other boy.\u201d I grimaced. I didn\u2019t have a response to that. She patted my hand. \u201cHe\u2019ll get over it.\u201d \u201cI hope so. Jake\u2019s going through kind of a tough time. He needs me.\u201d \u201cYou and Jacob are pretty close, aren\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cLike family,\u201d I agreed. \u201cAnd Edward doesn\u2019t like him. . . . That must be hard. I wonder how Ben would handle that?\u201d she mused. I half-smiled. \u201cProbably just like any other boy.\u201d She grinned. \u201cProbably.\u201d Then she changed the subject. Angela wasn\u2019t one to pry, and she seemed to sense I wouldn\u2019t \u2014 couldn\u2019t \u2014 say any more. \u201cI got my dorm assignment yesterday. The farthest building from campus, naturally.\u201d \u00a0\u201cDoes Ben know where he\u2019s staying yet?\u201d \u201cThe closest dorm to campus. He\u2019s got all the luck. How about you? Did you decide where you\u2019re going?\u201d I stared down, concentrating on the clumsy scrawl of my handwriting. For a second I was distracted by the thought of Angela and Ben at the University of Washington. They would be off to Seattle in just a few months. Would it be safe then? Would the wild young vampire menace have moved elsewhere? Would there be a new place by then, some other city flinching from horror-movie headlines? Would those new headlines be my fault? I tried to shake it off and answered her question a beat late. \u201cAlaska, I think. The university there in Juneau.\u201d I could hear the surprise in her voice. \u201cAlaska? Oh. Really? I mean, that\u2019s great. I just figured you\u2019d go somewhere . . . warmer.\u201d I laughed a little, still staring at the envelope. \u201cYeah. Forks has really changed my perspective on life.\u201d \u00a0\u201cAnd Edward?\u201d Though his name set butterflies fluttering in my stomach, I looked up and grinned at her. \u201cAlaska\u2019s not too cold for Edward, either.\u201d She grinned back. \u201cOf course not.\u201d And then she sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s so far. You won\u2019t be able to come home very often. I\u2019ll miss you. Will you e-mail me?\u201d A swell of quiet sadness crashed over me; maybe it was a mistake to get closer to Angela now. But wouldn\u2019t it be sadder still to miss out on these last chances? I shook off the unhappy thoughts, so that I could answer her teasingly. \u201cIf I can type again after this.\u201d I nodded toward the stack of envelopes I\u2019d done. We laughed, and it was easy then to chat cheerfully about classes and majors while we finished the rest \u2014 all I had to do was not think about it. Anyway, there were more urgent things to worry about today. I helped her put the stamps on, too. I was afraid to leave. \u201cHow\u2019s your hand?\u201d she asked. I flexed my fingers. \u201cI think I\u2019ll recover the full use of it . . . someday.\u201d The door banged downstairs, and we both looked up. \u201cAng?\u201d Ben called. I tried to smile, but my lips trembled. \u201cI guess that\u2019s my cue to leave.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go. Though he\u2019s probably going to describe the movie for me . . . in detail.\u201d \u201cCharlie will be wondering where I am anyway.\u201d \u201cThanks for helping me.\u201d \u201cI had a good time, actually. We should do something like this again. It was nice to have some girl time.\u201d \u201cDefinitely.\u201d There was a light knock on the bedroom door. \u201cCome in, Ben,\u201d Angela said. I got up and stretched. \u201cHey, Bella! You survived,\u201d Ben greeted me quickly before going to take my place by Angela. He eyed\u00a0 our work. \u201cNice job. Too bad there\u2019s nothing left to do, I would have . . .\u201d He let the thought trail off, and then restarted excitedly. \u201cAng, I can\u2019t believe you missed this one! It was awesome. There was this final fight sequence \u2014 the choreography was unbelievable! This one guy \u2014 well, you\u2019re going to have to see it to know what I\u2019m talking about \u2014\u201d Angela rolled her eyes at me. \u201cSee you at school,\u201d I said with a nervous laugh. She sighed. \u201cSee you.\u201d I was jumpy on the way out to my truck, but the street was empty. I spent the whole drive glancing anxiously in all my mirrors, but there was never any sign of the silver car. His car was not in front of the house, either, though that meant little. \u201cBella?\u201d Charlie called when I opened the front door. \u201cHey, Dad.\u201d I found him in the living room, in front of the TV. \u00a0\u201cSo, how was your day?\u201d \u201cGood,\u201d I said. Might as well tell him everything \u2014 he\u2019d hear it from Billy soon enough. Besides, it would make him happy. \u201cThey didn\u2019t need me at work, so I went down to La Push.\u201d There wasn\u2019t enough surprise in his face. Billy had already talked to him. \u201cHow\u2019s Jacob?\u201d Charlie asked, attempting to sound indifferent. \u201cGood,\u201d I said, just as casual. \u201cYou get over to the Webers\u2019?\u201d \u201cYep. We got all her announcements addressed.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s nice.\u201d Charlie smiled a wide smile. He was strangely focused, considering that there was a game on. \u201cI\u2019m glad you spent some time with your friends today.\u201d \u201cMe, too.\u201d I ambled toward the kitchen, looking for busy work. Unfortunately, Charlie had already cleaned up his lunch. I stood there for a few minutes, staring at the bright patch of light the sun made on the floor. But I knew I couldn\u2019t delay this forever. .  \u201cI\u2019m going to go study,\u201d I announced glumly as I headed up the stairs. \u201cSee you later,\u201d Charlie called after me. If I survive, I thought to myself. I shut my bedroom door carefully before I turned to face my room. Of course he was there. He stood against the wall across from me, in the shadow beside the open window. His face was hard and his posture tense. He glared at me wordlessly.  I cringed, waiting for the torrent, but it didn\u2019t come. He just continued to glare, possibly too angry to speak. \u201cHi,\u201d I finally said. His face could have been carved from stone. I counted to a hundred in my head, but there was no change. \u201cEr . . . so, I\u2019m still alive,\u201d I began. A growl rumbled low in his chest, but his expression didn\u2019t change. \u00a0\u201cNo harm done,\u201d I insisted with a shrug. He moved. His eyes closed, and he pinched the bridge of his nose between the fingers of his right hand. \u201cBella,\u201d he whispered. \u201cDo you have any idea how close I came to crossing the line today? To breaking the treaty and coming after you? Do you know what that would have meant?\u201d I gasped and his eyes opened. They were as cold and hard as night. \u00a0\u201cYou can\u2019t!\u201d I said too loudly. I worked to modulate the volume of my voice so Charlie wouldn\u2019t hear, but I wanted to shout the words. \u201cEdward, they\u2019d use any excuse for a fight. They\u2019d love that. You can\u2019t ever break the rules!\u201d \u201cMaybe they aren\u2019t the only ones who would enjoy a fight.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you start,\u201d I snapped. \u201cYou made the treaty \u2014 you stick to it.\u201d \u201cIf he\u2019d hurt you \u2014\u201d \u201cEnough!\u201d I cut him off. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to worry about. Jacob isn\u2019t dangerous.\u201d \u00a0\u201cBella.\u201d He rolled his eyes. \u201cYou aren\u2019t exactly the best judge of what is or isn\u2019t dangerous.\u201d \u201cI know I don\u2019t have to worry about Jake. And neither do you.\u201d He ground his teeth together. His hands were balled up in fists at his sides. He was still standing against the wall, and I hated the space between us. I took a deep breath, and crossed the room. He didn\u2019t move when I wrapped my arms around him. Next to the warmth of the last of the afternoon sun streaming through the window, his skin felt especially icy. He seemed like ice, too, frozen the way he was. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry I made you anxious,\u201d I muttered. He sighed, and relaxed a little. His arms wound around my waist. \u201cAnxious is a bit of an understatement,\u201d he murmured. \u201cIt was a very long day.\u201d \u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to know about it,\u201d I reminded him. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be hunting longer.\u201d I looked up at his face, at his defensive eyes; I hadn\u2019t noticed in the stress of the moment, but they were too dark. The rings under them were deep purple. I frowned in disapproval. \u00a0\u201cWhen Alice saw you disappear, I came back,\u201d he explained. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have done that. Now you\u2019ll have to go away again.\u201d My frown intensified. \u201cI can wait.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. I mean, I know she couldn\u2019t see me with Jacob, but you should have known \u2014\u201d \u201cBut I didn\u2019t,\u201d he broke in. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t expect me to let you \u2014\u201d \u201cOh, yes, I can,\u201d I interrupted him. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I expect \u2014\u201d \u201cThis won\u2019t happen again.\u201d \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s right! Because you\u2019re not going to overreact next time.\u201d \u201cBecause there isn\u2019t going to be a next time.\u201d \u201cI understand when you have to leave, even if I don\u2019t like it \u2014\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not the same. I\u2019m not risking my life.\u201d \u201cNeither am I.\u201d \u201cWerewolves constitute a risk.\u201d \u00a0\u201cI disagree.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not negotiating this, Bella.\u201d \u201cNeither am I.\u201d His hands were in fists again. I could feel them against my back. The words popped out thoughtlessly. \u201cIs this really just about my safety?\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he demanded. \u00a0\u201cYou aren\u2019t . . .\u201d Angela\u2019s theory seemed sillier now than before. It was hard to finish the thought. \u201cI mean, you know better than to be jealous, right?\u201d He raised one eyebrow. \u201cDo I?\u201d \u201cBe serious.\u201d \u201cEasily \u2014 there\u2019s nothing remotely humorous about this.\u201d I frowned suspiciously. \u201cOr . . . is this something else altogether? Some vampires-and-werewolves-are-always-enemies nonsense? Is this just a testosterone-fueled \u2014\u201d His eyes blazed. \u201cThis is only about you. All I care is that you\u2019re safe.\u201d The black fire in his eyes was impossible to doubt. \u201cOkay,\u201d I sighed. \u201cI believe that. But I want you to know something \u2014 when it comes to all this enemies nonsense, I\u2019m out. I am a neutral country. I am Switzerland. I refuse to be affected by territorial disputes between mythical creatures. Jacob is family. You are . . . well, not exactly the love of my life, because I expect to love you for much longer than that. The love of my existence. I don\u2019t care who\u2019s a werewolf and who\u2019s a vampire. \u00a0If Angela turns out to be a witch, she can join the party, too.\u201d He stared at me silently through narrowed eyes. \u201cSwitzerland,\u201d I repeated again for emphasis. He frowned at me, and then sighed. \u201cBella . . . ,\u201d he began, but he paused, and his nose wrinkled in disgust. \u201cWhat now?\u201d \u201cWell . . . don\u2019t be offended, but you smell like a dog,\u201d he told me. And then he smiled crookedly, so I knew the fight was over. For now. Edward had to make up for the missed hunting trip, and so he was leaving Friday night with Jasper, Emmett, and Carlisle to hit some reserve in Northern California with a mountain lion problem. We\u2019d come to no agreement on the werewolf issue, but I didn\u2019t feel guilty calling Jake \u2014 during my brief window of opportunity when Edward took the Volvo home before climbing back in through my window \u2014 to let him know I\u2019d be coming over on Saturday again. It wasn\u2019t sneaking around. Edward knew how I felt. And if he broke my truck again, then I\u2019d have Jacob pick me up. Forks was neutral, just like Switzerland \u2014 just like me. So when I got off work Thursday and it was Alice rather than Edward waiting for me in the Volvo, I was not suspicious at first. The passenger door was open, and music I didn\u2019t recognize was shaking the frame when the bass played. \u201cHey, Alice,\u201d I shouted over the wailing as I climbed in. \u201cWhere\u2019s your brother?\u201d She was singing along to the song, her voice an octave higher than the melody, weaving through it with a complicated harmony. She nodded at me, ignoring my question as she concentrated on the music. I shut my door and put my hands over my ears. She grinned, and turned the volume down until it was just background. Then she hit the locks and the gas in the same second. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I asked, starting to feel uneasy. \u201cWhere is Edward?\u201d She shrugged. \u201cThey left early.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d I tried to control the absurd disappointment. If he left early, that meant he\u2019d be back sooner, I reminded myself. \u00a0\u201cAll the boys went, and we\u2019re having a slumber party!\u201d she announced in a trilling, singsong voice. \u201cA slumber party?\u201d I repeated, the suspicion finally settling in. \u201cAren\u2019t you excited?\u201d she crowed. I met her animated gaze for a long second. \u201cYou\u2019re kidnapping me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d She laughed and nodded. \u201cTill Saturday. Esme cleared it with Charlie; you\u2019re staying with me two nights, and I will drive you to and from school tomorrow.\u201d I turned my face to the window, my teeth grinding together. \u201cSorry,\u201d Alice said, not sounding in the least bit penitent. \u201cHe paid me off.\u201d \u201cHow?\u201d I hissed through my teeth. \u201cThe Porsche. It\u2019s exactly like the one I stole in Italy.\u201d She sighed happily. \u201cI\u2019m not supposed to drive it around Forks, but if you want, we could see how long it takes to get from here to L.A. \u2014 I bet I could have you back by midnight.\u201d I took a deep breath. \u201cI think I\u2019ll pass,\u201d I sighed, repressing a shudder. We wound, always too fast, down the long drive. Alice pulled around to the garage, and I quickly looked over the cars. Emmett\u2019s big jeep was there, with a shiny canary yellow Porsche between it and Rosalie\u2019s red convertible. Alice hopped out gracefully and went to stroke her hand along the length of her bribe. \u201cPretty, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cPretty over-the-top,\u201d I grumbled, incredulous. \u201cHe gave you that just for two days of holding me hostage?\u201d Alice made a face. A second later, comprehension came and I gasped in horror. \u201cIt\u2019s for every time he\u2019s gone, isn\u2019t it?\u201d She nodded. I slammed my door and stomped toward the house. She danced along next to me, still unrepentant. \u201cAlice, don\u2019t you think this is just a little bit controlling? Just a tiny bit psychotic, maybe?\u201d \u201cNot really.\u201d She sniffed. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem to grasp how dangerous a young werewolf can be.\u00a0 Especially when I can\u2019t see them. Edward has no way to know if you\u2019re safe. You shouldn\u2019t be so reckless.\u201d My voice turned acidic. \u201cYes, because a vampire slumber party is the pinnacle of safety conscious behavior.\u201d Alice laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a pedicure and everything,\u201d she promised. It wasn\u2019t so bad, except for the fact that I was being held against my will. Esme brought Italian food \u2014 the good stuff, all the way from Port Angeles \u2014 and Alice was prepared with my favorite movies. Even Rosalie was there, quietly in the background. Alice did insist on the pedicure, and I wondered if she was working from a list \u2014 maybe something she\u2019d compiled from watching bad sitcoms. \u00a0\u201cHow late do you want to stay up?\u201d she asked when my toenails were glistening a bloody red. Her enthusiasm remained untouched by my mood. \u201cI don\u2019t want to stay up. We have school in the morning.\u201d She pouted. \u201cWhere am I supposed to sleep, anyway?\u201d I measured the couch with my eyes. It was a little short. \u201cCan\u2019t you just keep me under surveillance at my house?\u201d \u201cWhat kind of a slumber party would that be?\u201d Alice shook her head in exasperation. \u201cYou\u2019re sleeping in Edward\u2019s room.\u201d I sighed. His black leather sofa was longer than this one. Actually, the gold carpet in his room was probably thick enough that the floor wouldn\u2019t be half bad either. \u00a0\u201cCan I go back to my place to get my things, at least?\u201d She grinned. \u201cAlready taken care of.\u201d \u201cAm I allowed to use your phone?\u201d \u201cCharlie knows where you are.\u201d \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to call Charlie.\u201d I frowned. \u201cApparently, I have some plans to cancel.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d She deliberated. \u201cI\u2019m not sure about that.\u201d \u201cAlice!\u201d I whined loudly. \u201cC\u2019mon!\u201d \u00a0\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d she said, flitting from the room. She was back in half a second, cell phone in hand. \u201cHe didn\u2019t specifically prohibit this . . . ,\u201d she murmured to herself as she handed it to me. I dialed Jacob\u2019s number, hoping he wasn\u2019t out running with his friends tonight. Luck was with me \u2014 Jacob was the one to answer. \u201cHello?\u201d \u00a0\u201cHey, Jake, it\u2019s me.\u201d Alice watched me with expressionless eyes for a second, before she turned and went to sit between Rosalie and Esme on the sofa. \u201cHi, Bella,\u201d Jacob said, suddenly cautious. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d \u201cNothing good. I can\u2019t come over Saturday after all.\u201d It was silent for a minute. \u201cStupid bloodsucker,\u201d he finally muttered. \u201cI thought he was leaving. Can\u2019t you have a life when he\u2019s gone? Or does he lock you in a coffin?\u201d I laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s funny.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m only laughing because you\u2019re close,\u201d I told him. \u201cBut he\u2019s going to be here Saturday, so it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d \u201cWill he be feeding there in Forks, then?\u201d Jacob asked cuttingly. \u201cNo.\u201d I didn\u2019t let myself get irritated with him. I wasn\u2019t that far from being as angry as he was. \u201cHe left early.\u201d \u00a0\u201cOh. Well, hey, come over now, then,\u201d he said with sudden enthusiasm. \u201cIt\u2019s not that late. Or I\u2019ll come up to Charlie\u2019s.\u201d \u201cI wish. I\u2019m not at Charlie\u2019s,\u201d I said sourly. \u201cI\u2019m kind of being held prisoner.\u201d He was silent as that sunk in, and then he growled. \u201cWe\u2019ll come and get you,\u201d he promised in a flat voice, slipping automatically into a plural. A chill slid down my spine, but I answered in a light and teasing voice. \u201cTempting. I have been tortured \u2014 Alice painted my toenails.\u201d \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be. They\u2019re just trying to keep me safe.\u201d He growled again. \u201cI know it\u2019s silly, but their hearts are in the right place.\u201d \u201cTheir hearts !\u201d he scoffed. \u201cSorry about Saturday,\u201d I apologized. \u201cI\u2019ve got to hit the sack\u201d \u2014 the couch, I corrected mentally \u2014 \u201cbut I\u2019ll call you again soon.\u201d \u00a0\u201cAre you sure they\u2019ll let you?\u201d he asked in a scathing tone. \u201cNot completely.\u201d I sighed. \u201c\u2019Night, Jake.\u201d \u201cSee you around.\u201d Alice was abruptly at my side, her hand held out for the phone, but I was already <em>dialing</em>. She saw the number. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019ll have his phone on him,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll leave a message.\u201d The phone rang four times, followed by a beep. There was no greeting. \u201cYou are in trouble,\u201d I said slowly, emphasizing each word. \u201cEnormous trouble. Angry grizzly bears are going to look tame next to what is waiting for you at home.\u201d I snapped the phone shut and placed it in her waiting hand. \u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d She grinned. \u201cThis hostage stuff is fun.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to sleep now,\u201d I announced, heading for the stairs. Alice tagged along. \u201cAlice,\u201d I sighed. \u201cI\u2019m not going to sneak out. You would know if I was planning to, and you\u2019d catch me if I tried.\u201d \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m just going to show you where your things are,\u201d she said innocently. Edward\u2019s room was at the farthest end of the third floor hallway, hard to mistake even when the huge house had been less familiar. But when I switched the light on, I paused in confusion. Had I picked the wrong door? Alice giggled. It was the same room, I realized quickly; the furniture had just been rearranged. The couch was pushed to the north wall and the stereo shoved up against the vast shelves of CDs \u2014 to make room for the colossal bed that now dominated the central space. The southern wall of glass reflected the scene back like a mirror, making it look twice as bad. It matched. The coverlet was a dull gold, just lighter than the walls; the frame was black, made of intricately patterned wrought iron. Sculpted metal roses wound in vines up the tall posts and formed a bowery lattice overhead. My pajamas were folded neatly on the foot of the bed, my bag of toiletries to one side. \u201cWhat the hell is all this?\u201d I spluttered. \u00a0\u201cYou didn\u2019t really think he would make you sleep on the couch, did you?\u201d I mumbled unintelligibly as I stalked forward to snatch my things off the bed. \u201cI\u2019ll give you some privacy,\u201d Alice laughed. \u201cSee you in the morning.\u201d After my teeth were brushed and I was dressed, I grabbed a puffy feather pillow off the huge bed and dragged the gold cover to the couch. I knew I was being silly, but I didn\u2019t care. Porsches as bribes and king-sized beds in houses where nobody slept \u2014 it was beyond irritating. I flipped off the lights and curled up on the sofa, wondering if I was too annoyed to sleep. In the dark, the glass wall was no longer a black mirror, doubling the room. The light of the moon brightened the clouds outside the window. As my eyes adjusted, I could see the diffused glow highlighting the tops of the trees, and glinting off a small slice of the river. I watched the silver light, waiting for my eyes to get heavy. There was a light knock on the door. \u00a0\u201cWhat, Alice?\u201d I hissed. I was on the defensive, imagining her amusement when she saw my makeshift bed. \u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d Rosalie said softly, opening the door enough that I could see the silver glow touch her perfect face. \u201cCan I come in?",

            "en": "7          7. NIGHTMARE I told Charlie I had a lot of homework to do, and that I didn't want anything to eat. There was a basketball game on that he was excited about, though of course I had no idea what was special about it, so he wasn't aware of anything unusual in my face or tone. Once in my room, I locked the door. I dug through my desk until I found my old headphones, and I plugged them into my little CD player. I picked up a CD that Phil had given to me for Christmas. It was one of his favorite bands, but they used a little too much bass and shrieking for my tastes. I popped it into place and lay down on my bed. I put on the headphones, hit Play, and turned up the volume until it hurt my ears. I closed my eyes, but the light still intruded, so I added a pillow over the top half of my face. I concentrated very carefully on the music, trying to understand the lyrics, to unravel the complicated drum patterns. By the third time I'd listened through the CD, I knew all the words to the choruses, at least.  I was surprised to find that I really did like the band after all, once I got past the blaring noise. I'd have to thank Phil again.  And it worked. The shattering beats made it impossible for me to think \u2014 which was the whole purpose of the exercise. I listened to the CD again and again, until I was singing along with all the songs, until, finally, I fell asleep. I opened my eyes to a familiar place. Aware in some corner of my consciousness that I was dreaming, I recognized the green light of the forest. I could hear the waves crashing against the rocks somewhere nearby. And I knew that if I found the ocean, I'd be able to see the sun.  I was trying to follow the sound, but then Jacob Black was there, tugging on my hand, pulling me back toward the blackest part of the forest. \"Jacob? What's wrong?\" I asked. His face was frightened as he yanked with all his strength against my resistance; I didn't want to go into the dark. \"Run, Bella, you have to run!\" he whispered, terrified. \"This way, Bella!\" I recognized Mike's voice calling out of the gloomy heart of the trees, but I couldn't see him. \"Why?\" I asked, still pulling against Jacob's grasp, desperate now to find the sun. But Jacob let go of my hand and yelped, suddenly shaking, falling to the dim forest floor. He twitched on the ground as I watched in horror.  \"Jacob!\" I screamed. But he was gone. In his place was a large red-brown wolf with black eyes. The wolf faced away from me, pointing toward the shore, the hair on the back of his shoulders bristling, low growls issuing from between his exposed fangs. \"Bella, run!\" Mike cried out again from behind me. But I didn't turn. I was watching a light coming toward me from the beach. And then Edward stepped out from the trees, his skin faintly glowing, his eyes black and dangerous. He held up one hand and beckoned me to come to him. The wolf growled at my feet. I took a step forward, toward Edward. He smiled then, and his teeth were sharp, pointed. \"Trust me,\" he purred. I took another step. The wolf launched himself across the space between me and the vampire, fangs aiming for the jugular. \"No!\" I screamed, wrenching upright out of my bed. My sudden movement caused the headphones to pull the CD player off the bedside table, and it clattered to the wooden floor. My light was still on, and I was sitting fully dressed on the bed, with my shoes on. I glanced, disoriented, at the clock on my dresser. It was five-thirty in the morning. I groaned, fell back, and rolled over onto my face, kicking off my boots. I was too uncomfortable to get anywhere near sleep, though. I rolled back over and unbuttoned my jeans, yanking them off awkwardly as I tried to stay horizontal. I could feel the braid in my hair, an uncomfortable ridge along the back of my skull. I turned onto my side and ripped the rubber band out, quickly combing through the plaits with my fingers. I pulled the pillow back over my eyes.  It was all no use, of course. My subconscious had dredged up exactly the images I'd been trying so desperately to avoid. I was going to have to face them now. I sat up, and my head spun for a minute as the blood flowed downward. First things first, I thought to myself, happy to put it off as long as possible. I grabbed my bathroom bag. The shower didn't last nearly as long as I hoped it would, though. Even taking the time to blow-dry my hair, I was soon out of things to do in the bathroom. Wrapped in a towel, I crossed back to my room. I couldn't tell if Charlie was still asleep, or if he had already left. I went to look out my window, and the cruiser was gone. Fishing again. I dressed slowly in my most comfy sweats and then made my bed \u2014 something I never did. I couldn't put it off any longer. I went to my desk and switched on my old computer. I hated using the Internet here. My modem was sadly outdated, my free service substandard; just <em>dialing</em> up took so long that I decided to go get myself a bowl of cereal while I waited. I ate slowly, chewing each bite with care. When I was done, I washed the bowl and spoon, dried them, and put them away. My feet dragged as I climbed the stairs. I went to my CD player first, picking it up off the floor and placing it precisely in the center of the table. I pulled out the headphones, and put them away in the desk drawer. Then I turned the same CD on, turning it down to the point where it was background noise.  With another sigh, I turned to my computer. Naturally, the screen was covered in pop-up ads. I sat in my hard folding chair and began closing all the little windows. Eventually I made it to my favorite search engine. I shot down a few more pop-ups and then typed in one word. Vampire. It took an infuriatingly long time, of course. When the results came up, there was a lot to sift through \u2014 everything from movies and TV shows to role-playing games, underground metal, and gothic cosmetic companies. Then I found a promising site \u2014 Vampires A\u2014Z. I waited impatiently for it to load, quickly clicking closed each ad that flashed across the screen. Finally the screen was finished \u2014 simple white background with black text, academic-looking. Two quotes greeted me on the home page: Throughout the vast shadowy world of ghosts and demons there is no figure so terrible, no figure so dreaded and abhorred, yet dight with such fearful fascination, as the vampire, who is himself neither ghost nor demon, but yet who partakes the dark natures and possesses the mysterious and terrible qualities of both. \u2014 Rev. Montague Summers If there is in this world a well-attested account, it is that of the vampires. Nothing is lacking: official reports, affidavits of well-known people, of surgeons, of priests, of magistrates; the judicial proof is most complete. And with all that, who is there who believes in vampires? \u2014 Rousseau The rest of the site was an alphabetized listing of all the different myths of vampires held throughout the world. The first I clicked on, the Danag, was a Filipino vampire supposedly responsible for planting taro on the islands long ago. The myth continued that the Danag worked with humans for many years, but the partnership ended one day when a woman cut her finger and a Danag sucked her wound, enjoying the taste so much that it drained her body completely of blood. I read carefully through the descriptions, looking for anything that sounded familiar, let alone plausible. It seemed that most vampire myths centered around beautiful women as demons and children as victims; they also seemed like constructs created to explain away the high mortality rates for young children, and to give men an excuse for infidelity. Many of the stories involved bodiless spirits and warnings against improper burials. There wasn't much that sounded like the movies I'd seen, and only a very few, like the Hebrew Estrie and the Polish Upier, who were even preoccupied with drinking blood. Only three entries really caught my attention: the Romanian Varacolaci, a powerful undead being who could appear as a beautiful, pale-skinned human, the Slovak Nelapsi, a creature so strong and fast it could massacre an entire village in the single hour after midnight, and one other, the Stregoni benefici. About this last there was only one brief sentence.  Stregoni benefici: An Italian vampire, said to be on the side of goodness, and a mortal enemy of all evil vampires. It was a relief, that one small entry, the one myth among hundreds that claimed the existence of good vampires. Overall, though, there was little that coincided with Jacob's stories or my own observations. I'd made a little catalogue in my mind as I'd read and carefully compared it with each myth. Speed, strength, beauty, pale skin, eyes that shift color; and then Jacob's criteria: blood drinkers, enemies of the werewolf, cold-skinned, and immortal. There were very few myths that matched even one factor. And then another problem, one that I'd remembered from the small number of scary movies that I'd seen and was backed up by today's reading \u2014 vampires couldn't come out in the daytime, the sun would burn them to a cinder. They slept in coffins all day and came out only at night. Aggravated, I snapped off the computer's main power switch, not waiting to shut things down properly. Through my irritation, I felt overwhelming embarrassment. It was all so stupid. I was sitting in my room, researching vampires. What was wrong with me? I decided that most of the blame belonged on the doorstep of the town of Forks \u2014 and the entire sodden Olympic Peninsula, for that matter. I had to get out of the house, but there was nowhere I wanted to go that didn't involve a three-day drive. I pulled on my boots anyway, unclear where I was headed, and went downstairs. I shrugged into my raincoat without checking the weather and stomped out the door.  It was overcast, but not raining yet. I ignored my truck and started east on foot, angling across Charlie's yard toward the ever-encroaching forest. It didn't take long till I was deep enough for the house and the road to be invisible, for the only sound to be the squish of the damp earth under my feet and the sudden cries of the jays. There was a thin ribbon of a trail that led through the forest here, or I wouldn't risk wandering on my own like this. My sense of direction was hopeless; I could get lost in much less helpful surroundings. The trail wound deeper and deeper into the forest, mostly east as far as I could tell. It snaked around the Sitka spruces and the hemlocks, the yews and the maples. I only vaguely knew the names of the trees around me, and all I knew was due to Charlie pointing them out to me from the cruiser window in earlier days. There were many I didn't know, and others I couldn't be sure about because they were so covered in green parasites. I followed the trail as long as my anger at myself pushed me forward. As that started to ebb, I slowed. A few drops of moisture trickled down from the canopy above me, but I couldn't be certain if it was beginning to rain or if it was simply pools left over from yesterday, held high in the leaves above me, slowly dripping their way back to the earth. A recently fallen tree \u2014 I knew it was recent because it wasn't entirely carpeted in moss \u2014 rested against the trunk of one of her sisters, creating a sheltered little bench just a few safe feet off the trail. I stepped over the ferns and sat carefully, making sure my jacket was between the damp seat and my clothes wherever they\u00a0 touched, and leaned my hooded head back against the living tree. This was the wrong place to have come. I should have known, but where else was there to go? The forest was deep green and far too much like the scene in last night's dream to allow for peace of mind. Now that there was no longer the sound of my soggy footsteps, the silence was piercing.  The birds were quiet, too, the drops increasing in frequency, so it must be raining above. The ferns stood higher than my head, now that I was seated, and I knew someone could walk by on the path, three feet away, and not see me. Here in the trees it was much easier to believe the absurdities that embarrassed me indoors. Nothing had changed in this forest for thousands of years, and all the myths and legends of a hundred different lands seemed much more likely in this green haze than they had in my clear-cut bedroom. I forced myself to focus on the two most vital questions I had to answer, but I did so unwillingly.  First, I had to decide if it was possible that what Jacob had said about the Cullens could be true. Immediately my mind responded with a resounding negative. It was silly and morbid to entertain such ridiculous notions. But what, then? I asked myself. There was no rational explanation for how I was alive at this moment. I listed again in my head the things I'd observed myself: the impossible speed and strength, the eye color shifting from black to gold and back again, the inhuman beauty, the pale, frigid skin. And more \u2014 small things that registered slowly \u2014 how they never seemed to eat, the disturbing grace with which they moved. And the way be sometimes spoke, with unfamiliar cadences and phrases that better fit the style of a turn-of-the-century novel than that of a twenty-first-century classroom. He had skipped class the day we'd done blood typing. He hadn't said no to the beach trip till he heard where we were going. He seemed to know what everyone around him was thinking\u2026 except me. He had told me he was the villain, dangerous\u2026 Could the Cullens be vampires? Well, they were something. Something outside the possibility of rational justification was taking place in front of my incredulous eyes. Whether it be Jacob's cold ones or my own superhero theory, Edward Cullen was not\u2026 human. He was something more.  So then \u2014 maybe. That would have to be my answer for now.  And then the most important question of all. What was I going to do if it was true? If Edward was a vampire \u2014 I could hardly make myself think the words \u2014 then what should I do? Involving someone else was definitely out. I couldn't even believe myself; anyone I told would have me committed.  Only two options seemed practical. The first was to take his advice: to be smart, to avoid him as much as possible. To cancel our plans, to go back to ignoring him as far as I was able. To pretend there was an impenetrably thick glass wall between us in the one class where we were forced together. To tell him to leave me alone \u2014 and mean it this time.  I was gripped in a sudden agony of despair as I considered that alternative. My mind rejected the pain, quickly skipping on to the next option. I could do nothing different. After all, if he was something\u2026 sinister, he'd done nothing to hurt me so far. In fact, I would be a dent in Tyler's fender if he hadn't acted so quickly. So quickly, I argued with myself, that it might have been sheer reflexes. But if it was a reflex to save lives, how bad could he be? I retorted. My head spun around in answerless circles. There was one thing I was sure of, if I was sure of anything. The dark Edward in my dream last night was a reflection only of my fear of the word Jacob had spoken, and not Edward himself. Even so, when I'd screamed out in terror at the werewolf's lunge, it wasn't fear for the wolf that brought the cry of \"no\" to my lips. It was fear that he would be harmed \u2014 even as he called to me with sharp-edged fangs, I feared for him. And I knew in that I had my answer. I didn't know if there ever was a choice, really. I was already in too deep. Now that I knew \u2014 if I knew \u2014 I could do nothing about my frightening secret. Because when I thought of him, of his voice, his hypnotic eyes, the magnetic force of his personality, I wanted nothing more than to be with him right now. Even if\u2026 but I couldn't think it. Not here, alone in the darkening forest. Not while the rain made it dim as twilight under the canopy and pattered like footsteps across the matted earthen floor. I shivered and rose quickly from my place of concealment, worried that somehow the path would have disappeared with the rain. But it was there, safe and clear, winding its way out of the dripping green maze. I followed it hastily, my hood pulled close around my face, becoming surprised, as I nearly ran through the trees, at how far I had come. I started to wonder if I was heading out at all, or following the path farther into the confines of the forest. Before I could get too panicky, though, I began to glimpse some open spaces through the webbed branches. And then I could hear a car passing on the street, and I was free, Charlie's lawn stretched out in front of me, the house beckoning me, promising warmth and dry socks. It was just noon when I got back inside. I went upstairs and got dressed for the day, jeans and a t-shirt, since I was staying indoors. It didn't take too much effort to concentrate on my task for the day, a paper on Macbeth that was due Wednesday. I settled into outlining a rough draft contentedly, more serene than I'd felt since\u2026 well, since Thursday afternoon, if I was being honest.  That had always been my way, though. Making decisions was the painful part for me, the part I agonized over. But once the decision was made, I simply followed through \u2014 usually with relief that the choice was made. Sometimes the relief was tainted by despair, like my decision to come to Forks. But it was still better than wrestling with the alternatives.  This decision was ridiculously easy to live with. Dangerously easy.  And so the day was quiet, productive \u2014 I finished my paper before eight. Charlie came home with a large catch, and I made a mental note to pick up a book of recipes for fish while I was in Seattle next week. The chills that flashed up my spine whenever I thought of that trip were no different than the ones I'd felt before I'd taken my walk with Jacob Black. They should be different, I thought. I should be afraid \u2014 I knew I should be, but I couldn't feel the right kind of fear. I slept dreamlessly that night, exhausted from beginning my day so early, and sleeping so poorly the night before. I woke, for the second time since arriving in Forks, to the bright yellow light of a sunny day. I skipped to the window, stunned to see that there was hardly a cloud in the sky, and those there were just fleecy little white puffs that couldn't possibly be carrying any rain. I opened the window \u2014 surprised when it opened silently, without sticking, not having opened it in who knows how many years \u2014 and sucked in the relatively dry air. It was nearly warm and hardly windy at all. My blood was electric in my veins.  Charlie was finishing breakfast when I came downstairs, and he picked up on my mood immediately. \"Nice day out,\" he commented. \"Yes,\" I agreed with a grin. He smiled back, his brown eyes crinkling around the edges. When Charlie smiled, it was easier to see why he and my mother had jumped too quickly into an early marriage. Most of the young romantic he'd been in those days had faded before I'd known him, as the curly brown hair \u2014 the same color, if not the same texture, as mine \u2014 had dwindled, slowly revealing more and more of the shiny skin of his forehead. But when he smiled I could see a little of the man who had run away with Ren\u00e9e when she was just two years older than I was now. I ate breakfast cheerily, watching the dust moats stirring in the sunlight that streamed in the back window. Charlie called out a goodbye, and I heard the cruiser pull away from the house. I hesitated on my way out the door, hand on my rain jacket. It would be tempting fate to leave it home. With a sigh, I folded it over my arm and stepped out into the brightest light I'd seen in months. By dint of much elbow grease, I was able to get both windows in the truck almost completely rolled down. I was one of the first ones to school; I hadn't even checked the clock in my hurry to get outside. I parked and headed toward the seldom-used picnic benches on the south side of the cafeteria. The benches were still a little damp, so I sat on my jacket, glad to have a use for it. My homework was done \u2014 the product of a slow social life \u2014 but there were a few Trig problems I wasn't sure I had right. I took out my book industriously, but halfway through rechecking the first problem I was daydreaming, watching the sunlight play on the red-barked trees. I sketched inattentively along the margins of my homework. After a few minutes, I suddenly realized I'd drawn five pairs of dark eyes staring out of the page at me. I scrubbed them out with the eraser. \"Bella!\" I heard someone call, and it sounded like Mike. I looked around to realize that the school had become populated while I'd been sitting there, absentminded. Everyone was in t-shirts, some even in shorts though the temperature couldn't be over sixty. Mike was coming toward me in khaki shorts and a striped Rugby shirt, waving.  \"Hey, Mike,\" I called, waving back, unable to be halfhearted on a morning like this. He came to sit by me, the tidy spikes of his hair shining golden in the light, his grin stretching across his face. He was so delighted to see me, I couldn't help but feel gratified. \"I never noticed before \u2014 your hair has red in it,\" he commented, catching between his fingers a strand that was fluttering in the light breeze. \"Only in the sun.\" I became just a little uncomfortable as he tucked the lock behind my ear. \"Great day, isn't it?\" \"My kind of day,\" I agreed.  \"What did you do yesterday?\" His tone was just a bit too proprietary. \"I mostly worked on my essay.\" I didn't add that I was finished with it \u2014 no need to sound smug. He hit his forehead with the heel of his hand. \"Oh yeah \u2014 that's due Thursday, right?\" \"Um, Wednesday, I think.\" \"Wednesday?\" He frowned. \"That's not good\u2026 What are you writing yours on?\" \"Whether Shakespeare's treatment of the female characters is misogynistic.\" He stared at me like I'd just spoken in pig Latin. \"I guess I'll have to get to work on that tonight,\" he said, deflated. \"I was going to ask if you wanted to go out.\" \"Oh.\" I was taken off guard. Why couldn't I ever have a pleasant\u00a0 conversation with Mike anymore without it getting awkward? \"Well, we could go to dinner or something\u2026 and I could work on it later.\" He smiled at me hopefully. \"Mike\u2026\" I hated being put on the spot. \"I don't think that would be the best idea.\" His face fell. \"Why?\" he asked, his eyes guarded. My thoughts flickered to Edward, wondering if that's where his thoughts were as well. \"I think\u2026 and if you ever repeat what I'm saying right now I will cheerfully beat you to death,\" I threatened, \"but I think that would hurt Jessica's feelings.\" He was bewildered, obviously not thinking in that direction at all.  \"Jessica?\" \"Really, Mike, are you blind?\" \"Oh,\" he exhaled \u2014 clearly dazed. I took advantage of that to make my escape. \"It's time for class, and I can't be late again.\" I gathered my books up and stuffed them in my bag. We walked in silence to building three, and his expression was distracted. I hoped whatever thoughts he was immersed in were leading him in the right direction. When I saw Jessica in Trig, she was bubbling with enthusiasm. She, Angela, and Lauren were going to Port Angeles tonight to go dress shopping for the dance, and she wanted me to come, too, even though I didn't need one. I was indecisive. It would be nice to get out of town with some girlfriends, but Lauren would be there. And who knew what I could be doing tonight\u2026 But that was definitely the wrong path to let my mind wander down. Of course I was happy about the sunlight. But that wasn't completely responsible for the euphoric mood I was in, not even close. So I gave her a maybe, telling her I'd have to talk with Charlie first. She talked of nothing but the dance on the way to Spanish, continuing as if without an interruption when class finally ended, five minutes late, and we were on our way to lunch. I was far too lost in my own frenzy of anticipation to notice much of what she said. I was painfully eager to see not just him but all the Cullens \u2014 to compare them with the new suspicions that plagued my mind. As I crossed the threshold of the cafeteria, I felt the first true tingle of fear slither down my spine and settle in my stomach. Would they be able to know what I was thinking? And then a different feeling jolted through me \u2014 would Edward be waiting to sit with me again? As was my routine, I glanced first toward the Cullens' table. A shiver of panic trembled in my stomach as I realized it was empty. With dwindling hope, my eyes scoured the rest of the cafeteria, hoping to find him alone, waiting for me. The place was nearly filled \u2014 Spanish had made us late \u2014 but there was no sign of Edward or any of his family. Desolation hit me with crippling strength. I shambled along behind Jessica, not bothering to pretend to listen anymore. We were late enough that everyone was already at our table. I avoided the empty chair next to Mike in favor of one by Angela. I vaguely noticed that Mike held the chair out politely for Jessica, and that her face lit up in response. Angela asked a few quiet questions about the Macbeth paper, which I answered as naturally as I could while spiraling downward in misery. She, too, invited me to go with them tonight, and I agreed now, grasping at anything to distract myself. I realized I'd been holding on to a last shred of hope when I entered Biology, saw his empty seat, and felt a new wave of disappointment. The rest of the day passed slowly, dismally. In Gym, we had a lecture on the rules of badminton, the next torture they had lined up for me. But at least it meant I got to sit and listen instead of stumbling around on the court. The best part was the coach didn't finish, so I got another day off tomorrow. Never mind that the day after they would arm me with a racket before unleashing me on the rest of the class. I was glad to leave campus, so I would be free to pout and mope before I went out tonight with Jessica and company. But right after I walked in the door of Charlie's house, Jessica called to cancel our plans. I tried to be happy that Mike had asked her out to dinner \u2014 I really was relieved that he finally seemed to be catching on \u2014 but my enthusiasm sounded false in my own ears. She rescheduled our shopping trip for tomorrow night. Which left me with little in the way of distractions. I had fish marinating for dinner, with a salad and bread left over from the night before, so there was nothing to do there. I spent a focused half hour on homework, but then I was through with that, too. I checked my e-mail, reading the backlog of letters from my mother, getting snippier as they progressed to the present. I sighed and typed a quick response.  Mom, Sorry. I've been out. I went to the beach with some friends. And I had to write a paper. My excuses were fairly pathetic, so I gave up on that. It's sunny outside today - I know, I'm shocked, too - so I'm going to go outside and soak up as much vitamin D as I can. I love you, Bella. I decided to kill an hour with non-school-related reading. I had a small collection of books that came with me to Forks, the shabbiest volume being a compilation of the works of Jane Austen. I selected that one and headed to the backyard, grabbing a ragged old quilt from the linen cupboard at the top of the stairs on my way down. Outside in Charlie's small, square yard, I folded the quilt in half and laid it out of the reach of the trees' shadows on the thick lawn that would always be slightly wet, no matter how long the sun shone. I lay on my stomach, crossing my ankles in the air, flipping through the different novels in the book, trying to decide which would occupy my mind the most thoroughly. My favorites were Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility. I'd read the first most recently, so I started into Sense and Sensibility, only to remember after I began three that the hero of the story happened to be named Edward. Angrily, I turned to Mansfield Park, but the hero of that piece was named Edmund, and that was just too close. Weren't there any other names available in the late eighteenth century? I snapped the book shut, annoyed, and rolled over onto my back.  I pushed my sleeves up as high as they would go, and closed my eyes. I would think of nothing but the warmth on my skin, I told myself severely. The breeze was still light, but it blew tendrils of my hair around my face, and that tickled a bit. I pulled all my hair over my head, letting it fan out on the quilt above me, and focused again on the heat that touched my eyelids, my cheekbones, my nose, my lips, my forearms, my neck, soaked through my light shirt\u2026 The next thing I was conscious of was the sound of Charlie's cruiser turning onto the bricks of the driveway. I sat up in surprise, realizing the light was gone, behind the trees, and I had fallen asleep. I looked around, muddled, with the sudden feeling that I wasn't alone.  \"Charlie?\" I asked. But I could hear his door slamming in front of the house. I jumped up, foolishly edgy, gathering the now-damp quilt and my book. I ran inside to get some oil heating on the stove, realizing that dinner would be late. Charlie was hanging up his gun belt and stepping out of his boots when I came in. \"Sorry, Dad, dinner's not ready yet \u2014 I fell asleep outside.\" I stifled a yawn. \"Don't worry about it,\" he said. \"I wanted to catch the score on the game, anyway.\" I watched TV with Charlie after dinner, for something to do. There wasn't anything on I wanted to watch, but he knew I didn't like baseball, so he turned it to some mindless sitcom that neither of us enjoyed. He seemed happy, though, to be doing something together. And it felt good, despite my depression, to make him happy. \"Dad,\" I said during a commercial, \"Jessica and Angela are going to look at dresses for the dance tomorrow night in Port Angeles, and they wanted me to help them choose\u2026 do you mind if I go with them?\" \"Jessica Stanley?\" he asked. \"And Angela Weber.\" I sighed as I gave him the details. He was confused. \"But you're not going to the dance, right?\" \"No, Dad, but I'm helping them find dresses \u2014 you know, giving them constructive criticism.\" I wouldn't have to explain this to a woman. \"Well, okay.\" He seemed to realize that he was out of his depth with the girlie stuff. \"It's a school night, though.\" \"We'll leave right after school, so we can get back early. You'll be okay for dinner, right?\" \"Bells, I fed myself for seventeen years before you got here,\" he reminded me. \"I don't know how you survived,\" I muttered, then added more clearly, \"I'll leave some things for cold-cut sandwiches in the fridge, okay? Right on top.\" It was sunny again in the morning. I awakened with renewed hope that I grimly tried to suppress. I dressed for the warmer weather in a deep blue V-neck blouse \u2014 something I'd worn in the dead of winter in Phoenix.  I had planned my arrival at school so that I barely had time to make it to class. With a sinking heart, I circled the full lot looking for a space, while also searching for the silver Volvo that was clearly not there. I parked in the last row and hurried to English, arriving breathless, but subdued, before the final bell.  It was the same as yesterday \u2014 I just couldn't keep little sprouts of hope from budding in my mind, only to have them squashed painfully as I searched the lunchroom in vain and sat at my empty Biology table. The Port Angeles scheme was back on again for tonight and made all the more attractive by the fact that Lauren had other obligations. I was anxious to get out of town so I could stop glancing over my shoulder, hoping to see him appearing out of the blue the way he always did. I vowed to myself that I would be in a good mood tonight and not ruin Angela's or Jessica's enjoyment in the dress hunting. Maybe I could do a little clothes shopping as well. I refused to think that I might be shopping alone in Seattle this weekend, no longer interested in the earlier arrangement. Surely he wouldn't cancel without at least telling me. After school, Jessica followed me home in her old white Mercury so that I could ditch my books and truck. I brushed through my hair quickly when I was inside, feeling a slight lift of excitement as I contemplated getting out of Forks. I left a note for Charlie on the table, explaining again where to find dinner, switched my scruffy wallet from my school bag to a purse I rarely used, and ran out to join Jessica. We went to Angela's house next, and she was waiting for us. My excitement increased exponentially as we actually drove out of the town limits.",
