A New York Times/CBS News poll showed the bump in Obama's performance rating -- which it warned could be short-lived -- but also found that more than six in 10 Americans believed the threat of extremist attacks against the United States was likely to increase.  Bin Laden, who had become the face of <em>Islamist</em> militancy since masterminding the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, was shot in the head by U.S. forces who stormed his compound in Pakistan on Monday after a decade-long manhunt.  A separate USA Today/Gallup survey of 645 adults showed that 62 percent of Americans believe an act of terrorism is either \"very likely\" or \"somewhat likely\" to occur on U.S. soil within the next several weeks.  \"The current results indicate Americans are slightly more likely to be worried about a terrorist incident occurring than they were shortly after the London bus and subway bombings in July 2005, but are less worried than at the start of the Iraq war as well as immediately after 9/11,\" Gallup said.  While fearful that a retaliatory attack could be imminent, 54 percent of those polled by USA Today/Gallup believed the country was safer in the longer term from terrorism.  About 40 percent of respondents in that poll said they were also a lot more confident that the United States can succeed in its \"war against Islamic terrorism,\" while 34 percent said they were only a little more confident.  Nearly half of the 532 people polled in The New York Times/CBS poll said the United States should not decrease its troop levels in Afghanistan, where the hunt for bin Laden began in 2001. Obama plans to start a withdrawal of some U.S. forces from the unpopular war in July.  The bump in Obama's ratings may not last. The New York Times/CBS poll said that former President George W. Bush received an 8-point boost after the capture of Saddam Hussein in Iraq in 2003, but that bounce evaporated within a month.  Obama's popularity had been hurt by economic woes and high gasoline prices. Voters are expected to focus again on domestic concerns crucial to his 2012 re-election prospects.  More than half of respondents in the Times/CBS poll disapproved of Obama's handling of the economy, a similar result to last month's survey.",

            "en": "Suicide Bombing Kills 35 at Moscow Airport         Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has ordered extra security at all Russian airports and train stations, after a suicide bomber blew himself up in Moscow's biggest airport Monday, killing at least 35 people. Mr. Medvedev is demanding that investigators jump into action while he says the trail is still hot. He calls the blast an act of terrorism. Witnesses say a man carrying a suitcase walked into the baggage claim area at the crowded Domodedovo airport terminal and may have set off a blast. At least 145 people were wounded. Russian news reports say a closed-circuit television camera captured the explosion and that authorities are searching for three men. The blast left behind a bloody chaotic scene. Body parts and pieces of human flesh were everywhere. Blood-covered survivors scrambled through emergency exits. One man, apparently in shock, calmly pushed a baggage cart through the carnage. Many of the victims were said to have bolts, nails and ball bearings imbedded in them. No one has claimed responsibility for the blast. But the Interfax news agency quotes a law enforcement source as saying the bomber's severed head was found. World leaders condemned the suicide bombing, with U.S. President Barack Obama calling it \u201coutrageous,\u201d and U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon saying he is \u201cappalled.\u201d The Arab League called terrorism unacceptable, and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak telephoned Mr. Medvedev to express condolences to the victims. Russian officials say at least six foreigners were blast casualties \u2014 three from Tajikistan, a British woman, a Moldovan and a citizen from Serbia. Earlier reports said a Frenchman and an Italian were hurt. Monday's attack was the worst in the Russian capital since a double suicide bombing killed at least 40 people in the Moscow subway last March. The two women responsible for the subway attacks were from Dagestan, a southern Russian region torn by Islamic extremism. Security procedures at Domodedovo have failed in the past. In 2004, two suicide bombers boarded planes at the airport by illegally buying tickets from airport personnel. The bombers blew themselves up in mid-air, killing 90 people aboard the two flights. Russia is battling an <em>Islamist</em> insurgency in the North Caucasus region, where there are near daily armed attacks on government and security officials.",
