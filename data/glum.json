Romeo and Juliet, Act II, Scene VI PREFACE I FELT LIKE I WAS TRAPPED IN ONE OF THOSE TERRIFYING nightmares, the one where you have to run, run till your lungs burst, but you can't make your body move fast enough. My legs seemed to move slower and slower as I fought my way through the callous crowd, but the hands on the huge clock tower didn't slow. With relentless, uncaring force, they turned inexorably toward the end \u2014the end of everything. But this was no dream, and, unlike the nightmare, I wasn't running for my life; I was racing to save something infinitely more precious. My own life meant little to me today. Alice had said there was a good chance we would both die here. Perhaps the outcome would be different if she weren't trapped by the brilliant sunlight; only I was free to run across this bright, crowded square. And I couldn't run fast enough. So it didn't matter to me that we were surrounded by our extraordinarily dangerous enemies. As the clock began to toll out the hour, vibrating under the soles of my sluggish feet, I knew I was too late\u2014and I was glad something bloodthirsty waited in the wings. For in failing at this, I forfeited any desire to live. The clock tolled again, and the sun beat down from the exact center point of the sky. 1. PARTY I WAS NINETY-NINE POINT NINE PERCENT SURE I WAS dreaming. The reasons I was so certain were that, first, I was standing in a bright shaft of sunlight\u2014the kind of blinding clear sun that never shone on my drizzly new hometown in Forks, Washington\u2014and second, I was looking at my Grandma Marie. Gran had been dead for six years now, so that was solid evidence toward the dream theory. Gran hadn't changed much; her face looked just the same as I remembered it. The skin was soft and withered, bent into a thousand tiny creases that clung gently to the bone underneath. Like a dried apricot, but with a puff of thick white hair standing out in a cloud around it. Our mouths\u2014hers a wizened picker \u2014spread into the same surprised half-smile at just the same time. Apparently, she hadn't been expecting to see me, either. I was about to ask her a question; I had so many\u2014What was she doing here in my dream? What had she been up to in the past six years? Was Pop okay, and had they found each other, wherever they were?\u2014but she opened her mouth when I did, so I stopped to let her go first. She paused, too, and then we both smiled at the little awkwardness. \"Bella!\" It wasn't Gran who called my name, and we both turned to see the addition to our small reunion. I didn't have to look to know who it was; this was a voice I would know anywhere\u2014know, and respond to, whether I was awake or asleep\u2026 or even dead, I'd bet. The voice I'd walk through fire for\u2014or, less dramatically, slosh every day through the cold and endless rain for. Edward. Even though I was always thrilled to see him\u2014 conscious or otherwise\u2014and even though I was almost positive that I was dreaming, I panicked as Edward walked toward us through the glaring sunlight. I panicked because Gran didn't know that I was in love with a vampire\u2014nobody knew that\u2014so how was I supposed to explain the fact that the brilliant sunbeams were shattering off his skin into a thousand rainbow shards like he was made of crystal or diamond? Well, Gran, you might have noticed that my boyfriend glitters. It's just something he does in the sun. Don't worry about it\u2026 What was he doing? The whole reason he lived in Forks, the rainiest place in the world, was so that he could be outside in the daytime without exposing his family's secret. Yet here he was, strolling gracefully toward me\u2014with the most beautiful smile on his angel's face\u2014as if I were the only one here. In that second, I wished that I was not the one exception to his mysterious talent; I usually felt grateful that I was the only person whose thoughts he couldn't hear just as clearly as if they were spoken aloud. But now I wished he could hear me, too, so that he could hear the warning I was screaming in my head. I shot a panicked glance back at Gran, and saw that it was too late. She was just turning to stare back at me, her eyes as alarmed as mine. Edward\u2014still smiling so beautifully that my heart felt like it was going to swell up and burst through my chest\u2014put his arm around my shoulder and turned to face my grandmother. Gran's expression surprised me. Instead of looking horrified, she was staring at me sheepishly, as if waiting for a scolding. And she was standing in such a strange position\u2014one arm held awkwardly away from her body, stretched out and then curled around the air. Like she had her arm around someone I couldn't see, someone invisible\u2026 Only then, as I looked at the bigger picture, did I notice the huge gilt frame that enclosed my grandmother's form. Uncomprehending, I raised the hand that wasn't wrapped around Edward's waist and reached out to touch her. She mimicked the movement exactly, mirrored it. But where our fingers should have met, there was nothing but cold glass\u2026 With a dizzying jolt, my dream abruptly became a nightmare. There was no Gran. That was me. Me in a mirror. Me\u2014ancient, creased, and withered. Edward stood beside me, casting no reflection, excruciatingly lovely and forever\u00a0 seventeen. He pressed his icy, perfect lips against my wasted cheek. \"Happy birthday,\" he whispered. I woke with a start \u2014my eyelids popping open wide\u2014and gasped. Dull gray light, the familiar light of an overcast morning, took the place of the blinding sun in my dream. Just a dream, I told myself. It was only a dream. I took a deep breath, and then jumped again when my alarm went off. The little calendar in the corner of the clock's display informed me that today was September thirteenth. Only a dream, but prophetic enough in one way, at least. Today was my birthday. I was officially eighteen years old. I'd been dreading this day for months. All through the perfect summer\u2014the happiest summer I had ever had, the happiest summer anyone anywhere had ever had, and the rainiest summer in the history of the Olympic Peninsula\u2014this bleak date had lurked in ambush, waiting to spring. And now that it had hit, it was even worse than I'd feared it would be. I could feel it\u2014I was older. Every day I got older, but this was different, worse, quantifiable. I was eighteen.  And Edward never would be. When I went to brush my teeth, I was almost surprised that the face in the mirror hadn't changed. I stared at myself, looking for some sign of impending wrinkles in my ivory skin. The only creases were the ones on my forehead, though, and I knew that if I could manage to relax, they would disappear. I couldn't. My eyebrows stayed lodged in a worried line over my anxious brown eyes. It was just a dream, I reminded myself again. Just a dream\u2026 but also my worst\u00a0 nightmare. I skipped breakfast, in a hurry to get out of the house as quickly as possible. I wasn't entirely able to avoid my dad, and so I had to spend a few minutes acting cheerful. I honestly tried to be excited about the gifts I'd asked him not to get me, but every time I had to smile, it felt like I might start crying. I struggled to get a grip on myself as I drove to school. The vision of Gran\u2014I would not think of it as me\u2014was hard to get out of my head. I couldn't feel anything but despair until I pulled into the familiar parking lot behind Forks High School and spotted Edward leaning motionlessly against his polished silver Volvo, like a marble tribute to some forgotten pagan god of beauty. The dream had not done him justice. And he was waiting there for me, just the same as every other day. Despair momentarily vanished; wonder took its place. Even after half a year with him, I still couldn't believe that I deserved this degree of good fortune. His sister Alice was standing by his side, waiting for me, too. Of course Edward and Alice weren't really related (in Forks the story was that all the Cullen siblings were adopted by Dr. Carlisle Culler and his wife, Esme, both plainly too young to have teenage children), but their skin was precisely the same pale shade, their eyes had the same strange golden tint, with the same deep, bruise-like shadows beneath them. Her face, like his, was also startlingly beautiful. To someone in the know\u2014someone like me\u2014these similarities marked them for what they were. The sight of Alice waiting there\u2014her tawny eyes brilliant with excitement, and a small silver-wrapped square in her hands\u2014made me frown. I'd told Alice I didn't want anything, anything, not gifts or even attention, for my birthday. Obviously, my wishes were being ignored. I slammed the door of my '53 Chevy truck\u2014a shower of rust specks fluttered down to the wet blacktop \u2014and walked slowly toward where they waited. Alice skipped forward to meet me, her pixie face glowing under her spiky black hair. \"Happy birthday, Bella!\" \"Shh!\" I hissed, glancing around the lot to make sure no one had heard her. The last thing I wanted was some kind of celebration of the black event. She ignored me. \"Do you want to open your present now or later?\" she asked eagerly as we made our way to where Edward still waited. \"No presents,\" I protested in a mumble. She finally seemed to process my mood. \"Okay\u2026 later, then. Did you like the scrapbook your mom sent you? And the camera from Charlie?\" I sighed. Of course she would know what my birthday presents were. Edward wasn't the only member of his family with unusual skills. Alice would have \"seen\" what my parents were planning as soon as they'd decided that themselves. \"Yeah. They're great.\" \"I think it's a nice idea. You're only a senior once. Might as well document the\u00a0 experience.\" \"How many times have you been a senior?\" \"That's different.\" We reached Edward then, and he held out his hand for mine. I took it eagerly, forgetting, for a moment, my <em>glum</em> mood. His skin was, as always, smooth, hard, and very cold. He gave my fingers a gentle squeeze. I looked into his liquid topaz eyes, and my heart gave a not-quite-so-gentle squeeze of its own. Hearing the stutter in my heartbeats, he smiled again. He lifted his free hand and traced one cool fingertip around the outside of my lips as he spoke. \"So, as discussed, I am not allowed to wish you a happy birthday, is that correct?\" \"Yes. That is correct.\" I could never quite mimic the flow of his perfect, formal articulation. It was something that could only be picked up in an earlier century. \"Just checking.\" He ran his hand through his tousled bronze hair. \"You might have changed your mind.\u00a0 Most people seem to enjoy things like birthdays and gifts.\" Alice laughed, and the sound was all silver, a wind chime. \"Of course you'll enjoy it. Everyone is supposed to be nice to you today and give you your way, Bella. What's the worst that could happen?\" She meant it as a rhetorical question. \"Getting older,\" I answered anyway, and my voice was not as steady as I wanted it to be. Beside me, Edward's smile tightened into a hard line. \"Eighteen isn't very old,\" Alice said. \"Don't women usually wait till they're twenty-nine to get upset over birthdays?\" \"It's older than Edward,\" I mumbled. He sighed. \"Technically,\" she said, keeping her tone light. \"Just by one little year, though.\" And I supposed\u2026 if I could be sure of the future I wanted, sure that I would get to spend forever with Edward, and Alice and the rest of the Cullens (preferably not as a wrinkled little old lady)\u2026 then a year or two one direction or the other wouldn't matter to me so much. But Edward was dead set against any future that changed me. Any future that made me like him\u2014that made me immortal, too. An impasse, he called it. I couldn't really see Edward's point, to be honest. What was so great about mortality? Being a vampire didn't look like such a terrible thing\u2014not the way the Cullens did it, anyway. \"What time will you be at the house?\" Alice continued, changing the subject. From her expression, she was up to exactly the kind of thing I'd been hoping to avoid. \"I didn't know I had plans to be there.\" \"Oh, be fair, Bella!\" she complained. \"You aren't going to ruin all our fun like that, are you?\" \"I thought my birthday was about what I want.\" \"I'll get her from Charlie's right after school,\" Edward told her, ignoring me altogether. \"I have to work,\" I protested. \"You don't, actually,\" Alice told me smugly. \"I already spoke to Mrs. Newton about it. She's trading your shifts. She said to tell you 'Happy Birthday.'\" \"I\u2014I still can't come over,\" I stammered, scrambling for an excuse. \"I, well, I haven't watched Romeo and Juliet yet for English.\" Alice snorted. \"You have Romeo and Juliet memorized.\" \"But Mr. Berty said we needed to see it performed to fully appreciate it\u2014that's how Shakespeare intended it to be presented.\" Edward rolled his eyes. \"You've already seen the movie,\" Alice accused. \"But not the nineteen-sixties version. Mr. Berty said it was the best.\" Finally, Alice lost the smug smile and glared at me. \"This can be easy, or this can be hard, Bella, but one way or the other\u2014\" Edward interrupted her threat. \"Relax, Alice. If Bella wants to watch a movie, then she can. It's her birthday.\" \"So there,\" I added. \u00a0\"I'll bring her over around seven,\" he continued. \"That will give you more time to set up.\" Alice's laughter chimed again. \"Sounds good. See you tonight, Bella! It'll be fun, you'll see.\" She grinned\u2014the wide smile exposed all her perfect, glistening teeth\u2014then pecked me on the cheek and danced off toward her first class before I could respond. \"Edward, please\u2014\" I started to beg, but he pressed one cool finger to my lips. \"Let's discuss it later. We're going to be late for class.\" No one bothered to stare at us as we took our usual seats in the back of the classroom (we had almost every class together now\u2014it was amazing the favors Edward could get the female administrators to do for him). Edward and I had been together too long now to be an object of gossip anymore. Even Mike Newton didn't bother to give me the <em>glum</em> stare that used to make me feel a little guilty. He smiled now instead, and I was glad he seemed to have accepted that we could only be friends. Mike had changed over the summer\u2014his face had lost some of the roundness, making his cheekbones more prominent, and he was wearing his pale blond hair a new way; instead of bristly, it was longer and gelled into a carefully casual disarray. It was easy to see where his inspiration came from\u2014but Edward's look wasn't something that could be achieved through imitation. As the day progressed, I considered ways to get out of whatever was going down at the Cullen house tonight. It would be bad enough to have to celebrate when I was in the mood to mourn. But, worse than that, this was sure to involve attention and gifts. Attention is never a good thing, as any other accident-prone klutz would agree. No one wants a spotlight when they're likely to fall on their face. And I'd very pointedly asked\u2014well, ordered really\u2014that no one give me any presents this year. It looked like Charlie and Renee weren't the only ones who had decided to overlook that. I'd never had much money, and that had never bothered me. Renee had raised me on a kindergarten teacher's salary. Charlie wasn't getting rich at his job, either\u2014he was the police chief here in the tiny town of Forks. My only personal income came from the three days a week I worked at the local sporting goods store. In a town this small, I was lucky to have a job. Every penny I made went into my microscopic college fund. (College was Plan B. I was still hoping for Plan A, but Edward was just so stubborn about leaving me human\u2026) Edward had a lot of money\u2014I didn't even want to think about how much. Money meant next to nothing to Edward or the rest of the Cullens. It was just something that accumulated when you had unlimited time on your hands and a sister who had an uncanny ability to predict trends in the stock market. Edward didn't seem to understand why I objected to him spending money on me\u2014why it made me uncomfortable if he took me to an expensive restaurant in Seattle, why he wasn't allowed to buy me a car that could reach speeds over fifty-five miles an hour, or why I wouldn't let him pay my college tuition (he was ridiculously enthusiastic about Plan B). Edward thought I was being unnecessarily difficult. But how could I let him give me things when I had nothing to reciprocate with? He, for some unfathomable reason, wanted to be with me. Anything he gave me on top of that just threw us more out of balance. As the day went on, neither Edward nor Alice brought my birthday up again, and I began to relax a little. We sat at our usual table for lunch. A strange kind of truce existed at that table. The three of us\u2014Edward, Alice, and I\u2014sat on the extreme southern end of the table. Now that the \"older\" and somewhat scarier (in Emmett's case, certainly) Cullen siblings had graduated, Alice and Edward did not seem quite so intimidating, and we did not sit here alone. My other friends, Mike and Jessica (who were in the awkward post-breakup friendship phase), Angela and Ben (whose relationship had survived the summer), Eric, Conner, Tyler, and Lauren (though that last one didn't really count in the friend category) all sat at the same table, on the other side of an invisible line. That line dissolved on sunny days when Edward and Alice always skipped school, and then the conversation would swell out effortlessly to include me.  Edward and Alice didn't find this minor ostracism odd or hurtful the way I would have. They barely noticed it. People always felt strangely ill at ease with the Cullens, almost afraid for some reason they couldn't explain to themselves. I was a rare exception to that rule. Sometimes it bothered Edward how very comfortable I was with being close to him. He thought he was hazardous to my health\u2014an opinion I rejected vehemently whenever he voiced it. \u00a0The afternoon passed quickly. School ended, and Edward walked me to my truck as he usually did. But this time, he held the passenger door open for me. Alice must have been taking his car home so that he could keep me from making a run for it. I folded my arms and made no move to get out of the rain. \"It's my birthday, don't I get to drive?\" \"I'm pretending it's not your birthday, just as you wished.\" \"If it's not my birthday, then I don't have to go to your house tonight\u2026\" \"All right.\" He shut the passenger door and walked past me to open the driver's side. \"Happy birthday.\" \"Shh,\" I shushed him halfheartedly. I climbed in the opened door, wishing he'd taken the other offer. Edward played with the radio while I drove, shaking his head in disapproval. \"Your radio has horrible reception.\" I frowned. I didn't like it when he picked on my truck. The truck was great\u2014it had\u00a0 personality. \"You want a nice stereo? Drive your own car.\" I was so nervous about Alice's plans, on top of my already gloomy mood, that the words came out sharper than I'd meant them. I was hardly ever bad-tempered with Edward, and my tone made him press his lips together to keep from smiling. When I parked in front of Charlie's house, he reached over to take my face in his hands. He handled me very carefully, pressing just the tips of his fingers softly against my temples, my cheekbones, my jaw line. Like I was especially breakable. Which was exactly the case\u2014compared with him, at least. \"You should be in a good mood, today of all days,\" he whispered. His sweet breath fanned across my face. \"And if I don't want to be in a good mood?\" I asked, my breathing uneven. His golden eyes smoldered. \"Too bad.\" My head was already spinning by the time he leaned closer and pressed his icy lips against mine. As he intended, no doubt, I forgot all about my worries, and concentrated on remembering how to inhale and exhale. His mouth lingered on mine, cold and smooth and gentle, until I wrapped my arms around his neck and threw myself into the kiss with a little too much enthusiasm. I could feel his lips curve upward as he let go of my face and reached back to unlock my grip on him. Edward had drawn many careful lines for our physical relationship, with the intent being to keep me alive. Though I respected the need for maintaining a safe distance between my skin and his razor-sharp, venom-coated teeth, I tended to forget about trivial things like that when he was kissing me. \"Be good, please,\" he breathed against my cheek. He pressed his lips gently to mine one more time and then pulled away, folding my arms across my stomach. My pulse was thudding in my ears. I put one hand over my heart. It drummed hyperactively under my palm. \u00a0\"Do you think I'll ever get better at this?\" I wondered, mostly to myself. \"That my heart might someday stop trying to jump out of my chest whenever you touch me?\" \"I really hope not,\" he said, a bit smug. I rolled my eyes. \"Let's go watch the Capulets and Montagues hack each other up, all right?\" \"Your wish, my command.\" Edward sprawled across the couch while I started the movie, fast-forwarding through the opening credits. When I perched on the edge of the sofa in front of him, he wrapped his arms around my waist and pulled me against his chest. It wasn't exactly as comfortable as a sofa cushion would be, what with his chest being hard and cold\u2014and perfect\u2014as an ice sculpture, but it was definitely preferable. He pulled the old afghan off the back of the couch and draped it over me so I wouldn't freeze beside his body. \"You know, I've never had much patience with Romeo,\" he commented as the movie started. \"What's wrong with Romeo?\" I asked, a little offended. Romeo was one of my favorite fictional characters. Until I'd met Edward, I'd sort of had a thing for him. \"Well, first of all, he's in love with this Rosaline\u2014don't you think it makes him seem a little fickle? And then, a few minutes after their wedding, he kills Juliet's cousin. That's not very brilliant. Mistake after mistake. Could he have destroyed his own happiness any more thoroughly?\" I sighed. \"Do you want me to watch this alone?\" \"No, I'll mostly be watching you, anyway.\" His fingers traced patterns across the skin of my arm, raising goose bumps. \"Will you cry?\" \"Probably,\" I admitted, \"if I'm paying attention.\" \"I won't distract you then.\" But I felt his lips on my hair, and it was very distracting. The movie eventually captured my interest, thanks in large part to Edward whispering Romeo's lines in my ear\u2014his irresistible, velvet voice made the actor's voice sound weak and coarse by comparison. And I did cry, to his amusement, when Juliet woke and found her new husband dead. \"I'll admit, I do sort of envy him here,\" Edward said, drying the tears with a lock of my hair. \"She's very pretty.\" He made a disgusted sound. \"I don't envy him the girl\u2014just the ease of the suicide,\" he clarified in a teasing tone. \"You humans have it so easy! All you have to do is throw down one tiny vial of plant extracts\u2026\" \"What?\" I gasped. \"It's something I had to think about once, and I knew from Carlisle's experience that it wouldn't be simple. I'm not even sure how many ways Carlisle tried to kill himself in the beginning\u2026 after he realized what he'd become\u2026\" His voice, which had grown serious, turned light again. \"And he's clearly still in excellent health.\" I twisted around so that I could read his face. \"What are you talking about?\" I demanded. \"What do you mean, this something you had to think about once?\" \"Last spring, when you were\u2026 nearly killed\u2026\" He paused to take a deep breath, snuggling to return to his teasing tone. \"Of course I was trying to focus on finding you alive, but part of my mind was making contingency plans. Like I said, it's not as easy for me as it is for a human.\" For one second, the memory of my last trip to Phoenix washed through my head and made me feel dizzy. I could see it all so clearly\u2014the blinding sun, the heat waves coming off the concrete as I ran with desperate haste to find the sadistic vampire who wanted to torture me to death. James, waiting in the mirrored room with my mother as his hostage\u2014or so I'd thought. I hadn't known it was all a ruse. Just as James hadn't known that Edward was racing to save me; Edward made it in time, but it had been a close one. Unthinkingly, my fingers traced the crescent-shaped scar on my hand that was always just a few degrees cooler than the rest of my skin. I shook my head\u2014as if I could shake away the bad memories\u2014and tried to grasp what Edward meant. My stomach plunged uncomfortably. \"Contingency plans?\" I repeated. \"Well, I wasn't going to live without you.\" He rolled his eyes as if that fact were\u00a0\u00a0 childishly obvious. \"But I wasn't sure how to do it\u2014I knew Emmett and Jasper would never help\u2026 so I was thinking maybe I would go to Italy and do something to provoke the Volturi.\" I didn't want to believe he was serious, but his golden eyes were brooding, focused on something far away in the distance as he contemplated ways to end his own life. Abruptly, I was furious. \"What is a Volturi?\" I demanded. \u00a0\"The Volturi are a family,\" he explained, his eyes still remote. \"A very old, very powerful family of our kind. They are the closest thing our world has to a royal family, I suppose. Carlisle lived with them briefly in his early years, in Italy, before he settled in America\u2014do you remember the story?\" \"Of course I remember.\" I would never forget the first time I'd gone to his home, the huge white mansion buried deep in the forest beside the river, or the room where Carlisle\u2014Edward's father in so many real ways\u2014kept a wall of paintings that illustrated his personal history. The most vivid, most wildly colorful canvas there, the largest, was from Carlisle's time in Italy. Of course I remembered the calm quartet of men, each with the exquisite face of a seraph, painted into the highest balcony overlooking the swirling mayhem of color. Though the painting was centuries old, Carlisle\u2014the blond angel\u2014remained unchanged. And I remembered the three others, Carlisle's early acquaintances. Edward had never used the name Volturi for the beautiful trio, two black-haired, one snow white. He'd called them Aro, Caius, and Marcus, nighttime patrons of the arts\u2026 \"Anyway, you don't irritate the Volturi,\" Edward went on, interrupting ray reverie. \"Not unless you want to die\u2014or whatever it is we do.\" His voice was so calm, it made him sound almost bored by the prospect. My anger turned to horror. I took his marble face between my hands and held it very tightly. \"You must never, never, never think of anything like that again!\" I said. \"No matter what might ever happen to me, you are not allowed to hurt yourself!\" \"I'll never put you in danger again, so it's a moot point.\" \"Put me in danger! I thought we'd established that all the bad luck is my fault?\" I was getting angrier.\u00a0 \"How dare you even think like that?\" The idea of Edward ceasing to exist, even if I were dead, was impossibly painful. \"What would you do, if the situation were reversed?\" he asked. \"That's not the same thing.\" He didn't seem to understand the difference. He chuckled. \"What if something did happen to you?\" I blanched at the thought. \"Would you want me to go off myself?\" A trace of pain touched his perfect features. \"I guess I see your point\u2026 a little,\" he admitted. \"But what would I do without you?\" \"Whatever you were doing before I came along and complicated your existence.\" He sighed. \"You make that sound so easy.\" \"It should be. I'm not really that interesting.\" He was about to argue, but then he let it go. \"Moot point,\" he reminded me. Abruptly, he pulled himself up into a more formal posture, shifting me to the side so that we were no longer touching. \"Charlie?\" I guessed. Edward smiled. After a moment, I heard the sound of the police cruiser pulling into the driveway. I reached out and took his hand firmly. My dad could deal with that much. Charlie came in with a pizza box in his hands. \"Hey, kids.\" He grinned at me. \"I thought you'd like a break from cooking and washing dishes for your birthday. Hungry?\" \"Sure. Thanks, Dad.\" Charlie didn't comment on Edward's apparent lack of appetite. He was used to Edward passing on dinner. \"Do you mind if I borrow Bella for the evening?\" Edward asked when Charlie and I were done. I looked at Charlie hopefully. Maybe he had some concept of birthdays as stay-at-home, family affairs\u2014this was my first birthday with him, the first birthday since my mom, Renee, had remarried and gone to live in Florida, so I didn't know what he would expect. \"That's fine\u2014the Mariners are playing the Sox tonight,\" Charlie explained, and my hope disappeared. \"So I won't be any kind of company\u2026 Here.\" He scooped up the camera he'd gotten me on Renee's suggestion (because I would need pictures to fill up my scrap-book), and threw it to me. He ought to know better than that\u2014I'd always been coordination ally challenged. The camera glanced off the tip of my finger, and tumbled toward the floor. Edward snagged it before it could crash onto the linoleum. \"Nice save,\" Charlie noted. \"If they're doing something fun at the Cullens' tonight, Bella, you should take some pictures. You know how your mother gets\u2014she'll be wanting to see the pictures faster than you can take them.\" \"Good idea, Charlie,\" Edward said, handing me the camera. I turned the camera on Edward, and snapped the first picture. \"It works.\" \"That's good. Hey, say hi to Alice for me. She hasn't been over in a while.\" Charlie's mouth pulled down at one corner. \"It's been three days, Dad,\" I reminded him. Charlie was crazy about Alice. He'd become attached last spring when she'd helped me through my awkward convalescence; Charlie would be forever grateful to her for saving him from the horror of an almost-adult daughter who needed help showering. \"I'll tell her.\" \"Okay. You kids have fun tonight.\" It was clearly a dismissal. Charlie was already edging toward the living room and the TV. Edward smiled, triumphant, and took my hand to pull me from the kitchen. When we got to the truck, he opened the passenger door for me again, and this time I didn't argue. I still had a hard time finding the obscure turnoff to his house in the dark. Edward drove north through Forks, visibly chafing at the speed limit enforced by my prehistoric Chevy. The engine groaned even louder than usual as he pushed it over fifty. \"Take it easy,\" I warned him. \"You know what you would love? A nice little Audi coupe. Very quiet, lots of power\u2026\" \"There's nothing wrong with my truck. And speaking of expensive nonessentials, if you know what's good for you, you didn't spend any money on birthday presents.\" \"Not a dime,\" he said virtuously. \"Good.\" \"Can you do me a favor?\" \"That depends on what it is.\" He sighed, his lovely face serious. \"Bella, the last real birthday any of us had was Emmett in 1935. Cut us a little slack, and don't be too difficult tonight. They're all very excited.\" It always startled me a little when he brought up things like that. \"Fine, I'll behave.\" \"I probably should warn you\u2026\" \"Please do.\" \"When I say they're all excited\u2026 I do mean all of them.\" \"Everyone?\" I choked. \"I thought Emmett and Rosalie were in Africa.\" The rest of Forks was under the impression that the older Cullens had gone off to college this year, to Dartmouth, but I knew better. \"Emmett wanted to be here.\" \"But\u2026 Rosalie?\" \"I know, Bella. Don't worry, she'll be on her best behavior.\" I didn't answer. Like I could just not worry, that easy. Unlike Alice, Edward's other \"adopted\" sister, the golden blond and exquisite Rosalie, didn't like me much. Actually, the feeling was a little bit stronger than just dislike. As far as Rosalie was concerned, I was an unwelcome intruder into her family's secret life. I felt horribly guilty about the present situation, guessing that Rosalie and Emmett's prolonged absence was my fault, even as I furtively enjoyed not having to see her Emmett, Edward's playful bear of a brother, I did miss. He was in many ways just like the big brother I'd always wanted\u2026 only much, much more terrifying. Edward decided to change the subject. \"So, if you won't let me get you the Audi, isn't there anything that you'd like for your birthday?\" The words came out in a whisper. \"You know what I want.\" A deep frown carved creases into his marble forehead. He obviously wished he'd stuck to the subject of Rosalie. It felt like we'd had this argument a lot today. \"Not tonight, Bella. Please.\" \"Well, maybe Alice will give me what I want.\" Edward growled\u2014a deep, menacing sound. \"This isn't going to be your last birthday, Bella,\" he vowed. \"That's not fair!\" I thought I heard his teeth clench together. We were pulling up to the house now. Bright light shined from every window on the first two floors. A long line of glowing Japanese lanterns hung from the porch eaves, reflecting a soft radiance on the huge cedars that surrounded the house. Big bowls of flowers\u2014pink roses\u2014lined the wide stairs up to the front doors. I moaned. Edward took a few deep breaths to calm himself. \"This is a party,\" he reminded me. \"Try to be a good sport.\" \"Sure,\" I muttered. He came around to get my door, and offered me his hand. \"I have a question.\" He waited warily. \"If I develop this film,\" I said, toying with the camera in my hands, \"will you show up in the picture?\" Edward started laughing. He helped me out of the car, pulled me up the stairs, and was still laughing as he opened the door for me. They were all waiting in the huge white living room; when I walked through the door, they greeted me with a loud chorus of \"Happy birthday, Bella!\" while I blushed and looked down. Alice, I assumed, had covered every flat surface with pink candles and dozens of crystal bowls filled with hundreds of roses. There was a table with a white cloth draped over it next to Edward's grand piano, holding a pink birthday cake, more roses, a stack of glass plates, and a small pile of silver-wrapped presents. It was a hundred times worse than I'd imagined. Edward, sensing my distress, wrapped an encouraging arm around my waist and kissed the top of my head. Edward's parents, Carlisle and Esme\u2014impossibly youthful and lovely as ever\u2014were the closest to the door. Esme hugged me carefully, her soft, caramel-colored hair brushing against my cheek as she kissed my forehead, and then Carlisle put his arm around my shoulders. \"Sorry about this, Bella,\" he stage-whispered. \"We couldn't rein Alice in.\" Rosalie and Emmett stood behind them. Rosalie didn't smile, but at least she didn't glare. Emmett's face was stretched into a huge grin. It had been months since I'd seen them; I'd forgotten how gloriously beautiful Rosalie was\u2014it almost hurt to look at her. And had Emmett always been so\u2026 big? \"You haven't changed at all,\" Emmett said with mock disappointment. \"I expected a perceptible difference, but here you are, red-faced just like always.\" \"Thanks a lot, Emmett,\" I said, blushing deeper. He laughed, \"I have to step out for a second\"\u2014he paused to wink conspicuously at Alice\u2014\"Don't do anything funny while I'm gone.\" \"I'll try.\" Alice let go of Jasper's hand and skipped forward, all her teeth sparkling in the bright light. Jasper smiled, too, but kept his distance. He leaned, long and blond, against the post at the foot of the stairs. During the days we'd had to spend cooped up together in Phoenix, I'd thought he'd gotten over his aversion to me. But he'd gone back to exactly how he'd acted before\u2014avoiding me as much as possible\u2014the moment he was free from that temporary obligation to protect me. I knew it wasn't personal, just a precaution, and I tried not to be overly sensitive about it. Jasper had more trouble sticking to the Cullens' diet than the rest of them; the scent of human blood was much harder for him to resist than the others\u2014he hadn't been trying as long. \"Time to open presents,\" Alice declared. She put her cool hand under my elbow and towed me to the table with the cake and the shiny packages. I put on my best martyr face. \"Alice, I know I told you I didn't want anything\u2014\" \"But I didn't listen,\" she interrupted, smug. \"Open it.\" She took the camera from my hands and replaced it with a big, square silver box. The box was so light that it felt empty. The tag on top said that it was from Emmett, Rosalie, and Jasper. Self-consciously, I tore the paper off and then stared at the box it concealed. It was something electrical, with lots of numbers in the name. I opened the box, hoping for further illumination. But the box was empty. \"Um\u2026 thanks.\" Rosalie actually cracked a smile. Jasper laughed. \"It's a stereo for your truck,\" he explained. \"Emmett's installing it right now so that you can't return it.\" Alice was always one step ahead of me. \"Thanks, Jasper, Rosalie,\" I told them, grinning as I remembered Edward's complaints about my radio this afternoon\u2014all a setup, apparently. \"Thanks, Emmett!\" I called more loudly. I heard his booming laugh from my truck, and I couldn't help laughing, too. \"Open mine and Edward's next,\" Alice said, so excited her voice was a high-pitched trill. She held a small, flat square in her hand. I turned to give Edward a basilisk glare. \"You promised.\" Before he could answer, Emmett bounded through the door. \"Just in time!\" he crowed. He pushed in behind Jasper, who had also drifted closer than usual to get a good look. \"I didn't spend a dime,\" Edward assured me. He brushed a strand of hair from my face, leaving my skin tingling from his touch. I inhaled deeply and turned to Alice. \"Give it to me,\" I sighed. Emmett chuckled with delight. I took the little package, rolling my eyes at Edward while I stuck my finger under the edge of the paper and jerked it under the tape. \"Shoot,\" I muttered when the paper sliced my finger; I pulled it out to examine the damage. A single drop of blood oozed from the tiny cut. It all happened very quickly then. \"No!\" Edward roared. He threw himself at me, flinging me back across the table. It fell, as I did, scattering the cake and the presents, the flowers and the plates. I landed in the mess of shattered crystal. Jasper slammed into Edward, and the sound was like the crash of boulders in a rock slide. There was another noise, a grisly snarling that seemed to be coming from deep in Jasper's chest. Jasper tried to shove past Edward, snapping his teeth just inches from Edward's face. Emmett grabbed Jasper from behind in the next second, locking him into his massive steel grip, but Jasper struggled on, his wild, empty eyes focused only on me. Beyond the shock, there was also pain. I'd tumbled down to the floor by the piano, with my arms thrown out instinctively to catch my fall, into the jagged shards of glass. Only now did I feel the searing, stinging pain that ran from my wrist to the crease inside my elbow. Dazed and disoriented, I looked up from the bright red blood pulsing out of my arm\u2014into the fevered eyes of the six suddenly ravenous vampires.",

            "en": "7 REPETITION         17. VISITOR UNNATURALLY STILL AND WHITE, WITH LARGE BLACK EYES intent on my face, my visitor waited perfectly motionless in the center of the hall, beautiful beyond imagining. My knees trembled for a second, and I nearly fell. Then I hurled myself at her. \"Alice, oh, Alice!\" I cried, as I slammed into her. I'd forgotten how hard she was; it was like running headlong into a wall of cement. \"Bella?\" There was a strange mingling of relief and confusion in her voice. I locked my arms around her, gasping to inhale as much of the scent of her skin as possible. It wasn't like anything else\u2014not floral or spice, citrus or musk. No perfume in the world could compare. My memory hadn't done it justice. I didn't notice when the gasping turned into something else\u2014I only realized I was sobbing when Alice dragged me to the living room couch and pulled me into her lap. It was like curling up into a cool stone, but a stone that was contoured comfortingly to the shape of my body. She rubbed my back in a gentle rhythm, waiting for me to get control of myself. \"I'm\u2026 sorry,\" I blubbered. \"I'm just\u2026 so happy\u2026 to see you!\" \"It's okay, Bella. Everything's okay.\" \"Yes,\" I bawled. And, for once, it seemed that way. Alice sighed. \"I'd forgotten how exuberant you are,\" she said, and her tone was disapproving. I looked up at her through my streaming eyes. Alice's neck was tight, straining away from me, her lips pressed together firmly. Her eyes were black as pitch. \"Oh,\" I puffed, as I realized the problem. She was thirsty. And I smelled appetizing. It had been a while since I'd had to think about that kind of thing. \"Sorry.\" \"It's my own fault. It's been too long since I hunted. I shouldn't let myself get so thirsty. But I was in a hurry today.\" The look she directed at me then was a glare. \"Speaking of which, would you like to explain to me how you're alive?\" That brought me up short and stopped the sobs. I realized what must have happened immediately, and why Alice was here. I swallowed loudly. \"You saw me fall.\" \"No,\" she disagreed, her eyes narrowing. \"I saw you jump.\" I pursed my lips as I tried to think of an explanation that wouldn't sound nuts. Alice shook her head. \"I told him this would happen, but he didn't believe me. 'Bella promised,'\" her voice imitated his so perfectly that I froze in shock while the pain ripped through my torso. \"'Don't be looking for her future, either,'\" she continued to quote him. '\"We've done enough damage.\" \"But just because I'm not looking, doesn't mean I don't see\" she went on. \"I wasn't \u00a0keeping tabs on you,\u00a0 I swear, Bella. It's just that I'm already attuned to you\u2026 when I saw you jumping, I didn't think, I just got on a plane. I knew I would be too late, but I couldn't do nothing. And then I get here, thinking maybe I could help Charlie somehow, and you drive up.\" She shook her head, this time in confusion. Her voice was strained. \"I saw you go into the water and I waited and waited for you to come up, but you didn't. \u00a0\u00a0What happened? And how could you do that to Charlie? Did you stop to think what this would do to him? And my brother? Do you have any idea what Edward\u2014\" I cut her off then, as soon as she said his name. I'd let her go on, even after I realized the misunderstanding she was under, just to hear the perfect bell tone of her voice. But it was time to interrupt. \"Alice, I wasn't committing suicide.\" She eyed me dubiously. \"Are you saying you didn't jump off a cliff?\" \"No, but\u2026\" I grimaced. \"It was for recreational purposes only.\" Her expression hardened. \"I'd seen some of Jacob's friends cliff diving,\" I insisted. \"It looked like\u2026 fun, and I was bored\u2026\" She waited. \"I didn't think about how the storm would affect the currents. Actually, I didn't think about the water much at all.\" Alice didn't buy it. I could see that she still thought I had been trying to kill myself. I decided to redirect. \"So if you saw me go in, why didn't you see Jacob?\" She cocked her head to the side, distracted. I continued. \"It's true that I probably would have drowned if Jacob hadn't jumped in after me. Well, okay, there's no probably about it. But he did, and he pulled me out, and I guess he towed me back to shore, though I was kind of out for that part. It couldn't have been more than a minute that I was under before he grabbed me. How come you didn't see that?\" She frowned in perplexity. \"Someone pulled you out?\" \"Yes. Jacob saved me.\" I watched curiously as an enigmatic range of emotions flitted across her face. Something was bothering her\u2014her imperfect vision? But I wasn't sure. Then she deliberately leaned in and sniffed my shoulder. I froze. \"Don't be ridiculous,\" she muttered, sniffing at me some more. \"What are you doing?\" She ignored my question. \"Who was with you out there just now? It sounded like you were arguing.\" \"Jacob Black. He's\u2026 sort of my best friend, I guess. At least, he was\u2026\" I thought of Jacob's angry, betrayed face, and wondered what he was to me now. Alice nodded, seeming preoccupied. \"What?\" \"I don't know,\" she said. \"I'm not sure what it means.\" \"Well, I'm not dead, at least.\" She rolled her eyes. \"He was a fool to think you could survive alone. I've never seen anyone so prone to life-threatening idiocy.\" \"I survived,\" I pointed out. She was thinking of something else. \"So, if the currents were too much for you, how did this Jacob manage?\" \"Jacob is\u2026 strong.\" She heard the reluctance in my voice, and her eyebrows rose. I gnawed on my lip for a second. Was this a secret, or not? And if it was, then who was my greatest allegiance to? Jacob, or Alice? It was too hard to keep secrets, I decided. Jacob knew everything, why not Alice, too? \"See, well, he's\u2026 sort of a werewolf,\" I admitted in a rush. \"The Quileutes turn into \u00a0wolves when there are vampires around. They know Carlisle from a long time ago. Were you with Carlisle back then?\" Alice gawked at me for a moment, and then recovered herself, blinking rapidly. \"Well, I guess that explains the smell,\" she muttered. \"But does it explain what I didn't see?\" She frowned, her porcelain forehead creasing. \"The smell?\" I repeated. \"You smell awful,\" she said absently, still frowning. \"A werewolf? Are you sure about that?\"  \"Very sure,\" I promised, wincing as I remembered Paul and Jacob fighting in the road. \"I guess you weren't with Carlisle the last time there were werewolves here in Forks?\" \"No. I hadn't found him yet.\" Alice was still lost in thought. Suddenly, her eyes widened, and she turned to stare at me with a shocked expression. \"Your best friend is a \u00a0werewolf?\" I nodded sheepishly. \"How long has this been going on?\" \"Not long,\" I said, my voice sounding defensive. \"He's only been a werewolf for just a few weeks.\" She glowered at me. \"A young werewolf? Even worse! Edward was right\u2014you're a magnet for danger. Weren't you supposed to be staying out of trouble?\" \"There's nothing wrong with werewolves,\" I grumbled, stung by her critical tone. \"Until they lose their tempers.\" She shook her head sharply from side to side. \"Leave it to you, Bella.  Anyone else would be better off when the vampires left town. But you have to start hanging out with the first monsters you can find.\" I didn't want to argue with Alice\u2014I was still trembling with joy that she was really, truly here, that I could touch her marble skin and hear her wind-chime voice\u2014but she had it all wrong. \"No, Alice, the vampires didn't really leave\u2014not all of them, anyway. That's the whole trouble. If it weren't for the werewolves, Victoria would have gotten me by now. Well, if it weren't for Jake and his friends, Laurent would have gotten me before she could, I guess, so\u2014\" \"Victoria?\" she hissed. \"Laurent?\" I nodded, a teensy bit alarmed by the expression in her black eyes. I pointed at my chest. \"Danger magnet, remember?\" She shook her head again. \"Tell me everything\u2014start at the beginning.\" I glossed over the beginning, skipping the motorcycles and the voices, but telling her everything else right up to today's misadventure. Alice didn't like my thin explanation about boredom and the cliffs, so I hurried on to the strange flame I'd seen on the water and what I thought it meant. Her eyes narrowed almost to slits at that part. It was strange to see her look so\u2026 so dangerous\u2014like a vampire. I swallowed hard and went on with the rest about Harry. She listened to my story without interrupting. Occasionally, she would shake her head, and the crease in her forehead deepened until it looked like it was carved permanently into the marble of her skin. She didn't speak and, finally, I fell quiet, struck again by the borrowed grief at Harry's passing. I thought of Charlie; he would be home soon. What condition would he be in? \"Our leaving didn't do you any good at all, did it?\" Alice murmured. I laughed once\u2014it was a slightly hysterical sound. \"That was never the point, though, was it? It's not like you left for my benefit.\" Alice scowled at the floor for a moment. \"Well\u2026 I guess I acted impulsively today. I probably shouldn't have intruded.\" I could feel the blood draining from my face. My stomach dropped. \"Don't go, Alice,\" I whispered. My fingers locked around the collar of her white shirt and I began to hyperventilate. \"Please don't leave me.\" Her eyes opened wider. \"All right,\" she said, enunciating each word with slow precision. \"I'm not going anywhere tonight. Take a deep breath.\" I tried to obey, though I couldn't quite locate my lungs. She watched my face while I concentrated on my breathing. She waited till I was calmer to comment.  \"You look like hell, Bella.\" \"I drowned today,\" I reminded her. \"It goes deeper than that. You're a mess.\" I flinched. \"Look, I'm doing my best.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"It hasn't been easy. I'm working on it.\" She frowned. \"I told him,\" she said to herself. \"Alice,\" I sighed. \"What did you think you were going to find? I mean, besides me dead? Did you expect to find me skipping around and whistling show tunes? You know me better than that.\" \"I do. But I hoped.\" \"Then I guess I don't have the corner on the idiocy market.\" The phone rang. \"That has to be Charlie,\" I said, staggering to my feet. I grabbed Alice's stone hand and dragged her with me to the kitchen. I wasn't about to let her out of my sight. \"Charlie?\" I answered the phone. \"No, it's me,\" Jacob said. \"Jake!\" Alice scrutinized my expression. \"Just making sure you were still alive,\" Jacob said sourly. \"I'm fine. I told you that it wasn't\u2014\" \"Yeah. I got it. 'Bye.\" Jacob hung up on me. I sighed and let my head hang back, staring at the ceiling. \"That's going to be a problem.\" Alice squeezed my hand. \"They aren't excited I'm here.\" \"Not especially. But it's none of their business anyway.\" Alice put her arm around me. \"So what do we do now?\" she mused. She seemed to talk to herself for a moment. \"Things to do. Loose ends to tie.\" \"What things to do?\" Her face was suddenly careful. \"I don't know for sure\u2026 I need to see Carlisle.\" Would she leave so soon? My stomach dropped. \"Could you stay?\" I begged. \"Please? For just a little while. I've missed you so much.\" My voice broke. \"If you think that's a good idea.\" Her eyes were unhappy. \"I do. You can stay here\u2014Charlie would love that.\" \"I have a house, Bella.\" I nodded, disappointed but resigned. She hesitated, studying me. \"Well, I need to go get a suitcase of clothes, at the very least.\" I threw my arms around her. \"Alice, you're the best!\" \"And I think I'll need to hunt. Immediately,\" she added in a strained voice. \"Oops.\" I took a step back. \"Can you stay out of trouble for one hour?\" she asked skeptically. Then, before I could \u00a0answer, she held up one finger and closed her eyes. Her face went smooth and blank for a few seconds. And then her eyes opened and she answered her own question. \"Yes, you'll be fine. For tonight, anyway.\" She grimaced. Even making faces, she looked like an angel. \"You'll come back?\" I asked in a small voice. \"I promise\u2014one hour.\" I glanced at the clock over the kitchen table. She laughed and leaned in quickly to kiss me on the cheek. Then she was gone. I took a deep breath. Alice would be back. I suddenly felt so much better. I had plenty to do to keep myself busy while I waited. A shower was definitely first on the agenda. I sniffed my shoulders as I undressed, but I couldn't smell anything but the brine and seaweed scent of the ocean. I wondered what Alice had meant about me smelling bad. When I was cleaned up, I went back to the kitchen. I couldn't see any signs that Charlie had eaten recently, and he would probably be hungry when he got back. I hummed tunelessly to myself as I moved around the kitchen. While Thursday's casserole rotated in the microwave, I made up the couch with sheets and an old pillow. Alice wouldn't need it, but Charlie would need to see it. I was careful not to watch the clock. There was no reason to start myself panicking; Alice had promised. I hurried through my dinner, not tasting it\u2014just feeling the ache as it slid down my raw throat. Mostly I was thirsty; I must have drunk a half gallon of water by the time I was finished. All the salt in my system had dehydrated me. I went to go try to watch TV while I waited. Alice was already there, sitting on her improvised bed. Her eyes were a liquid butterscotch. She smiled and patted the pillow. \"Thanks.\" \"You're early,\" I said, elated. I sat down next to her and leaned my head on her shoulder. She put her cold arms around me and sighed. \"Bella. What are we going to do with you?\" \"I don't know,\" I admitted. \"I really have been trying my hardest.\" \"I believe you.\" It was silent. \"Does\u2014does he\u2026\" I took a deep breath. It was harder to say his name out loud, even though I was able to think it now. \"Does Edward know you're here?\" I couldn't help asking. It was my pain, after all. I'd deal with it when she was gone, I promised myself, and felt sick at the thought. \"No.\" There was only one way that could be true. \"He's not with Carlisle and Esme?\" \"He checks in every few months.\" \"Oh.\" He must still be out enjoying his distractions. I focused my curiosity on a safer topic. \"You said you flew here\u2026 Where did you come from?\" \"I was in Denali. Visiting Tanya's family.\" \"Is Jasper here? Did he come with your'\" She shook her head. \"He didn't approve of my interfering. We promised\u2026\" she trailed off, and then her tone changed. \"And you think Charlie won't mind my being here?\" she asked, sounding worried. \"Charlie thinks you're wonderful, Alice.\" \"Well, we're about to find out.\" Sure enough, a few seconds later I heard the cruiser pull into the driveway. I jumped up and hurried to open the door. Charlie trudged slowly up the walk, his eyes on the ground and his shoulders slumped. I walked forward to meet him; he didn't even see me until I hugged him around the waist. He embraced me back fiercely. \"I'm so sorry about Harry, Dad.\" \"I'm really going to miss him,\" Charlie mumbled. \"How's Sue doing?\" \"She seems dazed, like she hasn't grasped it yet. Sam's staying with her\u2026\" The volume of his voice faded in and out. \"Those poor kids. Leah's just a year older than you, and Seth is only fourteen\u2026\" He shook his head. He kept his arms tight around me as he started toward the door again. \"Um, Dad?\" I figured I'd better warn him. \"You'll never guess who's here.\" He looked at me blankly. His head swiveled around, and he spied the Mercedes across the street, the porch light reflecting off the glossy black paint. Before he could react, Alice was in the doorway. \"Hi, Charlie,\" she said in a subdued voice. \"I'm sorry I came at such a bad time.\" \"Alice Cullen?\" he peered at the slight figure in front of him as if he doubted what his eyes were telling him. \"Alice, is that you?\" \"It's me,\" she confirmed. \"I was in the neighborhood.\" \"Is Carlisle\u2026?\" \"No, I'm alone.\" Both Alice and I knew he wasn't really asking about Carlisle. His arm tightened over my shoulder. \"She can stay here, can't she?\" I pleaded. \"I already asked her.\" \"Of course,\" Charlie said mechanically. \"We'd love to have you, Alice.\" \"Thank you, Charlie. I know it's horrid timing.\" \"No, it's fine, really. I'm going to be really busy doing what I can for Harry's family; it will be nice for Bella to have some company.\" \"There's dinner for you on the table, Dad,\" I told him. \"Thanks, Bell.\" He gave me one more squeeze before he shuffled toward the kitchen. Alice went back to the couch, and I followed her. This time, she was the one to pull me against her shoulder. \"You look tired.\" \"Yeah,\" I agreed, and shrugged. \"Near-death experiences do that to me\u2026 So, what does Carlisle think of you being here?\" \"He doesn't know. He and Esme were on a hunting trip. I'll hear from him in a few days, when he gets back.\" \"You won't tell him, though\u2026 when he checks in again?\" I asked. She knew I didn't mean Carlisle now. \"No. He'd bite my head off,\" Alice said grimly. I laughed once, and then sighed. I didn't want to sleep. I wanted to stay up all night talking to Alice. And it didn't make sense for me to be tired, what with crashing on Jacob's couch all day. But drowning really had taken a lot out of me, and my eyes wouldn't stay open. I rested my head on her stone shoulder, and drifted into a more peaceful oblivion than I had any hope of. I woke early, from a deep and dreamless sleep, feeling well-rested, but stiff. I was on the couch tucked under the blankets I'd laid out for Alice, and I could hear her and Charlie talking in the kitchen. It sounded like Charlie was fixing her breakfast. \"How bad was it, Charlie?\" Alice asked softly, and at first I thought they were talking about the Clear waters. Charlie sighed. \"Real bad.\" \"Tell me about it. I want to know exactly what happened when we left.\" There was a pause while a cupboard door was closed and a dial on the stove was clicked off. I waited, cringing. \"I've never felt so helpless,\" Charlie began slowly. \"I didn't know what to do. That first week\u2014I thought I was going to have to hospitalize her. She wouldn't eat or drink, she wouldn't move. Dr. Gerandy was throwing around words like 'catatonic,' but I didn't let him up to see her. I was afraid it would scare her.\" \"She snapped out of it though?\" \"I had Renee come to take her to Florida. I just didn't want to be the one\u2026 if she had to go to a hospital or something. I hoped being with her mother would help. But when we started packing her clothes, she woke up with a vengeance. I've never seen Bella throw a fit like that. She was never one for the tantrums, but, boy, did she fly into a fury. She threw her clothes everywhere and screamed that we couldn't make her leave\u2014and then she finally started crying. I thought that would be the turning point. I didn't argue when she insisted on staying here\u2026 and she did seem to get better at first\u2026\" Charlie trailed off. It was hard listening to this, knowing how much pain I'd caused him. \"But?\" Alice prompted. \"She went back to school and work, she ate and slept and did her homework. She answered when someone asked her a direct question. But she was\u2026 empty. Her eyes were blank. There were lots of little things\u2014she wouldn't listen to music anymore; I found a bunch of CDs broken in the trash. She didn't read; she wouldn't be in the same room when the TV was on, not that she watched it so much before. I finally figured it out\u2014she was avoiding everything that might remind her of\u2026 him. \"We could hardly talk; I was so worried about saying something that would upset her\u2014the littlest things would make her flinch\u2014and she never volunteered anything. She would just answer if I asked her something. \"She was alone all the time. She didn't call her friends back, and after a while, they stopped calling. \"It was night of the living dead around here. I still hear her screaming in her sleep\u2026\" I could almost see him shuddering. I shuddered, too, remembering. And then I sighed. I hadn't fooled him at all, not for one second. \"I'm so sorry, Charlie,\" Alice said, voice <em>glum</em>. \"It's not your fault.\" The way he said it made it perfectly clear that he was holding someone responsible. \"You were always a good friend to her.\" \"She seems better now, though.\" \"Yeah. Ever since she started hanging out with Jacob Black, I've noticed a real improvement. She has some color in her cheeks when she comes home, some light in her eyes. She's happier.\" He paused, and his voice was different when he spoke again. \"He's a year or so younger than her, and I know she used to think of him as a friend, but I think maybe it's something more now, or headed that direction, anyway.\" Charlie said this in a tone that was almost belligerent. It was a warning, not for Alice, but for her to pass along. \"Jake's old for his years,\" he continued, still sounding defensive. \"He's taken care of his father physically the way Bella took care of her mother \u00a0emotionally. It matured him. He's a good-looking kid, too\u2014takes after his mom's side. He's good for Bella, you know,\" Charlie insisted.  \"Then it's good she has him,\" Alice agreed. Charlie sighed out a big gust of air, folding quickly to the lack of opposition. \"Okay, so I guess that's overstating things. I don't know\u2026 even with Jacob, now and then I see something in her eyes, and I wonder if I've ever grasped how much pain she's really in It's not normal, Alice, and it\u2026 it frightens me. Not normal at all. Not like someone\u2026 left her, but like someone died.\" His voice cracked. It was like someone had died\u2014like I had died. Because it had been more than just losing the truest of true loves, as if that were not enough to kill anyone. It was also losing a whole future, a whole family\u2014the whole life that I'd chosen\u2026 Charlie went on in a hopeless tone. \"I don't know if she's going to get over it\u2014I'm not sure if it's in her nature to heal from something like this. She's always been such a constant little thing. She doesn't get past things, change her mind.\" \"She's one of a kind,\" Alice agreed in a dry voice. \"And Alice\u2026\" Charlie hesitated. \"Now, you know how fond I am of you, and I can tell that she's happy to see you, but\u2026 I'm a little worried about what your visit will do to her.\" \"So am I, Charlie, so am I. I wouldn't have come if I'd had any idea. I'm sorry.\" \"Don't apologize, honey. Who knows? Maybe it will be good for her.\" \"I hope you're right.\" There was a long break while forks scraped plates and Charlie chewed. I wondered where Alice was hiding the food. \"Alice, I have to ask you something,\" Charlie said awkwardly. Alice was calm. \"Go ahead.\" \"He's not coming back to visit, too, is he?\" I could hear the suppressed anger in Charlie's voice. Alice answered in a soft, reassuring tone. \"He doesn't even know I'm here. The last time I spoke with him, he was in South America.\" I stiffened as I heard this new information, and listened harder. \"That's something, at least.\" Charlie snorted. \"Well, I hope he's enjoying himself.\" For the first time, Alice's voice had a bit of steel in it. \"I wouldn't make assumptions, Charlie.\" I knew how her eyes would flash when she used that tone. A chair scooted from the table, scraping loudly across the floor. I pictured Charlie getting up; there was no way Alice would make that kind of noise. The faucet ran, splashing against a dish. It didn't sound like they were going to say anything more about Edward, so I decided it was time to wake up. I turned over, bouncing against the springs to make them squeak. Then I yawned loudly. All was quiet in the kitchen. I stretched and groaned. \"Alice?\" I asked innocently; the soreness rasping in my throat added nicely to the charade. \"I'm in the kitchen, Bella,\" Alice called, no hint in her voice that she suspected my eavesdropping. But she was good at hiding things like that. Charlie had to leave then\u2014he was helping Sue Clearwater with the funeral arrangements. It would have been a very long day without Alice. She never spoke about leaving, and I didn't ask her. I knew it was inevitable, but I put it out of my mind. Instead, we talked about her family\u2014all but one. Carlisle was working nights in Ithaca and teaching part time at Cornell. Esme was restoring a seventeenth century house, a historical monument, in the forest north of the city. Emmett and Rosalie had gone to Europe for a few months on another honeymoon, but they were back now. Jasper was at Cornell, too, studying philosophy this time. And Alice had been doing some personal research, concerning the information I'd accidentally uncovered for her last spring. She'd successfully tracked down the asylum where she'd spent the last years of her human life. The life she had no memory of. \"My name was Mary Alice Brandon,\" she told me quietly. \"I had a little sister named Cynthia. Her daughter\u2014my niece\u2014is still alive in Biloxi.\" \"Did you find out why they put you in\u2026 that place?\" What would drive parents to that extreme? Even if their daughter saw visions of the future\u2026 She just shook her head, her topaz eyes thoughtful. \"I couldn't find much about them. I went through all the old newspapers on microfiche. My family wasn't mentioned often; they weren't part of the social circle that made the papers. My parents' engagement was there, and Cynthia's.\" The name fell uncertainly from her tongue. \"My birth was announced\u2026 and my death. I found my grave. I also filched my admissions sheet from the old asylum archives. The date on the admission and the date on my tombstone are the same.\" I didn't know what to say, and, after a short pause, Alice moved on to lighter topics. The Cullens were reassembled now, with the one exception, spending Cornell's spring break in Denali with Tanya and her family. I listened too eagerly to even the most trivial news. She never mentioned the one I was most interested in, and for that I was grateful. It was enough to listen to the stories of the family I'd once dreamed of belonging to. Charlie didn't get back until after dark, and he looked more worn than he had the night before. He would be headed back to the reservation first thing in the morning for Harry's funeral, so he turned in early. I stayed on the couch with Alice again. Charlie was almost a stranger when he came down the stairs before the sun was up, wearing an old suit I'd never seen him in before. The jacket hung open; I guessed it was too tight to fasten the buttons. His tie was a bit wide for the current style. He tiptoed to the door, trying not to wake us up. I let him go, pretending to sleep, as Alice did on the recliner. As soon as he was out the door, Alice sat up. Under the quilt, she was fully dressed. \"So, what are we doing today?\" she asked. \"I don't know\u2014do you see anything interesting happening?\" She smiled and shook her head. \"But it's still early.\" All the time I'd been spending in La Push meant a pile of things I'd been neglecting at home, and I decided to catch up on my chores. I wanted to do something, anything that might make life easier for Charlie\u2014maybe it would make him feel just a little better to come home to a clean, organized house. I started with the bathroom\u2014it showed the most signs of neglect. While I worked, Alice leaned against the doorjamb and asked nonchalant questions about my, well, our high school friends and what they been up to since she'd left. Her face stayed casual and emotionless, but I sensed her disapproval when she realized how little I could tell her. Or maybe I just had a guilty conscience after eavesdropping on her conversation with Charlie yesterday morning. I was literally up to my elbows in Comet, scrubbing the floor of the bathtub, when the doorbell rang. I looked to Alice at once, and her expression was perplexed, almost worried, which was strange; Alice was never taken by surprise. \"Hold on!\" I shouted in the general direction of the front door, getting up and hurrying to the sink to rinse my arms off. \"Bella,\" Alice said with a trace of frustration in her voice, \"I have a fairly good guess who that might be, and I think I'd better step out.\" \"Guess?\" I echoed. Since when did Alice have to guess anything? \"If this is a repeat of my egregious lapse in foresight yesterday, then it's most likely Jacob Black or one of his\u2026 friends.\" I stared at her, putting it together. \"You can't see werewolves?\" She grimaced. \"So it would seem.\" She was obviously annoyed by this fact\u2014very annoyed. The doorbell rang again\u2014buzzing twice quickly and impatiently. \"You don't have go anywhere, Alice. You were here first.\" She laughed her silvery little laugh\u2014it had a dark edge. \"Trust me\u2014it wouldn't be a good idea to have me and Jacob Black in a room together.\" She kissed my cheek swiftly before she vanished through Charlie's door\u2014and out his back window, no doubt. The doorbell rang again.",

            "en": "5          5. BLOOD TYPE I made my way to English in a daze. I didn't even realize when I first walked in that class had already started. \"Thank you for joining us, Miss Swan,\" Mr. Mason said in a disparaging tone. I flushed and hurried to my seat. It wasn't till class ended that I realized Mike wasn't sitting in his usual seat next to me. I felt a twinge of guilt. But he and Eric both met me at the door as usual, so I figured I wasn't totally unforgiven. Mike seemed to become more himself as we walked, gaining enthusiasm as he talked about the weather report for this weekend. The rain was supposed to take a minor break, and so maybe his beach trip would be possible. I tried to sound eager, to make up for disappointing him yesterday. It was hard; rain or no rain, it would still only be in the high forties, if we were lucky. The rest of the morning passed in a blur. It was difficult to believe that I hadn't just imagined what Edward had said, and the way his eyes had looked. Maybe it was just a very convincing dream that I'd confused with reality. That seemed more probable than that I really appealed to him on any level. So I was impatient and frightened as Jessica and I entered the cafeteria. I wanted to see his face, to see if he'd gone back to the cold, indifferent person I'd known for the last several weeks. Or if, by some miracle, I'd really heard what I thought I'd heard this morning. Jessica babbled on and on about her dance plans \u2014 Lauren and Angela had asked the other boys and they were all going together \u2014 completely unaware of my inattention. Disappointment flooded through me as my eyes unerringly focused on his table. The other four were there, but he was absent. Had he gone home? I followed the still-babbling Jessica through the line, crushed. I'd lost my appetite \u2014 I bought nothing but a bottle of lemonade. I just wanted to go sit down and sulk. \"Edward Cullen is staring at you again,\" Jessica said, finally breaking through my abstraction with his name. \"I wonder why he's sitting alone today.\" My head snapped up. I followed her gaze to see Edward, smiling crookedly, staring at me from an empty table across the cafeteria from where he usually sat. Once he'd caught my eye, he raised one hand and motioned with his index finger for me to join him. As I stared in disbelief, he winked. \"Does he mean you?\" Jessica asked with insulting astonishment in her voice. \"Maybe he needs help with his Biology homework,\" I muttered for her benefit. \"Um, I'd better go see what he wants.\" I could feel her staring after me as I walked away. When I reached his table, I stood behind the chair across from him, unsure. \"Why don't you sit with me today?\" he asked, smiling. I sat down automatically, watching him with caution. He was still smiling. It was hard to believe that someone so beautiful could be real. I was afraid that he might disappear in a sudden puff of smoke, and I would wake up. He seemed to be waiting for me to say something. \"This is different,\" I finally managed. \"Well\u2026\" He paused, and then the rest of the words followed in a rush. \"I decided as long as I was going to hell, I might as well do it thoroughly.\" I waited for him to say something that made sense. The seconds ticked by. \"You know I don't have any idea what you mean,\" I eventually pointed out. \"I know.\" He smiled again, and then he changed the subject. \"I think your friends are angry with me for stealing you.\" \"They'll survive.\" I could feel their stares boring into my back. \"I may not give you back, though,\" he said with a wicked glint in his eyes. I gulped. He laughed. \"You look worried.\" \"No,\" I said, but, ridiculously, my voice broke. \"Surprised, actually\u2026 what brought all this on?\" \"I told you \u2014 I got tired of trying to stay away from you. So I'm giving up.\" He was still smiling, but his ocher eyes were serious. \"Giving up?\" I repeated in confusion. \"Yes \u2014 giving up trying to be good. I'm just going to do what I want now, and let the chips fall where they may.\" His smile faded as he explained, and a hard edge crept into his voice. \"You lost me again.\" The breathtaking crooked smile reappeared. \"I always say too much when I'm talking to you \u2014 that's one of the problems.\" \"Don't worry \u2014 I don't understand any of it,\" I said wryly. \"I'm counting on that.\" \"So, in plain English, are we friends now?\" \"Friends\u2026\" he mused, dubious. \"Or not,\" I muttered. He grinned. \"Well, we can try, I suppose. But I'm warning you now that I'm not a good friend for you.\" Behind his smile, the warning was real.  \"You say that a lot,\" I noted, trying to ignore the sudden trembling in my stomach and keep my voice even. \"Yes, because you're not listening to me. I'm still waiting for you to believe it. If you're smart, you'll avoid me.\" \"I think you've made your opinion on the subject of my intellect clear, too.\" My eyes narrowed. He smiled apologetically. \"So, as long as I'm being\u2026 not smart, we'll try to be friends?\" I struggled to sum up the confusing exchange. \"That sounds about right.\" I looked down at my hands wrapped around the lemonade bottle, not sure what to do now. \"What are you thinking?\" he asked curiously. I looked up into his deep gold eyes, became befuddled, and, as usual, blurted out the truth. \"I'm trying to figure out what you are.\" His jaw tightened, but he kept his smile in place with some effort. \"Are you having any luck with that?\" he asked in an offhand tone. \"Not too much,\" I admitted. He chuckled. \"What are your theories?\" I blushed. I had been vacillating during the last month between Bruce Wayne and Peter Parker. There was no way I was going to own up to that. \"Won't you tell me?\" he asked, tilting his head to one side with a shockingly tempting smile. I shook my head. \"Too embarrassing.\" \"That's really frustrating, you know,\" he complained. \"No,\" I disagreed quickly, my eyes narrowing, \"I can't imagine why that would be frustrating at all \u2014 just because someone refuses to tell you what they're thinking, even if all the while they're making cryptic little remarks specifically designed to keep you up at night wondering what they could possibly mean\u2026 now, why would that be frustrating?\" He grimaced. \"Or better,\" I continued, the pent-up annoyance flowing freely now, \"say that person also did a wide range of bizarre things \u2014 from saving your life under impossible circumstances one day to treating you like a pariah the next, and he never explained any of that, either, even after he promised. That, also, would be very non-frustrating.\" \"You've got a bit of a temper, don't you?\" \"I don't like double standards.\" We stared at each other, unsmiling. He glanced over my shoulder, and then, unexpectedly, he snickered. \"What?\" \"Your boyfriend seems to think I'm being unpleasant to you \u2014 he's debating whether or not to come break up our fight.\" He snickered again. \"I don't know who you're talking about,\" I said frostily. \"But I'm sure you're wrong, anyway.\" \"I'm not. I told you, most people are easy to read.\" \"Except me, of course.\" \"Yes. Except for you.\" His mood shifted suddenly; his eyes turned brooding. \"I wonder why that is.\" I had to look away from the intensity of his stare. I concentrated on unscrewing the lid of my lemonade. I took a swig, staring at the table without seeing it. \"Aren't you hungry?\" he asked, distracted. \"No.\" I didn't feel like mentioning that my stomach was already full \u2014 of butterflies. \"You?\" I looked at the empty table in front of him. \"No, I'm not hungry.\" I didn't understand his expression \u2014 it looked like he was enjoying some private joke. \"Can you do me a favor?\" I asked after a second of hesitation. He was suddenly wary. \"That depends on what you want.\" \"It's not much,\" I assured him. He waited, guarded but curious. \"I just wondered\u2026 if you could warn me beforehand the next time you decide to ignore me for my own good. Just so I'm prepared.\" I looked at the lemonade bottle as I spoke, tracing the circle of the opening with my pinkie finger. \"That sounds fair.\" He was pressing his lips together to keep from laughing when I looked up. \"Thanks.\" \"Then can I have one answer in return?\" he demanded. \"One.\" \"Tell me one theory.\" Whoops. \"Not that one.\" \"You didn't qualify, you just promised one answer,\" he reminded me. \"And you've broken promises yourself,\" I reminded him back. \"Just one theory \u2014 I won't laugh.\" \"Yes, you will.\" I was positive about that. He looked down, and then glanced up at me through his long black lashes, his ocher eyes scorching. \"Please?\" he breathed, leaning toward me. I blinked, my mind going blank. Holy crow, how did he do that? \"Er, what?\" I asked, dazed. \"Please tell me just one little theory.\" His eyes still smoldered at me. \"Um, well, bitten by a radioactive spider?\" Was he a hypnotist, too? Or was I just a hopeless pushover? \"That's not very creative,\" he scoffed. \"I'm sorry, that's all I've got,\" I said, miffed. \"You're not even close,\" he teased. \"No spiders?\" \"Nope.\" \"And no radioactivity?\" \"None.\" \"Dang,\" I sighed. \"Kryptonite doesn't bother me, either,\" he chuckled. \"You're not supposed to laugh, remember?\" He struggled to compose his face. \"I'll figure it out eventually,\" I warned him. \"I wish you wouldn't try.\" He was serious again. \"Because\u2026 ?\" \"What if I'm not a superhero? What if I'm the bad guy?\" He smiled playfully, but his eyes were impenetrable. \"Oh,\" I said, as several things he'd hinted fell suddenly into place. \"I see.\" \"Do you?\" His face was abruptly severe, as if he were afraid that he'd accidentally said too much. \"You're dangerous?\" I guessed, my pulse quickening as I intuitively realized the truth of my own words. He was dangerous. He'd been trying to tell me that all along. He just looked at me, eyes full of some emotion I couldn't comprehend. \"But not bad,\" I whispered, shaking my head. \"No, I don't believe that you're bad.\" \"You're wrong.\" His voice was almost inaudible. He looked down, stealing my bottle lid and then spinning it on its side between his fingers. I stared at him, wondering why I didn't feel afraid. He meant what he was saying \u2014 that was obvious. But I just felt anxious, on edge\u2026 and, more than anything else, fascinated. The same way I always felt when I was near him. The silence lasted until I noticed that the cafeteria was almost empty. I jumped to my feet. \"We're going to be late.\" \"I'm not going to class today,\" he said, twirling the lid so fast it was just a blur. \"Why not?\" \"It's healthy to ditch class now and then.\" He smiled up at me, but his eyes were still troubled. \"Well, I'm going,\" I told him. I was far too big a coward to risk getting caught. He turned his attention back to his makeshift top. \"I'll see you later, then.\" I hesitated, torn, but then the first bell sent me hurrying out the door \u2014 with a last glance confirming that he hadn't moved a centimeter. As I half-ran to class, my head was spinning faster than the bottle cap. So few questions had been answered in comparison to how many new questions had been raised. At least the rain had stopped. I was lucky; Mr. Banner wasn't in the room yet when I arrived. I settled quickly into my seat, aware that both Mike and Angela were staring at me. Mike looked resentful; Angela looked surprised, and slightly awed. Mr. Banner came in the room then, calling the class to order. He was juggling a few small cardboard boxes in his arms. He put them down on Mike's table, telling him to start passing them around the class. \"Okay, guys, I want you all to take one piece from each box,\" he said as he produced a pair of rubber gloves from the pocket of his lab jacket and pulled them on. The sharp sound as the gloves snapped into place against his wrists seemed ominous to me. \"The first should be an indicator card,\" he went on, grabbing a white card with four squares marked on it and displaying it. \"The second is a four-pronged applicator \u2014\" he held up something that looked like a nearly toothless hair pick \"\u2014 and the third is a sterile micro-lancet.\" He held up a small piece of blue plastic and split it open. The barb was invisible from this distance, but my stomach flipped. \"I'll be coming around with a dropper of water to prepare your cards, so please don't start until I get to you.\" He began at Mike's table again, carefully putting one drop of water in each of the four squares. \"Then I want you to carefully prick your finger with the lancet\u2026\" He grabbed Mike's hand and jabbed the spike into the tip of Mike's middle finger. Oh no. Clammy moisture broke out across my forehead. \"Put a small drop of blood on each of the prongs.\" He demonstrated, squeezing Mike's finger till the blood flowed. I swallowed convulsively, my stomach heaving. \"And then apply it to the card,\" he finished, holding up the dripping red card for us to see. I closed my eyes, trying to hear through the ringing\u00a0 in my ears. \"The Red Cross is having a blood drive in Port Angeles next weekend, so I thought you should all know your blood type.\" He sounded proud of himself. \"Those of you who aren't eighteen yet will need a parent's permission \u2014 I have slips at my desk.\" He continued through the room with his water drops. I put my cheek against the cool black tabletop and tried to hold on to my consciousness. All around me I could hear squeals, complaints, and giggles as my classmates skewered their fingers. I breathed slowly in and out through my mouth. \"Bella, are you all right?\" Mr. Banner asked. His voice was close to my head, and it sounded alarmed. \"I already know my blood type, Mr. Banner,\" I said in a weak voice. I was afraid to raise my head. \"Are you feeling faint?\" \"Yes, sir,\" I muttered, internally kicking myself for not ditching when I had the chance. \"Can someone take Bella to the nurse, please?\" he called. I didn't have to look up to know that it would be Mike who volunteered.  \"Can you walk?\" Mr. Banner asked. \"Yes,\" I whispered. Just let me get out of here, I thought. I'll crawl. Mike seemed eager as he put his arm around my waist and pulled my arm over his shoulder. I leaned against him heavily on the way out of the classroom. Mike towed me slowly across campus. When we were around the edge of the cafeteria, out of sight of building four in case Mr. Banner was watching, I stopped. \"Just let me sit for a minute, please?\" I begged. He helped me sit on the edge of the walk. \"And whatever you do, keep your hand in your pocket,\" I warned. I was still so dizzy. I slumped over on my side, putting my cheek against the freezing, damp cement of the sidewalk, closing my eyes. That seemed to help a little. \"Wow, you're green, Bella,\" Mike said nervously. \"Bella?\" a different voice called from the distance. No! Please let me be imagining that horribly familiar voice. \"What's wrong \u2014 is she hurt?\" His voice was closer now, and he sounded upset. I wasn't imagining it. I squeezed my eyes shut, hoping to die. Or, at the very least, not to throw up. Mike seemed stressed. \"I think she's fainted. I don't know what happened, she didn't even stick her finger.\" \"Bella.\" Edward's voice was right beside me, relieved now. \"Can you hear me?\" \"No,\" I groaned. \"Go away.\" He chuckled. \"I was taking her to the nurse,\" Mike explained in a defensive tone, \"but she wouldn't go any farther.\" \"I'll take her,\" Edward said. I could hear the smile still in his voice. \"You can go back to class.\" \"No,\" Mike protested. \"I'm supposed to do it.\" Suddenly the sidewalk disappeared from beneath me. My eyes flew open in shock. Edward had scooped me up in his arms, as easily as if I weighed ten pounds instead of a hundred and ten. \"Put me down!\" Please, please let me not vomit on him. He was walking before I was finished talking. \"Hey!\" Mike called, already ten paces behind us. Edward ignored him. \"You look awful,\" he told me, grinning. \"Put me back on the sidewalk,\" I moaned. The rocking movement of his walk was not helping. He held me away from his body, gingerly, supporting all my weight with just his arms \u2014 it didn't seem to bother him.  \"So you faint at the sight of blood?\" he asked. This seemed to entertain him. I didn't answer. I closed my eyes again and fought the nausea with all my strength, clamping my lips together. \"And not even your own blood,\" he continued, enjoying himself.  I don't know how he opened the door while carrying me, but it was suddenly warm, so I knew we were inside. \"Oh my,\" I heard a female voice gasp. \"She fainted in Biology,\" Edward explained. I opened my eyes. I was in the office, and Edward was striding past the front counter toward the nurse's door. Ms. Cope, the redheaded front office receptionist, ran ahead of him to hold it open. The grandmotherly nurse looked up from a novel, astonished, as Edward swung me into the room and placed me gently on the crackly paper that covered the brown vinyl mattress on the one cot. Then he moved to stand against the wall as far across the narrow room as possible. His eyes were bright, excited. \"She's just a little faint,\" he reassured the startled nurse. \"They're blood typing in Biology.\" The nurse nodded sagely. \"There's always one.\" He muffled a snicker. \"Just lie down for a minute, honey; it'll pass.\" \"I know,\" I sighed. The nausea was already fading. \"Does this happen a lot?\" she asked. \"Sometimes,\" I admitted. Edward coughed to hide another laugh. \"You can go back to class now,\" she told him. \"I'm supposed to stay with her.\" He said this with such assured authority that \u2014 even though she pursed her lips \u2014 the nurse didn't argue it further. \"I'll go get you some ice for your forehead, dear,\" she said to me, and then bustled out of the room. \"You were right,\" I moaned, letting my eyes close. \"I usually am \u2014 but about what in particular this time?\" \"Ditching is healthy.\" I practiced breathing evenly. \"You scared me for a minute there,\" he admitted after a pause. His tone made it sound like he was confessing a humiliating weakness. \"I thought Newton was dragging your dead body off to bury it in the woods.\" \"Ha ha.\" I still had my eyes closed, but I was feeling more normal every minute. \"Honestly \u2014 I've seen corpses with better color. I was concerned that I might have to avenge your murder.\" \"Poor Mike. I'll bet he's mad.\" \"He absolutely loathes me,\" Edward said cheerfully. \"You can't know that,\" I argued, but then I wondered suddenly if he could. \"I saw his face \u2014 I could tell.\" \"How did you see me? I thought you were ditching.\" I was almost fine now, though the queasiness would probably pass faster if I'd eaten something for lunch. On the other hand, maybe it was lucky my stomach was empty. \"I was in my car, listening to a CD.\" Such a normal response \u2014 it surprised me. I heard the door and opened my eyes to see the nurse with a cold compress in her hand. \"Here you go, dear.\" She laid it across my forehead. \"You're looking better,\" she added. \"I think I'm fine,\" I said, sitting up. Just a little ringing in my ears, no spinning. The mint green walls stayed where they should. I could see she was about to make me lie back down, but the door opened just then, and Ms. Cope stuck her head in. \"We've got another one,\" she warned. I hopped down to free up the cot for the next invalid. I handed the compress back to the nurse. \"Here, I don't need this.\" And then Mike staggered through the door, now supporting a sallow-looking Lee Stephens, another boy in our Biology class. Edward and I drew back against the wall to give them room. \"Oh no,\" Edward muttered. \"Go out to the office, Bella.\" I looked up at him, bewildered. \"Trust me \u2014 go.\" I spun and caught the door before it closed, darting out of the infirmary. I could feel Edward right behind me. \"You actually listened to me.\" He was stunned. \"I smelled the blood,\" I said, wrinkling my nose. Lee wasn't sick from watching other people, like me. \"People can't smell blood,\" he contradicted. \"Well, I can \u2014 that's what makes me sick. It smells like rust\u2026 and salt.\" He was staring at me with an unfathomable expression. \"What?\" I asked. \"It's nothing.\" Mike came through the door then, glancing from me to Edward. The look he gave Edward confirmed what Edward had said about loathing. He looked back at me, his eyes <em>glum</em>. \"You look better,\" he accused. \"Just keep your hand in your pocket,\" I warned him again. \"It's not bleeding anymore,\" he muttered. \"Are you going back to class?\" \"Are you kidding? I'd just have to turn around and come back.\" \"Yeah, I guess\u2026 So are you going this weekend? To the beach?\" While he spoke, he flashed another glare toward Edward, who was standing against the cluttered counter, motionless as a sculpture, staring off into space. I tried to sound as friendly as possible. \"Sure, I said I was in.\" \"We're meeting at my dad's store, at ten.\" His eyes flickered to Edward again, wondering if he was giving out too much information. His body language made it clear that it wasn't an open invitation. \"I'll be there,\" I promised. \"I'll see you in Gym, then,\" he said, moving uncertainly toward the door.  \"See you,\" I replied. He looked at me once more, his round face slightly pouting, and then as he walked slowly through the door, his shoulders slumped. A swell of sympathy washed over me. I pondered seeing his disappointed face again\u2026 in Gym.  \"Gym,\" I groaned. \"I can take care of that.\" I hadn't noticed Edward moving to my side, but he spoke now in my ear. \"Go sit down and look pale,\" he muttered. That wasn't a challenge; I was always pale, and my recent swoon had left a light sheen of sweat on my face. I sat in one of the creaky folding chairs and rested my head against the wall with my eyes closed. Fainting spells always exhausted me. I heard Edward speaking softly at the counter. \"Ms. Cope?\" \"Yes?\" I hadn't heard her return to her desk. \"Bella has Gym next hour, and I don't think she feels well enough. Actually, I was thinking I should take her home now. Do you think you could excuse her from class?\" His voice was like melting honey. I could imagine how much more overwhelming his eyes would be. \"Do you need to be excused, too, Edward?\" Ms. Cope fluttered. Why couldn't I do that? \"No, I have Mrs. Goff, she won't mind.\" \"Okay, it's all taken care of. You feel better, Bella,\" she called to me. I nodded weakly, hamming it up just a bit. \"Can you walk, or do you want me to carry you again?\" With his back to the receptionist, his expression became sarcastic. \"I'll walk.\" I stood carefully, and I was still fine. He held the door for me, his smile polite but his eyes mocking. I walked out into the cold, fine mist that had just begun to fall. It felt nice \u2014 the first time I'd enjoyed the constant moisture falling out of the sky \u2014 as it washed my face clean of the sticky perspiration. \"Thanks,\" I said as he followed me out. \"It's almost worth getting sick to miss Gym.\" \"Anytime.\" He was staring straight forward, squinting into the rain. \"So are you going? This Saturday, I mean?\" I was hoping he would, though it seemed unlikely. I couldn't picture him loading up to carpool with the rest of the kids from school; he didn't belong in the same world. But just hoping that he might gave me the first twinge of enthusiasm I'd felt for the outing. \"Where are you all going, exactly?\" He was still looking ahead, expressionless. \"Down to La Push, to First Beach.\" I studied his face, trying to read it. His eyes seemed to narrow infinitesimally. He glanced down at me from the corner of his eye, smiling wryly. \"I really don't think I was invited.\" I sighed. \"I just invited you.\" \"Let's you and I not push poor Mike any further this week. We don't want him to snap.\" His eyes danced; he was enjoying the idea more than he should. \"Mike-schmike.\" I muttered, preoccupied by the way he'd said \"you and I.\" I liked it more than I should.  We were near the parking lot now. I veered left, toward my truck. Something caught my jacket, yanking me back. \"Where do you think you're going?\" he asked, outraged. He was gripping a fistful of my jacket in one hand. I was confused. \"I'm going home.\" \"Didn't you hear me promise to take you safely home? Do you think I'm going to let you drive in your condition?\" His voice was still indignant. \"What condition? And what about my truck?\" I complained.  \"I'll have Alice drop it off after school.\" He was towing me toward his car now, pulling me by my jacket. It was all I could do to keep from falling backward. He'd probably just drag me along anyway if I did. \"Let go!\" I insisted. He ignored me. I staggered along sideways across the wet sidewalk until we reached the Volvo. Then he finally freed me \u2014 I stumbled against the passenger door. \"You are so pushy!\" I grumbled. \"It's open,\" was all he responded. He got in the driver's side. \"I am perfectly capable of driving myself home!\" I stood by the car, fuming. It was raining harder now, and I'd never put my hood up, so my hair was dripping down my back. He lowered the automatic window and leaned toward me across the seat. \"Get in, Bella.\" I didn't answer. I was mentally calculating my chances of reaching the truck before he could catch me. I had to admit, they weren't good. \"I'll just drag you back,\" he threatened, guessing my plan. I tried to maintain what dignity I could as I got into his car. I wasn't very successful \u2014 I looked like a half-drowned cat and my boots squeaked. \"This is completely unnecessary,\" I said stiffly. He didn't answer. He fiddled with the controls, turning the heater up and the music down. As he pulled out of the parking lot, I was preparing to give him the silent treatment \u2014 my face in full pout mode \u2014 but then I recognized the music playing, and my curiosity got the better of my intentions. \"Clair de Lune?\" I asked, surprised. \"You know Debussy?\" He sounded surprised, too. \"Not well,\" I admitted. \"My mother plays a lot of classical music around the house \u2014 I only know my favorites.\" \"It's one of my favorites, too.\" He stared out through the rain, lost in thought. I listened to the music, relaxing against the light gray leather seat. It was impossible not to respond to the familiar, soothing melody. The rain blurred everything outside the window into gray and green smudges. I began to realize we were driving very fast; the car moved so steadily, so evenly, though, I didn't feel the speed. Only the town flashing by gave it away. \"What is your mother like?\" he asked me suddenly. I glanced over to see him studying me with curious eyes. \"She looks a lot like me, but she's prettier,\" I said. He raised his eyebrows. \"I have too much Charlie in me. She's more outgoing than I am, and braver. She's irresponsible and slightly eccentric, and she's a very unpredictable cook. She's my best friend.\" I stopped. Talking about her was making me depressed. \"How old are you, Bella?\" His voice sounded frustrated for some reason I couldn't imagine. He'd stopped the car, and I realized we were at Charlie's house already. The rain was so heavy that I could barely see the house at all. It was like the car was submerged under a river. \"I'm seventeen,\" I responded, a little confused. \"You don't seem seventeen.\" His tone was reproachful; it made me laugh. \"What?\" he asked, curious again. \"My mom always says I was born thirty-five years old and that I get more middle-aged every year.\" I laughed, and then sighed. \"Well, someone has to be the adult.\" I paused for a second. \"You don't seem much like a junior in high school yourself,\" I noted. He made a face and changed the subject. \"So why did your mother marry Phil?\" I was surprised he would remember the name; I'd mentioned it just once, almost two months ago. It took me a moment to answer. \"My mother\u2026 she's very young for her age. I think Phil makes her feel even younger. At any rate, she's crazy about him.\" I shook my head. The attraction was a mystery to me. \"Do you approve?\" he asked. \"Does it matter?\" I countered. \"I want her to be happy\u2026 and he is who she wants.\" \"That's very generous\u2026 I wonder,\" he mused. \"What?\" \"Would she extend the same courtesy to you, do you think? No matter who your choice was?\" He was suddenly intent, his eyes searching mine. \"I-I think so,\" I stuttered. \"But she's the parent, after all. It's a little bit different.\" \"No one too scary then,\" he teased. I grinned in response. \"What do you mean by scary? Multiple facial piercings and extensive tattoos?\" \"That's one definition, I suppose.\" \"What's your definition?\" But he ignored my question and asked me another. \"Do you think that I could be scary?\" He raised one eyebrow, and the faint trace of a smile lightened his face. I thought for a moment, wondering whether the truth or a lie would go over better. I decided to go with the truth. \"Hmmm\u2026 I think you could be, if you wanted to.\" \"Are you frightened of me now?\" The smile vanished, and his heavenly face was suddenly serious. \"No.\" But I answered too quickly. The smile returned. \"So, now are you going to tell me about your family?\" I asked to distract him. \"It's got to be a much more interesting story than mine.\" He was instantly cautious. \"What do you want to know?\" \"The Cullens adopted you?\" I verified. \"Yes.\" I hesitated for a moment. \"What happened to your parents?\" \"They died many years ago.\" His tone was matter-of-fact. \"I'm sorry,\" I mumbled. \"I don't really remember them that clearly. Carlisle and Esme have been my parents for a long time now.\" \"And you love them.\" It wasn't a question. It was obvious in the way he spoke of them. \"Yes.\" He smiled. \"I couldn't imagine two better people.\" \"You're very lucky.\" \"I know I am.\" \"And your brother and sister?\" He glanced at the clock on the dashboard. \"My brother and sister, and Jasper and Rosalie for that matter, are going to be quite upset if they have to stand in the rain waiting for me.\" \"Oh, sorry, I guess you have to go.\" I didn't want to get out of the car. \"And you probably want your truck back before Chief Swan gets home, so you don't have to tell him about the Biology incident.\" He grinned at me. \"I'm sure he's already heard. There are no secrets in Forks.\" I sighed. He laughed, and there was an edge to his laughter. \"Have fun at the beach\u2026 good weather for sunbathing.\" He glanced out at the sheeting rain. \"Won't I see you tomorrow?\" \"No. Emmett and I are starting the weekend early.\" \"What are you going to do?\" A friend could ask that, right? I hoped the disappointment wasn't too apparent in my voice. \"We're going to be hiking in the Goat Rocks Wilderness, just south of Rainier.\" I remembered Charlie had said the Cullens went camping frequently. \"Oh, well, have fun.\" I tried to sound enthusiastic. I don't think I fooled him, though. A smile was playing around the edges of his lips. \"Will you do something for me this weekend?\" He turned to look me straight in the face, utilizing the full power of his burning gold eyes. I nodded helplessly. \"Don't be offended, but you seem to be one of those people who just attract accidents like a magnet. So\u2026 try not to fall into the ocean or get run over or anything, all right?\" He smiled crookedly. The helplessness had faded as he spoke. I glared at him.  \"I'll see what I can do,\" I snapped as I jumped out into the rain. I slammed the door behind me with excessive force. He was still smiling as he drove away.",

            "en": "17         17. THE GAME It was just beginning to drizzle when Edward turned onto my street. Up until that moment, I'd had no doubt that he'd be staying with me while I spent a few interim hours in the real world. And then I saw the black car, a weathered Ford, parked in Charlie's driveway \u2014 and heard Edward mutter something unintelligible in a low, harsh voice. Leaning away from the rain under the shallow front porch, Jacob Black stood behind his father's wheelchair. Billy's face was impassive as stone as Edward parked my truck against the curb. Jacob stared down, his expression mortified. Edward's low voice was furious. \"This is crossing the line.\" \"He came to warn Charlie?\" I guessed, more horrified than angry. Edward just nodded, answering Billy's gaze through the rain with narrowed eyes. I felt weak with relief that Charlie wasn't home yet. \"Let me deal with this,\" I suggested. Edward's black glare made me anxious. To my surprise, he agreed. \"That's probably best. Be careful, though. The child has no idea.\" I bridled a little at the word child. \"Jacob is not that much younger than I am,\" I reminded him. He looked at me then, his anger abruptly fading. \"Oh, I know,\" he assured me with a grin. I sighed and put my hand on the door handle. \"Get them inside,\" he instructed, \"so I can leave. I'll be back around dusk.\" \"Do you want my truck?\" I offered, meanwhile wondering how I would explain its absence to Charlie. He rolled his eyes. \"I could walk home faster than this truck moves.\" \"You don't have to leave,\" I said wistfully. He smiled at my <em>glum</em> expression. \"Actually, I do. After you get rid of them\" \u2014 he threw a dark glance in the Blacks' direction \u2014 \"you still have to prepare Charlie to meet your new boyfriend.\" He grinned widely, showing all of his teeth. I groaned. \"Thanks a lot.\" He smiled the crooked smile that I loved. \"I'll be back soon,\" he promised. His eyes flickered back to the porch, and then he leaned in to swiftly kiss me just under the edge of my jaw. My heart lurched frantically, and I, too, glanced toward the porch. Billy's face was no longer impassive, and his hands clutched at the armrests of his chair. \"Soon,\" I stressed as I opened the door and stepped out into the rain. I could feel his eyes on my back as I half-ran through the light sprinkle toward the porch. \"Hey, Billy. Hi, Jacob.\" I greeted them as cheerfully as I could manage. \"Charlie's gone for the day \u2014 I hope you haven't been waiting long.\" \"Not long,\" Billy said in a subdued tone. His black eyes were piercing. \"I just wanted to bring this up.\" He indicated a brown paper sack resting in his lap. \"Thanks,\" I said, though I had no idea what it could be. \"Why don't you come in for a minute and dry off?\" I pretended to be oblivious to his intense scrutiny as I unlocked the door, and waved them in ahead of me. \"Here, let me take that,\" I offered, turning to shut the door. I allowed myself one last glance at Edward. He was waiting, perfectly still, his eyes solemn. \"You'll want to put it in the fridge,\" Billy noted as he handed me the package. \"It's some of Harry Clearwater's homemade fish fry \u2014 Charlie's favorite. The fridge keeps it drier.\" He shrugged. \"Thanks,\" I repeated, but with feeling this time. \"I was running out of new ways to fix fish, and he's bound to bring home more tonight.\" \"Fishing again?\" Billy asked with a subtle gleam in his eye. \"Down at the usual spot? Maybe I'll run by and see him.\" \"No,\" I quickly lied, my face going hard. \"He was headed someplace new\u2026 but I have no idea where.\" He took in my changed expression, and it made him thoughtful. \"Jake,\" he said, still appraising me. \"Why don't you go get that new picture of Rebecca out of the car? I'll leave that for Charlie, too.\" \"Where is it?\" Jacob asked, his voice morose. I glanced at him, but he was staring at the floor, his eyebrows pulling together. \"I think I saw it in the trunk,\" Billy said. \"You may have to dig for it.\" Jacob slouched back out into the rain. Billy and I faced each other in silence. After a few seconds, the quiet started to feel awkward, so I turned and headed to the kitchen. I could hear his wet wheels squeak against the linoleum as he followed. I shoved the bag onto the crowded top shelf of the fridge, and spun around to confront him. His deeply lined face was unreadable. \"Charlie won't be back for a long time.\" My voice was almost rude. He nodded in agreement, but said nothing. \"Thanks again for the fish fry,\" I hinted. He continued nodding. I sighed and folded my arms across my chest. He seemed to sense that I had given up on small talk. \"Bella,\" he said, and then he hesitated. I waited. \"Bella,\" he said again, \"Charlie is one of my best friends.\" \"Yes.\" He spoke each word carefully in his rumbling voice. \"I noticed you've been spending time with one of the Cullens.\" \"Yes,\" I repeated curtly. His eyes narrowed. \"Maybe it's none of my business, but I don't think that is such a good idea.\" \"You're right,\" I agreed. \"It is none of your business.\" He raised his graying eyebrows at my tone. \"You probably don't know this, but the Cullen family has an unpleasant reputation on the reservation.\" \"Actually, I did know that,\" I informed him in a hard voice. This surprised him. \"But that reputation couldn't be deserved, could it?\u00a0 Because the Cullens never set foot on the reservation, do they?\" I could see that my less than subtle reminder of the agreement that both bound and protected his tribe pulled him up short. \"That's true,\" he acceded, his eyes guarded. \"You seem\u2026 well informed about the Cullens. More informed than I expected.\" I stared him down. \"Maybe even better informed than you are.\" He pursed his thick lips as he considered that. \"Maybe.\" he allowed, but his eyes were shrewd. \"Is Charlie as well informed?\" He had found the weak chink in my armor. \"Charlie likes the Cullens a lot,\" I hedged. He clearly understood my evasion. His expression was unhappy, but unsurprised. \"It's not my business,\" he said. \"But it may be Charlie's.\" \"Though it would be my business, again, whether or not I think that it's Charlie's business, right?\" I wondered if he even understood my confused question as I struggled not to say anything compromising. But he seemed to. He thought about it while the rain picked up against the roof, the only sound breaking the silence. \"Yes,\" he finally surrendered. \"I guess that's your business, too.\" I sighed with relief. \"Thanks, Billy.\" \"Just think about what you're doing, Bella,\" he urged. \"Okay,\" I agreed quickly. He frowned. \"What I meant to say was, don't do what you're doing.\" I looked into his eyes, filled with nothing but concern for me, and there was nothing I could say. Just then the front door banged loudly, and I jumped at the sound. \"There's no picture anywhere in that car.\" Jacob's complaining voice reached us before he did. The shoulders of his shirt were stained with the rain, his hair dripping, when he rounded the corner. \"Hmm,\" Billy grunted, suddenly detached, spinning his chair around to face his son. \"I guess I left it at home.\" Jacob rolled his eyes dramatically. \"Great.\" \"Well, Bella, tell Charlie\" \u2014 Billy paused before continuing \u2014 \"that we stopped by, I mean.\" \"I will,\" I muttered. Jacob was surprised. \"Are we leaving already?\" \"Charlie's gonna be out late,\" Billy explained as he rolled himself past Jacob. \"Oh.\" Jacob looked disappointed. \"Well, I guess I'll see you later, then, Bella.\" \"Sure,\" I agreed. \"Take care,\" Billy warned me. I didn't answer. Jacob helped his father out the door. I waved briefly, glancing swiftly toward my now-empty truck, and then shut the door before they were gone. I stood in the hallway for a minute, listening to the sound of their car as it backed out and drove away. I stayed where I was, waiting for the irritation and anxiety to subside. When the tension eventually faded a bit, I headed upstairs to change out of my dressy clothes. I tried on a couple of different tops, not sure what to expect tonight. As I concentrated on what was coming, what had just passed became insignificant. Now that I was removed from Jasper's and Edward's influence, I began to make up for not being terrified before. I gave up quickly on choosing an outfit \u2014 throwing on an old flannel shirt and jeans \u2014 knowing I would be in my raincoat all night anyway. The phone rang and I sprinted downstairs to get it. There was only one voice I wanted to hear; anything else would be a disappointment. But I knew that if he wanted to talk to me, he'd probably just materialize in my room. \"Hello?\" I asked, breathless. \"Bella? It's me,\" Jessica said. \"Oh, hey, Jess.\" I scrambled for a moment to come back down to reality. It felt like months rather than days since I'd spoken to Jess. \"How was the dance?\" \"It was so much fun!\" Jessica gushed. Needing no more invitation than that, she launched into a minute-by-minute account of the previous night. I mmm'd and ahh'd at the right places, but it wasn't easy to concentrate. Jessica, Mike, the dance, the school \u2014 they all seemed strangely irrelevant at the moment. My eyes kept flashing to the window, trying to judge the degree of light behind the heavy clouds. \"Did you hear what I said, Bella?\" Jess asked, irritated. \"I'm sorry, what?\" \"I said, Mike kissed me! Can you believe it?\" \"That's wonderful, Jess,\" I said. \"So what did you do yesterday?\" Jessica challenged, still sounding bothered by my lack of attention. Or maybe she was upset because I hadn't asked for details. \"Nothing, really. I just hung around outside to enjoy the sun.\" I heard Charlie's car in the garage. \"Did you ever hear anything more from Edward Cullen?\" The front door slammed and I could hear Charlie banging around under the stairs, putting his tackle away. \"Um.\" I hesitated, not sure what my story was anymore. \"Hi there, kiddo!\" Charlie called as he walked into the kitchen. I waved at him. Jess heard his voice. \"Oh, your dad's there. Never mind \u2014 we'll talk tomorrow. See you in Trig.\" \"See ya, Jess.\" I hung up the phone. \"Hey, Dad,\" I said. He was scrubbing his hands in the sink. \"Where's the fish?\" \"I put it out in the freezer.\" \"I'll go grab a few pieces before they freeze \u2014 Billy dropped off some of Harry Clearwater's fish fry this afternoon.\" I worked to sound enthusiastic. \"He did?\" Charlie's eyes lit up. \"That's my favorite.\" Charlie cleaned up while I got dinner ready. It didn't take long till we were sitting at the table, eating in silence. Charlie was enjoying his food. I was wondering desperately how to fulfill my assignment, struggling to think of a way to broach the subject. \"What did you do with yourself today?\" he asked, snapping me out of my reverie. \"Well, this afternoon I just hung out around the house\u2026\" Only the very recent part of this afternoon, actually. I tried to keep my voice upbeat, but my stomach was hollow. \"And this morning I was over at the Cullens'.\" Charlie dropped his fork. \"Dr. Cullen's place?\" he asked in astonishment. I pretended not to notice his reaction. \"Yeah.\" \"What were you doing there?\" He hadn't picked his fork back up. \"Well, I sort of have a date with Edward Cullen tonight, and he wanted to introduce me to his parents\u2026 Dad?\" It appeared that Charlie was having an aneurysm. \"Dad, are you all right?\" \"You are going out with Edward Cullen?\" he thundered. Uh-oh. \"I thought you liked the Cullens.\" \"He's too old for you,\" he ranted. \"We're both juniors,\" I corrected, though he was more right than he dreamed. \"Wait\u2026\" He paused. \"Which one is Edwin?\" \"Edward is the youngest, the one with the reddish brown hair.\" The beautiful one, the godlike one\u2026 \"Oh, well, that's\" \u2014 he struggled \u2014 \"better, I guess. I don't like the look of that big one. I'm sure he's a nice boy and all, but he looks too\u2026 mature for you. Is this Edwin your boyfriend?\" \"It's Edward, Dad.\" \"Is he?\" \"Sort of, I guess.\" \"You said last night that you weren't interested in any of the boys in town.\" But he picked up his fork again, so I could see the worst was over. \"Well, Edward doesn't live in town, Dad.\" He gave me a disparaging look as he chewed. \"And, anyways,\" I continued, \"it's kind of at an early stage, you know.\u00a0 Don't embarrass me with all the boyfriend talk, okay?\" \"When is he coming over?\" \"He'll be here in a few minutes.\" \"Where is he taking you?\" I groaned loudly. \"I hope you're getting the Spanish Inquisition out of your system now. We're going to play baseball with his family.\" His face puckered, and then he finally chuckled. \"You're playing baseball?\" \"Well, I'll probably watch most of the time.\" \"You must really like this guy,\" he observed suspiciously. I sighed and rolled my eyes for his benefit. I heard the roar of an engine pull up in front of the house. I jumped up and started cleaning my dishes. \"Leave the dishes, I can do them tonight. You baby me too much.\" The doorbell rang, and Charlie stalked off to answer it. I was half a step behind him. I hadn't realized how hard it was pouring outside. Edward stood in the halo of the porch light, looking like a male model in an advertisement for raincoats. \"Come on in, Edward.\" I breathed a sigh of relief when Charlie got his name right. \"Thanks, Chief Swan,\" Edward said in a respectful voice. \"Go ahead and call me Charlie. Here, I'll take your jacket.\" \"Thanks, sir.\" \"Have a seat there, Edward.\" I grimaced. Edward sat down fluidly in the only chair, forcing me to sit next to Chief Swan on the sofa. I quickly shot him a dirty look. He winked behind Charlie's back. \"So I hear you're getting my girl to watch baseball.\" Only in Washington would the fact that it was raining buckets have no bearing at all on the playing of outdoor sports. \"Yes, sir, that's the plan.\" He didn't look surprised that I'd told my father the truth. He might have been listening, though. \"Well, more power to you, I guess.\" Charlie laughed, and Edward joined in. \"Okay.\" I stood up. \"Enough humor at my expense. Let's go.\" I walked back to the hall and pulled on my jacket. They followed. \"Not too late, Bell.\" \"Don't worry, Charlie, I'll have her home early,\" Edward promised. \"You take care of my girl, all right?\" I groaned, but they ignored me. \"She'll be safe with me, I promise, sir.\" Charlie couldn't doubt Edward's sincerity, it rang in every word. I stalked out. They both laughed, and Edward followed me. I stopped dead on the porch. There, behind my truck, was a monster Jeep. Its tires were higher than my waist. There were metal guards over the headlights and tail-lights, and four large spotlights attached to the crash bar. The hardtop was shiny red. Charlie let out a low whistle. \"Wear your seat belts,\" he choked out. Edward followed me around to my side and opened the door. I gauged the distance to the seat and prepared to jump for it. He sighed, and then lifted me in with one hand. I hoped Charlie didn't notice. As he went around to the driver's side, at a normal, human pace, I tried to put on my seat belt. But there were too many buckles. \"What's all this?\" I asked when he opened the door. \"It's an off-roading harness.\" \"Uh-oh.\" I tried to find the right places for all the buckles to fit, but it wasn't going too quickly. He sighed again and reached over to help me. I was glad that the rain was too heavy to see Charlie clearly on the porch. That meant he couldn't see how Edward's hands lingered at my neck, brushed along my collarbones. I gave up trying to help him and focused on not hyperventilating. Edward turned the key and the engine roared to life. We pulled away from the house. \"This is a\u2026 um\u2026 big Jeep you have.\" \"It's Emmett's. I didn't think you'd want to run the whole way.\" \"Where do you keep this thing?\" \"We remodeled one of the outbuildings into a garage.\" \"Aren't you going to put on your seat belt?\" He threw me a disbelieving look. Then something sunk in. \"Run the whole way? As in, we're still going to run part of the way?\" My voice edged up a few octaves. He grinned tightly. \"You're not going to run.\" \"I'm going to be sick.\" \"Keep your eyes closed, you'll be fine.\" I bit my lip, fighting the panic. He leaned over to kiss the top of my head, and then groaned. I looked at him, puzzled. \"You smell so good in the rain,\" he explained. \"In a good way, or in a bad way?\" I asked cautiously. He sighed. \"Both, always both.\" I don't know how he found his way in the gloom and downpour, but he somehow found a side road that was less of a road and more of a mountain path. For a long while conversation was impossible, because I was bouncing up and down on the seat like a jackhammer. He seemed to enjoy the ride, though, smiling hugely the whole way. And then we came to the end of the road; the trees formed green walls on three sides of the Jeep. The rain was a mere drizzle, slowing every second, the sky brighter through the clouds. \"Sorry, Bella, we have to go on foot from here.\" \"You know what? I'll just wait here.\" \"What happened to all your courage? You were extraordinary this morning.\" \"I haven't forgotten the last time yet.\" Could it have been only yesterday? He was around to my side of the car in a blur. He started unbuckling me. \"I'll get those, you go on ahead,\" I protested. \"Hmmm\u2026\" he mused as he quickly finished. \"It seems I'm going to have to tamper with your memory.\" Before I could react, he pulled me from the Jeep and set my feet on the ground. It was barely misting now; Alice was going to be right. \"Tamper with my memory?\" I asked nervously. \"Something like that.\" He was watching me intently, carefully, but there was humor deep in his eyes. He placed his hands against the Jeep on either side of my head and leaned forward, forcing me to press back against the door. He leaned in even closer, his face inches from mine. I had no room to escape. \"Now,\" he breathed, and just his smell disturbed my thought processes, \"what exactly are you worrying about?\" \"Well, um, hitting a tree \u2014\" I gulped \"\u2014 and dying. And then getting sick.\" He fought back a smile. Then he bent his head down and touched his cold lips softly to the hollow at the base of my throat. \"Are you still worried now?\" he murmured against my skin. \"Yes.\" I struggled to concentrate. \"About hitting trees and getting sick.\" His nose drew a line up the skin of my throat to the point of my chin. His cold breath tickled my skin. \"And now?\" His lips whispered against my jaw. \"Trees,\" I gasped. \"Motion sickness.\" He lifted his face to kiss my eyelids. \"Bella, you don't really think I would hit a tree, do you?\" \"No, but I might.\" There was no confidence in my voice. He smelled an easy victory. He kissed slowly down my cheek, stopping just at the corner of my mouth. \"Would I let a tree hurt you?\" His lips barely brushed against my trembling lower lip. \"No,\" I breathed. I knew there was a second part to my brilliant defense, but I couldn't quite call it back. \"You see,\" he said, his lips moving against mine. \"There's nothing to be afraid of, is there?\" \"No,\" I sighed, giving up. Then he took my face in his hands almost roughly, and kissed me in earnest, his unyielding lips moving against mine. There really was no excuse for my behavior. Obviously I knew better by now. And yet I couldn't seem to stop from reacting exactly as I had the first time. Instead of keeping safely motionless, my arms reached up to twine tightly around his neck, and I was suddenly welded to his stone figure. I sighed, and my lips parted. He staggered back, breaking my grip effortlessly. \"Damn it, Bella!\" he broke off, gasping. \"You'll be the death of me, I swear you will.\" I leaned over, bracing my hands against my knees for support. \"You're indestructible,\" I mumbled, trying to catch my breath. \"I might have believed that before I met you. Now let's get out of here before I do something really stupid,\" he growled. He threw me across his back as he had before, and I could see the extra effort it took for him to be as gentle as he was. I locked my legs around his waist and secured my arms in a choke hold around his neck. \"Don't forget to close your eyes,\" he warned severely. I quickly tucked my face into his shoulder blade, under my own arm, and squeezed my eyes shut. And I could hardly tell we were moving. I could feel him gliding along beneath me, but he could have been strolling down the sidewalk, the movement was so smooth. I was tempted to peek, just to see if he was really flying through the forest like before, but I resisted. It wasn't worth that awful dizziness. I contented myself with listening to his breath come and go evenly. I wasn't quite sure we had stopped until he reached back and touched my hair. \"It's over, Bella.\" I dared to open my eyes, and, sure enough, we were at a standstill. I stiffly unlocked my stranglehold on his body and slipped to the ground, landing on my backside. \"Oh!\" I huffed as I hit the wet ground. He stared at me incredulously, evidently not sure whether he was still too mad to find me funny. But my bewildered expression pushed him over the edge, and he broke into a roar of laughter. I picked myself up, ignoring him as I brushed the mud and bracken off the back of my jacket. That only made him laugh harder. Annoyed, I began to stride off into the forest. I felt his arm around my waist. \"Where are you going, Bella?\" \"To watch a baseball game. You don't seem to be interested in playing anymore, but I'm sure the others will have fun without you.\" \"You're going the wrong way.\" I turned around without looking at him, and stalked off in the opposite direction. He caught me again. \"Don't be mad, I couldn't help myself. You should have seen your face.\" He chuckled before he could stop himself. \"Oh, you're the only one who's allowed to get mad?\" I asked, raising my eyebrows. \"I wasn't mad at you.\" \"'Bella, you'll be the death of me'?\" I quoted sourly. \"That was simply a statement of fact.\" I tried to turn away from him again, but he held me fast. \"You were mad,\" I insisted. \"Yes.\" \"But you just said \u2014\" \"That I wasn't mad at you. Can't you see that, Bella?\" He was suddenly intense, all trace of teasing gone. \"Don't you understand?\" \"See what?\" I demanded, confused by his sudden mood swing as much as his words. \"I'm never angry with you \u2014 how could I be? Brave, trusting\u2026 warm as you are.\" \"Then why?\" I whispered, remembering the black moods that pulled him away from me, that I'd always interpreted as well-justified frustration \u2014 frustration at my weakness, my slowness, my unruly human reactions\u2026 He put his hands carefully on both sides of my face. \"I infuriate myself,\" he said gently. \"The way I can't seem to keep from putting you in danger. My very existence puts you at risk. Sometimes I truly hate myself. I should be stronger, I should be able to \u2014\"  I placed my hand over his mouth. \"Don't.\" He took my hand, moving it from his lips, but holding it to his face. \"I love you,\" he said. \"It's a poor excuse for what I'm doing, but it's still true.\" It was the first time he'd said he loved me \u2014 in so many words. He might not realize it, but I certainly did. \"Now, please try to behave yourself,\" he continued, and he bent to softly brush his lips against mine. I held properly still. Then I sighed. \"You promised Chief Swan that you would have me home early, remember? We'd better get going.\" \"Yes, ma'am.\" He smiled wistfully and released all of me but one hand. He led me a few feet through the tall, wet ferns and draping moss, around a massive hemlock tree, and we were there, on the edge of an enormous open field in the lap of the Olympic peaks. It was twice the size of any baseball stadium. I could see the others all there; Esme, Emmett, and Rosalie, sitting on a bare outcropping of rock, were the closest to us, maybe a hundred yards away. Much farther out I could see Jasper and Alice, at least a quarter of a mile apart, appearing to throw something back and forth, but I never saw any ball. It looked like Carlisle was marking bases, but could they really be that far apart? When we came into view, the three on the rocks rose. Esme started toward us. Emmett followed after a long look at Rosalie's back; Rosalie had risen gracefully and strode off toward the field without a glance in our direction. My stomach quivered uneasily in response. \"Was that you we heard, Edward?\" Esme asked as she approached. \"It sounded like a bear choking,\" Emmett clarified. I smiled hesitantly at Esme. \"That was him.\" \"Bella was being unintentionally funny,\" Edward explained, quickly settling the score. Alice had left her position and was running, or dancing, toward us. She hurtled to a fluid stop at our feet. \"It's time,\" she announced. As soon as she spoke, a deep rumble of thunder shook the forest beyond us, and then crashed westward toward town. \"Eerie, isn't it?\" Emmett said with easy familiarity, winking at me. \"Let's go.\" Alice reached for Emmett's hand and they darted toward the oversized field; she ran like a gazelle. He was nearly as graceful and just as fast \u2014 yet Emmett could never be compared to a gazelle. \"Are you ready for some ball?\" Edward asked, his eyes eager, bright. I tried to sound appropriately enthusiastic. \"Go team!\" He snickered and, after mussing my hair, bounded off after the other two. His run was more aggressive, a cheetah rather than a gazelle, and he quickly overtook them. The grace and power took my breath away. \"Shall we go down?\" Esme asked in her soft, melodic voice, and I realized I was staring openmouthed after him. I quickly reassembled my expression and nodded. Esme kept a few feet between us, and I wondered if she was still being careful not to frighten me. She matched her stride to mine without seeming impatient at the pace.  \"You don't play with them?\" I asked shyly. \"No, I prefer to referee \u2014 I like keeping them honest,\" she explained. \"Do they like to cheat, then?\" \"Oh yes \u2014 you should hear the arguments they get into! Actually, I hope you don't, you would think they were raised by a pack of wolves.\" \"You sound like my mom,\" I laughed, surprised. She laughed, too. \"Well, I do think of them as my children in most ways. I never could get over my mothering instincts \u2014 did Edward tell you I had lost a child?\" \"No,\" I murmured, stunned, scrambling to understand what lifetime she was remembering. \"Yes, my first and only baby. He died just a few days after he was born, the poor tiny thing,\" she sighed. \"It broke my heart \u2014 that's why I jumped off the cliff, you know,\" she added matter-of-factly. \"Edward just said you f-fell,\" I stammered. \"Always the gentleman.\" She smiled. \"Edward was the first of my new sons. I've always thought of him that way, even though he's older than I, in one way at least.\" She smiled at me warmly. \"That's why I'm so happy that he's found you, dear.\" The endearment sounded very natural on her lips. \"He's been the odd man out for far too long; it's hurt me to see him alone.\" \"You don't mind, then?\" I asked, hesitant again. \"That I'm\u2026 all wrong for him?\" \"No.\" She was thoughtful. \"You're what he wants. It will work out, somehow,\" she said, though her forehead creased with worry. Another peal of thunder began. Esme stopped then; apparently, we'd reached the edge of the field. It looked as if they had formed teams. Edward was far out in left field, Carlisle stood between the first and second bases, and Alice held the ball, positioned on the spot that must be the pitcher's mound. Emmett was swinging an aluminum bat; it whistled almost untraceably through the air. I waited for him to approach home plate, but then I realized, as he took his stance, that he was already there \u2014 farther from the pitcher's mound than I would have thought possible. Jasper stood several feet behind him, catching for the other team. Of course, none of them had gloves. \"All right,\" Esme called in a clear voice, which I knew even Edward would hear, as far out as he was. \"Batter up.\" Alice stood straight, deceptively motionless. Her style seemed to be stealth rather than an intimidating windup. She held the ball in both hands at her waist, and then, like the strike of a cobra, her right hand flicked out and the ball smacked into Jasper's hand. \"Was that a strike?\" I whispered to Esme. \"If they don't hit it, it's a strike,\" she told me. Jasper hurled the ball back to Alice's waiting hand. She permitted herself a brief grin. And then her hand spun out again. This time the bat somehow made it around in time to smash into the invisible ball. The crack of impact was shattering, thunderous; it echoed off the mountains \u2014 I immediately understood the necessity of the thunderstorm. The ball shot like a meteor above the field, flying deep into the surrounding forest. \"Home run,\" I murmured. \"Wait,\" Esme cautioned, listening intently, one hand raised. Emmett was a blur around the bases, Carlisle shadowing him. I realized Edward was missing. \"Out!\" Esme cried in a clear voice. I stared in disbelief as Edward sprang from the fringe of the trees, ball in his upraised hand, his wide grin visible even to me. \"Emmett hits the hardest,\" Esme explained, \"but Edward runs the fastest.\" The inning continued before my incredulous eyes. It was impossible to keep up with the speed at which the ball flew, the rate at which their bodies raced around the field. I learned the other reason they waited for a thunderstorm to play when Jasper, trying to avoid Edward's infallible fielding, hit a ground ball toward Carlisle. Carlisle ran into the ball, and then raced Jasper to first base. When they collided, the sound was like the crash of two massive falling boulders. I jumped up in concern, but they were somehow unscathed. \"Safe,\" Esme called in a calm voice. Emmett's team was up by one \u2014 Rosalie managed to flit around the bases after tagging up on one of Emmett's long flies \u2014 when Edward caught the third out. He sprinted to my side, sparkling with excitement. \"What do you think?\" he asked. \"One thing's for sure, I'll never be able to sit through dull old Major League Baseball again.\" \"And it sounds like you did so much of that before,\" he laughed. \"I am a little disappointed,\" I teased. \"Why?\" he asked, puzzled. \"Well, it would be nice if I could find just one thing you didn't do better than everyone else on the planet.\" He flashed his special crooked smile, leaving me breathless. \"I'm up,\" he said, heading for the plate. He played intelligently, keeping the ball low, out of the reach of Rosalie's always-ready hand in the outfield, gaining two bases like lightning before Emmett could get the ball back in play. Carlisle knocked one so far out of the field \u2014 with a boom that hurt my ears \u2014 that he and Edward both made it in. Alice slapped them dainty high fives. The score constantly changed as the game continued, and they razzed each other like any street ballplayers as they took turns with the lead. Occasionally Esme would call them to order. The thunder rumbled on, but we stayed dry, as Alice had predicted. Carlisle was up to bat, Edward catching, when Alice suddenly gasped. My eyes were on Edward, as usual, and I saw his head snap up to look at her. Their eyes met and something flowed between them in an instant. He was at my side before the others could ask Alice what was wrong. \"Alice?\" Esme's voice was tense. \"I didn't see \u2014 I couldn't tell,\" she whispered. All the others were gathered by this time. \"What is it, Alice?\" Carlisle asked with the calm voice of authority. \"They were traveling much quicker than I thought. I can see I had the perspective wrong before,\" she murmured. Jasper leaned over her, his posture protective. \"What changed?\" he asked. \"They heard us playing, and it changed their path,\" she said, contrite, as if she felt responsible for whatever had frightened her. Seven pairs of quick eyes flashed to my face and away. \"How soon?\" Carlisle said, turning toward Edward. A look of intense concentration crossed his face. \"Less than five minutes. They're running \u2014 they want to play.\" He scowled. \"Can you make it?\" Carlisle asked him, his eyes flicking toward me again. \"No, not carrying \u2014\" He cut short. \"Besides, the last thing we need is for them to catch the scent and start hunting.\" \"How many?\" Emmett asked Alice. \"Three,\" she answered tersely. \"Three!\" he scoffed. \"Let them come.\" The steel bands of muscle flexed along his massive arms. For a split second that seemed much longer than it really was, Carlisle deliberated. Only Emmett seemed unperturbed; the rest stared at Carlisle's face with anxious eyes. \"Let's just continue the game,\" Carlisle finally decided. His voice was cool and level. \"Alice said they were simply curious.\" All this was said in a flurry of words that lasted only a few seconds. I had listened carefully and caught most of it, though I couldn't hear what Esme now asked Edward with a silent vibration of her lips. I only saw the slight shake of his head and the look of relief on her face. \"You catch, Esme,\" he said. \"I'll call it now.\" And he planted himself in front of me. The others returned to the field, warily sweeping the dark forest with their sharp eyes. Alice and Esme seemed to orient themselves around where I stood. \"Take your hair down,\" Edward said in a low, even voice. I obediently slid the rubber band out of my hair and shook it out around me. I stated the obvious. \"The others are coming now.\" \"Yes, stay very still, keep quiet, and don't move from my side, please.\" He hid the stress in his voice well, but I could hear it. He pulled my long hair forward, around my face. \"That won't help,\" Alice said softly. \"I could smell her across the field.\" \"I know.\" A hint of frustration colored his tone. Carlisle stood at the plate, and the others joined the game halfheartedly. \"What did Esme ask you?\" I whispered. He hesitated for a second before he answered. \"Whether they were thirsty,\" he muttered unwillingly. The seconds ticked by; the game progressed with apathy now. No one dared to hit harder than a bunt, and Emmett, Rosalie, and Jasper hovered in the infield.  Now and again, despite the fear that numbed my brain, I was aware of Rosalie's eyes on me. They were expressionless, but something about the way she held her mouth made me think she was angry. Edward paid no attention to the game at all, eyes and mind ranging the forest. \"I'm sorry, Bella,\" he muttered fiercely. \"It was stupid, irresponsible, to expose you like this. I'm so sorry.\" I heard his breath stop, and his eyes zeroed in on right field. He took a half step, angling himself between me and what was coming. Carlisle, Emmett, and the others turned in the same direction, hearing sounds of passage much too faint for my ears.",

            "en": "Ch\u1ea1ng V\u1ea1ng - Twilight            2. OPEN BOOK The next day was better\u2026 and worse. It was better because it wasn't raining yet, though the clouds were dense and opaque. It was easier because I knew what to expect of my day. Mike came to sit by me in English, and walked me to my next class, with Chess Club Eric glaring at him all the while; that was nattering. People didn't look at me quite as much as they had yesterday. I sat with a big group at lunch that included Mike, Eric, Jessica, and several other people whose names and faces I now remembered. I began to feel like I was treading water, instead of drowning in it.  It was worse because I was tired; I still couldn't sleep with the wind echoing around the\u00a0 house. It was worse because Mr. Varner called on me in Trig when my hand wasn't raised and I had the wrong answer. It was miserable because I had to play volleyball, and the one time I didn't cringe out of the way of the ball, I hit my teammate in the head with it. And it was worse because Edward Cullen wasn't in school at all. \u00a0All morning I was dreading lunch, fearing his bizarre glares. Part of me wanted to confront him and demand to know what his problem was. While I was lying sleepless in my bed, I even imagined what I would say. But I knew myself too well to think I would really have the guts to do it. I made the Cowardly Lion look like the terminator. But when I walked into the cafeteria with Jessica \u2014 trying to keep my eyes from sweeping the place for him, and failing entirely \u2014 I saw that his four siblings of sorts were sitting together at the same table, and he was not with them. Mike intercepted us and steered us to his table. Jessica seemed elated by the attention, and her friends quickly joined us. But as I tried to listen to their easy chatter, I was terribly uncomfortable, waiting nervously for the moment he would arrive. I hoped that he would simply ignore me when he came, and prove my suspicions false. He didn't come, and as time passed I grew more and more tense. I walked to Biology with more confidence when, by the end of lunch, he still hadn't showed. Mike, who was taking on the qualities of a golden retriever, walked faithfully by my side to class. I held my breath at the door, but Edward Cullen wasn't there, either. I exhaled and went to my seat. Mike followed, talking about an upcoming trip to the beach. He lingered by my desk till the bell rang. Then he smiled at me wistfully and went to sit by a girl with braces and a bad perm. It looked like I was going to have to do something about Mike, and it wouldn't be easy. In a town like this, where everyone lived on top of everyone else, diplomacy was essential. I had never been enormously tactful; I had no practice dealing with overly friendly boys. I was relieved that I had the desk to myself, that Edward was absent. I told myself that repeatedly. But I couldn't get rid of the nagging suspicion that I was the reason he wasn't there. It was ridiculous, and egotistical, to think that I could affect anyone that strongly. It was impossible. And yet I couldn't stop worrying that it was true. When the school day was finally done, and the blush was fading out of my cheeks from the volleyball incident, I changed quickly back into my jeans and navy blue sweater. I hurried from the girls' locker room, pleased to find that I had successfully evaded my retriever friend for the moment. I walked swiftly out to the parking lot. It was crowded now with fleeing students. I got in my truck and dug through my bag to make sure I had what I needed. Last night I'd discovered that Charlie couldn't cook much besides fried eggs and bacon. So I requested that I be assigned kitchen detail for the duration of my stay. He was willing enough to hand over the keys to the banquet hall. I also found out that he had no food in the house. So I had my shopping list and the cash from the jar in the cupboard labeled FOOD MONEY, and I was on my way to the Thriftway. I gunned my deafening engine to life, ignoring the heads that turned in my direction, and backed carefully into a place in the line of cars that were waiting to exit the parking lot. As I waited, trying to pretend that the earsplitting rumble was coming from someone else's car, I saw the two Cullens and the Hale twins getting into their car. It was the shiny new Volvo. Of course. I hadn't noticed their clothes before \u2014 I'd been too mesmerized by their faces. Now that I looked, it was obvious that they were all dressed exceptionally well; simply, but in clothes that subtly hinted at designer origins. With their remarkable good looks, the style with which they carried themselves, they could have worn dishrags and pulled it off. It seemed excessive for them to have both looks and money.  But as far as I could tell, life worked that way most of the time. It didn't look as if it bought them any acceptance here.  No, I didn't fully believe that. The isolation must be their desire; I couldn't imagine any door that wouldn't be opened by that degree of beauty. They looked at my noisy truck as I passed them, just like everyone else.  I kept my eyes straight forward and was relieved when I finally was free of the school grounds.  The Thriftway was not far from the school, just a few streets south, off the highway. It was nice to be inside the supermarket; it felt normal. I did the shopping at home, and I fell into the pattern of the familiar task gladly. The store was big enough inside that I couldn't hear the tapping of the rain on the roof to remind me where I was. When I got home, I unloaded all the groceries, stuffing them in wherever I could find an open space. I hoped Charlie wouldn't mind. I wrapped potatoes in foil and stuck them in the oven to bake, covered a steak in marinade and balanced it on top of a carton of eggs in the fridge.  When I was finished with that, I took my book bag upstairs. Before starting my homework, I changed into a pair of dry sweats, pulled my damp hair up into a pony-tail, and checked my e-mail for the first time. I had three messages. \"Bella,\" my mom wrote\u2026  Write me as soon as you get in. Tell me how your flight was. Is it raining? I miss you\u00a0 already. I'm almost finished packing for Florida, but I can't find my pink blouse. Do you know where I put it? Phil says hi.  Mom. I sighed and went to the next. It was sent eight hours after the first. \"Bella,\" she wrote\u2026 Why haven't you e-mailed me yet? What are you waiting for? Mom. The last was from this morning. Isabella, If I haven't heard from you by 5:30 p.m. today I'm calling Charlie. I checked the clock. I still had an hour, but my mom was well known for jumping the gun. Mom, Calm down. I'm writing right now. Don't do anything rash. Bella. I sent that, and began again. Mom, Everything is great. Of course it's raining. I was waiting for something to write about. School isn't bad, just a little repetitive. I met some nice kids who sit by me at lunch. Your blouse is at the dry cleaners - you were supposed to pick it up Friday. Charlie bought me a truck, can you believe it? I love it. It's old, but really sturdy, which is good, you know, for me. I miss you, too. I'll write again soon, but I'm not going to check my e-mail every five minutes. Relax, breathe. I love you. Bella. I had decided to read Wuthering Heights \u2014 the novel we were currently studying in English \u2014 yet again for the fun of it, and that's what I was doing when Charlie came home. I'd lost track of the time, and I hurried downstairs to take the potatoes out and put the steak in to broil. \"Bella?\" my father called out when he heard me on the stairs. Who else? I thought to myself. \"Hey, Dad, welcome home.\" \"Thanks.\" He hung up his gun belt and stepped out of his boots as I bustled about the kitchen. As far as I was aware, he'd never shot the gun on the job. But he kept it ready. When I came here as a child, he would always remove the bullets as soon as he walked in the door. I guess he considered me old enough now not to shoot myself by accident, and not depressed enough to shoot myself on purpose.  \"What's for dinner?\" he asked warily. My mother was an imaginative cook, and her experiments weren't always edible. I was surprised, and sad, that he seemed to remember that far back. \"Steak and potatoes,\" I answered, and he looked relieved. He seemed to feel awkward standing in the kitchen doing nothing; he lumbered into the living room to watch TV while I worked. We were both more comfortable that way. I made a salad while the steaks cooked, and set the table. I called him in when dinner was ready, and he sniffed appreciatively as he walked into the room. \"Smells good, Bell.\" \"Thanks.\" We ate in silence for a few minutes. It wasn't uncomfortable. Neither of us was bothered by the quiet. In some ways, we were well suited for living together. \"So, how did you like school? Have you made any friends?\" he asked as he was taking seconds. \"Well, I have a few classes with a girl named Jessica. I sit with her friends at lunch. And there's this boy, Mike, who's very friendly. Everybody seems pretty nice.\" With one outstanding exception. \"That must be Mike Newton. Nice kid \u2014 nice family. His dad owns the sporting goods store just outside of town. He makes a good living off all the backpackers who come through here.\" \" Do you know the Cullen family?\" I asked hesitantly.  \"Dr. Cullen's family? Sure. Dr. Cullen's a great man.\" \"They\u2026 the kids\u2026 are a little different. They don't seem to fit in very well at school.\" Charlie surprised me by looking angry. \"People in this town,\" he muttered.\u201dDr. Cullen is a brilliant surgeon who could probably work in any hospital in the world, make ten times the salary he gets here,\" he continued, getting louder.\u201dWe're lucky to have him \u2014 lucky that his wife wanted to live in a small town. He's an asset to the community, and all of those kids are well behaved and polite. I had my doubts, when they first moved in, with all those adopted teenagers. I thought we might have some problems with them. But they're all very mature \u2014 I haven't had one speck of trouble from any of them. That's more than I can say for the children of some folks who have lived in this town for generations. And they stick together the way a family should \u2014 camping trips every other weekend\u2026  Just because they're newcomers, people have to talk.\" It was the longest speech I'd ever heard Charlie make. He must feel strongly about whatever people were saying. I backpedaled.\u201dThey seemed nice enough to me. I just noticed they kept to themselves. They're all very attractive,\" I added, trying to be more complimentary. \"You should see the doctor,\" Charlie said, laughing.\u201dIt's a good thing he's happily married. A lot of the nurses at the hospital have a hard time concentrating on their work with him around.\" We lapsed back into silence as we finished eating. He cleared the table while I started on the dishes. He went back to the TV, and after I finished washing the dishes by hand \u2014 no\u00a0 dishwasher \u2014 I went upstairs unwillingly to work on my math homework. I could feel a tradition in the making. That night it was finally quiet. I fell asleep quickly, exhausted. The rest of the week was uneventful. I got used to the routine of my classes. By Friday I was able to recognize, if not name, almost all the students at school. In Gym, the kids on my team learned not to pass me the ball and to step quickly in front of me if the other team tried to take advantage of my weakness. I happily stayed out of their way. Edward Cullen didn't come back to school. Every day, I watched anxiously until the rest of the Cullens entered the cafeteria without him. Then I could relax and join in the lunchtime conversation. Mostly it centered around a trip to the La Push Ocean Park in two weeks that Mike was putting together. I was invited, and I had agreed to go, more out of politeness than desire. Beaches should be hot and dry. By Friday I was perfectly comfortable entering my Biology class, no longer worried that Edward would be there. For all I knew, he had dropped out of school. I tried not to think about him, but I couldn't totally suppress the worry that I was responsible for his continued absence, ridiculous as it seemed. My first weekend in Forks passed without incident. Charlie, unused to spending time in the usually empty house, worked most of the weekend. I cleaned the house, got ahead on my homework, and wrote my mom more bogusly cheerful e-mail. I did drive to the library Saturday, but it was so poorly stocked that I didn't bother to get a card; I would have to make a date to visit Olympia or Seattle soon and find a good bookstore. I wondered idly what kind of gas mileage the truck got\u2026 and shuddered at the thought. The rain stayed soft over the weekend, quiet, so I was able to sleep well. People greeted me in the parking lot Monday morning. I didn't know all their names, but I waved back and smiled at everyone. It was colder this morning, but happily not raining. In English, Mike took his accustomed seat by my side. We had a pop quiz on Wuthering Heights. It was straightforward, very easy. All in all, I was feeling a lot more comfortable than I had thought I would feel by this point. More comfortable than I had ever expected to feel here. When we walked out of class, the air was full of swirling bits of white. I could hear people shouting excitedly to each other. The wind bit at my cheeks, my nose. \"Wow,\" Mike said.\u201dIt's snowing.\" I looked at the little cotton fluffs that were building up along the sidewalk and swirling erratically past my face.  \"Ew.\" Snow. There went my good day. He looked surprised.\u201dDon't you like snow?\" \"No. That means it's too cold for rain.\" Obviously.\u201dBesides, I thought it was supposed to come down in flakes \u2014 you know, each one unique and all that. These just look like the ends of Q-tips.\" \"Haven't you ever seen snow fall before?\" he asked incredulously. \"Sure I have.\" I paused.\u201dOn TV.\" Mike laughed. And then a big, squishy ball of dripping snow smacked into the back of his head. We both turned to see where it came from. I had my suspicions about Eric, who was walking away, his back toward us \u2014 in the wrong direction for his next class. Mike appatently had the same notion.  He bent over and began scraping together a pile of the white mush. \"I'll see you at lunch, okay?\" I kept walking as I spoke.\u201dOnce people start throwing wet stuff, I go inside.\" He just nodded, his eyes on Eric's retreating figure. Throughout the morning, everyone chattered excitedly about the snow; apparently it was the first snowfall of the new year. I kept my mouth shut. Sure, it was drier than rain \u2014 until it melted in your socks. I walked alertly to the cafeteria with Jessica after Spanish. Mush balls were flying everywhere. I kept a binder in my hands, ready to use it as a shield if necessary. Jessica thought I was hilarious, but something in my expression kept her from lobbing a snowball at me herself. Mike caught up to us as we walked in the doors, laughing, with ice melting the spikes in his hair. He and Jessica were talking animatedly about the snow fight as we got in line to buy food. I glanced toward that table in the corner out of habit. And then I froze where I stood. There were five people at the table. Jessica pulled on my arm. \"Hello? Bella? What do you want?\" I looked down; my ears were hot. I had no reason to feel self-conscious, I reminded myself. I hadn't done anything wrong. \"What's with Bella?\" Mike asked Jessica. \"Nothing,\" I answered.\u201dI'll just get a soda today.\" I caught up to the end of the line. \"Aren't you hungry?\" Jessica asked. \"Actually, I feel a little sick,\" I said, my eyes still on the floor. I waited for them to get their food, and then followed them to a table, my eyes on my feet. I sipped my soda slowly, my stomach churning. Twice Mike asked, with unnecessary concern, how I was feeling. I told him it was nothing, but I was wondering if I should play it up and escape to the nurse's office for the next hour. Ridiculous. I shouldn't have to run away.  I decided to permit myself one glance at the Cullen family's table. If he was glaring at me, I would skip Biology, like the coward I was. I kept my head down and glanced up under my lashes. None of them were looking this way. I lifted my head a little. They were laughing. Edward, Jasper, and Emmett all had their hair entirely saturated with melting snow. Alice and Rosalie were leaning away as Emmett shook his dripping hair toward them. They were enjoying the snowy day, just like everyone else \u2014 only they looked more like a scene from a movie than the rest of us. But, aside from the laughter and playfulness, there was something different, and I couldn't quite pinpoint what that difference was. I examined Edward the most carefully. His skin was less pale, I decided \u2014 flushed from the snow fight maybe \u2014 the circles under his eyes much less noticeable. But there was something more. I pondered, staring, trying to isolate the change. \"Bella, what are you staring at?\" Jessica intruded, her eyes following my stare. At that precise moment, his eyes flashed over to meet mine. I dropped my head, letting my hair fall to conceal my face. I was sure, though, in the instant our eyes met, that he didn't look harsh or unfriendly as he had the last time I'd seen him. He looked merely curious again, unsatisfied in some way. \"Edward Cullen is staring at you,\" Jessica giggled in my ear. \"He doesn't look angry, does he?\" I couldn't help asking. \"No,\" she said, sounding confused by my question.\u201dShould he be?\" \"I don't think he likes me,\" I confided. I still felt queasy. I put my head down on my arm. \"The Cullens don't like anybody\u2026 well, they don't notice anybody enough to like them. But he's still staring at you.\" \"Stop looking at him,\" I hissed. She snickered, but she looked away. I raised my head enough to make sure that she did, contemplating violence if she resisted. Mike interrupted us then \u2014 he was planning an epic battle of the blizzard in the parking lot after school and wanted us to join. Jessica agreed enthusiastically. The way she looked at Mike left little doubt that she would be up for anything he suggested. I kept silent. I would have to hide in the gym until the parking lot cleared. For the rest of the lunch hour I very carefully kept my eyes at my own table. I decided to honor the bargain I'd made with myself. Since he didn't look angry, I would go to Biology. My stomach did frightened little flips at the thought of sitting next to him again. I didn't really want to walk to class with Mike as usual \u2014 he seemed to be a popular target for the snowball snipers \u2014 but when we went to the door, everyone besides me groaned in unison. It was raining, washing all traces of the snow away in clear, icy ribbons down the side of the walkway. I pulled my hood up, secretly pleased. I would be free to go straight home after Gym. Mike kept up a string of complaints on the way to building four. Once inside the classroom, I saw with relief that my table was still empty. Mr. Banner was walking around the room, distributing one microscope and box of slides to each table. Class didn't start for a few minutes, and the room buzzed with conversation. I kept my eyes away from the door, doodling idly on the cover of my notebook. I heard very clearly when the chair next to me moved, but my eyes stayed carefully focused on the pattern I was drawing. \"Hello,\" said a quiet, musical voice. I looked up, stunned that he was speaking to me. He was sitting as far away from me as the desk allowed, but his chair was angled toward me. His hair was dripping wet, disheveled \u2014 even so, he looked like he'd just finished shooting a commercial for hair gel. His dazzling face was friendly, open, a slight smile on his flawless lips. But his eyes were careful. \"My name is Edward Cullen,\" he continued.\u201dI didn't have a chance to introduce myself last week. You must be Bella Swan.\" My mind was spinning with confusion. Had I made up the whole thing? He was perfectly polite now. I had to speak; he was waiting. But I couldn't think of anything conventional to say. \"H-how do you know my name?\" I stammered.  He laughed a soft, enchanting laugh. \"Oh, I think everyone knows your name. The whole town's been waiting for you to arrive.\" I grimaced. I knew it was something like that. \"No,\" I persisted stupidly.\u201dI meant, why did you call me Bella?\" He seemed confused.\u201dDo you prefer Isabella?\" \"No, I like Bella,\" I said.\u201dBut I think Charlie \u2014 I mean my dad \u2014 must call me Isabella behind my back \u2014 that's what everyone here seems to know me as,\" I tried to explain, feeling like an utter moron. \"Oh.\" He let it drop. I looked away awkwardly.  Thankfully, Mr. Banner started class at that moment. I tried to concentrate as he explained the lab we would be doing today. The slides in the box were out of order. Working as lab partners, we had to separate the slides of onion root tip cells into the phases of mitosis they represented and label them accordingly. We weren't supposed to use our books. In twenty minutes, he would be coming around to see who had it right. \"Get started,\" he commanded. \"Ladies first, partner?\" Edward asked. I looked up to see him smiling a crooked smile so beautiful that I could only stare at him like an idiot. \"Or I could start, if you wish.\" The smile faded; he was obviously wondering if I was mentally competent. \"No,\" I said, flushing.\u201dI'll go ahead.\" I was showing off, just a little. I'd already done this lab, and I knew what I was looking for. It should be easy. I snapped the first slide into place under the microscope and adjusted it quickly to the 40X objective. I studied the slide briefly. My assessment was confident.\u201dProphase.\" \"Do you mind if I look?\" he asked as I began to remove the slide. His hand caught mine, to stop me, as he asked. His fingers were ice-cold, like he'd been holding them in a snowdrift before class. But that wasn't why I jerked my hand away so quickly. When he touched me, it stung my hand as if an electric current had passed through us. \"I'm sorry,\" he muttered, pulling his hand back immediately. However, he continued to reach for the microscope. I watched him, still staggered, as he examined the slide for an even shorter time than I had. \"Prophase,\" he agreed, writing it neatly in the first space on our worksheet. He swiftly switched out the first slide for the second, and then glanced at it cursorily. \"Anaphase,\" he murmured, writing it down as he spoke.  I kept my voice indifferent.\u201dMay I?\" He smirked and pushed the microscope to me. I looked through the eyepiece eagerly, only to be disappointed. Dang it, he was right. \"Slide three?\" I held out my hand without looking at him. He handed it to me; it seemed like he was being careful not to touch my skin again. I took the most fleeting look I could manage. \"Interphase.\" I passed him the microscope before he could ask for it. He took a swift peek, and then wrote it down. I would have written it while he looked, but his clear, elegant script intimidated me. I didn't want to spoil the page with my clumsy scrawl. We were finished before anyone else was close. I could see Mike and his partner comparing two slides again and again, and another group had their book open under the table. Which left me with nothing to do but try to not look at him\u2026 unsuccessfully. I glanced up, and he was staring at me, that same inexplicable look of frustration in his eyes. Suddenly I identified that subtle difference in his face. \"Did you get contacts?\" I blurted out unthinkingly. He seemed puzzled by my unexpected question.\u201dNo.\" \"Oh,\" I mumbled.\u201dI thought there was something different about your eyes.\" He shrugged, and looked away. In fact, I was sure there was something different. I vividly remembered the flat black color of his eyes the last time he'd glared at me \u2014 the color was striking against the background of his pale skin and his auburn hair. Today, his eyes were a completely different color: a strange ocher, darker than butterscotch, but with the same golden tone. I didn't understand how that could be, unless he was lying for some reason about the contacts. Or maybe Forks was making me crazy in the literal sense of the word. I looked down. His hands were clenched into hard fists again. Mr. Banner came to our table then, to see why we weren't working. He looked over our shoulders to glance at the completed lab, and then stared more intently to check the answers. \"So, Edward, didn't you think Isabella should get a chance with the microscope?\" Mr. Banner asked. \"Bella,\" Edward corrected automatically.\u201dActually, she identified three of the five.\" Mr. Banner looked at me now; his expression was skeptical. \"Have you done this lab before?\" he asked. I smiled sheepishly.\u201dNot with onion root.\" \"Whitefish blastula?\" \"Yeah.\" Mr. Banner nodded.\u201dWere you in an advanced placement program in Phoenix?\" \"Yes.\" \"Well,\" he said after a moment,\u201dI guess it's good you two are lab partners.\" He mumbled something else as he walked away. After he left, I began doodling on my notebook again. \"It's too bad about the snow, isn't it?\" Edward asked. I had the feeling that he was forcing himself to make small talk with me. Paranoia swept over me again. It was like he had heard my conversation with Jessica at lunch and was trying to prove me wrong. \"Not really,\" I answered honestly, instead of pretending to be normal like everyone else. I was still trying to dislodge the stupid feeling of suspicion, and I couldn't concentrate. \"You don't like the cold.\" It wasn't a question. \"Or the wet.\" \"Forks must be a difficult place for you to live,\" he mused. \"You have no idea,\" I muttered darkly. He looked fascinated by what I said, for some reason I couldn't imagine. His face was such a distraction that I tried not to look at it any more than courtesy absolutely demanded. \"Why did you come here, then?\" No one had asked me that \u2014 not straight out like he did, demanding. \"It's\u2026 complicated.\" \"I think I can keep up,\" he pressed. I paused for a long moment, and then made the mistake of meeting his gaze. His dark gold eyes confused me, and I answered without thinking. \"My mother got remarried,\" I said. \"That doesn't sound so complex,\" he disagreed, but he was suddenly sympathetic.\u201dWhen did that happen?\" \"Last September.\" My voice sounded sad, even to me. \"And you don't like him,\" Edward surmised, his tone still kind. \"No, Phil is fine. Too young, maybe, but nice enough.\" \"Why didn't you stay with them?\" I couldn't fathom his interest, but he continued to stare at me with penetrating eyes, as if my dull life's story was somehow vitally important. \"Phil travels a lot. He plays ball for a living.\" I half-smiled. \"Have I heard of him?\" he asked, smiling in response. \"Probably not. He doesn't play well. Strictly minor league. He moves around a lot.\" \"And your mother sent you here so that she could travel with him.\" He said it as an assumption again, not a question. My chin raised a fraction.\u201dNo, she did not send me here. I sent myself.\" His eyebrows knit together.\u201dI don't understand,\" he admitted, and he seemed unnecessarily frustrated by that fact. I sighed. Why was I explaining this to him? He continued to stare at me with obvious curiosity. \"She stayed with me at first, but she missed him. It made her unhappy\u2026 so I decided it was time to spend some quality time with Charlie.\" My voice was <em>glum</em> by the time I finished. \"But now you're unhappy,\" he pointed out.  \"And?\" I challenged. \"That doesn't seem fair.\" He shrugged, but his eyes were still intense. I laughed without humor.\u201dHasn't anyone ever told you? Life isn't fair.\" \"I believe I have heard that somewhere before,\" he agreed dryly. \"So that's all,\" I insisted, wondering why he was still staring at me that way. His gaze became appraising.\u201dYou put on a good show,\" he said slowly. \"But I'd be willing to bet that you're suffering more than you let anyone see.\" I grimaced at him, resisting the impulse to stick out my tongue like a five-year-old, and looked away. \"Am I wrong?\" I tried to ignore him. \"I didn't think so,\" he murmured smugly. \"Why does it matter to you?\" I asked, irritated. I kept my eyes away, watching the teacher make his rounds. \"That's a very good question,\" he muttered, so quietly that I wondered if he was talking to himself. However, after a few seconds of silence, I decided that was the only answer I was going to get. I sighed, scowling at the blackboard. \"Am I annoying you?\" he asked. He sounded amused. I glanced at him without thinking\u2026 and told the truth again.\u201dNot exactly. I'm more annoyed at myself. My face is so easy to read \u2014 my mother always calls me her open book.\" I frowned. \"On the contrary, I find you very difficult to read.\" Despite everything that I'd said and he'd guessed, he sounded like he meant it. \"You must be a good reader then,\" I replied. \"Usually.\" He smiled widely, flashing a set of perfect, ultrawhite teeth. Mr. Banner called the class to order then, and I turned with relief to listen. I was in disbelief that I'd just explained my dreary life to this bizarre, beautiful boy who may or may not despise me. He'd seemed engrossed in our conversation, but now I could see, from the corner of my eye, that he was leaning away from me again, his hands gripping the edge of the table with unmistakable tension. I tried to appear attentive as Mr. Banner illustrated, with transparencies on the overhead projector, what I had seen without difficulty through the microscope. But my thoughts were unmanageable. When the bell finally rang, Edward rushed as swiftly and as gracefully from the room as he had last Monday. And, like last Monday, I stared after him in amazement. Mike skipped quickly to my side and picked up my books for me. I imagined him with a wagging tail. \"That was awful,\" he groaned.\u201dThey all looked exactly the same. You're lucky you had Cullen for a partner.\" \"I didn't have any trouble with it,\" I said, stung by his assumption. I regretted the snub instantly.\u201dI've done the lab before, though,\" I added before he could get his feelings hurt. \"Cullen seemed friendly enough today,\" he commented as we shrugged into our raincoats. He didn't seem pleased about it. I tried to sound indifferent.\u201dI wonder what was with him last Monday.\" I couldn't concentrate on Mike's chatter as we walked to Gym, and RE. didn't do much to hold my attention, either. Mike was on my team today. He chivalrously covered my position as well as his own, so my woolgathering was only interrupted when it was my turn to serve; my team ducked warily out of the way every time I was up. The rain was just a mist as I walked to the parking lot, but I was happier when I was in the dry cab. I got the heater running, for once not caring about the mind-numbing roar of the engine. I unzipped my jacket, put the hood down, and fluffed my damp hair out so the heater could dry it on the way home. I looked around me to make sure it was clear. That's when I noticed the still, white figure. Edward Cullen was leaning against the front door of the Volvo, three cars down from me, and staring intently in my direction. I swiftly looked away and threw the truck into reverse, almost hitting a rusty Toyota Corolla in my haste. Lucky for the Toyota, I stomped on the brake in time. It was just the sort of car that my truck would make scrap metal of. I took a deep breath, still looking out the other side of my car, and cautiously pulled out again, with greater success. I stared straight ahead as I passed the Volvo, but from a peripheral peek, I would swear I saw him laughing.",
