            "en": "Symantec: China Main Source of Targeted Attacks       A new report from Symantec's MessageLabs analyzed targeted attacks this month and found that nearly a third originate from senders in China. A new report from Symantec names China as the world's primary source of targeted malware the month of March. The high stakes of such attacks were brought into focus for many earlier this year with the Aurora attack on Google and dozens of other companies. According to Symantec (PDF), while most of the malware (36.6 percent) came from the United States in terms of mail server location, an analysis of the sender\u2019s IP address put the attacker's location in China 28.2 percent of the time, followed by Romania (21.1 percent) and then the United States (13.8 percent).   \u201cWhen considering the true location of the sender rather than the location of the e-mail server, fewer attacks are actually sent from North America than it would at first seem,\u201d said Paul Wood, intelligence senior analyst with Symantec\u2019s MessageLabs, in a statement. \u201cA large proportion of targeted attacks are sent from legitimate webmail accounts which are located in the U.S. and therefore, the IP address of the sending mail server is not a useful indicator of the true origin of the attack. Analysis of the sender\u2019s IP address, rather than the IP address of the e-mail server reveals the true source of these targeted attacks.\u201d  Symantec found that the top five targeted roles are: Director, Senior Official, Vice President, Manager, and Executive Director, and the individuals that receive the most targeted malware are typically responsible for foreign trade and defense policy involving Asian countries.  Mikko Hypponen, chief researcher officer at F-Secure, noted in a conversation with eWEEK that targeted attacks are often preceded by real-world espionage where the hackers dig into the backgrounds of their targets, searching for information such as where they live, what language they speak and what information they have access to.  \u201cWho are their colleagues? What area are they working (in)? What kind of computers are they using, what kind of security systems they have in place\u2026once you have all that information, then you can launch the actual attacks,\u201d he said.  According to Symantec, the city Shaoxing in China seems to be a major source for attacks, accounting for 21.3 percent. Taipei in Taiwan and London in the U.K. accounted for 16.5 percent and 14.8 percent, respectively.  Symantec\u2019s analysis found the most common file types attached to malicious e-mails are .XLS and .DOC, though the most dangerous file type is .RAR files, which are a proprietary compressed <em>archive</em> format. .XLS and .DOC file types each accounted for 15.4 percent of file attachments in e-mail in March.  The most compromised file type for the month were encrypted .RAR files, which accounted for roughly 1 in 312 malicious files attached to e-mails. While encrypted .RAR files are relatively uncommon, Symantec reported that 96.8 percent attached to e-mails were found to be malicious.  \u201cBy comparison, unencrypted .RAR files are rarely exploited and occur in 1.1 percent of e-mails,\u201d Wood said. \u201cAlthough they are more common than encrypted .RAR files, they are far less likely to be seen attached to malicious e-mail.\u201d The .EXE file type is the most likely to arouse suspicion when attached to an e-mail, however, in March executable file types accounted for just 6.7 percent of files attached to e-mail and were found to be compromised 15 percent of the time. The most common file extensions, .XLS, .DOC, .ZIP and .PDF, as attachments, were the least likely to be infected, due to the sheer number of e-mails using them as attachments, Symantec reported.  These attacks often come through spoofed e-mails with all the calling cards of legitimate messages.   \u201cIn many cases these e-mails are very convincing\u2026talking about projects by numbers and codenames, talking about highly specific details that the person is working with and they have an attachment\u2026which when opened will actually show you a real file which is again relevant in most cases, but at the same time it will drop an exploit through a backdoor,\u201d Hypponen explained.",

            "en": "Dell is looking to become a larger player in the highly competitive cloud-computing field, where such stalwarts as HP, Microsoft and Amazon already have strong footholds. Dell is investing $1 billion in its current fiscal year in new data centers, solution facilities and technologies designed to broaden its capabilities in such areas as cloud computing, virtualization and converged infrastructure. Dell\u2019s strategy, announced April 7, includes building 10 new data centers over the next two years\u2014which will be spread out around the world\u2014including the United States, Asia and Europe\u2014that will be stocked with Dell equipment and help customers adopt and deploy desktop-virtualization and cloud-computing environments, either on their own premises or hosted by the OEM. Through the data center, Dell eventually will offer cloud services based on Microsoft\u2019s Azure platform. In addition, Dell officials plan to open 12 Global Solutions Centers this year, plus another 10 over the next 18 months, where customers will be able to learn about Dell offerings and work with Dell experts to figure out which technologies work best within their budgets. As part of its aggressive cloud-computing/virtualization push, Dell also is rolling products and services designed to make it easier for businesses to adopt cloud-computing models. Key among those is vStart, a pre-assembled hardware and software package of Dell PowerEdge servers, EqualLogics storage and PowerConnect switches that can be delivered as a single unit and easily deployed with initial deployment services from Dell. Each vStart package will enable businesses to immediately run 100 or 200 virtual machines. Eventually, Dell will offer vStart packages that provide virtual-machine capabilities below 100 and above 200, according to Steve Schuckenbrock, president of Dell Services. Dell\u2019s vStart initially will support VMware virtualization technology, but over the next few quarters will expand the number of hypervisors it will offer. \u00a0\u201cCustomers are really now more interested in buying [virtual machines] than they are in buying physical hardware that they have to put together,\u201d Praveen Asthana, vice president of Dell\u2019s Enterprise Solutions and Strategy unit, said during a press conference April 6. \"Customers spend far too much time integrating and trying to optimize software for deploying virtual machines.\" Dell\u2019s announcements are part of a larger strategy to grow beyond its roots as a PC and server maker and become more of a solutions provider, with an emphasis in such areas as virtualization and cloud computing. Dell officials have been aggressive in buying companies that enable it to grow its capabilities rapidly, including several storage technology vendors and services firm Perot Systems. However, it\u2019s moving into a highly competitive field. Dell\u2019s large OEM rivals, such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Cisco Systems, all are pushing converged infrastructures, as well as data center and cloud services. In addition, as Dell looks to become more active in cloud computing, it will run up against public cloud giants like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and Rackspace. During the April 6 press conference, Schuckenbrock said that Dell\u2019s new data centers would be primarily focused on hosting customers\u2019 data center infrastructures. Dell is committed to bringing in the appropriate staffing, and he said that while Dell\u2019s ambitions are large, the company has experience in cloud computing. He pointed to the OEM\u2019s Data Center Solutions business as a proof point. \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve seen some of the things we\u2019ve done with our DCS business, and you can expect to see that kind of architecture with a highly scaled-out infrastructure,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we\u2019ve proven our ability to do hyperscale data centers that support some of the largest cloud capabilities in the world.\u201d Dell\u2019s new data centers will \u201clargely be modular and oriented toward hosting cloud capabilities, whether it\u2019s desktop as a service or private and public cloud capabilities,\u201d Schuckenbrock said. Along with the data center and solution-center build-outs and the vStart offering, Dell officials also announced a three-year partnership with Microsoft that is designed to help businesses more quickly get up and running with virtualization and cloud technologies. They\u2019ll be offering management solutions based on Dell\u2019s Virtual Integrated System and Advanced Infrastructure Manager, and Microsoft\u2019s System Center. The virtualization offerings will be based on Microsoft\u2019s Hyper-V. Dell also showed off a new email and file <em>archive</em> solution, which includes a pre-configured reference architecture, ongoing maintenance and support, and storage products that offer high scalability and ease of use. The OEM also is expanding its desktop-virtualization capabilities, offering a portfolio that includes pre-packaged services, and configured and tested hardware and software for fast deployment. With its desktop-virtualization solutions, Dell also is looking to accelerate the time it takes for businesses to implement a desktop-virtualization solution, and to support any computing endpoint anywhere. \u00a0\u201cWe do a lot of the pre-work for customers\u201d in cloud and virtualized environments, Schuckenbrock said.",

            "en": "The secrets of Britain's abandoned villages          The ghosts of thousands of long-forgotten villages haunt Britain, inhabitations suddenly deserted and left to ruin. As a new campaign begins to shed further light on these forgotten histories, the Magazine asks - what happened and why? Albert Nash, blacksmith for 44 years in the village of Imber, Wiltshire, was found by his wife Martha slumped over the anvil in his forge. He was, in her words, crying like a baby.  It was the beginning of November 1943, a day or two after Mr Nash and the rest of the villagers had been told by the War Office they had 47 days to pack their bags and leave, to make way for US forces. Within weeks Mr Nash had died. Folklore had it that the death certificate said the cause was a broken heart. Imber, once a Saxon settlement, is one of thousands of British ex-villages - once thriving communities that succumbed to natural or human forces, like disease, coastal erosion, industrial decline, reservoirs or war. To mark the launch of the new Times Atlas of Britain, its publisher Collins wants people to send in their memories of such places, to create a digital <em>archive</em> dedicated to these lost locations.  \"While compiling the first comprehensive atlas of its type to be published in the UK in over 40 years, we were not only interested in how the United Kingdom had changed geographically over time, but the implications of this for residents of our islands,\" says Jethro Lennox, senior publishing manager at Times Atlas. \"Initially, we found that natural factors such as coastal erosion and flooding had made some places uninhabitable... while economic, military or industrial-related reasons also contributed towards an abandonment of settlements, including Dylife, Imber and Radcliffe.\" The anguish of Mr Nash shows the pain that such events in history can wreak on families and communities. Mr Nash's grandson, Ken Mitchell, now 84, remembers the eviction well. \"It was a bombshell dropped on the villagers. The elders were called together for a meeting in the schoolroom and when they were told, it was a complete surprise. \"Albert was very upset and it hit him very hard. He moved to Bishops Cannings, near Devizes, but he had lost the will to live and only survived four or five weeks.\"  Ken was 17 at the time. He had for a time worked with his grandfather in the smithy but was now seeking a career in the RAF.  After leaving Imber and the vicarage where he worked, Ken's father became a labourer on a farm about 15 miles away, and took his wife and three children there, although a year later Ken joined the Army.  All 155 villagers left, most of them scattered around the Salisbury Plain area, working as farmhands. Their demands to return after the war came to nothing. \"There was no anger at the time. Dismay and disappointment, yes, but the anger took a long time. They felt they were helping the country and helping the war effort, and they thought they were coming back. My mother was visibly upset but I don't think it really affected the children.\" For a few weekends a year, the Ministry of Defence allows public access to Imber, so Ken and other surviving villagers return, but the thatched cottage he left behind has been demolished and the Victorian vicarage destroyed.  The story of Imber has long fascinated Rex Sawyer, a former headmaster in Wiltshire and author of Little Imber on the Down, and he says it's now part of the county's identity. \"It has such a grip on the hearts and minds of Wiltshire people. When Imber opens, people flood there, but the village is in a very sad state now, just a few buildings.\" For many other \"ghost\" settlements, there are no remains at all, so long ago were they inhabited and then deserted.  Villages, hamlets and farms have been moving around since the Neolithic Age, when people settled down for the first time, says Trevor Rowley, author of Deserted Villages, although some periods in history such as the Black Death in the late Middle Ages, have been more turbulent than others. \u00a0\u201cThese changes happen in places previously desirable but no longer worth living in because you can't make your living there any more. So it reflects on social history and economic history,\" says Mr Rowley.  Archaeologists are happy because the remains give them an undisturbed snapshot of society, he says, but there is an underlying sadness to these events. Although some people affected were rehoused, many others took up a life of squatting while the most unfortunate turned to vagrancy. One of the most infamous examples in British history was the Highlands Clearances in the 18th and 19th Centuries, which displaced thousands and had a deep cultural impact.  Around the same time, Irish poet Oliver Goldsmith evoked feelings of melancholy in The Deserted Village, about returning to his village after a long absence, to find it neglected and empty - \"desolation saddens all they green\" - apart from one lonely widow. Stephen Fisk, who visits Britain's abandoned villages and documents them on his website, says his devotion was stimulated by the human stories behind evictions and resettlements. \"I wanted to know what it was like for people forced to leave their homes and land, and how they coped afterwards. When it's a wealthy landlord forcing people out for one reason or another, I think there's more anger. You can't help but feel indignation on their behalf.\" But when it's due to natural causes, it is at least a gradual process, at least in the UK, says Mr Fisk. Dunwich in Suffolk was a very important port in the Middle Ages but it was washed away by the sea, in a process that probably happened over hundreds of years. In the last 100 years, societies have proved to be remarkably versatile, he says, and the general decline in industries has not claimed as many villages as one might think. \"Communities have survived or developed a new purpose, or even just become commuter places for the town or city nearby.\" Resettlements have become less likely to happen today, because the power structures don't exist and we're better at resisting them, he says, although the village of Sipson in west London only escaped when plans for the third runway at Heathrow Airport were cancelled recently.  Still today, there are reminders of abandonments of the past - a solitary church or a strange bump on the landscape. And in the Dorset village of Tyneham, a more poignant tribute. As if frozen in time, the coat pegs in the schoolhouse still bear the names of the children evacuated 70 years ago, when the village become an Army training base for the D-Day landings.",
