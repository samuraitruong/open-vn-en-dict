We can readily reject these ideas.\u00a0All species of animals studied to date have both short and long-term memory; and all are susceptible to retrograde amnesia.\u00a0Like humans, birds, bees, and molluscs, as well as fish and rats, make long-term memory slowly. Consolidation of memory clearly emerged\u00a0early\u00a0in\u00a0evolution, and was <em>conserved</em>.",
