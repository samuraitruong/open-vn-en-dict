But if it had to perish twice,  I think I know enough of hate  To say that for destruction ice  Is also great  And would suffice.  Robert Frost    PREFACE  All our attempts at subterfuge had been in vain.  With ice in my heart, I watched him prepare to defend me. His intense concentration betrayed no hint of doubt, though he was outnumbered. I knew that we could expect no help \u2014 at this moment, his family was fighting for their lives just as surely as he was for ours.    Would I ever learn the outcome of that other fight? Find out who the winners and the losers were?  Would I live long enough for that?  The odds of that didn\u2019t look so great.  Black eyes, wild with their fierce craving for my death, watched for the moment when my protector\u2019s attention would be diverted. The moment when I would surely die.  Somewhere, far, far away in the cold forest, a wolf howled.    1. ULTIMATUM  Bella,  I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re making Charlie carry notes to Billy like we\u2019re in second grade \u2014 if I wanted to talk to you I would answer them  You made the choice here, okay? You can\u2019t have it both ways when  What part of \u201cmortal enemies\u201d is too complicated for you to  Look, I know I\u2019m being a jerk, but there\u2019s just no way around  We can\u2019t be friends when you\u2019re spending all your time with a bunch of  It just makes it worse when I think about you too much, so don\u2019t write anymore  Yeah, I miss you, too. A lot. Doesn\u2019t change anything. Sorry.  Jacob     I ran my fingers across the page, feeling the dents where he had pressed the pen to the paper so hard that it had nearly broken through. I could picture him writing this \u2014 scrawling the angry letters in his rough handwriting, slashing through line after line when the words came out wrong, maybe even snapping the pen in his too-big hand; that would explain the ink splatters. I could imagine the frustration pulling his black eyebrows together and crumpling his forehead. If I\u2019d been there, I might have laughed. Don\u2019t give yourself a brain hemorrhage, Jacob, I would have told him. Just spit it out.     Laughing was the last thing I felt like doing now as I reread the words I\u2019d already memorized. His answer to my pleading note \u2014 passed from Charlie to Billy to him, just like second grade, as he\u2019d pointed out \u2014 was no surprise. I\u2019d known the essence of what it would say before I\u2019d opened it. What was surprising was how much each crossed-out line wounded me \u2014 as if the points of the letters had cutting edges. More than that, behind each angry beginning lurked a vast pool of hurt; Jacob\u2019s pain cut me deeper than my own.     While I was pondering this, I caught the unmistakable scent of a smoking burner rising from the kitchen. In another house, the fact that someone besides myself was cooking might not be a cause for panicking. I shoved the wrinkled paper into my back pocket and ran, making it downstairs in the nick of time. The jar of spaghetti sauce Charlie\u2019d stuck in the microwave was only on its first revolution when I yanked the door open and pulled it out.     \u201cWhat did I do wrong?\u201d Charlie demanded.  \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to take the lid off first, Dad. Metal\u2019s bad for microwaves.\u201d I swiftly removed the lid as I spoke, poured half the sauce into a bowl, and then put the bowl inside the microwave and the jar back in the fridge; I fixed the time and pressed start.  Charlie watched my adjustments with pursed lips. \u201cDid I get the noodles right?\u201d  I looked in the pan on the stove \u2014 the source of the smell that had alerted me. \u201cStirring helps,\u201d I said mildly. I found a spoon and tried to de-clump the mushy hunk that was scalded to the bottom.  Charlie sighed.     \u201cSo what\u2019s all this about?\u201d I asked him.  He folded his arms across his chest and glared out the back windows into the sheeting rain. \u201cDon\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d he grumbled.  I was <em>mystified</em>. Charlie cooking? And what was with the surly attitude? Edward wasn\u2019t here yet; usually my dad reserved this kind of behavior for my boyfriend\u2019s benefit, doing his best to illustrate the theme of \u201cunwelcome\u201d with every word and posture. Charlie\u2019s efforts were unnecessary \u2014 Edward knew exactly what my dad was thinking without the show.      The word boyfriend had me chewing on the inside of my cheek with a familiar tension while I stirred. It wasn\u2019t the right word, not at all. I needed something more expressive of eternal commitment. . . . But words like destiny and fate sounded hokey when you used them in casual conversation.     Edward had another word in mind, and that word was the source of the tension I felt. It put my teeth on edge just to think it to myself. Fianc\u00e9e. Ugh. I shuddered away from the thought.  \u201cDid I miss something? Since when do you make dinner?\u201d I asked Charlie. The pasta lump bobbed in the boiling water as I poked it. \u201cOr try to make dinner, I should say.\u201d  Charlie shrugged. \u201cThere\u2019s no law that says I can\u2019t cook in my own house.\u201d     \u201cYou would know,\u201d I replied, grinning as I eyed the badge pinned to his leather jacket.  \u201cHa. Good one.\u201d He shrugged out of the jacket as if my glance had reminded him he still had it on, and hung it on the peg reserved for his gear. His gun belt was already slung in place \u2014 he hadn\u2019t felt the need to wear that to the station for a few weeks. There had been no more disturbing disappearances to trouble the small town of Forks, Washington, no more sightings of the giant, mysterious wolves in the ever-rainy woods. . . .      I prodded the noodles in silence, guessing that Charlie would get around to talking about whatever was bothering him in his own time. My dad was not a man of many words, and the effort he had put into trying to orchestrate a sit-down dinner with me made it clear there were an uncharacteristic number of words on his mind.  I glanced at the clock routinely - something I did every few minutes around this time. Less than a half hour to go now.    Afternoons were the hardest part of my day. Ever since my former best friend (and werewolf), Jacob Black, had informed on me about the motorcycle I\u2019d been riding on the sly \u2014 a betrayal he had devised in order to get me grounded so that I couldn\u2019t spend time with my boyfriend (and vampire), Edward Cullen \u2014 Edward had been allowed to see me only from seven till nine-thirty p.m., always inside the confines of my home and under the supervision of my dad\u2019s unfailingly crabby glare.     This was an escalation from the previous, slightly less stringent grounding that I\u2019d earned for an unexplained three-day disappearance and one episode of cliff diving.     Of course, I still saw Edward at school, because there wasn\u2019t anything Charlie could do about that. And then, Edward spent almost every night in my room, too, but Charlie wasn\u2019t precisely aware of that. Edward\u2019s ability to climb easily and silently through my second-story window was almost as useful as his ability to read Charlie\u2019s mind.     Though the afternoon was the only time I spent away from Edward, it was enough to make me restless, and the hours always dragged. Still, I endured my punishment without complaining because \u2014 for one thing \u2014 I knew I\u2019d earned it, and \u2014 for another \u2014 because I couldn\u2019t bear to hurt my dad by moving out now, when a much more permanent separation hovered, invisible to Charlie, so close on my horizon.    My dad sat down at the table with a grunt and unfolded the damp newspaper there; within seconds he was clucking his tongue in disapproval.  \u201cI don\u2019t know why you read the news, Dad. It only ticks you off.\u201d  He ignored me, grumbling at the paper in his hands. \u201cThis is why everyone wants to live in a small town! Ridiculous.\u201d  \u201cWhat have big cities done wrong now?\u201d  \u201cSeattle\u2019s making a run for murder capital of the country. Five unsolved homicides in the last two weeks. Can you imagine living like that?\u201d      \u201cI think Phoenix is actually higher up the homicide list, Dad. I have lived like that.\u201d And I\u2019d never come close to being a murder victim until after I moved to his safe little town. In fact, I was still on several hit lists. . . . The spoon shook in my hands, making the water tremble. \u201cWell, you couldn\u2019t pay me enough,\u201d Charlie said.     I gave up on saving dinner and settled for serving it; I had to use a steak knife to cut a portion of spaghetti for Charlie and then myself, while he watched with a sheepish expression. Charlie coated his helping with sauce and dug in. I disguised my own clump as well as I could and followed his example without much enthusiasm. We ate in silence for a moment. Charlie was still scanning the news, so I picked up my much-abused copy of Wuthering Heights from where I\u2019d left it this morning at breakfast, and tried to lose myself in turn-of-the-century England while I waited for him to start talking.     I was just to the part where Heathcliff returns when Charlie cleared his throat and threw the paper to the floor.  \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Charlie said. \u201cI did have a reason for doing this.\u201d He waved his fork at the gluey spread.  \u201cI wanted to talk to you.\u201d  I laid the book aside; the binding was so destroyed that it slumped flat to the table. \u201cYou could have just asked.\u201d  He nodded, his eyebrows pulling together. \u201cYeah. I\u2019ll remember that next time. I thought taking dinner off your hands would soften you up.\u201d     I laughed. \u201cIt worked \u2014 your cooking skills have me soft as a marshmallow. What do you need, Dad?\u201d  \u201cWell, it\u2019s about Jacob.\u201d  I felt my face harden. \u201cWhat about him?\u201d I asked through stiff lips.  \u201cEasy, Bells. I know you\u2019re still upset that he told on you, but it was the right thing. He was being responsible.\u201d  \u201cResponsible,\u201d I repeated scathingly, rolling my eyes. \u201cRight. So, what about Jacob?\u201d  The careless question repeated inside my head, anything but trivial.What about Jacob? What was I going to do about him? My former best friend who was now . . . what? My enemy? I cringed.    Charlie\u2019s face was suddenly wary. \u201cDon\u2019t get mad at me, okay?\u201d  \u201cMad?\u201d  \u201cWell, it\u2019s about Edward, too.\u201d  My eyes narrowed.  Charlie\u2019s voice got gruffer. \u201cI let him in the house, don\u2019t I?\u201d  \u201cYou do,\u201d I admitted. \u201cFor brief periods of time. Of course, you might let me out of the house for brief periods now and then, too,\u201d I continued \u2014 only jokingly; I knew I was on lockdown for the duration of the school year. \u201cI\u2019ve been pretty good lately.\u201d  \u201cWell, that\u2019s kind of where I was heading with this. . . .\u201d And then Charlie\u2019s face stretched into an unexpected eye-crinkling grin; for a second he looked twenty years younger.     I saw a dim glimmer of possibility in that smile, but I proceeded slowly. \u201cI\u2019m confused, Dad. Are we talking about Jacob, or Edward, or me being grounded?\u201d  The grin flashed again. \u201cSort of all three.\u201d  \u201cAnd how do they relate?\u201d I asked, cautious.  \u201cOkay.\u201d He sighed, raising his hands as if in surrender. \u201cSo I\u2019m thinking maybe you deserve a parole for good behavior. For a teenager, you\u2019re amazingly non-whiney.\u201d  My voice and eyebrows shot up. \u201cSeriously? I\u2019m free?\u201d  Where was this coming from? I\u2019d been positive I would be under house arrest until I actually moved out, and Edward hadn\u2019t picked up any wavering in Charlie\u2019s thoughts. . . .     Charlie held up one finger. \u201cConditionally.\u201d  The enthusiasm vanished. \u201cFantastic,\u201d I groaned.  \u201cBella, this is more of a request than a demand, okay? You\u2019re free. But I\u2019m hoping you\u2019ll use that freedom . . . judiciously.\u201d  \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d  He sighed again. \u201cI know you\u2019re satisfied to spend all of your time with Edward \u2014\u201d  \u201cI spend time with Alice, too,\u201d I interjected. Edward\u2019s sister had no hours of visitation; she came and went as she pleased. Charlie was putty in her capable hands.  \u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you have other friends besides the Cullens, Bella. Or you used to.\u201d     We stared at each other for a long moment.  \u201cWhen was the last time you spoke to Angela Weber?\u201d he threw at me.  \u201cFriday at lunch,\u201d I answered immediately.  Before Edward\u2019s return, my school friends had polarized into two groups. I liked to think of those groups as good vs.evil. Us and them worked, too. The good guys were Angela, her steady boyfriend Ben Cheney, and Mike Newton; these three had all very generously forgiven me for going crazy when Edward left. Lauren Mallory was the evil core of the them side, and almost everyone else, including my first friend in Forks, Jessica Stanley, seemed content to go along with her anti-Bella agenda.     With Edward back at school, the dividing line had become even more distinct.  Edward\u2019s return had taken its toll on Mike\u2019s friendship, but Angela was unswervingly loyal, and Ben followed her lead. Despite the natural aversion most humans felt toward the Cullens, Angela sat dutifully beside Alice every day at lunch. After a few weeks, Angela even looked comfortable there. It was difficult not to be charmed by the Cullens \u2014 once one gave them the chance to be charming.  \u201cOutside of school?\u201d Charlie asked, calling my attention back.     \u201cI haven\u2019t seen anyone outside of school, Dad. Grounded, remember? And Angela has a boyfriend, too. She\u2019s always with Ben.If I\u2019m really free,\u201d I added, heavy on the skepticism, \u201cmaybe we could double.\u201d  \u201cOkay. But then . . .\u201d He hesitated. \u201cYou and Jake used to be joined at the hip, and now \u2014\u201d  I cut him off. \u201cCan you get to the point, Dad? What\u2019s your condition \u2014 exactly?\u201d  \u201cI don\u2019t think you should dump all your other friends for your boyfriend, Bella,\u201d he said in a stern voice.  \u201cIt\u2019s not nice, and I think your life would be better balanced if you kept some other people in it. What happened last September . . .\u201d  I flinched.      \u201cWell,\u201d he said defensively. \u201cIf you\u2019d had more of a life outside of Edward Cullen, it might not have been like that.\u201d  \u201cIt would have been exactly like that,\u201d I muttered.  \u201cMaybe, maybe not.\u201d  \u201cThe point?\u201d I reminded him.  \u201cUse your new freedom to see your other friends, too. Keep it balanced.\u201d  I nodded slowly. \u201cBalance is good. Do I have specific time quotas to fill, though?\u201d  He made a face, but shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make this complicated. Just don\u2019t forget your friends . . .\u201d      It was a dilemma I was already struggling with. My friends. People who, for their own safety, I would never be able to see again after graduation.  So what was the better course of action? Spend time with them while I could? Or start the separation now to make it more gradual? I quailed at the idea of the second option.  \u201c. . . particularly Jacob,\u201d Charlie added before I could think things through more than that. A greater dilemma than the first. It took me a moment to find the right words. \u201cJacob might be . . . difficult.\u201d  \u201cThe Blacks are practically family, Bella,\u201d he said, stern and fatherly again. \u201cAnd Jacob has been a very, very good friend to you.\u201d  \u201cI know that.\u201d  \u201cDon\u2019t you miss him at all?\u201d Charlie asked, frustrated.    My throat suddenly felt swollen; I had to clear it twice before I answered. \u201cYes, I do miss him,\u201d I admitted, still looking down. \u201cI miss him a lot.\u201d  \u201cThen why is it difficult?\u201d It wasn\u2019t something I was at liberty to explain. It was against the rules for normal people \u2014human people like me and Charlie \u2014 to know about the clandestine world full of myths and monsters that existed secretly around us. I knew all about that world \u2014 and I was in no small amount of trouble as a result. I wasn\u2019t about to get Charlie in the same trouble. \u201cWith Jacob there is a . . . conflict,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cA conflict about the friendship thing, I mean. Friendship doesn\u2019t always seem to be enough for Jake.\u201d      I wound my excuse out of details that were true but insignificant, hardly crucial compared to the fact that Jacob\u2019s werewolf pack bitterly hated Edward\u2019s vampire family \u2014 and therefore me, too, as I fully intended to join that family. It just wasn\u2019t something I could work out with him in a note, and he wouldn\u2019t answer my calls. But my plan to deal with the werewolf in person had definitely not gone over well with the vampires.    \u201cIsn\u2019t Edward up for a little healthy competition?\u201d Charlie\u2019s voice was sarcastic now.  I leveled a dark look at him. \u201cThere\u2019s no competition.\u201d  \u201cYou\u2019re hurting Jake\u2019s feelings, avoiding him like this. He\u2019d rather be just friends than nothing.\u201d  Oh, now I was avoiding him?  \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Jake doesn\u2019t want to be friends at all.\u201d The words burned in my mouth. \u201cWhere\u2019d you get that idea, anyway?\u201d  Charlie looked embarrassed now. \u201cThe subject might have come up today with Billy. . . .\u201d  \u201cYou and Billy gossip like old women,\u201d I complained, stabbing my fork viciously into the congealed spaghetti on my plate.     \u201cBilly\u2019s worried about Jacob,\u201d Charlie said. \u201cJake\u2019s having a hard time right now. . . . He\u2019s depressed.\u201d  I winced, but kept my eyes on the blob.  \u201cAnd then you were always so happy after spending the day with Jake.\u201d Charlie sighed.  \u201cI\u2019m happy now,\u201d I growled fiercely through my teeth.  The contrast between my words and tone broke through the tension. Charlie burst into laughter, and I had to join in.  \u201cOkay, okay,\u201d I agreed. \u201cBalance.\u201d  \u201cAnd Jacob,\u201d he insisted.  \u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d      \u201cGood. Find that balance, Bella. And, oh, yeah, you\u2019ve got some mail,\u201d Charlie said, closing the subject with no attempt at subtlety. \u201cIt\u2019s by the stove.\u201d  I didn\u2019t move, my thoughts twisting into snarls around Jacob\u2019s name. It was most likely junk mail; I\u2019d just gotten a package from my mom yesterday and I wasn\u2019t expecting anything else.  Charlie shoved his chair away from the table and stretched as he got to his feet. He took his plate to the sink, but before he turned the water on to rinse it, he paused to toss a thick envelope at me. The letter skidded across the table and thunked into my elbow.      \u201cEr, thanks,\u201d I muttered, puzzled by his pushiness. Then I saw the return address \u2014 the letter was from the University of Alaska Southeast. \u201cThat was quick. I guess I missed the deadline on that one, too.\u201d  Charlie chuckled.  I flipped the envelope over and then glared up at him. \u201cIt\u2019s open.\u201d  \u201cI was curious.\u201d  \u201cI\u2019m shocked, Sheriff. That\u2019s a federal crime.\u201d  \u201cOh, just read it.\u201d  I pulled out the letter, and a folded schedule of courses.  \u201cCongratulations,\u201d he said before I could read anything. \u201cYour first acceptance.\u201d  \u201cThanks, Dad.\u201d     \u201cWe should talk about tuition. I\u2019ve got some money saved up \u2014\u201d  \u201cHey, hey, none of that. I\u2019m not touching your retirement, Dad. I\u2019ve got my college fund.\u201d What was left of it \u2014 and there hadn\u2019t been much to begin with.  Charlie frowned. \u201cSome of these places are pretty pricey, Bells. I want to help. You don\u2019t have to go to all the way to Alaska just because it\u2019s cheaper.\u201d     It wasn\u2019t cheaper, not at all. But it was far away, and Juneau had an average of three hundred twenty-one overcast days per year. The first was my prerequisite, the second was Edward\u2019s.  \u201cI\u2019ve got it covered. Besides, there\u2019s lots of financial aid out there. It\u2019s easy to get loans.\u201d I hoped my bluff wasn\u2019t too obvious. I hadn\u2019t actually done a lot of research on the subject.     \u201cSo . . . ,\u201d Charlie began, and then he pursed his lips and looked away.  \u201cSo what?\u201d  \u201cNothing. I was just . . .\u201d He frowned. \u201cJust wondering what . . . Edward\u2019s plans are for next year?\u201d  \u201cOh.\u201d  \u201cWell?\u201d  Three quick raps on the door saved me. Charlie rolled his eyes and I jumped up.  \u201cComing!\u201d I called while Charlie mumbled something that sounded like, \u201cGo away.\u201d I ignored him and went to let Edward in.     I wrenched the door out of my way \u2014 ridiculously eager \u2014 and there he was, my personal miracle. Time had not made me immune to the perfection of his face, and I was sure that I would never take any aspect of him for granted. My eyes traced over his pale white features: the hard square of his jaw, the softer curve of his full lips \u2014 twisted up into a smile now, the straight line of his nose, the sharp angle of his cheekbones, the smooth marble span of his forehead \u2014 partially obscured by a tangle of rain-darkened bronze hair. . . .     I saved his eyes for last, knowing that when I looked into them I was likely to lose my train of thought. They were wide, warm with liquid gold, and framed by a thick fringe of black lashes. Staring into his eyes always made me feel extraordinary \u2014 sort of like my bones were turning spongy. I was also a little lightheaded, but that could have been because I\u2019d forgotten to keep breathing. Again.  It was a face any male model in the world would trade his soul for. Of course, that might be exactly the asking price: one soul.  No. I didn\u2019t believe that. I felt guilty for even thinking it, and was glad \u2014 as I was often glad \u2014 that I was the one person whose thoughts were a mystery to Edward.     I reached for his hand, and sighed when his cold fingers found mine. His touch brought with it the strangest sense of relief \u2014 as if I\u2019d been in pain and that pain had suddenly ceased.  \u201cHey.\u201d I smiled a little at my anticlimactic greeting.  He raised our interlaced fingers to brush my cheek with the back of his hand. \u201cHow was your afternoon?\u201d  \u201cSlow.\u201d  \u201cFor me, as well.\u201d  He pulled my wrist up to his face, our hands still twisted together. His eyes closed as his nose skimmed along the skin there, and he smiled gently without opening them. Enjoying the bouquet while resisting the wine, as he\u2019d once put it.    I knew that the scent of my blood \u2014 so much sweeter to him than any other person\u2019s blood, truly like wine beside water to an alcoholic \u2014 caused him actual pain from the burning thirst it engendered. But he didn\u2019t seem to shy away from it as much as he once had. I could only dimly imagine the Herculean effort behind this simple gesture.",

            "en": "7 REPETITION        EPILOGUE  TREATY ALMOST EVERYTHING WAS BACK TO NORMAL\u2014THE GOOD, pre-zombie normal\u2014in less time than I would have believed possible. The hospital welcomed Carlisle back with eager arms, not even bothering to conceal their delight that Esme had found life in L.A. so little to her liking. Thanks to the Calculus test I'd missed while abroad, Alice and Edward were in better shape to graduate than I was at the moment. Suddenly, college was a priority (college was still plan B, on the off chance that Edward's offer swayed me from the post-graduation Carlisle option). Many deadlines had passed me by, but Edward had a new stack of applications for me to fill out every day. He'd already done the Harvard route, so it didn't bother him that, thanks to my procrastination, we might both end up at Peninsula Community College next year. Charlie was not happy with me, or speaking to Edward. But at least Edward was allowed\u2014during my designated visiting hours\u2014inside the house again. I just wasn't allowed out of it. School and work were the only exceptions, and the dreary, dull yellow walls of my classrooms had become oddly inviting to me of late. That had a lot to do with the person who sat in the desk beside me. Edward had resumed his schedule from the beginning of the year, which put him in most of my classes again. My behavior had been such last fall, after the Cullens' supposed move to L.A., that the seat beside me had never been filled. Even Mike, always eager to take any advantage, had kept a safe distance. With Edward back in place, it was almost as if the last eight months were just a disturbing nightmare.  Almost, but not quite. There was the house arrest situation, for one thing. And for another, before the fall, I hadn't been best friends with Jacob Black. So, of course, I hadn't missed him then. I wasn't at liberty to go to La Push, and Jacob wasn't coming to see me. He wouldn't even answer my phone calls. I made these calls mostly at night, after Edward had been kicked out\u2014promptly at nine by a grimly gleeful Charlie\u2014and before Edward snuck back through my window when Charlie was asleep. I chose that time to make my fruitless calls because I'd noticed that Edward made a certain face every time I mentioned Jacob's name. Sort of disapproving and wary\u2026 maybe even angry. I guessed that he had some reciprocal prejudice against the werewolves, though he wasn't as vocal as Jacob had been about the \"bloodsuckers.\" So, I didn't mention Jacob much. With Edward near me, it was hard to think about unhappy things\u2014even my former best friend, who was probably very unhappy right now, due to me. When I did think of Jake, I always felt guilty for not thinking of him more. The fairy tale was back on. Prince returned, bad spell broken. I wasn't sure exactly what to do about the leftover, unresolved character. Where was his happily ever after? Weeks passed, and Jacob still wouldn't answer my calls. It started to become a constant worry. Like a dripping faucet in the back of my head that I couldn't shut off or ignore. Drip, drip, drip. Jacob, Jacob, Jacob. So, though I didn't mention Jacob much, sometimes my frustration and anxiety boiled over. \"It's just plain rude!\" I vented one Saturday afternoon when Edward picked me up from work. Being angry about things was easier than feeling guilty. \"Downright insulting!\" I'd varied my pattern, in hopes of a different response. I'd called Jake from work this time, only to get an unhelpful Billy. Again. \"Billy said he didn't want to talk to me,\" I fumed, glaring at the rain oozing down the passenger window. \"That he was there, and wouldn't walk three steps to get to the phone! Usually Billy just says he's out or busy or sleeping or something. I mean, it's not like I didn't know he was lying to me, but at least it was a polite way to handle it. I guess Billy hates me now, too. It's not fair!\" \"It's not you, Bella,\" Edward said quietly. \"Nobody hates you.\" \"Feels that way,\" I muttered, folding my arms across my chest. It was no more than a stubborn gesture. There was no hole there now\u2014I could barely remember the empty feeling anymore. \"Jacob knows we're back, and I'm sure that he's ascertained that I'm with you,\" Edward said. \"He won't come anywhere near me. The enmity is rooted too deeply.\" \"That's stupid. He knows you're not\u2026 like other vampires.\" \"There's still good reason to keep a safe distance.\" I glared blindly out the windshield, seeing only Jacob's face, set in the bitter mask I hated. \"Bella, we are what we are,\" Edward said quietly. \"I can control myself, but I doubt he can. He's very young. It would most likely turn into a fight, and I don't know if I could stop it before I k\u2014\" he broke off, and then quickly continued. \"Before I hurt him. You would be unhappy. I don't want that to happen.\" I remembered what Jacob had said in the kitchen, hearing the words with perfect recall in his husky voice. I'm not sure that I'm even-tempered enough to handle that\u2026 You probably wouldn't like it so much if I killed your friend. But he'd been able to handle it, that time\u2026 \"Edward Cullen,\" I whispered. \"Were you about to say 'killed him? Were you?\" He looked away from me, staring into the rain. In front of us, the red light I hadn't noticed turned green and he started forward again, driving very slowly. Not his usual way of driving. \"I would try\u2026 very hard\u2026 not to do that,\" Edward finally said. I stared at him with my mouth hanging open, but he continued to look straight ahead. We were paused at the corner stop sign. Abruptly, I remembered what had happened to Paris when Romeo came back. The stage directions were simple: They fight. Paris falls. But that was ridiculous. Impossible. \"Well,\" I said, and took a deep breath, shaking my head to dispel the words in my head. \"Nothing like that is ever going to happen, so there's no reason to worry about it. And you know Charlie's staring at the clock right now. You'd better get me home before I get in more trouble for being late.\" I turned my face up toward him, to smile halfheartedly. Every time I looked at his face, that impossibly perfect face, my heart pounded strong and healthy and very there in my chest. This time, the pounding raced ahead of its usual besotted pace. I recognized the expression on his statue-still face. \"You're already in more trouble, Bella,\" he whispered through unmoving lips. I slid closer, clutching his arm as I followed his gaze to see what he was seeing. I don't know what I expected\u2014maybe Victoria standing in the middle of the street, her flaming red hair blowing in the wind, or a line of tall black cloaks\u2026 or a pack of angry \u00a0werewolves. But I didn't see anything at all. \"What? What is it?\" He took a deep breath. \"Charlie\u2026\" \"My dad?\" I screeched. He looked down at me then, and his expression was calm enough to ease some of my panic. \"Charlie\u2026 is probably not going to kill you, but he's thinking about it,\" he told me. He started to drive forward again, down my street, but he passed the house and parked by the edge of the trees. \"What did I do?\" I gasped. Edward glanced back at Charlie's house. I followed his gaze, and noticed for the first time what was parked in the driveway next to the cruiser. Shiny, bright red, impossible to miss. My motorcycle, flaunting itself in the driveway. Edward had said that Charlie was ready to kill me, so he must know that\u2014that it was mine. There was only one person who could be behind this treachery. \"No!\" I gasped. \"Why? Why would Jacob do this to me?\" The sting of betrayal washed through me. I had trusted Jacob implicitly\u2014trusted him with every single secret I had. He was supposed to be my safe harbor\u2014the person I could always rely on. Of course things were strained right now, but I didn't think any of the underlying foundation had changed. I didn't think that was changeable! What had I done to deserve this? Charlie was going to be so mad\u2014and worse than that, he was going to be hurt and worried. Didn't he have enough to deal with already? I would have never imagined that Jake could be so petty and just plain mean. Tears sprang, smarting, into my eyes, but they were not tears of sadness. I had been betrayed. I was suddenly so angry that my head throbbed like it was going to explode. \"Is he still here?\" I hissed. \"Yes. He's waiting for us there.\" Edward told me, nodding toward the slender path that divided the dark fringe of the forest in two. I jumped out of the car, launching myself toward the trees with my hands already balled into fists for the first punch. Why did Edward have to be so much faster than me? He caught me around the waist before I made the path. \"Let me go! I'm going to murder him! Traitor!\" I shouted the epithet toward the trees. \"Charlie will hear you,\" Edward warned me. \"And once he gets you inside, he may brick over the doorway.\" I glanced back at the house instinctively, and it seemed like the glossy red bike was all I could see. I was seeing red. My head throbbed again. \"Just give me one round with Jacob, and then I'll deal with Charlie.\" I struggled futilely to break free.  \"Jacob Black wants to see me. That's why he's still here.\" That stopped me cold\u2014took the fight right out of me. My hands went limp. They fight; Paris falls. I was furious, but not that furious. \"Talk?\" I asked. \"More or less.\" \"How much more?\" My voice shook. Edward smoothed my hair back from my face. \"Don't worry, he's not here to fight me. He's acting as\u2026 spokesperson for the pack.\" \"Oh.\" Edward looked at the house again, then tightened his arm around my waist and pulled me toward the woods. \"We should hurry. Charlie's getting impatient.\" We didn't have to go far; Jacob waited just a short ways up the path. He lounged against a mossy tree trunk as he waited, his face hard and bitter, exactly the way I knew it would be. He looked at me, and then at Edward. Jacob's mouth stretched into a humorless sneer, and he shrugged away from the tree. He stood on the balls of his bare feet, leaning slightly forward, with his trembling hands clenched into fists. He looked bigger than the last time I'd seen him. Somehow, impossibly, he was still growing. He would tower over Edward, if they stood next to each other. But Edward stopped as soon as we saw him, leaving a wide space between us and Jacob. Edward turned his body, shifting me so that I was behind him. I leaned around him to stare at Jacob\u2014to accuse him with my eyes. I would have thought that seeing his resentful, cynical expression would only make me angrier. Instead, it reminded me of the last time I'd seen him, with tears in his eyes. My fury weakened, faltered, as I stared at Jacob. It had been so long since I'd seen him\u2014I hated that our reunion had to be like this. \"Bella,\" Jacob said as a greeting, nodding once toward me without looking away from Edward.  \"Why?\" I whispered, trying to hide the sound of the lump in my throat. \"How could you do this to me, Jacob?\" The sneer vanished, but his face stayed hard and rigid. \"It's for the best.\" \"What is that supposed to mean? Do you want Charlie to strangle me? Or did you want him to have a heart attack, like Harry? No matter how mad you are at me, how could you do this to him?\" Jacob winced, and his eyebrows pulled together, but he didn't answer. \"He didn't want to hurt anyone\u2014he just wanted to get you grounded, so that you wouldn't be allowed to spend time with me,\" Edward murmured, explaining the thoughts Jacob wouldn't say. Jacob's eyes sparked with hate as he glowered at Edward again. \"Aw, Jake!\" I groaned. \"I'm already grounded! Why do you think I haven't been down to La Push to kick your butt for avoiding my phone calls?\" Jacob's eyes flashed back to me, confused for the first time. \"That's why?\" he asked, and then locked his jaw, like he was sorry he'd said anything. \"He thought I wouldn't let you, not Charlie,\" Edward explained again. \"Stop that,\" Jacob snapped. Edward didn't answer. Jacob shuddered once, and then gritted his teeth as hard as his fists. \"Bella wasn't exaggerating about your\u2026 abilities,\" he said through his teeth. \"So you must already know why I'm here.\" \"Yes,\" Edward agreed in a soft voice. \"But, before you begin, I need to say something.\" Jacob waited, clenching and unclenching his hands as he tried to control the shivers rolling down his arms. \"Thank you,\" Edward said, and his voice throbbed with the depth of his sincerity. \"I will never be able to tell you how grateful I am. I will owe you for the rest of my\u2026 existence.\" Jacob stared at him blankly, his shudders stilled by surprise. He exchanged a quick glance with me, but my face was just as <em>mystified</em>. \"For keeping Bella alive,\" Edward clarified, his voice rough and fervent. \"When I\u2026 didn't.\" \"Edward\u2014,\" I started to say, but he held one hand up, his eyes on Jacob. Understanding washed over Jacob's face before the hard mask returned. \"I didn't do it for your benefit.\" \"I know. But that doesn't erase the gratitude I feel. I thought you should know. If there's ever anything in my power to do for you\u2026\" Jacob raised one black brow. Edward shook his head. \"That's not in my power.\" \"Whose, then?\" Jacob growled. Edward looked down at me. \"Hers. I'm a quick learner, Jacob Black, and I don't make the same mistake twice. I'm here until she orders me away.\" I was immersed momentarily in his golden gaze. It wasn't hard to understand what I'd missed in the conversation. The only thing that Jacob would want from Edward would be his absence. \"Never,\" I whispered, still locked in Edward's eyes. Jacob made a gagging sound. I unwillingly broke free from Edward's gaze to frown at Jacob. \"Was there something else you needed, Jacob? You wanted me in trouble\u2014mission accomplished. Charlie might just send me to military school. But that won't keep me away from Edward. There's nothing that can do that. What more do you want?\" Jacob kept his eyes on Edward \"I just needed to remind your bloodsucking friends of a few key points in the treaty they agreed to. The treaty chat is the only thing stopping me from ripping his throat out right this minute.\" \"We haven't forgotten,\" Edward said at the same time that I demanded, \"What key points?\" Jacob still glowered at Edward, but he answered me. \"The treaty is quite specific. If any of them bite a human, the truce is over. Bite, not kill,\" he emphasized. Finally, he looked at me. His eyes were cold. It only took me a second to grasp the distinction, and then my face was as cold as his. \"That's none of your business.\" \"The hell it\u2014\" was all he managed to choke out. I didn't expect my hasty words to bring on such a strong response. Despite the warning he'd come to give, he must not have known. He must have thought the warning was just a precaution. He hadn't realized\u2014or didn't want to believe\u2014that I had already made my choice. That I was really intending to become a member of the Cullen family. My answer sent Jacob into near convulsions. He pressed his fists hard against his temples, closing his eyes tight and curling in on himself as he tried to control the spasms. His face turned sallow green under the russet skin. \"Jake? You okay?\" I asked anxiously. I took a half-step toward him, then Edward caught me and yanked me back behind his own body. \"Careful! He's not under control,\" he warned me. But Jacob was already somewhat himself again; only his arms were shaking now. He scowled at Edward with pure hate. \"Ugh. I would never hurt her.\" Neither Edward or I missed the inflection, or the accusation it contained. A low hiss escaped Edward's lips. Jacob clenched his fists reflexively. \"BELLA!\" Charlie's roar echoed from the direction of the house. \"YOU GET IN THIS HOUSE THIS INSTANT!\" All of us froze, listening to the silence that followed. I was the first to speak; my voice trembled. \"Crap.\" Jacob's furious expression faltered. \"I am sorry about that,\" he muttered. \"I had to do what I could\u2014I had to try\u2026\" \"Thanks.\" The tremor in my voice ruined the sarcasm. I stared up the path, half-expecting Charlie to come barreling through the wet ferns like an enraged bull. I would be the red flag in that scenario. \"Just one more thing,\" Edward said to me, and then he looked at Jacob. \"We've found no trace of Victoria on our side of the line\u2014have you?\" He knew the answer as soon as Jacob thought it, but Jacob spoke the answer anyway. \"The last time was while Bella was\u2026 away. We let her think she was slipping through\u2014we were tightening the circle, getting ready to ambush her\u2014\" Ice shot down my spine. \"But then she took off like a bat out of hell. Near as we can tell, she caught your little female's scent and bailed. She hasn't come near our lands since.\" Edward nodded. \"When she comes back, she's not your problem anymore. We'll\u2014\" \"She killed on our turf,\" Jacob hissed. \"She's ours!\" \"No\u2014,\" I began to protest both declarations. \"BELLA! I SEE HIS CAR AND I KNOW YOU'RE OUT THERE! IF YOU AREN'T INSIDE THIS HOUSE IN ONE MINUTE\u2026 !\" Charlie didn't bother to finish his threat. \"Let's go,\" Edward said. I looked back at Jacob, torn. Would I see him again? \"Sorry,\" he whispered so low that I had to read his lips to understand. '\"Bye, Bells.\" \"You promised,\" I reminded him desperately. \"Still friends, right?\" Jacob shook his head slowly, and the lump in my throat nearly strangled me. \"You know how hard I've tried to keep that promise, but\u2026 I can't see how to keep trying. Not now\u2026\" He struggled to keep his hard mask in place, but it wavered, and then disappeared. \"Miss you,\" he mouthed. One of his hands reached toward me, his fingers outstretched, like he wished they were long enough to cross the distance between us. \"Me, too,\" I choked out. My hand reached toward his across the wide space. Like we were connected, the echo of his pain twisted inside me. His pain, my pain. \"Jake\u2026\" I took a step toward him. I wanted to wrap my arms around his waist and erase the expression of misery on his face.  Edward pulled me back again, his arms restraining instead of defending. \"It's okay,\" I promised him, looking up to read his face with trust in my eyes. He would understand. His eyes were unreadable, his face expressionless. Cold. \"No, it's not.\" \"Let her go,\" Jacob snarled, furious again. \"She wants to!\" He took two long strides forward. A glint of anticipation flashed in his eyes. His chest seemed to swell as it shuddered. Edward pushed me behind himself, wheeling to face Jacob. \"No! Edward\u2014!\" \"ISABELLA SWAN!\" \"Come on! Charlie's mad!\" My voice was panicked, but not because of Charlie now. \"Hurry!\" I tugged on him and he relaxed a little. He pulled me back slowly, always keeping his eyes on Jacob as we retreated. Jacob watched us with a dark scowl on his bitter face. The anticipation drained from his eyes, and then, just before the forest came between us, his face suddenly crumpled in pain. I knew that last glimpse of his face would haunt me until I saw him smile again. And right there I vowed that I would see him smile, and soon. I would find a way to keep my friend. Edward kept his arm tight around my waist, holding me close. That was the only thing that held the tears inside my eyes. I had some serious problems. My best friend counted me with his enemies. Victoria was still on the loose, putting everyone I loved in danger. If I didn't become a vampire soon, the Volturi would kill me. And now it seemed that if I did, the Quileute werewolves would try to do the job \u00a0themselves\u2014along with trying to kill my future family. I didn't think they had any chance really, but would my best friend get himself killed in the attempt? Very serious problems. So why did they all suddenly seem insignificant when we broke through the last of the trees and I caught sight of the expression on Charlie's purple face? Edward squeezed me gently. \"I'm here.\" I drew in a deep breath. That was true. Edward was here, with his arms around me. I could face anything as long as that was true. I squared my shoulders and walked forward to meet my fate, with my destiny solidly at my side.",

            "en": "4         4. INVITATIONS In my dream it was very dark, and what dim light there was seemed to be radiating from Edward's skin. I couldn't see his face, just his back as he walked away from me, leaving me in the blackness. No matter how fast I ran, I couldn't catch up to him; no matter how loud I called, he never turned. Troubled, I woke in the middle of the night and couldn't sleep again for what seemed like a very long time. After that, he was in my dreams nearly every night, but always on the periphery, never within reach. The month that followed the accident was uneasy, tense, and, at first, embarrassing. To my dismay, I found myself the center of attention for the rest of that week. Tyler Crowley was impossible, following me around, obsessed with making amends to me somehow. I tried to convince him what I wanted more than anything else was for him to forget all about it \u2014 especially since nothing had actually happened to me \u2014 but he remained insistent. He followed me between classes and sat at our now-crowded lunch table. Mike and Eric were even less friendly toward him than they were to each other, which made me worry that I'd gained another unwelcome fan. No one seemed concerned about Edward, though I explained over and over that he was the hero \u2014 how he had pulled me out of the way and had nearly been crushed, too. I tried to be convincing. Jessica, Mike, Eric, and everyone else always commented that they hadn't even seen him there till the van was pulled away. I wondered to myself why no one else had seen him standing so far away, before he was suddenly, impossibly saving my life. With chagrin, I realized the probable cause \u2014 no one else was as aware of Edward as I always was. No one else watched him the way I did. How pitiful. Edward was never surrounded by crowds of curious bystanders eager for his firsthand account. People avoided him as usual. The Cullens and the Hales sat at the same table as always, not eating, talking only among themselves. None of them, especially Edward, glanced my way anymore.  When he sat next to me in class, as far from me as the table would allow, he seemed totally unaware of my presence. Only now and then, when his fists would suddenly ball up \u2014 skin stretched even whiter over the bones \u2014 did I wonder if he wasn't quite as oblivious as he appeared.  He wished he hadn't pulled me from the path of Tyler's van \u2014 there was no other conclusion I could come to. I wanted very much to talk to him, and the day after the accident I tried. The last time I'd seen him, outside the ER, we'd both been so furious. I still was angry that he wouldn't trust me with the truth, even though I was keeping my part of the bargain flawlessly. But he had in fact saved my life, no matter how he'd done it. And, overnight, the heat of my anger faded into awed gratitude. He was already seated when I got to Biology, looking straight ahead. I sat down, expecting him to turn toward me. He showed no sign that he realized I was there. \"Hello, Edward,\" I said pleasantly, to show him I was going to behave myself. He turned his head a fraction toward me without meeting my gaze, nodded once, and then looked the other way. And that was the last contact I'd had with him, though he was there, a foot away from me, every day. I watched him sometimes, unable to stop myself\u2014 from a distance, though, in the cafeteria or parking lot. I\u00a0 watched as his golden eyes grew perceptibly darker day by day. But in class I gave no more notice that he existed than he showed toward me. I was miserable. And the dreams continued. Despite my outright lies, the tenor of my e-mails alerted Ren\u00e9e to my depression, and she called a few times, worried. I tried to convince her it was just the weather that had me down. Mike, at least, was pleased by the obvious coolness between me and my lab partner. I could see he'd been worried that Edward's daring rescue might have impressed me, and he was relieved that it seemed to have the opposite effect. He grew more confident, sitting on the edge of my table to talk before Biology class started, ignoring Edward as completely as he ignored us. The snow washed away for good after that one dangerously icy day. Mike was disappointed he'd never gotten to stage his snowball fight, but pleased that the beach trip would soon be possible. The rain continued heavily, though, and the weeks passed. Jessica made me aware of another event looming on the horizon \u2014 she called the first Tuesday of March to ask my permission to invite Mike to the girls' choice spring dance in two weeks. \"Are you sure you don't mind\u2026 you weren't planning to ask him?\" she persisted when I told her I didn't mind in the least. \"No, Jess, I'm not going,\" I assured her. Dancing was glaringly outside my range of abilities. \"It will be really fun.\" Her attempt to convince me was halfhearted. I suspected that Jessica enjoyed my inexplicable popularity more than my actual company. \"You have fun with Mike,\" I encouraged. The next day, I was surprised that Jessica wasn't her usual gushing self in Trig and Spanish. She was silent as she walked by my side between classes, and I was afraid to ask her why. If Mike had turned her down, I was the last person she would want to tell. My fears were strengthened during lunch when Jessica sat as far from Mike as possible, chatting animatedly with Eric. Mike was unusually quiet.  Mike was still quiet as he walked me to class, the uncomfortable look on his face a bad sign. But he didn't broach the subject until I was in my seat and he was perched on my desk. As always, I was electrically aware of Edward sitting close enough to touch, as distant as if he were merely an invention of my imagination. \"So,\" Mike said, looking at the floor, \"Jessica asked me to the spring dance.\" \"That's great.\" I made my voice bright and enthusiastic. \"You'll have a lot of fun with Jessica.\" \"Well\u2026\" He floundered as he examined my smile, clearly not happy with my response. \"I told her I had to think about it.\" \"Why would you do that?\" I let disapproval color my tone, though I was relieved he hadn't given her an absolute no. His face was bright red as he looked down again. Pity shook my resolve. \"I was wondering if\u2026 well, if you might be planning to ask me.\" I paused for a moment, hating the wave of guilt that swept through me. But I saw, from the corner of my eye, Edward's head tilt reflexively in my direction. \"Mike, I think you should tell her yes,\" I said.  \"Did you already ask someone?\" Did Edward notice how Mike's eyes flickered in his direction? \"No,\" I assured him. \"I'm not going to the dance at all.\" \"Why not?\" Mike demanded. I didn't want to get into the safety hazards that dancing presented, so I quickly made new plans. \"I'm going to Seattle that Saturday,\" I explained. I needed to get out of town anyway \u2014 it was suddenly the perfect time to go. \"Can't you go some other weekend?\" \"Sorry, no,\" I said. \"So you shouldn't make Jess wait any longer \u2014 it's rude.\" \"Yeah, you're right,\" he mumbled, and turned, dejected, to walk back to his seat. I closed my eyes and pressed my fingers to my temples, trying to push the guilt and sympathy out of my head. Mr. Banner began talking.  I sighed and opened my eyes. And Edward was staring at me curiously, that same, familiar edge of frustration even more distinct now in his black eyes. I stared back, surprised, expecting him to look quickly away. But instead he continued to gaze with probing intensity into my eyes. There was no question of me looking away. My hands started to shake. \"Mr. Cullen?\" the teacher called, seeking the answer to a question that I hadn't heard. \"The Krebs Cycle,\" Edward answered, seeming reluctant as he turned to look at Mr. Banner. I looked down at my book as soon as his eyes released me, trying to find my place. Cowardly as ever, I shifted my hair over my right shoulder to hide my face. I couldn't believe the rush of emotion pulsing through me \u2014 just because he'd happened to look at me for the first time in a half-dozen weeks. I couldn't allow him to have this level of influence over me. It was pathetic. More than pathetic, it was unhealthy. I tried very hard not to be aware of him for the rest of the hour, and, since that was impossible, at least not to let him know that I was aware of him. When the bell rang at last, I turned my back to him to gather my things, expecting him to leave immediately as usual. \"Bella?\" His voice shouldn't have been so familiar to me, as if I'd known the sound of it all my life rather than for just a few short weeks. I turned slowly, unwillingly. I didn't want to feel what I knew I would feel when I looked at his too-perfect face. My expression was wary when I finally turned to him; his expression was unreadable. He didn't say anything. \"What? Are you speaking to me again?\" I finally asked, an unintentional note of petulance in my voice. His lips twitched, fighting a smile. \"No, not really,\" he admitted. I closed my eyes and inhaled slowly through my nose, aware that I was gritting my teeth. He waited. \"Then what do you want, Edward?\" I asked, keeping my eyes closed; it was easier to talk to him coherently that way. \"I'm sorry.\" He sounded sincere. \"I'm being very rude, I know. But it's better this way, really.\" I opened my eyes. His face was very serious. \"I don't know what you mean,\" I said, my voice guarded. \"It's better if we're not friends,\" he explained. \"Trust me.\" My eyes narrowed. I'd heard that before. \"It's too bad you didn't figure that out earlier,\" I hissed through my teeth. \"You could have saved yourself all this regret.\" \"Regret?\" The word, and my tone, obviously caught him off guard. \"Regret for what?\" \"For not just letting that stupid van squish me.\" He was astonished. He stared at me in disbelief. When he finally spoke, he almost sounded mad. \"You think I regret saving your life?\" \"I know you do,\" I snapped. \"You don't know anything.\" He was definitely mad. I turned my head sharply away from him, clenching my jaw against all the wild accusations I wanted to hurl at him. I gathered my books together, then stood and walked to the door. I meant to sweep dramatically out of the room, but of course I caught the toe of my boot on the door jamb and dropped my books. I stood there for a moment, thinking about leaving them. Then I sighed and bent to pick them up. He was there; he'd already stacked them into a pile. He handed them to me, his face hard. \"Thank you,\" I said icily. His eyes narrowed. \"You're welcome,\" he retorted. I straightened up swiftly, turned away from him again, and stalked off to Gym without looking back. Gym was brutal. We'd moved on to basketball. My team never passed me the ball, so that was good, but I fell down a lot. Sometimes I took people with me. Today I was worse than usual because my head was so filled with Edward. I tried to concentrate on my feet, but he kept creeping back into my thoughts just when I really needed my balance. It was a relief, as always, to leave. I almost ran to the truck; there were just so many people I wanted to avoid. The truck had suffered only minimal damage in the accident. I'd had to replace the taillights, and if I'd had a real paint job, I would have touched that up. Tyler's parents had to sell their van for parts. I almost had a stroke when I rounded the corner and saw a tall, dark figure leaning against the side of my truck. Then I realized it was just Eric. I started walking again. \"Hey, Eric,\" I called. \"Hi, Bella.\" \"What's up?\" I said as I was unlocking the door. I wasn't paying attention to the uncomfortable edge in his voice, so his next words took me by surprise. \"Uh, I was just wondering\u2026 if you would go to the spring dance with me?\" His voice broke on the last word. \"I thought it was girls' choice,\" I said, too startled to be diplomatic. \"Well, yeah,\" he admitted, shamefaced. I recovered my composure and tried to make my smile warm. \"Thank you for asking me, but I'm going to be in Seattle that day.\" \"Oh,\" he said. \"Well, maybe next time.\" \"Sure,\" I agreed, and then bit my lip. I wouldn't want him to take that too literally. He slouched off, back toward the school. I heard a low chuckle. Edward was walking past the front of my truck, looking straight forward, his lips pressed together. I yanked the door open and jumped inside, slamming it loudly behind me. I revved the engine deafeningly and reversed out into the aisle. Edward was in his car already, two spaces down, sliding out smoothly in front of me, cutting me off. He stopped there \u2014 to wait for his family; I could see the four of them walking this way, but still by the cafeteria. I considered taking out the rear of his shiny Volvo, but there were too many witnesses. I looked in my rearview mirror. A line was beginning to form. Directly behind me, Tyler Crowley was in his recently acquired used Sentra, waving.  I was too aggravated to acknowledge him. While I was sitting there, looking everywhere but at the car in front of me, I heard a knock on my passenger side window. I looked over; it was Tyler. I glanced back in my rearview mirror, confused. His car was still running, the door left open. I leaned across the cab to crank the window down. It was stiff. I got it halfway down, then gave up. \"I'm sorry, Tyler, I'm stuck behind Cullen.\" I was annoyed \u2014 obviously the holdup wasn't my fault. \"Oh, I know \u2014 I just wanted to ask you something while we're trapped here.\" He grinned. This could not be happening. \"Will you ask me to the spring dance?\" he continued. \"I'm not going to be in town, Tyler.\" My voice sounded a little sharp. I had to remember it wasn't his fault that Mike and Eric had already used up my quota of patience for the day. \"Yeah, Mike said that,\" he admitted. \"Then why \u2014\" He shrugged. \"I was hoping you were just letting him down easy.\" Okay, it was completely his fault. \"Sorry, Tyler,\" I said, working to hide my irritation. \"I really am going out of town.\" \"That's cool. We still have prom.\" And before I could respond, he was walking back to his car. I could feel the shock on my face. I looked forward to see Alice, Rosalie, Emmett, and Jasper all sliding into the Volvo. In his rearview mirror, Edward's eyes were on me. He was unquestionably shaking with laughter, as if he'd heard every word Tyler had said. My foot itched toward the gas pedal\u2026 one little bump wouldn't hurt any of them, just that glossy silver paint job. I revved the engine. But they were all in, and Edward was speeding away. I drove home slowly, carefully, muttering to myself the whole way. When I got home, I decided to make chicken enchiladas for dinner. It was a long process, and it would keep me busy. While I was simmering the onions and chilies, the phone rang. I was almost afraid to answer it, but it might be Charlie or my mom. It was Jessica, and she was jubilant; Mike had caught her after school to accept her invitation. I celebrated with her briefly while I stirred. She had to go, she wanted to call Angela and Lauren to tell them. I suggested \u2014 with casual innocence \u2014 that maybe Angela, the shy girl who had Biology with me, could ask Eric. And Lauren, a \u00a0standoffish girl who had always ignored me at the lunch table, could ask Tyler; I'd heard he was still available. Jess thought that was a great idea. Now that she was sure of Mike, she actually sounded sincere when she said she wished I would go to the dance. I gave her my Seattle excuse. After I hung up, I tried to concentrate on dinner \u2014 dicing the chicken especially; I didn't want to take another trip to the emergency room. But my head was spinning, trying to analyze every word Edward had spoken today. What did he mean, it was better if we weren't friends?  My stomach twisted as I realized what he must have meant. He must see how absorbed I was by him; he must not want to lead me on\u2026 so we couldn't even be friends\u2026 because he wasn't interested in me at all. Of course he wasn't interested in me, I thought angrily, my eyes stinging \u2014 a delayed reaction to the onions. I wasn't interesting. And he was. Interesting\u2026 and brilliant\u2026 and mysterious\u2026 and perfect\u2026 and beautiful\u2026 and possibly able to lift full-sized vans with one hand. Well, that was fine. I could leave him alone. I would leave him alone. I would get through my self-imposed sentence here in purgatory, and then hopefully some school in the Southwest, or possibly Hawaii, would offer me a scholarship. I focused my thoughts on sunny beaches and palm trees as I finished the enchiladas and put them in the oven. Charlie seemed suspicious when he came home and smelled the green peppers. I couldn't blame him \u2014 the closest edible Mexican food was probably in southern California. But he was a cop, even if just a small-town cop, so he was brave enough to take the first bite. He seemed to like it. It was fun to watch as he slowly began trusting me in the kitchen. \"Dad?\" I asked when he was almost done. \"Yeah, Bella?\" \"Um, I just wanted to let you know that I'm going to Seattle for the day a week from Saturday\u2026 if that's okay?\" I didn't want to ask permission \u2014 it set a bad precedent \u2014 but I felt rude, so I tacked it on at the end. \"Why?\" He sounded surprised, as if he were unable to imagine something that Forks couldn't offer. \"Well, I wanted to get few books \u2014 the library here is pretty limited \u2014 and maybe look at some clothes.\" I had more money than I was used to having, since, thanks to Charlie, I hadn't had to pay for a car. Not that the truck didn't cost me quite a bit in the gas department. \"That truck probably doesn't get very good gas mileage,\" he said, echoing my thoughts. \"I know, I'll stop in Montesano and Olympia \u2014 and Tacoma if I have to.\" \"Are you going all by yourself?\" he asked, and I couldn't tell if he was suspicious I had a secret boyfriend or just worried about car trouble. \"Yes.\" \"Seattle is a big city \u2014 you could get lost,\" he fretted. \"Dad, Phoenix is five times the size of Seattle \u2014 and I can read a map, don't worry about it.\" \"Do you want me to come with you?\" I tried to be crafty as I hid my horror. \"That's all right, Dad, I'll probably just be in dressing rooms all day \u2014 very boring.\" \"Oh, okay.\" The thought of sitting in women's clothing stores for any period of time immediately put him off. \"Thanks.\" I smiled at him. \"Will you be back in time for the dance?\" Grrr. Only in a town this small would a father know when the high school dances were. \"No \u2014 I don't dance, Dad.\" He, of all people, should understand that \u2014 I didn't get my balance problems from my mother. He did understand. \"Oh, that's right,\" he realized. The next morning, when I pulled into the parking lot, I deliberately parked as far as possible from the silver Volvo. I didn't want to put myself in the path of too much temptation and end up owing him a new car. Getting out of the cab, I fumbled with my key and it fell into a puddle at my feet. As I bent to get it, a white hand flashed out and grabbed it before I could. I jerked upright. Edward Cullen was right next to me, leaning casually against my truck. \"How do you do that?\" I asked in amazed irritation. \"Do what?\" He held my key out as he spoke. As I reached for it, he dropped it into my palm. \"Appear out of thin air.\" \"Bella, it's not my fault if you are exceptionally unobservant.\" His voice was quiet as usual \u2014 velvet, muted. I scowled at his perfect face. His eyes were light again today, a deep, golden honey color. Then I had to look down, to reassemble my now-tangled thoughts. \"Why the traffic jam last night?\" I demanded, still looking away. \"I thought you were supposed to be pretending I don't exist, not irritating me to death.\" \"That was for Tyler's sake, not mine. I had to give him his chance.\" He snickered. \"You\u2026\" I gasped. I couldn't think of a bad enough word. It felt like the heat of my anger should physically burn him, but he only seemed more amused. \"And I'm not pretending you don't exist,\" he continued. \"So you are trying to irritate me to death? Since Tyler's van didn't do the job?\" Anger flashed in his tawny eyes. His lips pressed into a hard line, all signs of humor gone. \"Bella, you are utterly absurd,\" he said, his low voice cold. My palms tingled \u2014 I wanted so badly to hit something. I was surprised at myself. I was usually a nonviolent person. I turned my back and started to walk away. \"Wait,\" he called. I kept walking, sloshing angrily through the rain. But he was next to me, easily keeping pace. \"I'm sorry, that was rude,\" he said as we walked. I ignored him. \"I'm not saying it isn't true,\" he continued, \"but it was rude to say it, anyway.\" \"Why won't you leave me alone?\" I grumbled. \"I wanted to ask you something, but you sidetracked me,\" he chuckled. He seemed to have recovered his good humor. \"Do you have a multiple personality disorder?\" I asked severely. \"You're doing it again.\" I sighed. \"Fine then. What do you want to ask?\" \"I was wondering if, a week from Saturday \u2014 you know, the day of the spring dance \u2014\" \"Are you trying to be funny?\" I interrupted him, wheeling toward him. My face got drenched as I looked up at his expression. His eyes were wickedly amused. \"Will you please allow me to finish?\" I bit my lip and clasped my hands together, interlocking my fingers, so I couldn't do anything rash. \"I heard you say you were going to Seattle that day, and I was wondering if you wanted a ride.\" That was unexpected. \"What?\" I wasn't sure what he was getting at. \"Do you want a ride to Seattle?\" \"With who?\" I asked, <em>mystified</em>. \"Myself, obviously.\" He enunciated every syllable, as if he were talking to someone mentally handicapped. I was still stunned. \"Why?\" \"Well, I was planning to go to Seattle in the next few weeks, and, to be honest, I'm not sure if your truck can make it.\" \"My truck works just fine, thank you very much for your concern.\" I started to walk again, but I was too surprised to maintain the same level of anger. \"But can your truck make it there on one tank of gas?\" He matched my pace again. \"I don't see how that is any of your business.\" Stupid, shiny Volvo owner. \"The wasting of finite resources is everyone's business.\" \"Honestly, Edward.\" I felt a thrill go through me as I said his name, and I hated it. \"I can't keep up with you. I thought you didn't want to be my friend.\" \"I said it would be better if we weren't friends, not that I didn't want to be.\" \"Oh, thanks, now that's all cleared up.\" Heavy sarcasm. I realized I had stopped walking again. We were under the shelter of the cafeteria roof now, so I could more easily look at his face. Which certainly didn't help my clarity of thought. \"It would be more\u2026 prudent for you not to be my friend,\" he explained.  \"But I'm tired of trying to stay away from you, Bella.\" His eyes were gloriously intense as he uttered that last sentence, his voice smoldering. I couldn't remember how to breathe. \"Will you go with me to Seattle?\" he asked, still intense. I couldn't speak yet, so I just nodded. He smiled briefly, and then his face became serious. \"You really should stay away from me,\" he warned. \"I'll see you in class.\" He turned abruptly and walked back the way we'd come.",

            "en": "2      2. EVASION I felt oddly buoyant as I walked from Spanish toward the cafeteria, and it wasn\u2019t just because I was holding hands with the most perfect person on the planet, though that was certainly part of it. Maybe it was the knowledge that my sentence was served and I was a free woman again. Or maybe it wasn\u2019t anything to do with me specifically. Maybe it was the atmosphere of freedom that hung over the entire campus. School was winding down, and, for the senior class especially, there was a perceptible thrill in the air. Freedom was so close it was touchable, taste-able. Signs of it were everywhere. Posters crowded together on the cafeteria walls, and the trashcans wore a colorful skirt of spilled-over fliers: reminders to buy yearbooks, class rings, and announcements; deadlines to order graduation gowns, hats, and tassels; neon-bright sales pitches \u2014 the juniors campaigning for class office; ominous, rose-wreathed advertisements for this year\u2019s prom.  The big dance was this coming weekend, but I had an ironclad promise from Edward that I would not be subjected to that again. After all, I\u2019d already had that human experience. No, it must be my personal freedom that lightened me today. The ending of the school year did not give me the pleasure it seemed to give the other students. Actually, I felt nervous to the point of nausea whenever I thought of it. I tried to not think of it. But it was hard to escape such an omnipresent topic as graduation. \u201cHave you sent your announcements, yet?\u201d Angela asked when Edward and I sat down at our table. She had her light brown hair pulled back into a sloppy ponytail instead of her usual smooth hairdo, and there was a slightly frantic look about her eyes. Alice and Ben were already there, too, on either side of Angela. Ben was intent over a comic book, his glasses sliding down his narrow nose.  Alice was scrutinizing my boring jeans-and-a-t-shirt outfit in a way that made me self-conscious. Probably plotting another makeover. I sighed. My indifferent attitude to fashion was a constant thorn in her side. If I\u2019d allow it, she\u2019d love to dress me every day \u2014 perhaps several times a day \u2014 like some oversized three-dimensional paper doll. \u00a0\u201cNo,\u201d I answered Angela. \u201cThere\u2019s no point, really. Ren\u00e9e knows when I\u2019m graduating. Who else is there?\u201d \u201cHow about you, Alice?\u201d Alice smiled. \u201cAll done.\u201d \u201cLucky you.\u201d Angela sighed. \u201cMy mother has a thousand cousins and she expects me to hand-address one to everybody. I\u2019m going to get carpal tunnel. I can\u2019t put it off any longer and I\u2019m just dreading it.\u201d \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll help you,\u201d I volunteered. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind my awful handwriting.\u201d Charlie would like that. From the corner of my eye, I saw Edward smile. He must like that, too \u2014 me fulfilling Charlie\u2019s conditions without involving werewolves. Angela looked relieved. \u201cThat\u2019s so nice of you. I\u2019ll come over any time you want.\u201d \u201cActually, I\u2019d rather go to your house if that\u2019s okay \u2014 I\u2019m sick of mine. Charlie un-grounded me last night.\u201d I grinned as I announced my good news. \u201cReally?\u201d Angela asked, mild excitement lighting her always-gentle brown eyes. \u201cI thought you said you were in for life.\u201d \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m more surprised than you are. I was sure I would at least have finished high school before he set me free.\u201d \u201cWell, this is great, Bella! We\u2019ll have to go out to celebrate.\u201d \u00a0\u201cYou have no idea how good that sounds.\u201d \u201cWhat should we do?\u201d Alice mused, her face lighting up at the possibilities. Alice\u2019s ideas were usually a little grandiose for me, and I could see it in her eyes now \u2014 the tendency to take things too far kicking into action. \u201cWhatever you\u2019re thinking, Alice, I doubt I\u2019m that free.\u201d \u201cFree is free, right?\u201d she insisted. \u201cI\u2019m sure I still have boundaries \u2014 like the continental U.S., for example.\u201d Angela and Ben laughed, but Alice grimaced in real disappointment. \u201cSo what are we doing tonight?\u201d she persisted. \u201cNothing. Look, let\u2019s give it a couple of days to make sure he wasn\u2019t joking. It\u2019s a school night, anyway.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll celebrate this weekend, then.\u201d Alice\u2019s enthusiasm was impossible to repress. \u00a0\u201cSure,\u201d I said, hoping to placate her. I knew I wasn\u2019t going to do anything too outlandish; it would be safer to take it slow with Charlie. Give him a chance to appreciate how trustworthy and mature I was before I asked for any favors. Angela and Alice started talking about options; Ben joined the conversation, setting his comics aside. My attention drifted. I was surprised to find that the subject of my freedom was suddenly not as gratifying as it had been just a moment ago. While they discussed things to do in Port Angeles or maybe Hoquiam, I began to feel disgruntled. It didn\u2019t take long to determine where my restlessness stemmed from. Ever since I\u2019d said goodbye to Jacob Black in the forest outside my home, I\u2019d been plagued by a persistent, uncomfortable intrusion of a specific mental picture. It popped into my thoughts at regular intervals like some annoying alarm clock set to sound every half hour, filling my head with the image of Jacob\u2019s face crumpled in pain. This was the last memory I had of him. As the disturbing vision struck again, I knew exactly why I was dissatisfied with my liberty. Because it was incomplete. Sure, I was free to go to anywhere I wanted \u2014 except La Push; free to do anything I wanted \u2014 except see Jacob. I frowned at the table. There had to be some kind of middle ground. \u201cAlice? Alice!\u201d  Angela\u2019s voice yanked me from my reverie. She was waving her hand back and forth in front of Alice\u2019s blank, staring face. Alice\u2019s expression was something I recognized \u2014 an expression that sent an automatic shock of panic through my body. The vacant look in her eyes told me that she was seeing something very different from the mundane lunchroom scene that surrounded us, but something that was every bit as real in its own way. Something that was coming, something that would happen soon. I felt the blood slither from my face. Then Edward laughed, a very natural, relaxed sound. Angela and Ben looked toward him, but my eyes were locked on Alice. She jumped suddenly, as if someone had kicked her under the table. \u201cIs it naptime already, Alice?\u201d Edward teased. Alice was herself again. \u201cSorry, I was daydreaming, I guess.\u201d \u201cDaydreaming\u2019s better than facing two more hours of school,\u201d Ben said. Alice threw herself back into the conversation with more animation than before \u2014 just a little bit too much. Once I saw her eyes lock with Edward\u2019s, only for a moment, and then she looked back to Angela before anyone else noticed. Edward was quiet, playing absentmindedly with a strand of my hair. I waited anxiously for a chance to ask Edward what Alice had seen in her vision, but the afternoon passed without one minute of alone time. It felt odd to me, almost deliberate. After lunch, Edward slowed his pace to match Ben\u2019s, talking about some assignment I knew he\u2019d already finished. Then there was always someone else there between classes, though we usually had a few minutes to ourselves. When the final bell rang, Edward struck up a conversation with Mike Newton of all people, falling into step beside him as Mike headed for the parking lot. I trailed behind, letting Edward tow me along. I listened, confused, while Mike answered Edward\u2019s unusually friendly queries. It seemed Mike was having car troubles. \u00a0\u201c. . . but I just replaced the battery,\u201d Mike was saying. His eyes darted ahead and then back to Edward warily. <em>Mystified</em>, just like I was. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s the cables?\u201d Edward offered. \u201cMaybe. I really don\u2019t know anything about cars,\u201d Mike admitted. \u201cI need to have someone look at it, but I can\u2019t afford to take it to Dowling\u2019s.\u201d I opened my mouth to suggest my mechanic, and then snapped it shut again. My mechanic was busy these days \u2014 busy running around as a giant wolf. \u201cI know a few things \u2014 I could take a look, if you like,\u201d Edward offered. \u201cJust let me drop Alice and Bella at home.\u201d Mike and I both stared at Edward with our mouths hanging open. \u201cEr . . . thanks,\u201d Mike mumbled when he recovered. \u201cBut I have to get to work. Maybe some other time.\u201d \u00a0\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d \u201cSee ya.\u201d Mike climbed into his car, shaking his head in disbelief. Edward\u2019s Volvo, with Alice already inside, was just two cars away. \u201cWhat was that about ?\u201d I muttered as Edward held the passenger door for me. \u201cJust being helpful,\u201d Edward answered. And then Alice, waiting in the backseat, was babbling at top speed. \u201cYou\u2019re really not that good a mechanic, Edward. Maybe you should have Rosalie take a look at it tonight, just so you look good if Mike decides to let you help, you know. \u00a0\u00a0Not that it wouldn\u2019t be fun to watch his face if Rosalie showed up to help. But since Rosalie is supposed to be across the country attending college, I guess that\u2019s not the best idea. Too bad. Though I suppose, for Mike\u2019s car, you\u2019ll do. It\u2019s only within the finer tunings of a good Italian sports car that you\u2019re out of your depth. And speaking of Italy and sports cars that I stole there, you still owe me a yellow Porsche. I don\u2019t know that I want to wait for Christmas. . . .\u201d I stopped listening after a minute, letting her quick voice become just a hum in the background as I settled into my patient mode. It looked to me like Edward was trying to avoid my questions. Fine. He would have to be alone with me soon enough. It was only a matter of time. Edward seemed to realize that, too. He dropped Alice at the mouth of the Cullens\u2019 drive as usual, though by this point I half expected him to drive her to the door and walk her in. As she got out, Alice threw a sharp look at his face. Edward seemed completely at ease. \u201cSee you later,\u201d he said. And then, ever so slightly, he nodded. Alice turned to disappear into the trees. He was quiet as he turned the car around and headed back to Forks. I waited, wondering if he would bring it up himself. He didn\u2019t, and this made me tense. What had Alice seen today at lunch? Something he didn\u2019t want to tell me, and I tried to think of a reason why he would keep secrets. Maybe it would be better to prepare myself before I asked. I didn\u2019t want to freak out and have him think I couldn\u2019t handle it, whatever it was. So we were both silent until we got to back to Charlie\u2019s house. \u00a0\u201cLight homework load tonight,\u201d he commented. \u201cMmm,\u201d I assented. \u201cDo you suppose I\u2019m allowed inside again?\u201d \u201cCharlie didn\u2019t throw a fit when you picked me up for school.\u201d But I was sure Charlie was going to turn sulky fast when he got home and found Edward here. Maybe I should make something extra-special for dinner. Inside, I headed up the stairs, and Edward followed. He lounged on my bed and gazed out the window, seeming oblivious to my edginess. I stowed my bag and turned the computer on. There was an unanswered e-mail from my mom to attend to, and she got panicky when I took too long. I drummed my fingers as I waited for my decrepit computer to wheeze awake; they snapped against the desk, staccato and anxious. And then his fingers were on mine, holding them still. \u201cAre we a little impatient today?\u201d he murmured. I looked up, intending to make a sarcastic remark, but his face was closer than I\u2019d expected. His golden eyes were smoldering, just inches away, and his breath was cool against my open lips. I could taste his scent on my tongue. I couldn\u2019t remember the witty response I\u2019d been about to make. I couldn\u2019t remember my name. He didn\u2019t give me a chance to recover. If I had my way, I would spend the majority of my time kissing Edward. There wasn\u2019t anything I\u2019d experienced in my life that compared to the feeling of his cool lips, marble hard but always so gentle, moving with mine. I didn\u2019t often get my way. So it surprised me a little when his fingers braided themselves into my hair, securing my face to his. My arms locked behind his neck, and I wished I was stronger \u2014 strong enough to keep him prisoner here. One hand slid down my back, pressing me tighter against his stone chest. Even through his sweater, his skin was cold enough to make me shiver \u2014 it was a shiver of pleasure, of happiness, but his hands began to loosen in response. I knew I had about three seconds before he would sigh and slide me deftly away, saying something about how we\u2019d risked my life enough for one afternoon. Making the most of my last seconds, I crushed myself closer, molding myself to the shape of him. The tip of my tongue traced the curve of his lower lip; it was as flawlessly smooth as if it had been polished, and the taste \u2014 He pulled my face away from his, breaking my hold with ease \u2014 he probably didn\u2019t even realize that I was using all my strength. He chuckled once, a low, throaty sound. His eyes were bright with the excitement he so rigidly disciplined. \u00a0\u201cAh, Bella.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI\u2019d say I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m not.\u201d \u201cAnd I should feel sorry that you\u2019re not sorry, but I don\u2019t. Maybe I should go sit on the bed.\u201d I exhaled a little dizzily. \u201cIf you think that\u2019s necessary. . . .\u201d  He smiled crookedly and disentangled himself. I shook my head a few times, trying to clear it, and turned back to my computer. It was all warmed up and humming now. Well, not as much humming as groaning. \u201cTell Ren\u00e9e I said hello.\u201d \u201cSure thing.\u201d I scanned through Ren\u00e9e\u2019s e-mail, shaking my head now and then at some of the dippier things she\u2019d done. I was just as entertained and horrified as the first time I\u2019d read this. It was so like my mother to forget exactly how paralyzed she was by heights until she was already strapped to a parachute and a dive instructor. I felt a little frustrated with Phil, her husband of almost two years, for allowing that one. I would have taken better care of her. I knew her so much better. You have to let them go their own way eventually, I reminded myself. You have to let them have their own life. . . . I\u2019d spent most of my life taking care of Ren\u00e9e, patiently guiding her away from her craziest plans, good-naturedly enduring the ones I couldn\u2019t talk her out of. I\u2019d always been indulgent with my mom, amused by her, even a little condescending to her. I saw her cornucopia of mistakes and laughed privately to myself. Scatterbrained Ren\u00e9e. I was a very different person from my mother. Someone thoughtful and cautious. The responsible one, the grown-up. That\u2019s how I saw myself. That was the person I knew. With the blood still pounding in my head from Edward\u2019s kiss, I couldn\u2019t help but think of my mother\u2019s most life-altering mistake. Silly and romantic, getting married fresh out of high school to a man she barely knew, then producing me a year later. She\u2019d always promised me that she had no regrets, that I was the best gift her life had ever given her. And yet she\u2019d drilled it into me over and over \u2014 smart people took marriage seriously. Mature people went to college and started careers before they got deeply involved in a relationship. She knew I would never be as thoughtless and goofy and small-town as she\u2019d been. . . . I gritted my teeth and tried to concentrate as I answered her letter. Then I hit her parting line and remembered why I\u2019d neglected to write sooner. You haven\u2019t said anything about Jacob in a long time, she\u2019d written. What\u2019s he up to these days? Charlie was prompting her, I was sure. I sighed and typed quickly, tucking the answer to her question between two less sensitive paragraphs. Jacob is fine, I guess. I don\u2019t see him much; he spends most of his time with a pack of his friends down at La Push these days. Smiling wryly to myself, I added Edward\u2019s greeting and hit \u201csend.\u201d I didn\u2019t realize that Edward was standing silently behind me again until after I\u2019d turned off the computer and shoved away from the desk. I was about to scold him for reading over my shoulder when I realized that he wasn\u2019t paying any attention to me. He was examining a flat black box with wires curling crookedly away from the main square in a way that didn\u2019t look healthy for whatever it was. After a second, I recognized the car stereo Emmett, Rosalie, and Jasper had given me for my last birthday. I\u2019d forgotten about the birthday presents hiding under a growing pile of dust on the floor of my closet. \u00a0\u201cWhat did you do to this?\u201d he asked in a horrorstruck voice. \u201cIt didn\u2019t want to come out of the dashboard.\u201d \u201cSo you felt the need to torture it?\u201d \u201cYou know how I am with tools. No pain was inflicted intentionally.\u201d He shook his head, his face a mask of faux tragedy. \u201cYou killed it.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cOh, well.\u201d \u201cIt would hurt their feelings if they saw this,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess it\u2019s a good thing that you\u2019ve been on house arrest. I\u2019ll have to get another one in place before they notice.\u201d \u201cThanks, but I don\u2019t need a fancy stereo.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not for your sake that I\u2019m going to replace it.\u201d I sighed. \u201cYou didn\u2019t get much good out of your birthday presents last year,\u201d he said in a disgruntled voice. Suddenly, he was fanning himself with a stiff rectangle of paper. I didn\u2019t answer, for fear my voice would shake. My disastrous eighteenth birthday \u2014 with all its far-reaching consequences \u2014 wasn\u2019t something I cared to remember, and I was surprised that he would bring it up. He was even more sensitive about it than I was. \u201cDo you realize these are about to expire?\u201d he asked, holding the paper out to me. It was another present \u2014 the voucher for airplane tickets that Esme and Carlisle had given me so that I could visit Ren\u00e9e in Florida. I took a deep breath and answered in a flat voice. \u201cNo. I\u2019d forgotten all about them, actually.\u201d His expression was carefully bright and positive; there was no trace of any deep emotion as he continued. \u201cWell, we still have a little time. You\u2019ve been liberated . . . and we have no plans this weekend, as you refuse to go to the prom with me.\u201d He grinned. \u201cWhy not celebrate your freedom this way?\u201d I gasped. \u201cBy going to Florida?\u201d \u201cYou did say something about the continental U.S. being allowable.\u201d I glared at him, suspicious, trying to understand where this had come from. \u201cWell?\u201d he demanded. \u201cAre we going to see Ren\u00e9e or not?\u201d \u201cCharlie will never allow it.\u201d \u201cCharlie can\u2019t keep you from visiting your mother. She still has primary custody.\u201d \u201cNobody has custody of me. I\u2019m an adult.\u201d He flashed a brilliant smile. \u201cExactly.\u201d I thought it over for a short minute before deciding that it wasn\u2019t worth the fight. Charlie would be furious \u2014 not that I was going to see Ren\u00e9e, but that Edward was going with me. Charlie wouldn\u2019t speak to me for months, and I\u2019d probably end up grounded again. It was definitely smarter not to even bring it up. Maybe in a few weeks, as a graduation favor or something. But the idea of seeing my mother now , not weeks from now, was hard to resist. It had been so long since I\u2019d seen Ren\u00e9e. And even longer since I\u2019d seen her under pleasant circumstances. The last time I\u2019d been with her in Phoenix, I\u2019d spent the whole time in a hospital bed. The last time she\u2019d come here, I\u2019d been more or less catatonic. Not exactly the best memories to leave her with. And maybe, if she saw how happy I was with Edward, she would tell Charlie to ease up. Edward scrutinized my face while I deliberated. I sighed. \u201cNot this weekend.\u201d \u201cWhy not?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to fight with Charlie. Not so soon after he\u2019s forgiven me.\u201d His eyebrows pulled together. \u201cI think this weekend is perfect,\u201d he muttered. I shook my head. \u201cAnother time.\u201d \u00a0\u201cYou aren\u2019t the only one who\u2019s been trapped in this house, you know.\u201d He frowned at me. Suspicion returned. This kind of behavior was unlike him. He was always so impossibly selfless; I knew it was making me spoiled. \u201cYou can go anywhere you want,\u201d I pointed out. \u201cThe outside world holds no interest for me without you.\u201d I rolled my eyes at the hyperbole. \u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s take the outside world slowly, all right? For example, we could start with a movie in Port Angeles. . . .\u201d He groaned. \u201cNever mind. We\u2019ll talk about it later.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s nothing left to talk about.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cOkay, then, new subject,\u201d I said. I\u2019d almost forgotten my worries about this afternoon \u2014 had that been his intention? \u201cWhat did Alice see today at lunch?\u201d My eyes were fixed on his face as I spoke, measuring his reaction. His expression was composed; there was only the slightest hardening of his topaz eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s been seeing Jasper in a strange place, somewhere in the southwest, she thinks, near his former . . . family. But he has no conscious intentions to go back.\u201d He sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s got her worried.\u201d \u00a0\u201cOh.\u201d That was nothing close to what I\u2019d been expecting. But of course it made sense that Alice would be watching out for Jasper\u2019s future. He was her soul mate, her true other half, though they weren\u2019t as flamboyant about their relationship as Rosalie and Emmett were. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me before?\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t realize you\u2019d noticed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably nothing important, in any case.\u201d My imagination was sadly out of control. I\u2019d taken a perfectly normal afternoon and twisted it until it looked like Edward was going out of his way to keep things from me. I needed therapy. We went downstairs to work on our homework, just in case Charlie showed up early. Edward finished in minutes; I slogged laboriously through my calculus until I decided it was time to fix Charlie\u2019s dinner. Edward helped, making faces every so often at the raw ingredients \u2014 human food was mildly repulsive to him. I made stroganoff from Grandma Swan\u2019s recipe, because I was sucking up. It wasn\u2019t one of my favorites, but it would please Charlie. Charlie seemed to already be in a good mood when he got home. He didn\u2019t even go out of his way to be rude to Edward. Edward excused himself from eating with us, as usual. The sound of the nightly news drifted from the front room, but I doubted Edward was really watching. After forcing down three helpings, Charlie kicked his feet up on the spare chair and folded his hands contentedly across his distended stomach. \u00a0\u201cThat was great, Bells.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m glad you liked it. How was work?\u201d He\u2019d been eating with too much concentration for me to make conversation before. \u201cSort of slow. Well, dead slow really. Mark and I played cards for a good part of the afternoon,\u201d he admitted with a grin. \u201cI won, nineteen hands to seven. And then I was on the phone with Billy for a while.\u201d I tried to keep my expression the same. \u201cHow is he?\u201d \u201cGood, good. His joints are bothering him a little.\u201d \u00a0\u201cOh. That\u2019s too bad.\u201d \u201cYeah. He invited us down to visit this weekend. He was thinking of having the Clearwaters and the Uleys over too. Sort of a playoff party. . . .\u201d \u201cHuh,\u201d was my genius response. But what could I say? I knew I wouldn\u2019t be allowed to hit a werewolf party, even with parental supervision. I wondered if Edward would have a problem with Charlie hanging out in La Push. Or would he suppose that, since Charlie was mostly spending time with Billy, who was only human, my father wouldn\u2019t be in danger? I got up and piled the dishes together without looking at Charlie. I dumped them into the sink and started the water. Edward appeared silently and grabbed a dishtowel. Charlie sighed and gave up for the moment, though I imagined he would revisit the subject when we were alone again. He heaved himself to his feet and headed for the TV, just like every other night. \u201cCharlie,\u201d Edward said in a conversational tone. Charlie stopped in the middle of his little kitchen. \u201cYeah?\u201d \u201cDid Bella ever tell you that my parents gave her airplane tickets on her last birthday, so that she could visit Ren\u00e9e?\u201d I dropped the plate I was scrubbing. It glanced off the counter and clattered noisily to the floor. It didn\u2019t break, but it spattered the room, and all three of us, with soapy water. Charlie didn\u2019t even seem to notice. \u201cBella?\u201d he asked in a stunned voice.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  I kept my eyes on the plate as I retrieved it. \u201cYeah, they did.\u201d Charlie swallowed loudly, and then his eyes narrowed as he turned back to Edward. \u201cNo, she never mentioned it.\u201d \u201cHmm,\u201d Edward murmured. \u201cWas there a reason you brought it up?\u201d Charlie asked in a hard voice. Edward shrugged. \u201cThey\u2019re about to expire. I think it might hurt Esme\u2019s feelings if Bella doesn\u2019t use her gift. Not that she\u2019d say anything.\u201d I stared at Edward in disbelief. Charlie thought for a minute. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a good idea for you to visit your mom, Bella. She\u2019d love that. I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t say anything about this, though.\u201d \u201cI forgot,\u201d I admitted. He frowned. \u201cYou forgot that someone gave you plane tickets?\u201d \u201cMmm,\u201d I murmured vaguely, and turned back to the sink. \u201cI noticed that you said they\u2019re about to expire, Edward,\u201d Charlie went on. \u201cHow many tickets did your\u00a0 parents give her?\u201d \u201cJust one for her . . . and one for me.\u201d The plate I dropped this time landed in the sink, so it didn\u2019t make as much noise. I could easily hear the sharp huff as my father exhaled. The blood rushed into my face, fueled by irritation and chagrin. Why was Edward doing this? I glared at the bubbles in the sink, panicking. \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s out of the question!\u201d Charlie was abruptly in a rage, shouting the words. \u201cWhy?\u201d Edward asked, his voice saturated with innocent surprise. \u201cYou just said it was a good idea for her to see her mother.\u201d Charlie ignored him. \u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere with him, young lady!\u201d he yelled. I spun around and he was jabbing a finger at me. Anger pulsed through me automatically, an instinctive reaction to his tone.  \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not a child, Dad. And I\u2019m not grounded anymore, remember?\u201d \u201cOh yes, you are. Starting now.\u201d \u201cFor what?!\u201d \u201cBecause I said so.\u201d \u201cDo I need to remind you that I\u2019m a legal adult, Charlie?\u201d \u201cThis is my house \u2014 you follow my rules!\u201d My glare turned icy. \u201cIf that\u2019s how you want it. Do you want me to move out tonight? Or can I have a few days to pack?\u201d Charlie\u2019s face went bright red. I instantly felt horrible for playing the move-out card. I took a deep breath and tried to make my tone more reasonable. \u201cI\u2019ll do my time without complaining when I\u2019ve done something wrong, Dad, but I\u2019m not going to put up with your prejudices.\u201d He sputtered, but managed nothing coherent. \u201cNow, I know that you know that I have every right to see Mom for the weekend. You can\u2019t honestly tell me you\u2019d object to the plan if I was going with Alice or Angela.\u201d \u201cGirls,\u201d he grunted, with a nod. \u201cWould it bother you if I took Jacob?\u201d I\u2019d only picked the name because I knew of my father\u2019s preference for Jacob, but I quickly wished I hadn\u2019t; Edward\u2019s teeth clenched together with an audible snap. My father struggled to compose himself before he answered. \u201cYes,\u201d he said in an unconvincing voice. \u201cThat would bother me.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re a rotten liar, Dad.\u201d \u201cBella \u2014\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m headed off to Vegas to be a showgirl or anything. I\u2019m going to see Mom ,\u201d I reminded him. \u201cShe\u2019s just as much my parental authority as you are.\u201d He threw me a withering look. \u201cAre you implying something about Mom\u2019s ability to look after me?\u201d Charlie flinched at the threat implicit in my question. \u201cYou\u2019d better hope I don\u2019t mention this to her,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019d better not,\u201d he warned. \u201cI\u2019m not happy about this, Bella.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for you to be upset.\u201d He rolled his eyes, but I could tell the storm was over. I turned to pull the plug out of the sink. \u201cSo my homework is done, your dinner is done, the dishes are done, and I\u2019m not grounded. I\u2019m going out. I\u2019ll be back before ten-thirty.\u201d \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d His face, almost back to normal, flushed light red again. \u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d I admitted. \u201cI\u2019ll keep it within a ten-mile radius, though. Okay?\u201d He grunted something that did not sound like approval, and stalked out of the room. Naturally, as soon as I\u2019d won the fight, I began to feel guilty. \u201cWe\u2019re going out?\u201d Edward asked, his voice low but enthusiastic. I turned to glower at him. \u201cYes. I think I\u2019d like to speak to you alone .\u201d He didn\u2019t look as apprehensive as I thought he should. I waited to begin until we were safely in his car. \u201cWhat was that ?\u201d I demanded. \u201cI know you want to see your mother, Bella \u2014 you\u2019ve been talking about her in your sleep. Worrying actually.\u201d \u201cI have?\u201d He nodded. \u201cBut, clearly, you were too much of a coward to deal with Charlie, so I interceded on your behalf.\u201d \u201cInterceded? You threw me to the sharks!\u201d He rolled his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t think you were in any danger.\u201d \u201cI told you I didn\u2019t want to fight with Charlie.\u201d \u201cNobody said that you had to.\u201d I glowered at him. \u201cI can\u2019t help myself when he gets all bossy like that \u2014 my natural teenage instincts overpower me.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cWell, that\u2019s not my fault.\u201d I stared at him, speculating. He didn\u2019t seem to notice. His face was serene as he gazed out the windshield. Something was off, but I couldn\u2019t put my finger on it. Or maybe it was just my imagination again, running wild like it had this afternoon. \u00a0\u201cDoes this sudden urge to see Florida have anything to do with the party at Billy\u2019s place?\u201d His jaw flexed. \u201cNothing at all. It wouldn\u2019t matter if you were here or on the other side of the world, you still wouldn\u2019t be going.\u201d It was just like with Charlie before \u2014 just like being treated as a misbehaving child. I gritted my teeth together so I wouldn\u2019t start shouting. I didn\u2019t want to fight with Edward, too. Edward sighed, and when he spoke his voice was warm and velvet again. \u201cSo what do you want to do tonight?\u201d he asked. \u201cCan we go to your house? I haven\u2019t seen Esme in so long.\u201d He smiled. \u201cShe\u2019ll like that. Especially when she hears what we\u2019re doing this weekend.\u201d I groaned in defeat. We didn\u2019t stay out late, as I\u2019d promised. I was not surprised to see the lights still on when we pulled up in front of the house \u2014 I knew Charlie would be waiting to yell at me some more. \u201cYou\u2019d better not come inside,\u201d I said. \u201cIt will only make things worse.\u201d \u201cHis thoughts are relatively calm,\u201d Edward teased. His expression made me wonder if there was some additional joke I was missing. The corners of his mouth twitched, fighting a smile. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later,\u201d I muttered glumly. He laughed and kissed the top of my head. \u201cI\u2019ll be back when Charlie\u2019s snoring.\u201d The TV was loud when I got inside. I briefly considered trying to sneak past him. \u201cCould you come in here, Bella?\u201d Charlie called, sinking that plan. My feet dragged as I took the five necessary steps. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Dad?\u201d \u201cDid you have a nice time tonight?\u201d he asked. He seemed ill at ease. I looked for hidden meanings in his words before I answered. \u201cYes,\u201d I said hesitantly. \u00a0\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d I shrugged. \u201cHung out with Alice and Jasper. Edward beat Alice at chess, and then I played Jasper. He buried me.\u201d I smiled. Edward and Alice playing chess was one of the funniest things I\u2019d ever seen. They\u2019d sat there nearly motionless, staring at the board, while Alice foresaw the moves he would make and he picked the moves she would make in return out of her head. They played most of the game in their minds; I think they\u2019d each moved two pawns when Alice suddenly flicked her king over and surrendered. It took all of three minutes. Charlie hit the mute button \u2014 an unusual action. \u201cLook, there\u2019s something I need to say.\u201d He frowned, looking very uncomfortable. I sat still, waiting. He met my gaze for a second before shifting his eyes to the floor. He didn\u2019t say anything more. \u201cWhat is it, Dad?\u201d He sighed. \u201cI\u2019m not good at this kind of thing. I don\u2019t know how to start. . . .\u201d I waited again. \u201cOkay, Bella. Here\u2019s the thing.\u201d He got up from the couch and started pacing back and forth across the room, looking as his feet all the time. \u201cYou and Edward seem pretty serious, and there are some things that you need to be careful about. I know you\u2019re an adult now, but you\u2019re still young, Bella, and there are a lot of important things you need to know when you . . . well, when you\u2019re physically involved with \u2014\u201d \u201cOh, please, please no!\u201d I begged, jumping to my feet. \u201cPlease tell me you are not trying to have a sex talk with me, Charlie.\u201d He glared at the floor. \u201cI am your father. I have responsibilities. Remember, I\u2019m just as embarrassed as you are.\u201d \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s humanly possible. Anyway, Mom beat you to the punch about ten years ago.\u00a0 You\u2019re off the hook.\u201d \u201cTen years ago you didn\u2019t have a boyfriend,\u201d he muttered unwillingly. I could tell he was battling with his desire to drop the subject. We were both standing up, looking at the floor, and facing away from each other. \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t think the essentials have changed that much,\u201d I mumbled, and my face had to be as red as his. This was beyond the seventh circle of Hades; even worse was realizing that Edward had known this was coming. No wonder he\u2019d seemed so smug in the car. \u00a0\u201cJust tell me that you two are being responsible,\u201d Charlie pled, obviously wishing a pit would open in the floor so that he could fall in. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Dad, it\u2019s not like that.\u201d \u201cNot that I don\u2019t trust you, Bella, but I know you don\u2019t want to tell me anything about this, and you know I don\u2019t really want to hear it. I will try to be open-minded, though. I know the times have changed.\u201d I laughed awkwardly. \u201cMaybe the times have, but Edward is very old-fashioned. You have nothing to worry about.\u201d Charlie sighed. \u201cSure he is,\u201d he muttered. \u201cUgh!\u201d I groaned. \u201cI really wish you were not forcing me to say this out loud, Dad. Really. But . . . I am a . . . virgin, and I have no immediate plans to change that status.\u201d We both cringed, but then Charlie\u2019s face smoothed out. He seemed to believe me. \u201cCan I go to bed, now? Please. \u201d \u201cIn a minute,\u201d he said. \u201cAw, please, Dad? I\u2019m begging you.\u201d \u201cThe embarrassing part\u2019s over, I promise,\u201d he assured me. I shot a glance at him, and was grateful to see that he looked more relaxed, that his face was back to its regular color. He sank down onto the sofa, sighing with relief that he was past the sex speech. \u201cWhat now?\u201d \u201cI just wanted to know how the balance thing is coming along.\u201d \u201cOh. Good, I guess. I made plans with Angela today. I\u2019m going to help her with her graduation announcements. Just us girls.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s nice. And what about Jake?\u201d I sighed. \u201cI haven\u2019t figured that one out yet, Dad.\u201d \u201cKeep trying, Bella. I know you\u2019ll do the right thing. You\u2019re a good person.\u201d Nice. So if I didn\u2019t figure out some way to make things right with Jacob, then I was a bad person? That was below the belt. \u00a0\u201cSure, sure,\u201d I agreed. The automatic response almost made me smile \u2014 it was something I\u2019d picked up from Jacob. I even said it in the same patronizing tone he used with his own father. Charlie grinned and turned the sound back on. He slumped lower into the cushions, pleased with his night\u2019s work. I could tell he would be up with the game for a while. \u201c\u2019Night, Bells.\u201d \u201cSee you in the morning!\u201d I sprinted for the stairs. Edward was long gone and he wouldn\u2019t be back until Charlie was asleep \u2014 he was probably out hunting or something to pass the time \u2014 so I was in no hurry to undress for bed. I wasn\u2019t in the mood to be alone, but I certainly wasn\u2019t going to go back downstairs to hang out with my Dad, just in case he thought of some topic of sex education that he hadn\u2019t touched on before; I shuddered. So, thanks to Charlie, I was wound up and anxious.  My homework was done and I didn\u2019t feel mellow enough for reading or just listening to music. I considered calling Ren\u00e9e with the news of my visit, but then I realized that it was three hours later in Florida, and she would be asleep.  I could call Angela, I supposed. But suddenly I knew that it wasn\u2019t Angela that I wanted to talk to. That I needed to talk to. I stared at the blank black window, biting my lip. I don\u2019t know how long I stood there weighing the pros against the cons \u2014 doing the right thing by Jacob, seeing my closest friend again, being a good person, versus making Edward furious with me. Ten minutes maybe. Long enough to decide that the pros were valid while the cons were not. Edward was only concerned about my safety, and I knew that there was really no problem on that count. The phone wasn\u2019t any help; Jacob had refused to answer my phone calls since Edward\u2019s return. Besides, I needed to see him \u2014 see him smiling again the way he used to. I needed to replace that awful last memory of his face warped and twisted by pain if I was ever going to have any peace of mind. I had an hour probably. I could make a quick run down to La Push and be back before Edward realized I had gone. It was past my curfew, but would Charlie really care about that when Edward wasn\u2019t involved? One way to find out. I grabbed my jacket and shoved my arms through the sleeves as I ran down the stairs. Charlie looked up from the game, instantly suspicious. \u201cYou care if I go see Jake tonight?\u201d I asked breathlessly. \u201cI won\u2019t stay long.\u201d As soon as I said Jake\u2019s name, Charlie\u2019s expression relaxed into a smug smile. He didn\u2019t seem surprised at all that his lecture had taken effect so quickly. \u201cSure, kid. No problem. Stay as long as you like.\u201d \u201cThanks, Dad,\u201d I said as I darted out the door. Like any fugitive, I couldn\u2019t help looking over my shoulder a few times while I jogged to my truck, but the night was so black that there really was no point. I had to feel my way along the side of the truck to the handle. My eyes were just beginning to adjust as I shoved my keys in the ignition. I twisted them hard to the left, but instead of roaring deafeningly to life, the engine just clicked. I tried it again with the same results. And then a small motion in my peripheral vision made me jump. \u201cGah!\u201d I gasped in shock when I saw that I was not alone in the cab. Edward sat very still, a faint bright spot in the darkness, only his hands moving as he turned a mysterious black object around and around. He stared at the object as he spoke. \u201cAlice called,\u201d he murmured. Alice! Damn. I\u2019d forgotten to account for her in my plans. He must have her watching me. \u201cShe got nervous when your future rather abruptly disappeared five minutes ago.\u201d My eyes, already wide with surprise, popped wider. \u201cBecause she can\u2019t see the wolves, you know,\u201d he explained in the same low murmur. \u201cHad you forgotten that? When you decide to mingle your fate with theirs, you disappear, too. You couldn\u2019t know that part, I realize that. But can you understand why that might make me a little . . . anxious? Alice saw you disappear, and she couldn\u2019t even tell if you\u2019d come home or not. Your future got lost, just like theirs. \u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re not sure why this is. Some natural defense they\u2019re born with?\u201d He spoke as if he were talking to himself now, still looking at the piece of my truck\u2019s engine as he twirled it in his hands. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t seem entirely likely, since I haven\u2019t had any trouble reading their thoughts. The Blacks\u2019 at least. Carlisle theorizes that it\u2019s because their lives are so ruled by their transformations. It\u2019s more an involuntary reaction than a decision. Utterly unpredictable, and it changes everything about them. In that instant when they shift from one form to the other, they don\u2019t really even exist. The future can\u2019t hold them. . . .\u201d I listened to his musing in stony silence. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll put your car back together in time for school, in case you\u2019d like to drive yourself,\u201d he assured me after a minute. With my lips mashed together, I retrieved my keys and stiffly climbed out of the truck. \u201cShut your window if you want me to stay away tonight. I\u2019ll understand,\u201d he whispered just before I slammed the door. I stomped into the house, slamming that door, too. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Charlie demanded from the couch. \u201cTruck won\u2019t start,\u201d I growled. \u00a0\u201cWant me to look at it?\u201d \u201cNo. I\u2019ll try it in the morning.\u201d \u00a0\u201cWant to use my car?\u201d I wasn\u2019t supposed to drive his police cruiser. Charlie must be really desperate to get me to La Push. Nearly as desperate as I was. \u201cNo. I\u2019m tired,\u201d I grumbled. \u201c\u2019Night.\u201d I stamped my way up the stairs, and went straight to my window. I shoved the metal frame roughly \u2014 it crashed shut and the glass trembled. I stared at the shivering black glass for a long moment, until it was still. Then I sighed, and opened the window as wide as it would go.",

            "en": "3          3. THE END I FELT ABSOLUTELY HIDEOUS IN THE MORNING. I HADN'T slept well; my arm burned and my head ached. It didn't help my outlook that Edward's face was smooth and remote as he kissed my forehead quickly and ducked out my window. I was afraid of the time I'd spent unconscious, afraid that he might have been thinking about right and wrong again while he watched me sleep. The anxiety seemed to ratchet up the intensity of the pounding in my head. Edward was waiting for me at school, as usual, but his face was still wrong. There was something buried in his eyes that I couldn't be sure of\u2014and it scared me. I didn't want to bring up last night, but I wasn't sure if avoiding the subject would be worse. He opened my door for me. \"How do you feel?\u00a0 \" \"Perfect,\" I lied, cringing as the sound of the slamming door echoed in my head. We walked in silence, he shortening his stride to match mine. There were so many questions I wanted to ask, but most of those questions would have to wait, because they were for Alice: How was Jasper this morning?\u00a0 \u00a0What had they said when I was gone?\u00a0 \u00a0What had Rosalie said?\u00a0 \u00a0And most importantly, what could she see happening now in her strange, imperfect visions of the future?\u00a0 \u00a0Could she guess what Edward was thinking, why he was so gloomy?\u00a0 \u00a0Was there a foundation for the tenuous, instinctive fears that I couldn't seem to shake?\u00a0  The morning passed slowly. I was impatient to see Alice, though I wouldn't be able to really talk to her with Edward there. Edward remained aloof. Occasionally he would ask about my arm, and I would lie. Alice usually beat us to lunch; she didn't have to keep pace with a sloth like me. But she wasn't at the table, waiting with a tray of food she wouldn't eat. Edward didn't say anything about her absence. I wondered to myself if her class was running late\u2014until I saw Conner and Ben, who were in her fourth hour French class. \"Where's Alice?\u00a0 \" I asked Edward anxiously. He looked at the granola bar he was slowly pulverizing between his fingertips while he answered. \"She's with Jasper.\" \"Is he okay?\u00a0 \" \"He's gone away for a while.\" \"What?\u00a0 \u00a0Where?\u00a0 \" Edward shrugged. \"Nowhere in particular.\" \"And Alice, too,\" I said with quiet desperation. Of course, if Jasper needed her, she would go.  \"Yes. She'll be gone for a while. She was trying to convince him to go to Denali.\" Denali was where the one other band of unique vampires\u2014good ones like the Cullens\u2014lived. Tanya and her family. I'd heard of them now and again. Edward had run to them last winter when my arrival had made Forks difficult for him. Laurent, the most civilized member of James's little coven, had gone there rather than siding with James against the Cullens. It made sense for Alice to encourage Jasper to go there. I swallowed, trying to dislodge the sudden lump in my throat. The guilt made my head bow and my shoulders slump. I'd run them out of their home, just like Rosalie and Emmett. I was a plague. \"Is your arm bothering you?\u00a0 \" he asked solicitously. \"Who cares about my stupid arm?\u00a0 \" I muttered in disgust. He didn't answer, and I put my head down on the table. By the end of the day, the silence was becoming ridiculous. I didn't want to be the one to break it, but apparently that was my only choice if I ever wanted him to talk to me again. \"You'll come over later tonight?\u00a0 \" I asked as he walked me\u2014silently\u2014to my truck. He always came over. \"Later?\u00a0 \" It pleased me that he seemed surprised. \"I have to work. I had to trade with Mrs. Newton to get yesterday off.\" \"Oh,\" he murmured. \"So you'll come over when I'm home, though, right?\u00a0 \" I hated that I felt suddenly unsure about this. \"If you want me to.\" \"I always want you,\" I reminded him, with perhaps a little more intensity than the conversation required. I expected he would laugh, or smile, or react somehow to my words. \"All right, then,\" he said indifferently. He kissed my forehead again before he shut the door on me. Then he turned his back and loped gracefully toward his car. I was able to drive out of the parking lot before the panic really hit, but I was hyperventilating by the time I got to Newton's. He just needed time, I told myself. He would get over this. Maybe he was sad because his family was disappearing. But Alice and Jasper would come back soon, and Rosalie and Emmett, too. If it would help, I would stay away from the big white house on the river\u2014I'd never set foot there again. That didn't matter. I'd still see Alice at school. She would have to come back for school, right?\u00a0 \u00a0And she was at my place all the time anyway. She wouldn't want to hurt Charlie's feelings by staying away. No doubt I would also run into Carlisle with regularity\u2014in the emergency room. After all, what had happened last night was nothing. Nothing had happened. So I fell down\u2014that was the story of my life. Compared to last spring, it seemed especially unimportant. James had left me broken and nearly dead from loss of blood\u2014and yet Edward had handled the interminable weeks in the hospital much better than this. Was it because, this time, it wasn't an enemy he'd had to protect me from?\u00a0  Because it was his brother?\u00a0  Maybe it would be better if he took me away, rather than his family being scattered. I grew slightly less depressed as I considered all the uninterrupted alone time. If he could just last through the school year, Charlie wouldn't be able to object. We could go away to college, or pretend that's what we were doing, like Rosalie and Emmett this year. Surely Edward could wait a year. What was a year to an immortal?\u00a0 \u00a0It didn't even seem like that much to me. I was able to talk myself into enough composure to handle getting out of the truck and walking to the store. Mike Newton had beaten me here today, and he smiled and waved when I came in. I grabbed my vest, nodding vaguely in his direction. I was still imagining pleasant scenarios that consisted of me running away with Edward to various exotic locales. Mike interrupted my fantasy. \"How was your birthday?\u00a0 \" \"Ugh,\" I mumbled. \"I'm glad it's over.\" Mike looked at me from the corners of his eyes like I was crazy. Work dragged. I wanted to see Edward again, praying that he would be past the worst of this, whatever it was exactly, by the time I saw him again. It's nothing, I told myself over and over again. Everything will go back to normal. The relief I felt when I turned onto my street and saw Edward's silver car parked in front of my house was an overwhelming, heady thing. And it bothered me deeply that it should be that way. I hurried through the front door, calling out before I was completely inside. \"Dad?\u00a0 \u00a0Edward?\u00a0 \" As I spoke, I could hear the distinctive theme music from ESPN's Sports Center coming from the living room. \"In here,\" Charlie called. I hung my raincoat on its peg and hurried around the corner. Edward was in the armchair, my father on the sofa. Both had their eyes trained on the TV. The focus was normal for my father. Not so much for Edward. \"Hi,\" I said weakly. \"Hey, Bella,\" my father answered, eyes never moving. \"We just had cold pizza. I think it's still on the table.\" \"Okay.\" I waited in the doorway. Finally, Edward looked over at me with a polite smile. \"I'll be right behind you,\" he promised. His eyes strayed back to the TV. I stared for another minute, shocked. Neither one seemed to notice. I could feel something, panic maybe, building up in my chest. I escaped to the kitchen. The pizza held no interest for me. I sat in my chair, pulled my knees up, and wrapped my arms around them. Something was very wrong, maybe more wrong than I'd realized. The sounds of male bonding and banter continued from the TV set. I tried to get control of myself, to reason with myself. What's the worst that can happen?\u00a0 \u00a0I flinched. That was definitely the wrong question to ask. I was having a hard time breathing right. Okay, I thought again, what's the worst I can live through?\u00a0 \u00a0I didn't like that question so much, either. But I thought through the possibilities I'd considered today. Staying away from Edward's family. Of course, he wouldn't expect Alice to be part of that. But if Jasper was off limits, that would lessen the time I could have with her. I nodded to myself\u2014I could live with that. Or going away. Maybe he wouldn't want to wait till the end of the school year, maybe it would have to be now. In front of me, on the table, my presents from Charlie and Renee were where I had left them, the camera I hadn't had the chance to use at the Cullens' sitting beside the album. I touched the pretty cover of the scrapbook my mother had given me, and sighed, thinking of Renee. Somehow, living without her for as long as I had did not make the idea of a more permanent separation easier. And Charlie would be left all alone here, abandoned. They would both be so hurt\u2026 But we'd come back, right?\u00a0 \u00a0We'd visit, of course, wouldn't we?\u00a0  I couldn't be certain about the answer to that. I leaned my cheek against my knee, staring at the physical tokens of my parents' love. I'd known this path I'd chosen was going to be hard. And, after all, I was thinking about the worst-case scenario\u2014the very worst I could live through. I touched the scrapbook again, flipping the front cover over. Little metal corners were already in place to hold the first picture. It wasn't a half-bad idea, to make some record of my life here. I felt a strange urge to get started. Maybe I didn't have that long left in Forks. I toyed with the wrist strap on the camera, wondering about the first picture on the roll. Could it possibly turn out anything close to the original?\u00a0 \u00a0I doubted it. But he didn't seem worried that it would be blank. I chuckled to myself, thinking of his carefree laughter last night. The chuckle died away. So much had changed, and so abruptly. It made me feel a little bit dizzy, like I was standing on an edge, a precipice somewhere much too high. I didn't want to think about that anymore. I grabbed the camera and headed up the stairs. My room hadn't really changed all that much in the seventeen years since my mother had been here. The walls were still light blue, the same yellowed lace curtains hung in front of the window. There was a bed, rather than a crib, but she would recognize the quilt draped untidily over the top\u2014it had been a gift from Gran. Regardless, I snapped a picture of my room. There wasn't much else I could do tonight\u2014it was too dark outside\u2014and the feeling was growing stronger, it was almost a\u00a0 compulsion now. I would record everything about Forks before I had to leave it. Change was coming. I could feel it. It wasn't a pleasant prospect, not when life was perfect the way it was. I took my time coming back down the stairs, camera in hand, trying to ignore the butterflies in my stomach as I thought of the strange distance I didn't want to see in Edward's eyes. He would get over this. Probably he was worried that I would be upset when he asked me to leave. I would let him work through it without meddling. And I would be prepared when he asked. I had the camera ready as I leaned around the corner, being sneaky. I was sure there was no chance that I had caught Edward by surprise, but he didn't look up. I felt a brief shiver as something icy twisted in my stomach; I ignored that and took the picture. They both looked at me then. Charlie frowned. Edward's face was empty, expressionless. \"What are you doing, Bella?\u00a0 \" Charlie complained. \"Oh, come on.\" I pretended to smile as I went to sit on the floor in front of the sofa where Charlie lounged. \"You know Mom will be calling soon to ask if I'm using my presents. I have to get to work before she can get her feelings hurt.\" \"Why are you taking pictures of me, though?\u00a0 \" he grumbled. \"Because you're so handsome,\" I replied, keeping it light. \"And because, since you\u00a0 bought the camera, you're obligated to be one of my subjects.\" He mumbled something unintelligible. \"Hey, Edward,\" I said with admirable indifference. \"Take one of me and my dad together.\"  I threw the camera toward him, carefully avoiding his eyes, and knelt beside the arm of the sofa where Charlie's face was. Charlie sighed. \"You need to smile, Bella,\" Edward murmured. I did my best, and the camera flashed. \"Let me take one of you kids,\" Charlie suggested. I knew he was just trying to shift the camera's focus from himself. Edward stood and lightly tossed him the camera. I went to stand beside Edward, and the arrangement felt formal and strange to me. He put one hand lightly on my shoulder, and I wrapped my arm more securely around his waist. I wanted to look at his face, but I was afraid to. \"Smile, Bella,\" Charlie reminded me again. I took a deep breath and smiled. The flash blinded me. \"Enough pictures for tonight,\" Charlie said then, shoving the camera into a crevice of the sofa cushions and rolling over it. \"You don't have to use the whole roll now.\" Edward dropped his hand from my shoulder and twisted casually out of my arm. He sat back down in the armchair. I hesitated, and then went to sit against the sofa again. I was suddenly so frightened that my hands were shaking. I pressed them into my stomach to hide them, put my chin on my knees and stared at the TV screen in front of me, seeing nothing. When the show ended, I hadn't moved an inch. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Edward stand. \"I'd better get home,\" he said. Charlie didn't look up from the commercial. \"See ya.\" I got awkwardly to my feet\u2014I was stiff from sitting so still\u2014and followed Edward out the front door. He went straight to his car. \"Will you stay?\u00a0 \" I asked, no hope in my voice. I expected his answer, so it didn't hurt as much. \"Not tonight.\" I didn't ask for a reason. He got in his car and drove away while I stood there, unmoving. I barely noticed that it was raining. I waited, without knowing what I waited for, until the door opened behind me. \"Bella, what are you doing?\u00a0 \" Charlie asked, surprised to see me standing there alone and dripping. \"Nothing.\" I turned and trudged back to the house. It was a long night, with little in the way of rest. I got up as soon as there was a faint light outside my window. I dressed for school mechanically, waiting for the clouds to brighten. When I had eaten a bowl of cereal, I decided that it was light enough for pictures. I took one of my truck, and then the front of the house. I turned and snapped a few of the forest by Charlie's house. Funny how it didn't seem sinister like it used to. I realized I would miss this\u2014the green, the timelessness, the mystery of the woods. All of it. I put the camera in my school bag before I left. I tried to concentrate on my new project rather than the fact that Edward apparently hadn't gotten over things during the night. Along with the fear, I was beginning to feel impatience. How long could this last?\u00a0  It lasted through the morning. He walked silently beside me, never seeming to actually look at me. I tried to concentrate on my classes, but not even English could hold my attention. Mr. Berty had to repeat his question about Lady Capulet twice before I realized he was talking to me. Edward whispered the correct answer under his breath and then went back to ignoring me. At lunch, the silence continued. I felt like I was going to start screaming at any moment, so, to distract myself, I leaned across the table's invisible line and spoke to Jessica. \"Hey, Jess?\u00a0 \" \"What's up, Bella?\u00a0 \" \"Could you do me a favor?\u00a0 \" I asked, reaching into my bag. \"My mom wants me to get some pictures of my friends for a scrapbook. So, take some pictures of everybody, okay?\u00a0 \" I handed her the camera. \"Sure,\" she said, grinning, and turned to snap a candid shot of Mike with his mouth full. A predictable picture war ensued. I watched them hand the camera around the table, giggling and flirting and complaining about being on film. It seemed strangely childish. Maybe I just wasn't in the mood for normal human behavior today. \"Uh-oh,\" Jessica said apologetically as she returned the camera. \"I think we used all your film.\" \"That's okay. I think I already got pictures of everything else I needed.\" After school, Edward walked me back to the parking lot in silence. I had to work again, and for once, I was glad. Time with me obviously wasn't helping things. Maybe time alone would be better. I dropped my film off at the Thriftway on my way to Newton's, and then picked up the developed pictures after work. At home, I said a brief hi to Charlie, grabbed a granola bar from the kitchen, and hurried up to my room with the envelope of photographs tucked under my arm. I sat in the middle of my bed and opened the envelope with wary curiosity. Ridiculously, I still half expected the first print to be a blank. When I pulled it out, I gasped aloud. Edward looked just as beautiful as he did in real life, staring at me out of the picture with the warm eyes I'd missed for the past few days. It was almost uncanny that anyone could look so\u2026 so\u2026 beyond description. No thousand words could equal this picture. I flipped through the rest of the stack quickly once, and then laid three of them out on the bed side by side. The first was the picture of Edward in the kitchen, his warm eyes touched with tolerant amusement. The second was Edward and Charlie, watching ESPN. The difference in Edward's expression was severe. His eyes were careful here, reserved. Still breathtakingly beautiful, but his face was colder, more like a sculpture, less alive. The last was the picture of Edward and me standing awkwardly side by side. Edward's face was the same as the last, cold and statue-like. But that wasn't the most troubling part of this photograph. The contrast between the two of us was painful. He looked like a god. I looked very average, even for a human, almost shamefully plain. I flipped the picture over with a feeling of disgust. Instead of doing my homework, I stayed up to put my pictures into the album. With a ballpoint pen I scrawled captions under all the pictures, the names and the dates. I got to the picture of Edward and me, and, without looking at it too long, I folded it in half and stuck it under the metal tab, Edward-side up. When I was done, I stuffed the second set of prints in a fresh envelope and penned a long thank-you letter to Renee. Edward still hadn't come over. I didn't want to admit that he was the reason I'd stayed up so late, but of course he was. I tried to remember the last time he'd stayed away like this, without an excuse, a phone call\u2026 He never had. Again, I didn't sleep well. School followed the silent, frustrating, terrifying pattern of the last two days. I felt relief when I saw Edward waiting for me in the parking lot, but it faded quickly. He was no different, unless maybe more remote. It was hard to even remember the reason for all this mess. My birthday already felt like the distant past. If only Alice would come back. Soon. Before this got any more out of hand.  But I couldn't count on that. I decided that, if I couldn't talk to him today, really talk, then I was going to see Carlisle tomorrow. I had to do something. After school, Edward and I were going to talk it out, I promised myself. I wasn't accepting any excuses. He walked me to my truck, and I steeled myself to make my demands. \"Do you mind if I come over today?\u00a0 \" he asked before we got to the truck, beating me to the punch. \"Of course not.\" \"Now?\u00a0 \" he asked again, opening my door for me. \"Sure,\" I kept my voice even, though I didn't like the urgency in his tone. \"I was just going to drop a letter for Renee in the mailbox on the way. I'll meet you there.\" He looked at the fat envelope on the passenger seat. Suddenly, he reached over me and snagged it. \"I'll do it,\" he said quietly. \"And I'll still beat you there.\" He smiled my favorite crooked smile, but it was wrong. It didn't reach his eyes. \"Okay,\" I agreed, unable to smile back. He shut the door, and headed toward his car. He did beat me home. He was parked in Charlie's spot when I pulled up in front of the house. That was a bad sign. He didn't plan to stay, then. I shook my head and took a deep breath, trying to locate some courage. He got out of his car when I stepped out of the truck, and came to meet me. He reached to take my book bag from me. That was normal. But he shoved it back onto the seat. That was not normal. \"Come for a walk with me,\" he suggested in an unemotional voice, taking my hand. I didn't answer. I couldn't think of a way to protest, but I instantly knew that I wanted to. I didn't like this. This is bad, this is very bad, the voice in my head repeated again and again. But he didn't wait for an answer. He pulled me along toward the east side of the yard, where the forest encroached. I followed unwillingly, trying to think through the panic. It was what I wanted, I reminded myself. The chance to talk it all through. So why was the panic choking me?\u00a0  We'd gone only a few steps into the trees when he stopped. We were barely on the trail\u2014I could still see the house. Some walk. Edward leaned against a tree and stared at me, his expression unreadable. \"Okay, let's talk,\" I said. It sounded braver than it felt. He took a deep breath. \"Bella, we're leaving.\" I took a deep breath, too. This was an acceptable option. I thought I was prepared. But I still had to ask. \"Why now?\u00a0 \u00a0Another year\u2014\" \"Bella, it's time. How much longer could we stay in Forks, after all?\u00a0 \u00a0Carlisle can barely pass for thirty, and he's claiming thirty-three now. We'd have to start over soon regardless.\" His answer confused me. I thought the point of leaving was to let his family live in peace. Why did we have to leave if they were going?\u00a0 \u00a0I stared at him, trying to understand what he meant. He stared back coldly. With a roll of nausea, I realized I'd misunderstood. \"When you say we\u2014,\" I whispered. \"I mean my family and myself.\" Each word separate and distinct. I shook my head back and forth mechanically, trying to clear it. He waited without any sign of impatience. It took a few minutes before I could speak. \"Okay,\" I said. \"I'll come with you.\" \"You can't, Bella. Where we're going\u2026 It's not the right place for you.\" \"Where you are is the right place for me.\" \"I'm no good for you, Bella.\" \"Don't be ridiculous.\" I wanted to sound angry, but it just sounded like I was begging. \"You're the very best part of my life.\" \"My world is not for you,\" he said grimly. \"What happened with Jasper\u2014that was nothing, Edward! Nothing!\" \"You're right,\" he agreed. \"It was exactly what was to be expected.\" \"You promised! In Phoenix, you promised that you would stay\u2014\" \"As long as that was best for you,\" he interrupted to correct me. \"No! This is about my soul, isn't it?\u00a0 \" I shouted, furious, the words exploding out of me\u2014somehow it still sounded like a plea. \"Carlisle told me about that, and I don't care,\u00a0 Edward. I don't care! You can have my soul. I don't want it without you\u2014it's yours already!\" He took a deep breath and stared, unseeingly, at the ground for a long moment. His mouth twisted the tiniest bit. When he finally looked up, his eyes were different, harder\u2014like the liquid gold had frozen solid. \"Bella, I don't want you to come with me.\" He spoke the words slowly and precisely, his cold eyes on my face, watching as I absorbed what he was really saying. There was a pause as I repeated the words in my head a few times, sifting through them for their real intent. \"You\u2026 don't\u2026 want me?\u00a0 \" I tried out the words, confused by the way they sounded, placed in that order. \"No.\" I stared, uncomprehending, into his eyes. He stared back without apology. His eyes were like topaz\u2014hard and clear and very deep. I felt like I could see into them for miles and miles, yet nowhere in their bottomless depths could I see a contradiction to the word he'd spoken. \"Well, that changes things.\" I was surprised by how calm and reasonable my voice sounded. It must be because I was so numb. I couldn't realize what he was telling me. It still didn't make any sense. He looked away into the trees as he spoke again. \"Of course, I'll always love you\u2026 in a way. But what happened the other night made me realize that it's time for a change. Because I'm\u2026 tired of pretending to be something I'm not, Bella. I am not human.\" He looked back, and the icy planes of his perfect face were not human. \"I've let this go on much too long, and I'm sorry for that.\" \"Don't.\" My voice was just a whisper now; awareness was beginning to seep through me, trickling like acid through my veins. \"Don't do this.\" He just stared at me, and I could see from his eyes that my words were far too late. He already had.  \"You're not good for me, Bella.\" He turned his earlier words around, and so I had no argument. How well I knew that I wasn't good enough for him. I opened my mouth to say something, and then closed it again. He waited patiently, his face wiped clean of all emotion. I tried again. \"If\u2026 that's what you want.\" He nodded once. My whole body went numb. I couldn't feel anything below the neck. \"I would like to ask one favor, though, if that's not too much,\" he said. I wonder what he saw on my face, because something flickered across his own face in response. But, before I could identify it, he'd composed his features into the same serene mask. \"Anything,\" I vowed, my voice faintly stronger. As I watched, his frozen eyes melted. The gold became liquid again, molten, burning down into mine with an intensity that was overwhelming. \"Don't do anything reckless or stupid,\" he ordered, no longer detached. \"Do you understand what I'm saying?\u00a0 \" I nodded helplessly. His eyes cooled, the distance returned. \"I'm thinking of Charlie, of course. He needs you. Take care of yourself\u2014for him.\" I nodded again. \"I will,\" I whispered. He seemed to relax just a little. \"And I'll make you a promise in return,\" he said. \"I promise that this will be the last time you'll see me. I won't come back. I won't put you through anything like this again. You can go on with your life without any more interference from me. It will be as if I'd never existed.\" My knees must have started to shake, because the trees were suddenly wobbling. I could hear the blood pounding faster than normal behind my ears. His voice sounded farther away. He smiled gently. \"Don't worry. You're human\u2014your memory is no more than a sieve. Time heals all wounds for your kind.\" \"And your memories?\u00a0 \" I asked. It sounded like there was something stuck in my throat, like I was choking. \"Well\"\u2014he hesitated for a short second\u2014\"I won't forget. But my kind\u2026 we're very easily distracted.\" He smiled; the smile was tranquil and it did not touch his eyes. He took a step away from me. \"That's everything, I suppose. We won't bother you again.\" The plural caught my attention. That surprised me; I would have thought I was beyond noticing anything. \"Alice isn't coming back,\" I realized. I don't know how he heard me\u2014the words made no sound\u2014but he seemed to understand. He shook his head slowly, always watching my face. \"No. They're all gone. I stayed behind to tell you goodbye.\" \"Alice is gone?\u00a0 \" My voice was blank with disbelief. \"She wanted to say goodbye, but I convinced her that a clean break would be better for you.\" I was dizzy; it was hard to concentrate. His words swirled around in my head, and I heard the doctor at the hospital in Phoenix, last spring, as he showed me the X-rays. You can see it's a clean break, his finger traced along the picture of my severed bone. That's good. It will heal more easily, more quickly. I tried to breathe normally. I needed to concentrate, to find a way out of this nightmare. \"Goodbye, Bella,\" he said in the same quiet, peaceful voice. \"Wait!\" I choked out the word, reaching for him, willing my deadened legs to carry me forward. I thought he was reaching for me, too. But his cold hands locked around my wrists and pinned them to my sides. He leaned down, and pressed his lips very lightly to my forehead for the briefest instant. My eyes closed. \"Take care of yourself,\" he breathed, cool against my skin. There was a light, unnatural breeze. My eyes flashed open. The leaves on a small vine maple shuddered with the gentle wind of his passage. He was gone. With shaky legs, ignoring the fact that my action was useless, I followed him into the forest. The evidence of his path had disappeared instantly. There were no footprints, the leaves were still again, but I walked forward without thinking. I could not do anything else. I had to keep moving. If I stopped looking for him, it was over. Love, life, meaning\u2026 over. I walked and walked. Time made no sense as I pushed slowly through the thick undergrowth. It was hours passing, but also only seconds. Maybe it felt like time had frozen because the forest looked the same no matter how far I went. I started to worry that I was traveling in a circle, a very small circle at that, but I kept going. I stumbled often, and, as it grew darker and darker, I fell often, too. Finally, I tripped over something\u2014it was black now, I had no idea what caught my foot\u2014and I stayed down. I rolled onto my side, so that I could breathe, and curled up on the wet bracken. As I lay there, I had a feeling that more time was passing than I realized. I couldn't remember how long it had been since nightfall. Was it always so dark here at night?\u00a0 \u00a0Surely, as a rule, some little bit of moonlight would filter down through the clouds, through the chinks in the canopy of trees, and find the ground. Not tonight. Tonight the sky was utterly black. Perhaps there was no moon tonight\u2014a lunar eclipse, a new moon. A new moon. I shivered, though I wasn't cold. It was black for a long time before I heard them calling. Someone was shouting my name. It was muted, muffled by the wet growth that surrounded me, but it was definitely my name. I didn't recognize the voice. I thought about answering, but I was dazed, and it took a long time to come to the conclusion that I should answer. By then, the calling had stopped. Sometime later, the rain woke me up. I don't think I'd really fallen asleep; I was just lost in an unthinking stupor, holding with all my strength to the numbness that kept me from realizing what I didn't want to know. The rain bothered me a little. It was cold. I unwrapped my arms from around my legs to cover my face.  It was then that I heard the calling again. It was farther away this time, and sometimes it sounded like several voices were calling at once. I tried to breathe deeply. I remembered that I should answer, but I didn't think they would be able to hear me. Would I be able to shout loud enough?\u00a0  Suddenly, there was another sound, startlingly close. A kind of snuffling, an animal sound. It sounded big. I wondered if I should feel afraid. I didn't\u2014just numb. It didn't matter. The snuffling went away. The rain continued, and I could feel the water pooling up against my cheek. I was trying to gather the strength to turn my head when I saw the light. At first it was just a dim glow reflecting off the bushes in the distance. It grew brighter and brighter, illuminating a large space unlike the focused beam of a flashlight. The light broke through the closest brush, and I could see that it was a propane lantern, but that was all I could see\u2014the brightness blinded me for a moment. \"Bella.\" The voice was deep and unfamiliar, but full of recognition. He wasn't calling my name to search, he was acknowledging that I was found. I stared up\u2014impossibly high it seemed\u2014at the dark face that I could now see above me. I was vaguely aware that the stranger probably only looked so tall because my head was still on the ground. \"Have you been hurt?\u00a0 \" I knew the words meant something, but I could only stare, bewildered. How could the meaning matter at this point?\u00a0  \"Bella, my name is Sam Uley.\" There was nothing familiar about his name. \"Charlie sent me to look for you.\" Charlie?\u00a0 \u00a0That struck a chord, and I tried to pay more attention to what he was saying. Charlie mattered, if nothing else did. The tall man held out a hand. I gazed at it, not sure what I was supposed to do. His black eyes appraised me for a second, and then he shrugged. In a quick and supple notion, he pulled me up from the ground and into his arms. I hung there, limp, as he loped swiftly through the wet forest. Some part of me knew this should upset me\u2014being carried away by a stranger. But there was nothing left in me to upset. It didn't seem like too much time passed before there were lights and the deep babble of many male voices. Sam Uley slowed as he approached the commotion. \"I've got her!\" he called in a booming voice. The babble ceased, and then picked up again with more intensity. A confusing swirl of faces moved over me. Sam's voice was the only one that made sense in the chaos, perhaps because my ear was against his chest. \"No, I don't think she's hurt,\" he told someone. \"She just keeps saying 'He's gone.' \" \u00a0Was I saying that out loud?\u00a0 \u00a0I bit down on my lip. \"Bella, honey, are you all right?\u00a0 \" That was one voice I would know anywhere\u2014even distorted, as it was now, with worry. \"Charlie?\u00a0 \" My voice sounded strange and small. \"I'm right here, baby.\" There was a shifting under me, followed by the leathery smell of my dad's sheriff jacket. Charlie staggered under my weight. \"Maybe I should hold on to her,\" Sam Uley suggested. \"I've got her,\" Charlie said, a little breathless. He walked slowly, struggling. I wished I could tell him to put me down and let me walk, but I couldn't find my voice. There were lights everywhere, held by the crowd walking with him. It felt like a parade. Or a funeral procession. I closed my eyes. \"We're almost home now, honey,\" Charlie mumbled now and then. I opened my eyes again when I heard the door unlock. We were on the porch of our house, and the tall dark man named Sam was holding the door for Charlie, one arm extended toward us, as if he was preparing to catch me when Charlie's arms failed. But Charlie managed to get me through the door and to the couch in the living room. \"Dad, I'm all wet,\" I objected feebly. \"That doesn't matter.\" His voice was gruff. And then he was talking to someone else. \"Blankets are in the cupboard at the top of the stairs.\" \"Bella?\u00a0 \" a new voice asked. I looked at the gray-haired man leaning over me, and recognition came after a few slow seconds. \"Dr. Gerandy?\u00a0 \" I mumbled. \"That's right, dear,\" he said. \"Are you hurt, Bella?\u00a0 \" It took me a minute to think that through. I was confused by the memory of Sam Uley's similar question in the woods. Only Sam had asked something else: Have you been hurt?\u00a0 \u00a0he'd said. The difference seemed significant somehow. Dr. Gerandy was waiting. One grizzled eyebrow rose, and the wrinkles on his forehead deepened.  \"I'm not hurt,\" I lied. The words, were true enough for what he'd asked. His warm hand touched my forehead, and his fingers pressed against the inside of my wrist. I watched his lips as he counted to himself, his eyes on his watch. \"What happened to you?\u00a0 \" he asked casually. I froze under his hand, tasting panic in the back of my throat. \"Did you get lost in the woods?\u00a0 \" he prodded. I was aware of several other people listening. Three tall men with dark faces\u2014from La Push, the Quileute Indian reservation down on the coastline, I guessed\u2014Sam Uley among them, were standing very close together and staring at me. Mr. Newton was there with Mike and Mr. Weber, Angela's father; they all were watching me more surreptitiously than the strangers. Other deep voices rumbled from the kitchen and outside the front door. Half the town must have been looking for me. Charlie was the closest. He leaned in to hear my answer. \"Yes,\" I whispered. \"I got lost.\" The doctor nodded, thoughtful, his fingers probing gently against the glands under my jaw. Charlie's face hardened. \"Do you feel tired?\u00a0 \" Dr. Gerandy asked. I nodded and closed my eyes obediently. \"I don't think there's anything wrong with her,\" I heard the doctor mutter to Charlie after a moment. \"Just exhaustion. Let her sleep it off, and I'll come check on her tomorrow,\" he paused. He must have looked at his watch, because he added, \"Well, later today actually.\" There was a creaking sound as they both pushed off from the couch to get to their feet. \"Is it true?\u00a0 \" Charlie whispered. Their voices were farther away now. I strained to hear. \"Did they leave?\u00a0 \" \"Dr. Cullen asked us not to say anything,\" Dr. Gerandy answered. \"The offer was very sudden; they had to choose immediately. Carlisle didn't want to make a big production out of leaving.\" \"A little warning might have been nice,\" Charlie grumbled. Dr. Gerandy sounded uncomfortable when he replied. \"Yes, well, in this situation, some warning might have been called for.\" I didn't want to listen anymore. I felt around for the edge of the quilt someone had laid on top of me, and pulled it over my ear. I drifted in and out of alertness. I heard Charlie whisper thanks to the volunteers as, one by one, they left. I felt his fingers on my forehead, and then the weight of another blanket. The phone rang a few times, and he hurried to catch it before it could wake me. He muttered reassurances in a low voice to the callers. \"Yeah, we found her. She's okay. She got lost. She's fine now,\" he said again and again. I heard the springs in the armchair groan when he settled himself in for the night. A few minutes later, the phone rang again. Charlie moaned as he struggled to his feet, and then he rushed, stumbling, to the kitchen I pulled my head deeper under the blankets, not wanting to listen to the same conversation again. \"Yeah,\" Charlie said, and yawned. His voice changed, it was much more alert when he spoke again. \"Where?\u00a0 '\" There was a pause. \"You're sure it's outside the reservation?\u00a0 \" Another short pause. \"But what could be burning out there?\u00a0 \" He sounded both worried and <em>mystified</em>. \"Look, I'll call down there and check it out.\" I listened with more interest as he punched in a number. \"Hey, Billy, it's Charlie\u2014sorry I'm calling so early\u2026 no, she's fine. She's sleeping\u2026 Thanks, but that's not why I called. I just got a call from Mrs. Stanley, and she says that from her second-story window she can see fires out on the sea cliffs, but I didn't really\u2026 Oh!\" Suddenly there was an edge in his voice\u2014irritation\u2026 or anger. \"And why are they doing that?\u00a0 \u00a0Uh huh. Really?\u00a0 \" He said it sarcastically. \"Well, don't apologize to me. Yeah, yeah. Just make sure the flames don't spread\u2026 I know, I know, I'm surprised they got them lit at all in this weather.\" Charlie hesitated, and then added grudgingly. \"Thanks for sending Sam and the other boys up. You were right\u2014they do know the forest better than we do. It was Sam who found her, so I owe you one\u2026 Yeah, I'll talk to you later,\" he agreed, still sour, before hanging up. Charlie muttered something incoherent as he shuffled back to the living room. \"What's wrong?\u00a0 \" I asked. He hurried to my side. \"I'm sorry I woke you, honey.\" \"Is something burning?\u00a0 \" \"It's nothing,\" he assured me. \"Just some bonfires out on the cliffs.\" \"Bonfires?\u00a0 \" I asked. My voice didn't sound curious. It sounded dead. Charlie frowned. \"Some of the kids from the reservation being rowdy,\" he explained. \"Why?\u00a0 \" I wondered dully. I could tell he didn't want to answer. He looked at the floor under his knees. \"They're celebrating the news.\" His tone was bitter. There was only one piece of news I could think of, try as I might not to. And then the pieces snapped together. \"Because the Cullens left,\" I whispered. \"They don't like the Cullens in La Push\u2014I'd forgotten about that.\" The Quileutes had their superstitions about the \"cold ones,\" the blood-drinkers that were enemies to their tribe, just like they had their legends of the great flood and wolf-men ancestors. Just stories, folklore, to most of them. Then there were the few that believed. Charlie's good friend Billy Black believed, though even Jacob, his own son, thought he was full of stupid superstitions. Billy had warned me to stay away from the Cullens\u2026 The name stirred something inside me, something that began to claw its way toward the surface, something I knew I didn't want to face. \"It's ridiculous,\" Charlie spluttered. We sat in silence for a moment. The sky was no longer black outside the window. Somewhere behind the rain, the sun was beginning to rise. \"Bella?\u00a0 \" Charlie asked. I looked at him uneasily. \"He left you alone in the woods?\u00a0 \" Charlie guessed. I deflected his question. \"How did you know where to find me?\u00a0 \" My mind shied away from the inevitable awareness that was coming, coming quickly now. \"Your note,\" Charlie answered, surprised. He reached into the back pocket of his jeans and pulled out a much-abused piece of paper. It was dirty and damp, with multiple creases from being opened and refolded many times. He unfolded it again, and held it up as evidence. The messy handwriting was remarkably close to my own. Going for a walk with Edward, up the path, it said. Back soon, B. \"When you didn't come back, I called the Cullens, and no one answered,\" Charlie said in a low voice. \"Then I called the hospital, and Dr. Gerandy told me that Carlisle was gone.\" \"Where did they go?\u00a0 \" I mumbled. He stared at me. \"Didn't Edward tell you?\u00a0 \" I shook my head, recoiling. The sound of his name unleashed the thing that was clawing inside of me\u2014a pain that knocked me breathless, astonished me with its force. Charlie eyed me doubtfully as he answered. \"Carlisle took a job with a big hospital in Los Angeles. I guess they threw a lot of money at him.\" Sunny L.A. The last place they would really go. I remembered my nightmare with the mirror\u2026 the bright sunlight shimmering off of his skin\u2014 Agony ripped through me with the memory of his face. \"I want to know if Edward left you alone out there in the middle of the woods,\" Charlie insisted. His name sent another wave of torture through me. I shook my head, frantic, desperate to escape the pain. \"It was my fault. He left me right here on the trail, in sight of the house\u2026 but I tried to follow him.\" Charlie started to say something; childishly, I covered my ears. \"I can't talk about this anymore, Dad. I want to go to my room.\" Before he could answer, I scrambled up from the couch and lurched my way up the stairs. Someone had been in the house to leave a note for Charlie, a note that would lead him to find me. From the minute that I'd realized this, a horrible suspicion began to grow in my head. I rushed to my room, shutting and locking the door behind me before I ran to the CD player by my bed. Everything looked exactly the same as I'd left it. I pressed down on the top of the CD player. The latch unhooked, and the lid slowly swung open. It was empty. The album Renee had given me sat on the floor beside the bed, just where I'd put it last. I lifted the cover with a shaking hand. I didn't have to flip any farther than the first page. The little metal corners no longer held a picture in place. The page was blank except for my own handwriting scrawled across the bottom: Edward Cullen, Charlie's kitchen, Sept. 13th. I stopped there. I was sure that he would have been very thorough. It will be as if I'd never existed, he'd promised me. I felt the smooth wooden floor beneath my knees, and then the palms of my hands, and then it was pressed against the skin of my cheek. I hoped that I was fainting, but, to my disappointment, I didn't lose consciousness. The waves of pain that had only lapped at me before now reared high up and washed over my head, pulling me under. I did not resurface.  OCTOBER NOVEMBER DECEMBER JANUARY",
