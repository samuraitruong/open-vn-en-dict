He met his longtime friend and fellow Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak when he was 16 years old thanks to an introduction from a mutual friend. That was in 1971\u2014years before the two roped in a couple more friends to begin working on their first computers for Apple.  \u00a0 Jobs founded Apple in 1976 along with Wozniak, Ronald Wayne, and A.C. Markkula Jr. in order to create personal computers that regular people could use at home\u2014a young but budding market back in the late '70s. Apple saw some success with its first series of Apple II computers, but the first <em>Macintosh</em> was released to the public in 1984 and became a wild success. Although Jobs was ousted from Apple in 1985 following a power struggle between him and who would become the new CEO, John Sculley, he was never forgotten by the Apple faithful. Jobs made a triumphant return to the struggling company in in 1997 following Apple's purchase of Jobs' other company, NeXT Computer. \u00a0 Since then, Apple has been doing (almost) nothing but going gangbusters on the technology world thanks to Jobs' ambitious-yet-ruthless management style. The original iMac, followed by the iPod, iPhone, MacBook Air, and now the iPad have all seen levels of success that were unfathomable in the mid-'90s. Jobs has arguably positioned himself as one of the most important people in personal technology between the late-1970s and today\u2014a difficult title to strive for during such a technologically innovative time period.  \u00a0 But the legend of Steve Jobs goes much further\u2014and will live much longer\u2014than any single piece of technology that Apple has produced. From stories of Jobs firing people in elevators to recollections of him going to a neighborhood pool party with his son, Jobs somehow managed to maintain a personal reputation as chilled out Buddhist with a type A personality. His high standards, combined with his eye for simplicity, will certainly live on in Apple's future creations.

            "en": "Tech innovator had been battling pancreatic cancer for years Oct. 5, 2011 -- Steve Jobs, the visionary co-founder of Apple Inc. who revolutionized the way we use technology, died today after fighting advanced pancreatic cancer since 2004. The death was announced by the company he helped found. \"Apple has lost a visionary and creative genius, and the world has lost an amazing human being,\" Apple stated in a note on its web site. \"Those of us who have been fortunate enough to know and work with Steve have lost a dear friend and an inspiring mentor. Steve leaves behind a company that only he could have built, and his spirit will forever be the foundation of Apple.\" Unlike many famous people diagnosed with cancer or other fatal illnesses, Jobs revealed few details about his health after he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. That was also true when he resigned from the company in August 2011.\u00a0 Jobs\u2019 shed little insight on his condition in this excerpt from his letter to the Apple Board of Directors: \u201cI have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple\u2019s CEO, I would be the first to let you know. Unfortunately, that day has come. I hereby resign as CEO of Apple. I would like to serve, if the Board sees fit, as Chairman of the Board, director and Apple employee.\u201d He was, however, willing to talk about death, as he did in 2005 commencement speech at Stanford University. He shared his relief at the time that he was diagnosed with a rare form of pancreatic cancer -- one did not mean an immediate death sentence.\u00a0 Yet he was realistic about his future: \u201cRemembering that I\u2019ll be dead soon is the most important tool I\u2019ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything -- all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure -- these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.\u201d Legendary career In his nearly four-decade career, Jobs oversaw the development of some of the most iconic tech products of the past half century. He co-founded Apple Computer Inc. in 1976. Based in Cupertino, Calif., the company developed one of the first commercially successful personal computers, the Apple II. Less than 10 years after its founding, though, Apple\u2019s business had lost its momentum, and, in 1985, Jobs was forced to resign. A year later, Jobs helped found Pixar, the independent animation studio that produced Toy Story and its two sequels, Monsters Inc., Ratatouille, and a host of others Academy Award-winning computer-animated films. Jobs returned to Apple in 1996. The following year he was named CEO, a position he resigned in August 2011. Back to Apple During his second tenure at Apple, the company introduced the iPod, the iPhone, and, most recently, the iPad. The popularity of each propelled Apple into its current position as one of the world\u2019s most valuable technology companies. Meanwhile, its <em>Macintosh</em> line of personal computers has, over the past several years, transformed the company from an also-ran to a top seller in the PC market. But as Jobs was reviving Apple, his own health was suffering. Jobs' pancreatic cancer In 2004, Jobs was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer when a neuroendocrine tumor was discovered in his pancreas. This type of tumor accounts for 3% of all pancreatic tumors.  The distinction between types of pancreatic cancer is an important one. Whereas the most common form of pancreatic cancer is quite aggressive and deadly, neuroendocrine pancreatic cancer typically progresses slowly and is often treatable. \u201cNeuroendocrine cancer has a much better prognosis,\u201d says Rodney Pommier, MD, a surgeon at Oregon Health and Sciences University and an expert in neuroendocrine cancer. Pommier did not participate in Jobs\u2019s care. Jobs had surgery in 2004 to remove the tumor, after which he returned to work. Five years later, though, he took another medical leave of absence from Apple. This time, he underwent a liver transplant at Methodist University Hospital in Memphis. Throughout his illness, Jobs preferred privacy over public disclosure of the details of his condition, and the reason for the liver transplant was never disclosed. There was speculation at the time that it was done because his cancer had spread to his liver. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0",

            "en": "Mr Jobs, who underwent a liver transplant following pancreatic cancer, said he could no longer meet his chief executive's duties and expectations.The Silicon Valley legend will become chairman of the firm.\nThe 56-year-old has been on medical leave for an undisclosed condition since 17 January.\nIn a short letter to the board of Apple, Mr Jobs wrote: \"I have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple's chief executive, I would be the first to let you know.\n\"Unfortunately, that day has come. I hereby resign as chief executive of Apple.\n\"I believe Apple's brightest and most innovative days are ahead of it. And I look forward to watching and contributing to its success in a new role.\n\"I have made some of the best friends of my life at Apple, and I thank you all for the many years of being able to work alongside you.\"\nApple board member Art Levinson paid tribute to Mr Job's contribution to the company: \"Steve's extraordinary vision and leadership saved Apple and guided it to its position as the world's most innovative and valuable technology company.\"\n'Hugely successful'\"Steve is [still] going to be able to provide the input he would do as a chief executive,\" said Colin Gillis at BGC Financial.Analysts said the move was not unexpected, and would have little impact on the day-to-day running of the company.\n\"But Tim has been de facto chief executive for some time and the company has been hugely successful. The vision and the roadmap is intact.\"\nNor will customers see any real difference, analysts said.\n\"At the end of the day, consumers don't buy products from Apple because they're from Steve Jobs, they buy them because they meet their needs and they're good products, and they'll continue to do that,\" Michael Gartenberg from Gartner told the BBC.\nHowever, Apple shares slid more than 5% in after-hours trading, suggesting that some investors were less confident of the company's prospects without Mr Jobs at the helm.\nAt the same time, shares in two of Apple's main Asian rivals gained. Taiwan-based phone maker HTC rose 4.1%, while South Korea's Samsung Electronics gained 3.2%.\nThe firms compete with Apple in the smartphone and tablet-PC sector, and have been involved in legal battles with Apple over patent rights. Analysts said that Mr Jobs' departure may make life easier for rivals.\n\"Maybe this will make the playing field a bit more level,\" Bryan Ma of IDC Asia-Pacific told the BBC's Asia Business Report.\nRevolutionary productsMr Jobs is widely seen as the creative force that has driven Apple to become one of the world's biggest companies.In the three months to the end of June, the company made a profit of $7.3bn on revenues of $28.6bn. It sold more than 20 million iPhones in the period and 9.25 million iPads.Thanks to innovative and hugely popular products such as the iPod, the iPhone and more recently the iPad, Apple has become one of the most sought after brands in the world.\nThe company recently became the valuable US firm after its market capitalisation overtook that of oil company Exxon Mobil.\nMr Jobs started Apple in the 1970s and its <em>Macintosh</em> computers became hugely popular in the 1980s.\nIn 1985, Mr Jobs left the company after falling out with colleagues, only to return in 1997 and begin Apple's transformation by launching the colourful iMac computer.\nThe iPod, which revolutionised the personal music-player market and spawned myriad copycat devices, was launched in 2002 and lay the foundations for the company's success over the past decade.\nNext came the iPhone, which similarly revolutionised the smartphone market, while the iPad confounded some initial scepticism to prove hugely popular.\nMany versions of these products have been launched while Mr Jobs has been on medical leave, and new versions that have been planned for months will not be affected by his departure, analysts said.\n\"In the near term, at least the next two three years, Apple will continue to have a fantastic run because it's got its entire roadmap in place which will continue to work seamlessly,\" Manoj Menon at Frost and Sullivan told the BBC",
