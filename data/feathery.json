            "en": "7 REPETITION        7 REPETITION I wasn't sure what the hell i was doing here. Was I trying to push myself back into the zombie stupor? Had I turned masochistic \u2014 developed a taste for torture? I should have gone straight down to La Push I felt much, much healthier around Jacob. This was not a healthy thing to do. But I continued to drive slowly down the overgrown lane, twisting through the trees that arched over me like a green, living tunnel. My hands were shaking, so I tightened my grip on the steering wheel. I knew that part of the reason I did this was the nightmare, now that I was really awake, the nothingness of the dream gnawed on my nerves, a dog worrying a bone. There was something to search for. Unattainable and impossible, uncaring and\u00a0\u00a0 distracted\u2026 but he was out there, somewhere. I had to believe that. The other part was the strange sense of repetition I'd felt at school today, the coincidence of the date. The feeling that I was starting over\u2014perhaps the way my first day would have gone if I'd really been the most unusual person in the cafeteria that afternoon. The words ran through my head, tonelessly, like I was reading them rather than hearing them spoken: It will be as if I'd never existed. I was lying to myself by splitting my reason for coming here into just two parts. I didn't want to admit the strongest motivation. Because it was mentally unsound. The truth was that I wanted to hear his voice again, like I had in the strange delusion Friday night. For that brief moment, when his voice came from some other part of me than my conscious memory, when his voice was perfect and honey smooth rather than the pale echo my memories usually produced, I was able to remember without pain. It hadn't lasted; the pain had caught up with me, as I was sure it would for this fool's errand. But those precious moments when I could hear him again were an irresistible lure. I had to find some way to repeat the experience\u2026 or maybe the better word was episode. I was hoping that d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu was the key. So I was going to his home, a place I hadn't been since my ill-fated birthday party, so many months ago. The thick, almost jungle-like growth crawled slowly past my windows. The drive wound on and on. I started to go faster, getting edgy. How long had I been driving? Shouldn't I have reached the house yet? The lane was so overgrown that it did not look familiar. What if I couldn't find it? I shivered. What if there was no tangible proof at all? Then there was the break in the trees that I was looking for, only it was not so\u00a0 pronounced as before. The flora here did not wait long to reclaim any land that was left unguarded. The tall ferns had infiltrated the meadow around the house, crowding against the trunks of the cedars, even the wide porch. It was like the lawn had been flooded\u2014waist-high\u2014with green, <em>feathery</em> waves. And the house was there, but it was not the same. Though nothing had changed on the outside, the emptiness screamed from the blank windows. It was creepy. For the first time since I'd seen the beautiful house, it looked like a fitting haunt for vampires. I hit the brakes, looking away. I was afraid to go farther. But nothing happened. No voice in my head. So I left the engine running and jumped out into the fern sea. Maybe, like Friday night, if I walked forward\u2026 I approached the barren, vacant face slowly, my truck rumbling out a comforting roar behind me. I stopped when I got to the porch stairs, because there was nothing here. No lingering sense of their presence\u2026 of his presence. The house was solidly here, but it meant little. Its concrete reality would not counteract the nothingness of the nightmares. I didn't go any closer. I didn't want to look in the windows. I wasn't sure which would be harder to see. If the rooms were bare, echoing empty from floor to ceiling, that would certainly hurt. Like my grandmother's funeral, when my mother had insisted that I stay outside during the viewing. She had said that I didn't need to see Gran that way, to remember her that way, rather than alive. But wouldn't it be worse if there were no change? If the couches sat just as I'd last seen them, the paintings on the walls\u2014worse still, the piano on its low platform? It would be second only to the house disappearing all together, to see that there was no physical possession that tied them in anyway. That everything remained, untouched and forgotten, behind them. Just like me. I turned my back on the gaping emptiness and hurried to my truck. I nearly ran. I was anxious to be gone, to get back to the human world. I felt hideously empty, and I wanted to see Jacob. Maybe I was developing a new kind of sickness, another addiction, like the numbness before. I didn't care. I pushed my truck as fast as it would go as I barreled toward my fix. Jacob was waiting for me. My chest seemed to relax as soon as I saw him, making it easier to breathe. \"Hey, Bella,\" he called. I smiled in relief. \"Hey, Jacob,\" I waved at Billy, who was looking out the window. \"Let's get to work,\" Jacob said in a low but eager voice. I was somehow able to laugh. \"You seriously aren't sick of me yet?\" I wondered. He must be starting to ask himself how desperate I was for company. Jacob led the way around the house to his garage. \"Nope. Not yet.\" \"Please let me know when I start getting on your nerves. I don't want to be a pain.\" \"Okay.\" He laughed, a throaty sound. \"I wouldn't hold your breath for that, though.\" When I walked into the garage, I was shocked to see the red bike standing up, looking like a motorcycle rather than a pile of jagged metal. \"Jake, you're amazing,\" I breathed. He laughed again. \"I get obsessive when I have a project.\" He shrugged. \"If I had any brains I'd drag it out a little bit.\" \"Why?\" He looked down, pausing for so long that I wondered if he hadn't heard my question. Finally, he asked me, \"Bella, if I told you that I couldn't fix these bikes, what would you say?\" I didn't answer right away, either, and he glanced up to check my expression. \"I would say\u2026 that's too bad, but I'll bet we could figure out something else to do. If we got really desperate, we could even do homework.\" Jacob smiled, and his shoulders relaxed. He sat down next to the bike and picked up a wrench. \"So you think you'll still come over when I'm done, then?\" \"Is that what you meant?\" I shook my head. \"I guess I am taking advantage of your very underpriced mechanical skills. But as long as you let me come over, I'll be here.\" \"Hoping to see Quil again?\" he teased. \"You caught me.\" He chuckled. \"You really like spending time with me?\" he asked, marveling. \"Very, very much. And I'll prove it. I have to work tomorrow, but Wednesday we'll do something nonmechanical.\" \"Like what?\" \"I have no idea. We can go to my place so you won't be tempted to be obsessive. You could bring your schoolwork\u2014you have to be getting behind, because I know I am.\" \"Homework might be a good idea.\" He made a face, and I wondered how much he was leaving undone to be with me. \"Yes,\" I agreed. \"We'll have to start being responsible occasionally, or Billy and Charlie aren't going to be so easygoing about this.\" I made a gesture indicating the two of us as a single entity. He liked that\u2014he beamed. \"Homework once a week?\" he proposed. \"Maybe we'd better go with twice,\" I suggested, thinking of the pile I'd just been assigned today. He sighed a heavy sigh. Then he reached over his toolbox to a paper grocery sack. He pulled out two cans of soda, cracking one open and handing it to me. He opened the second, and held it up ceremoniously. \"Here's to responsibility,\" he toasted. \"Twice a week.\" \"And recklessness every day in between,\" I emphasized. He grinned and touched his can to mine. I got home later than I'd planned and found Charlie had ordered a pizza rather than wait for me. He wouldn't let me apologize. \"I don't mind,\" he assured me. \"You deserve a break from all the cooking, anyway.\" I knew he was just relieved that I was still acting like a normal person, and he was not about to rock the boat. I checked my e-mail before I started on my homework, and there was a long one from Renee. She gushed over every detail I'd provided her with, so I sent back another exhaustive description of my day. Everything but the motorcycles. Even happy-go-lucky Renee was likely to be alarmed by that. School Tuesday had its ups and downs. Angela and Mike seemed ready to welcome me back with open arms\u2014to kindly overlook my few months of aberrant behavior. Jess was more resistant. I wondered if she needed a formal written apology for the Port Angeles incident. Mike was animated and chatty at work. It was like he'd stored up the semester's worth of talk, and it was all spilling out now. I found that I was able to smile and laugh with him, though it wasn't as effortless as it was with Jacob. It seemed harmless enough, until quitting time. Mike put the closed sign in the window while I folded my vest and shoved it under the counter. \"This was fun tonight,\" Mike said happily. \"Yeah,\" I agreed, though I'd much rather have spent the afternoon in the garage. \"It's too bad that you had to leave the movie early last week.\" I was a little confused by his train of thought. I shrugged. \"I'm just a wimp, I guess.\" \"What I mean is, you should go to a better movie, something you'd enjoy,\" he explained. \"Oh,\" I muttered, still confused. \"Like maybe this Friday. With me. We could go see something that isn't scary at all.\" I bit my lip. I didn't want to screw things up with Mike, not when he was one of the only people ready to forgive me for being crazy. But this, again, felt far too familiar. Like the last year had never happened. I wished I had Jess as an excuse this time. \"Like a date?\" I asked. Honesty was probably the best policy at this point. Get it over with. He processed the tone of my voice \"If you want. But it doesn't have to be like that.\" \"I don't date,\" I said slowly, realizing how true that was. That whole world seemed impossibly distant. \"Just as friends?\" he suggested. His clear blue eyes were not as eager now. I hoped he really meant that we could be friends anyway. \"That would be fun. But I actually have plans already this Friday, so maybe next week?\" \"What are you doing?\" he asked, less casually than I think he wanted to sound. \"Homework. I have a\u2026 study session planned with a friend.\" \"Oh. Okay. Maybe next week.\" He walked me to my car, less exuberant than before. It reminded me so clearly of my first months in Forks. I'd come full circle, and now everything felt like an echo\u2014an empty echo, devoid of the interest it used to have. The next night, Charlie didn't seem the smallest bit surprised to find Jacob and me sprawled across the living room floor with our books scattered around us, so I guessed that he and Billy were talking behind our backs. \"Hey, kids,\" he said, his eyes straying to the kitchen. The smell of the lasagna I'd spent the afternoon making\u2014while Jacob watched and occasionally sampled\u2014wafted down the hall; I was being good, trying to atone for all the pizza. Jacob stayed for dinner, and took a plate home for Billy. He grudgingly added another year to my negotiable age for being a good cook. Friday was the garage, and Saturday, after my shift at Newton's, was homework again. Charlie felt secure enough in my sanity to spend the day fishing with Harry. When he got back, we were all done\u2014feeling very sensible and mature about it, too\u2014and watching Monster Garage on the Discovery Channel. \"I probably ought to go.\" Jacob sighed. \"It's later than I thought.\" \"Okay, fine,\" I grumbled. \"I'll take you home.\" He laughed at my unwilling expression\u2014it seemed to please him. \"Tomorrow, back to work,\" I said as soon as we were safe in the truck. \"What time do you want me to come up?\" There was an unexplained excitement in his answering smile. \"I'll call you first, okay?\" \"Sure.\" I frowned to myself, wondering what was up. His smile widened. I cleaned the house the next morning\u2014waiting for Jacob to call and trying to shake off the Litest nightmare. The scenery had changed. Last night I'd wandered in a wide sea of ferns interspersed with huge hemlock trees. There was nothing else there, and I was lost, wandering aimless and alone, searching for nothing. I wanted to kick myself for the stupid field trip last week. I shoved the dream out of my conscious mind, hoping it would stay locked up somewhere and not escape again. Charlie was outside washing the cruiser, so when the phone rang, I dropped the toilet brush and ran downstairs to answer it. \"Hello?\" I asked breathlessly. \"Bella,\" Jacob said, a strange, formal tone to his voice. \"Hey, Jake.\" \"I believe that\u2026 we have a date\" he said, his tone thick with implications. It took me a second before I got it. \"They're done? I can't believe it!\" What perfect timing. I needed something to distract me from nightmares and nothingness. \"Yeah, they run and everything.\" \"Jacob, you are absolutely, without a doubt, the most talented and wonderful person I know. You get ten years for this one.\" \"Cool! I'm middle-aged now.\" I laughed. \"I'm on my way up!\" I threw the cleaning supplies under the bathroom counter and grabbed my jacket. \"Headed to see Jake,\" Charlie said when I ran past him. It wasn't really a question. \"Yep,\" I replied as I jumped in my truck. \"I'll be at the station later,\" Charlie called after me. \"Okay,\" I yelled back, turning the key. Charlie said something else, but I couldn't hear him clearly over the roar of the engine. It sounded sort of like, \"Where's the fire?\" I parked my truck off to the side of the Blacks' house, close to the trees, to make it easier for us to sneak the bikes out. When I got out, a splash of color caught my eye\u2014two shiny motorcycles, one red, one black, were hidden under a spruce, invisible from the house. Jacob was prepared. There was a piece of blue ribbon tied in a small bow around each of the handlebars. I was laughing at that when Jacob ran out of the house. \"Ready?\" he asked in a low voice, his eyes sparkling. I glanced over his shoulder, and there was no sign of Billy. \"Yeah,\" I said, but I didn't feel quite as excited as before; I was trying to imagine myself actually on the motorcycle. Jacob loaded the bikes into the bed of the truck with ease, laying them carefully on their sides so they didn't show. \"Let's go,\" he said, his voice higher than usual with excitement. \"I know the perfect spot\u2014no one will catch us there.\" We drove south out of town. The dirt road wove in and out of the forest\u2014sometimes there was nothing but trees, and then there would suddenly be a breathtaking glimpse of the Pacific Ocean, reaching to the horizon, dark gray under the clouds. We were above the shore, on top of the cliffs that bordered the beach here and the view seemed to stretch on forever. I was driving slowly, so that I could safely stare out across the ocean now and then, as the road wound closer to the sea cliffs. Jacob was talking about finishing the bikes, but his descriptions were getting technical, so I wasn't paying close attention. That was when I noticed four figures standing on a rocky ledge, much too close to the precipice. I couldn't tell from the distance how old they were, but I assumed they were men. Despite the chill in the air today, they seemed to be wearing only shorts. As I watched, the tallest person stepped closer to the brink. I slowed automatically, my foot hesitating over the brake pedal. And then he threw himself off the edge. \"No!\" I shouted, stomping down on the brake. \"What's wrong?\" Jacob shouted back, alarmed.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \"That guy\u2014he just jumped off the cliff! Why didn't they stop him? We've got to call an ambulance!\" I threw open my door and started to get out, which made no sense at all. The fastest way to a phone was to drive back to Billy's. But I couldn't believe what I'd just seen. Maybe, subconsciously, I hoped I would see something different without the glass of the windshield in the way. Jacob laughed, and I spun to stare at him wildly. How could he be so calloused, so cold-blooded? \"They're just cliff diving, Bella. Recreation. La Push doesn't have a mall, you know.\" He was teasing, but there was a strange note of irritation in his voice. \"Cliff diving?\" I repeated, dazed. I stared in disbelief as a second figure stepped to the edge, paused, and then very gracefully leaped into space. He fell for what seemed like an eternity to me, finally cutting smoothly into the dark gray waves below. \"Wow. It's so high.\" I slid back into my seat, still staring wide-eyed at the two remaining divers. \"It must be a hundred feet.\" \"Well, yeah, most of us jump from lower down, that rock that juts out from the cliff about halfway.\" He pointed out his window. The place he indicated did seem much more reasonable. \"Those guys are insane. Probably showing off how tough they are. I mean, really, it's freezing today. That water can't feel good.\" He made a disgruntled face, as if the stunt personally offended him. It surprised me a little. I would have thought Jacob was nearly impossible to upset. \"You jump off the cliff?\" I hadn't missed the \"us.\" \"Sure, sure.\" He shrugged and grinned. \"It's fun. A little scary, kind of a rush.\" I looked back at the cliffs, where the third figure was pacing the edge. I'd never witnessed anything so reckless in all my life. My eyes widened, and I smiled. \"Jake, you have to take me cliff diving.\" He frowned back at me, his face disapproving. \"Bella, you just wanted to call an ambulance for Sam,\" he reminded me. I was surprised that he could tell who it was from this distance. \"I want to try,\" I insisted, start ing to get out of the car again. Jacob grabbed my wrist. \"Not today, all right? Can we at least wait for a warmer day?\" \"Okay, fine,\" I agreed. With the door open, the glacial breeze was raising goose bumps on my arm. \"But I want to go soon.\" \"Soon.\" He rolled his eyes. \"Sometimes you're a little strange, Bella. Do you know that?\" I sighed. \"Yes.\" \"And we're not jumping off the top.\" I watched, fascinated, as the third boy made a running start and flung himself farther into the empty air than the other two. He twisted and cart wheeled through space as he fell, like he was skydiving. He looked absolutely free\u2014 unthinking and utterly irresponsible. \"Fine,\" I agreed. \"Not the first time, anyway.\" Now Jacob sighed. \"Are we going to try out the bikes or not?\" he demanded. \"Okay, okay,\" I said, tearing my eyes away from the last person waiting on the cliff. I put my seat belt back on and closed the door. The engine was still running, roaring as it idled. We started down the road again. \"So who were those guys\u2014the crazy ones?\" I wondered. He made a disgusted sound in the back of his throat. \"The La Push gang.\" \"You have a gang?\" I asked. I realized that I sounded impressed. He laughed once at my reaction. \"Not like that. I swear, they're like hall monitors gone bad. They don't start fights, they keep the peace.\" He snorted. \"There was this guy from up somewhere by the Makah rez, big guy too, scary-looking. Well, word got around that he was selling meth to kids, and Sam Uley and his disciples ran him off our land. They're all about our land, and tribe pride\u2026 it's getting ridiculous. The worst part is that the council takes them seriously. Embry said that the council actually meets with Sam.\" He shook his head, face full of resentment. \"Embry also heard from Leah Clearwater that they call themselves 'protectors' or something like that.\" Jacob's hands were clenched into fists, as if he'd like to hit something. I'd never seen this side of him.  I was surprised to hear Sam Uley's name. I didn't want it to bring back the images from my nightmare, so I made a quick observation to distract myself. \"You don't like them very much.\" \"Does it show?\" he asked sarcastically. \"Well\u2026 It doesn't sound like they're doing anything bad.\" I tried to soothe him, to make him cheerful again. \"Just sort of annoyingly goody-two-shoes for a gang.\" \u201cYeah. Annoying is a good word. They're always showing off\u2014like the cliff thing. They act like\u2026 like, I don't know. Like tough guys. I was hanging out at the store with Embry and Quil once, last semester, and Sam came by with his followers, Jared and Paul. Quil said something, you know how he's got a big mouth, and it pissed Paul off. His eyes got all dark, and he sort of smiled\u2014no, he showed his teeth but he didn't smile\u2014and it was like he was so mad he was shaking or something. But Sam put his hand against Paul's chest and shook his head. Paul looked at him for a minute and calmed down. Honestly, it was like Sam was holding him back\u2014like Paul was going to tear us up if Sam didn't stop him.\" He groaned. \"Like a bad western. You know, Sam's a pretty big guy, he's twenty. But Paul's just sixteen, too, shorter than me and not as beefy as Quil. I think any one of us could take him.\" \"Tough guys,\" I agreed. I could see it in my head as he described it, and it reminded me of something\u2026 a trio of tall, dark men standing very still and close together in my father's living room. The picture was sideways, because my head was lying against the couch while Dr. Gerandy and Charlie leaned over me\u2026 Had that been Sam's gang? I spoke quickly again to divert myself from the bleak memories. \"Isn't Sam a little too old for this kind of thing?\" \"Yeah. He was supposed to go to college, but he stayed. And no one gave him any crap about it, either.\u00a0 The whole council pitched a fit when my sister turned down a partial scholarship and got married. But, oh no, Sam Uley can do no wrong.\" His face was set in unfamiliar lines of outrage\u2014outrage and something else I didn't recognize at first. \"It all sounds really annoying and\u2026 strange. But I don't get why you're taking it so personally.\" I peeked over at his face, hoping I hadn't offended him. He was suddenly calm, staring out the side window. \"You just missed the turn,\" he said in an even voice. I executed a very wide U-turn, nearly hitting a tree as my circle ran the truck halfway off the road. \"Thanks for the heads-up,\" I muttered as I started up the side road. \"Sorry, I wasn't paying attention.\" It was quiet for a brief minute. \"You can stop anywhere along here,\" he said softly. I pulled over and cut the engine. My ears rang in the silence that followed. We both got out, and Jacob headed around to the back to get the bikes. I tried to read his expression. Something more was bothering him. I'd hit a nerve. He smiled halfheartedly as he pushed the red bike to my side. \"Happy late birthday. Are you ready for this?\" \"I think so.\" The bike suddenly looked intimidating, frightening, as I realized I would soon be astride it. \"We'll take it slow,\" he promised. I gingerly leaned the motorcycle against the truck's fender while he went to get his. \"Jake\u2026\"I hesitated as he came back around the truck. \"Yeah?\" \"What's really bothering you? About the Sam thing, I mean? Is there something else?\" I watched his face. He grimaced, but he didn't seem angry. He looked at the dirt and kicked his shoe against the front tire of his bike again and again, like he was keeping time. He sighed. \"It's just\u2026 the way they treat me. It creeps me out.\" The words started to rush out now. \"You know, the council is supposed to be made up of equals, but if there was a leader, it would be my dad. I've never been able to figure out why people treat him the way they do. Why his opinion counts the most. It's got something to do with his father and his father's father. My great-grandpa, Ephraim Black, was sort of the last chief we had, and they still listen to Billy, maybe because of that.\u201d  \"But I'm just like everyone else. Nobody treats me special\u2026 until now.\" That caught me off guard. \"Sam treats you special?\" \"Yeah,\" he agreed, looking up at me with troubled eyes. \"He looks at me like he's waiting for something\u2026 like I'm going to join his stupid gang someday. He pays more attention to me than any of the other guys. I hate it.\" \"You don't have to join anything.\" My voice was angry. This was really upsetting Jacob, and that infuriated me. Who did these \"protectors\" think they were? \"Yeah.\" His foot kept up its rhythm against the tire. \"What?\" I could tell there was more.  He frowned, his eyebrows pulling up in a way that looked sad and worried rather than angry. \"It's Embry. He's been avoiding me lately.\" The thoughts didn't seem connected, but I wondered if I was to blame for the problems with his friend. \"You've been hanging out with me a lot,\" I reminded him, feeling selfish. I'd been monopolizing him. \"No, that's not it. It's not just me\u2014it's Quil, too, and everyone. Embry missed a week of school, but he was never home when we tried to see him. And when he came back, he looked\u2026 he looked freaked out. Terrified. Quil and I both tried to get him to tell us what was wrong, but he wouldn't talk to either one of us.\" I stared at Jacob, biting my lip anxiously\u2014he was really frightened. But he didn't look at me. He watched his own foot kicking the rubber as if it belonged to someone else. The tempo increased. \"Then this week, out of nowhere, Embry's hanging out with Sam and the rest of them. He was out on the cliffs today.\" His voice was low and tense. He finally looked at me. \"Bella, they bugged him even more than they bother me. He didn't want anything to do with them. And now Embry's following Sam around like he's joined a cult. \"And that's the way it was with Paul. Just exactly the same. He wasn't friends with Sam at all. Then he stopped coming to school for a few weeks, and, when he came back, suddenly Sam owned him. I don't know what it means. I can't figure it out, and I feel like I have to, because Embry's my friend and\u2026 Sam's looking at me funny.. and\u2026\" He trailed off. \"Have you talked to Billy about this?\" I asked. His horror was spreading to me. I had chills running on the back of my neck. Now there was anger on his face. \"Yes,\" he snorted. \"That was helpful.\" \"What did he say?\" Jacob's expression was sarcastic, and when he spoke, his voice mocked the deep tones of his father's voice. \"It's nothing you need to worry about now, Jacob. In a few years, if you don't\u2026 well, I'll explain later.\" And then his voice was his own. \"What am I supposed to get from that? Is he trying to say it's some stupid puberty, coming-of-age thing? This is something else. Something wrong.\" He was biting his lower lip and clenching his hands. He looked like he was about to cry. I threw my arms around him instinctively, wrapping them around his waist and pressing my face against his chest. He was so big, I felt like I was a child hugging a grown-up. \"Oh, Jake, it'll be okay!\" I promised. \"If it gets worse you can come live with me and Charlie. Don't be scared, we'll think of something!\" He was frozen for a second, and then his long arms wrapped hesitantly around me. \"Thanks, Bella.\" His voice was huskier than usual. We stood like that for a moment, and it didn't upset me; in fact, I felt comforted by the contact. This didn't feel anything like the last time someone had embraced me this way. This was friendship. And Jacob was very warm. It was strange for me, being this close\u2014emotionally rather than physically, though the physical was strange for me, too\u2014to another human being. It wasn't my usual style. I didn't normally relate to people so easily, on such a basic level. Not human beings. \"If this is how you're going to react, I'll freak out more often.\" Jacob's voice was light, normal again, and his laughter rumbled against my ear. His fingers touched my hair, soft and tentative. Well, it was friendship for me. I pulled away quickly, laughing with him, but determined to put things back in perspective at once. \"It's hard to believe I'm two years older than you,\" I said, emphasizing the word older. \"You make me feel like a dwarf.\" Standing this close to him, I really had to crane my neck to see his face. \"You're forgetting I'm in my forties, of course.\" \"Oh, that's right.\" He patted my head. \"You're like a little doll,\" he teased. \"A porcelain doll.\" I rolled my eyes, taking another step away. \"Let's not start with the albino cracks.\" \"Seriously, Bella, are you sure you're not?\" He stretched his russet arm out next to mine. The difference wasn't flattering. \"I've never seen anyone paler than you\u2026 well, except for\u2014\" He broke off, and I looked away, trying to not understand what he had been about to say. \"So are we going to ride or what?\" \"Let's do it,\" I agreed, more enthusiastic than I would have been half a minute ago. His unfinished sentence reminded me of why I was here.",

            "en": "7 REPETITION        21 VERDICT WE WERE IN A BRIGHTLY LIT, UNREMARKABLE HALLWAY. The walls were off-white, the floor carpeted in industrial gray. Common rectangular fluorescent lights were spaced evenly along the ceiling. It was warmer here, for which I was grateful. This hall seemed very benign after the gloom of the ghoulish stone sewers. Edward didn't seem to agree with my assessment. He glowered darkly down the long hallway, toward the slight, black shrouded figure at the end, standing by an elevator. He pulled me along, and Alice walked on my other side. The heavy door creaked shut behind us, and then there was the thud of a bolt sliding home.\u00a0 Jane waited by the elevator, one hand holding the doors open for us. Her expression was apathetic. Once inside the elevator, the three vampires that belonged to the Volturi relaxed further. They threw back their cloaks, letting the hoods fall back on their shoulders. Felix and Demetri were both of a slightly olive complexion\u2014it looked odd combined with their chalky pallor. Felix's black hair was cropped short, but Demetri's waved to his shoulders. Their irises were deep crimson around the edges, darkening until they were black around the pupil. Under the shrouds, their clothes were modern, pale, and nondescript. I cowered in the corner, cringing against Edward. His hand still rubbed against my arm. He never took his eyes off Jane. The elevator ride was short; we stepped out into what looked like a posh office reception area. The walls were paneled in wood, the floors carpeted in thick, deep green. There were no windows, but large, brightly lit paintings of the Tuscan countryside hung everywhere as replacements. Pale leather couches were arranged in cozy groupings, and the glossy tables held crystal vases full of vibrantly colored bouquets. The flowers' smell reminded me of a funeral home.  In the middle of the room was a high, polished mahogany counter. I gawked in astonishment at the woman behind it. She was tall, with dark skin and green eyes. She would have been very pretty in any other company\u2014but not here. Because she was every bit as human as I was. I couldn't comprehend what this human woman was doing here, totally at ease, surrounded by vampires.  She smiled politely in welcome. \"Good afternoon, Jane,\" she said. There was no surprise in her face as she glanced at Jane's company. Not Edward, his bare chest glinting dimly in the white lights, or even me, disheveled and comparatively hideous. Jane nodded. \"Gianna.\" She continued toward a set of double doors in the back of the room, and we followed. As Felix passed the desk, he winked at Gianna, and she giggled. On the other side of the wooden doors was a different kind of reception. The pale boy in the pearl gray suit could have been Jane's twin. His hair was darker, and his lips were not as full, but he was just as lovely. He came forward to meet us. He smiled, reaching for her. \"Jane.\" \"Alec,\" she responded, embracing the boy. They kissed each other's cheeks on both sides. Then he looked at us. \"They send you out for one and you come back with two\u2026 and a half,\" he noted, looking at me. \"Nice work.\" She laughed\u2014the sound sparkled with delight like a baby's cooing. \"Welcome back, Edward,\" Alec greeted him. \"You seem in a better mood.\" \"Marginally,\" Edward agreed in a flat voice. I glanced at Edward's hard face, and wondered how his mood could have been darker before. Alec chuckled, and examined me as I clung to Edward's side. \"And this is the cause of all the trouble?\" he asked, skeptical. Edward only smiled, his expression contemptuous. Then he froze. \"Dibs,\" Felix called casually from behind. Edward turned, a low snarl building deep in his chest. Felix smiled\u2014his hand was raised, palm up; he curled his fingers twice, inviting Edward forward. Alice touched Edward's arm. \"Patience,\" she cautioned him. They exchanged a long glance, and I wished I could hear what she was telling him. I figured that it was something to do with not attacking Felix, because Edward took a deep breath and turned back to Alec. \"Aro will be so pleased to see you again,\" Alec said, as if nothing had passed. \"Let's not keep him waiting,\" Jane suggested. Edward nodded once. Alec and Jane, holding hands, led the way down yet another wide, ornate hall\u2014would there ever be an end? They ignored the doors at the end of the hall\u2014doors entirely sheathed in gold\u2014stopping halfway down the hall and sliding aside a piece of the paneling to expose a plain wooden door. It wasn't locked. Alec held it open for Jane. I wanted to groan when Edward pulled me through to the other side of the door. It was the same ancient stone as the square, the alley, and the sewers. And it was dark and cold again. The stone antechamber was not large. It opened quickly into a brighter, cavernous room, perfectly round like a huge castle turret\u2026 which was probably exactly what it was. Two stories up, long window slits threw thin rectangles of bright sunlight onto the stone floor below. There were no artificial lights. The only furniture in the room were several massive wooden chairs, like thrones, that were spaced unevenly, flush with the curving stone walls. In the very center of the circle, in a slight depression, was another drain. I wondered if they used it as an exit, like the hole in the street. The room was not empty. A handful of people were convened in seemingly relaxed conversation. The murmur of low, smooth voices was a gentle hum in the air. As I watched, a pair of pale women in summer dresses paused in a patch of light, and, like prisms, their skin threw the light in rainbow sparkles against the sienna walls. The exquisite faces all turned toward our party as we entered the room. Most of the immortals were dressed in inconspicuous pants and shirts\u2014things that wouldn't stick out at all on the streets below. But the man who spoke first wore one of the long robes. It was pitch-black, and brushed against the floor. For a moment, I thought his long, jet-black hair was the hood of his cloak. \"Jane, dear one, you've returned!\" he cried in evident delight. His voice was just a soft sighing. He drifted forward, and the movement flowed with such surreal grace that I gawked, my mouth hanging open. Even Alice, whose every motion looked like dancing, could not compare. I was only more astonished as he floated closer and I could see his face. It was not like the unnaturally attractive faces that surrounded him (for he did not approach us alone; the entire group converged around him, some following, and some walking ahead of him with the alert manner of bodyguards). I couldn't decide if his face was beautiful or not. I suppose the features were perfect.  But he was as different from the vampires beside him as they were from me. His skin was translucently white, like onionskin, and it looked just as delicate\u2014it stood in shocking contrast to the long black hair that framed his face. I felt a strange, horrifying urge to touch his cheek, to see if it was softer than Edward's or Alice's, or if it was powdery, like chalk. His eyes were red, the same as the others around him, but the color was clouded, milky; I wondered if his vision was affected by the haze. He glided to Jane, took her face in his papery hands, kissed her lightly on her full lips, and then floated back a step. \"Yes, Master.\" Jane smiled; the expression made her look like an angelic child. \"I brought him back alive, just as you wished.\" \"Ah, Jane.\" He smiled, too. \"You are such a comfort to me.\" He turned his misty eyes toward us, and the smile brightened\u2014became ecstatic. \"And Alice and Bella, too!\" he rejoiced, clapping his thin hands together. \"This is a happy surprise!  Wonderful!\" I stared in shock as he called our names informally, as if we were old friends dropping in for an unexpected visit. He turned to our hulking escort. \"Felix, be a dear and tell my brothers about our company. I'm sure they wouldn't want to miss this.\" \"Yes, Master.\" Felix nodded and disappeared back the way we had come. \"You see, Edward?\" The strange vampire turned and smiled at Edward like a fond but scolding grandfather. \"What did I tell you? Aren't you glad that I didn't give you what you wanted yesterday?\" \"Yes, Aro, I am,\" he agreed, tightening his arm around my waist. \"I love a happy ending.\" Aro sighed. \"They are so rare. But I want the whole story. How did this happen? Alice?\" He turned to gaze at Alice with curious, misty eyes. \"Your brother seemed to think you infallible, but apparently there was some mistake.\" \"Oh, I'm far from infallible.\" She flashed a dazzling smile. She looked perfectly at ease, except that her hands were balled into tight little fists. \"As you can see today, I cause problems as often as I cure them.\" \"You're too modest,\" Aro chided. \"I've seen some of your more amazing exploits, and I must admit I've never observed anything like your talent. Wonderful!\" Alice flickered a glance at Edward. Aro did not miss it. \"I'm sorry, we haven't been introduced properly at all, have we? It's just that I feel like I know you already, and I tend get ahead of myself. Your brother introduced us yesterday, in a peculiar way. You see, I share some of your brother's talent, only I am limited in a way that he is not.\" Aro shook his head; his tone was envious. \"And also exponentially more powerful,\" Edward added dryly. He looked at Alice as he swiftly explained. \"Aro needs physical contact to hear your thoughts, but he hears much more than I do. You know I can only hear what's passing through your head in the moment. Aro hears every thought your mind has ever had.\" Alice raised her delicate eyebrows, and Edward inclined his head. Aro didn't miss that either. \"But to be able to hear from a distance\u2026\" Aro sighed, gesturing toward the two of them, and the exchange that had just taken place. \"That would be so convenient.\" Aro looked over our shoulders. All the other heads turned in the same direction, including Jane, Alec, and Demetri, who stood silently beside us. I was the slowest to turn. Felix was back, and behind him floated two more black-robed men. Both looked very much like Aro, one even had the same flowing black hair. The other had a shock of snow-white hair\u2014the same shade as his face\u2014that brushed against his shoulders. Their faces had identical, paper-thin skin. The trio from Carlisle's painting was complete, unchanged by the last three hundred years since it was painted. \"Marcus, Caius, look!\" Aro crooned. \"Bella is alive after all, and Alice is here with her! Isn't that wonderful?\" Neither of the other two looked as if wonderful would be their first choice of words. The dark-haired man seemed utterly bored, like he'd seen too many millennia of Aro's enthusiasm. The other's face was sour under the snowy hair. Their lack of interest did not curb Aro's enjoyment. \"Let us have the story,\" Aro almost sang in his <em>feathery</em> voice. The white-haired ancient vampire drifted away, gliding toward one of the wooden thrones. The other paused beside Aro, and he reached his hand out, at first I thought to take Aro's hand. But he just touched Aro's palm briefly and then dropped his hand to his side. Aro raised one black brow. I wondered how his papery skin did not crumple in the effort. Edward snorted very quietly, and Alice looked at him, curious. \"Thank you, Marcus,\" Aro said. \"That's quite interesting.\" I realized, a second late, that Marcus was letting Aro know his thoughts. Marcus didn't look interested. He glided away from Aro to join the one who must be Caius, seated against the wall. Two of the attending vampires followed silently behind him\u2014bodyguards, like I'd thought before. I could see that the two women in the sundresses had gone to stand beside Caius in the same manner. The idea of any vampire needing a guard was faintly ridiculous to me, but maybe the ancient ones were as frail as their skin suggested. Aro was shaking his head. \"Amazing,\"' he said. \"Absolutely amazing.\" Alice's expression was frustrated. Edward turned to her and explained again in a swift, low voice.  \"Marcus sees relationships. He's surprised by the intensity of ours.\" Aro smiled. \"So convenient,\" he repeated to himself. Then he spoke to us. \"It takes quite a bit to surprise Marcus, I can assure you.\" I looked at Marcus's dead face, and I believed that. \"It's just so difficult to understand, even now,\" Aro mused, staring at Edward's arm wrapped around me. It was hard for me to follow Aro's chaotic train of thought. I struggled to keep up. \"How can you stand so close to her like that?\" \"It's not without effort,\" Edward answered calmly. \"But still\u2014la tua cantante! What a waste!\" Edward chuckled once without humor. \"I look at it more as a price.\" Aro was skeptical. \"A very high price.\" \"Opportunity cost.\" Aro laughed. \"If I hadn't smelled her through your memories, I wouldn't have believed the call of anyone's blood could be so strong. I've never felt anything like it myself. Most of us would trade much for such a gift, and yet you\u2026\" \"Waste it,\" Edward finished, his voice sarcastic now. Aro laughed again. \"Ah, how I miss my friend Carlisle! You remind me of him\u2014only he was not so angry.\" \"Carlisle outshines me in many other ways as well.\" \"I certainly never thought to see Carlisle bested for self-control of all things, but you put him to shame.\" \"Hardly.\" Edward sounded impatient. As if he were tired of the preliminaries. It made me more afraid; I couldn't help but try to imagine what he expected would follow. \"I am gratified by his success,\" Aro mused. \"Your memories of him are quite a gift for me, though they astonish me exceedingly. I am surprised by how it\u2026 pleases me, his success in this unorthodox path he's chosen. I expected that he would waste, weaken with time. I'd scoffed at his plan to find others who would share his peculiar vision. Yet, somehow, I'm happy to be wrong.\" Edward didn't reply. \"But your restraint!\" Aro sighed. \"I did not know such strength was possible. To inure yourself against such a siren call, not just once but again and again\u2014if I had not felt it myself, I would not have believed.\" Edward gazed back at Aro's admiration with no expression. I knew his face well enough\u2014time had not changed that\u2014to guess at something seething beneath the surface. I fought to keep my breathing even. \"Just remembering how she appeals to you\u2026\" Aro chuckled. \"It makes me thirsty.\" Edward tensed. \"Don't be disturbed,\" Aro reassured him. \"I mean her no harm. But I am so curious, about one thing in particular.\" He eyed me with bright interest. \"May I?\" he asked eagerly, lifting one hand. \"Ask her,\" Edward suggested in a flat voice. \"Of course, how rude of me!\" Aro exclaimed. \"Bella,\" he addressed me directly now. \"I'm fascinated that you are the one exception to Edward's impressive talent\u2014so very interesting that such a thing should occur! And I was wondering, since our talents are similar in many ways, if you would be so kind as to allow me to try\u2014to see if you are an exception for me, as well?\" My eyes flashed up to Edward's face in terror. Despite Aro's overt politeness, I didn't believe I really had a choice. I was horrified at the thought of allowing him to touch me, and yet also perversely intrigued by the chance to feel his strange skin. Edward nodded in encouragement\u2014whether because he was sure Aro would not hurt me, or because there was no choice, I couldn't tell. I turned back to Aro and raised my hand slowly in front of me. It was trembling. He glided closer, and I believe he meant his expression to be reassuring. But his papery features were too strange, too alien and frightening, to reassure. The look on his face was more confident than his words had been. Aro reached out, as if to shake my hand, and pressed his insubstantial-looking skin against mine. It was hard, but felt brittle\u2014shale rather than granite\u2014and even colder than I expected. His filmy eyes smiled down at mine, and it was impossible to look away. They were mesmerizing in an odd, unpleasant way. Aro's face altered as I watched. The confidence wavered and became first doubt, then incredulity before he calmed it into a friendly mask. \"So very interesting,\" he said as he released my hand and drifted back. My eyes flickered to Edward, and, though his face was composed, I thought he seemed a little smug. Aro continued to drift with a thoughtful expression. He was quiet for a moment, his eyes flickering between the three of us. Then, abruptly, he shook his head. \"A first,\" he said to himself \"I wonder if she is immune to our other talents\u2026 Jane, dear?\" \"No!\" Edward snarled the word. Alice grabbed his arm with a restraining hand. He shook her off. Little Jane smiled up happily at Aro. \"Yes, Master?\" Edward was truly snarling now, the sound ripping and tearing from him, glaring at Aro with baleful eyes. The room had gone still, everyone watching him with amazed disbelief, as if he were committing some embarrassing social faux pas. I saw Felix grin hopefully and move a step forward. Aro glanced at him once, and he froze in place, his grin turning to a sulky expression. Then he spoke to Jane. \"I was wondering, my dear one, if Bella is immune to you.\" I could barely hear Aro over Edward's furious growls. He let go of me, moving to hide me from their view. Caius ghosted in our direction, with his entourage, to watch. Jane turned toward us with a beatific smile. \"Don't!\" Alice cried as Edward launched himself at the little girl. Before I could react, before anyone could jump between them, before Aro's bodyguards could tense, Edward was on the ground. No one had touched him, but he was on the stone floor writhing in obvious agony, while I stared in horror. Jane was smiling only at him now, and it all clicked together. What Alice had said about formidable gifts , why everyone treated Jane with such deference, and why Edward had thrown himself in her path before she could do that to me. \"Stop!\" I shrieked, my voice echoing in the silence, jumping forward to put myself between them. But Alice threw her arms around me in an unbreakable grasp and ignored my struggles. No sound escaped Edward's lips as he cringed against the stones. It felt like my head would explode from the pain of watching this. \"Jane,\" Aro recalled her in a tranquil voice. She looked up quickly, still smiling with pleasure, her eyes questioning. As soon as Jane looked away, Edward was still. Aro inclined his head toward me. Jane turned her smile in my direction. I didn't even meet her gaze. I watched Edward from the prison of Alice's arms, still struggling pointlessly. \"He's fine,\" Alice whispered in a tight voice. As she spoke, he sat up, and then sprang lightly to his feet. His eyes met mine, and they were horror-struck. At first I thought the horror was for what he had just suffered. But then he looked quickly at Jane, and back to me\u2014and his face relaxed into relief. I looked at Jane, too, and she no longer smiled. She glared at me, her jaw clenched with the intensity of her focus. I shrank back, waiting for the pain. Nothing happened. Edward was by my side again. He touched Alice's arm, and she surrendered me to him. Aro started to laugh. \"Ha, ha. ha,\" he chuckled. \"This is wonderful!\" Jane hissed in frustration, leaning forward like she was preparing to spring. \"Don't be put out, dear one,\" Aro said in a comforting tone, placing a powder-light hand on her shoulder. \"She confounds us all.\" Jane's upper lip curled back ever her teeth as she continued to glare at me. \"Ha, ha, ha,\" Aro chortled again. \"You're very brave, Edward, to endure in silence. I asked Jane to do that to me once\u2014just out of curiosity.\" He shook his head in admiration. Edward glared, disgusted. \"So what do we do with you now?\" Aro sighed. Edward and Alice stiffened. This was the part they'd been waiting for. I began to tremble. \"I don't suppose there's any chance that you've changed your mind?\" Aro asked Edward hopefully. \"Your talent would be an excellent addition to our little company.\" Edward hesitated. From the corner of my eye, I saw both Felix and Jane grimace. Edward seemed to weigh each word before he spoke it. \"I'd\u2026 rather\u2026 not.\" \"Alice?\" Aro asked, still hopeful. \"Would you perhaps be interested in joining with us?\" \"No, thank you,\" Alice said. \"And you, Bella?\" Aro raised his eyebrows. Edward hissed, low in my ears. I stared at Aro blankly. Was he joking? Or was he really asking me if I wanted to stay for dinner? It was the white-haired Caius who broke the silence. \"What?\" he demanded of Aro; his voice, though no more than a whisper, was flat. \"Caius, surely you see the potential,\" Aro chided him affectionately. \"I haven't seen a prospective talent so promising since we found Jane and Alec. Can you imagine the possibilities when she is one of us?\" Caius looked away with a caustic expression. Jane's eyes sparked with indignation at the comparison. Edward fumed beside me. I could hear a rumble in his chest, building toward a growl. I couldn't let his temper get him hurt. \"No, thank you,\" I spoke up in barely more than a whisper, my voice breaking in fright. Aro sighed. \"That's unfortunate. Such a waste.\" Edward hissed. \"Join or die, is that it? I suspected as much when we were brought to this room. So much for your laws.\" The tone of his voice surprised me. He sounded irate, but there was something deliberate about his delivery\u2014as if he'd chosen his words with great care. \"Of course not.\" Aro blinked, astonished. \"We were already convened here, Edward, awaiting Heidi's return. Not for you.\" \"Aro,\" Caius hissed. \"The law claims them.\" Edward glared at Caius. \"How so?\" he demanded. He must have known what Caius was thinking, but he seemed determined to make him speak it aloud. Caius pointed a skeletal finger at me. \"She knows too much. You have exposed our secrets.\" His voice was papery thin, just like his skin. \"There are a few humans in on your charade here, as well,\" Edward reminded him, and I thought of the pretty receptionist below. Caius's face twisted into a new expression. Was it supposed to be a smiled. \"Yes,\" he agreed. \"But when they are no longer useful to us, they will serve to sustain us. That is not your plan for this one. If she betrays our secrets, are you prepared to destroy her? I think not,\" he scoffed. \"I wouldn't\u2014,\" I began, still whispering. Caius silenced me with an icy look. \"Nor do you intend to make her one of us,\" Caius continued. \"Therefore, she is a vulnerability. Though it is true, for this, only her life is forfeit. You may leave if you wish.\" Edward bared his teeth. \"That's what I thought,\" Caius said, with something akin to pleasure. Felix leaned forward, eager. \"Unless\u2026\" Aro interrupted. He looked unhappy with the way the conversation had gone. \"Unless you do intend to give her immortality?\" Edward pursed his lips, hesitating for a moment before he answered. \"And if I do?\" Aro smiled, happy again. \"Why, then you would be free to go home and give my regards to my friend Carlisle.\" His expression turned more hesitant. \"But I'm afraid you would have to mean it.\" Aro raised his hand in front of him. Caius, who had begun to scowl furiously, relaxed. Edward's lips tightened into a fierce line. He stared into my eyes, and I stared back. \"Mean it,\" I whispered. \"Please.\" Was it really such a loathsome idea? Would he rather die than change me? I felt like I'd been kicked in the stomach. Edward stared down at me with a tortured expression. And then Alice stepped away from us, forward toward Aro. We turned to watch her. Her hand was raised like his. She didn't say anything, and Aro waved off his anxious guard as they moved to block her approach. Aro met her halfway, and took her hand with an eager, acquisitive glint in his eyes. He bent his head over their touching hands, his eyes closing as he concentrated. Alice was motionless, her face blank. I heard Edward's teeth snap together. No one moved. Aro seemed frozen over Alice's hand. The seconds passed and I grew more and more stressed, wondering how much time would pass before it was too much time. Before it meant something was wrong\u2014more wrong than it already was. Another agonizing moment passed, and then Aro's voice broke the silence. \"Ha, ha, ha,\" he laughed, his head still bent forward. He looked up slowly, his eyes bright with excitement. \"That was fascinating!\" Alice smiled dryly. \"I'm glad you enjoyed it.\" \"To see the things you've seen\u2014especially the ones that haven't happened yet!\" He shook his head in wonder. \"But that will,\" she reminded him, voice calm. \"Yes, yes, it's quite determined. Certainly there's no problem.\" Caius looked bitterly disappointed\u2014a feeling he seemed to share with Felix and Jane. \"Aro,\" Caius complained. \"Dear Caius,\" Aro smiled. \"Do not fret. Think of the possibilities! They do not join us today, but we can always hope for the future. Imagine the joy young Alice alone would bring to our little household\u2026 Besides, I'm so terribly curious to see how Bella turns out!\" Aro seemed convinced. Did he not realize how subjective Alice's visions were.' That she could make up her mind to transform me today, and then change it tomorrow? A million tiny decisions, her decisions and so many others', too\u2014Edward's\u2014could alter her path, and with that, the future. And would it really matter that Alice was willing, would it make any difference if I did become a vampire, when the idea was so repulsive to Edward? If death was, to him, a better alternative than having me around forever, an immortal annoyance? Terrified as I was, I felt myself sinking down into depression, drowning in it\u2026 \"Then we are free to go now?\" Edward asked in an even voice. \"Yes, yes,\" Aro said pleasantly. \"But please visit again. It's been absolutely enthralling!\" \"And we will visit you as well,\" Caius promised, his eyes suddenly half-closed like the heavy-lidded gaze of a lizard. \"To be sure that you follow through on your side. Were I you, I would not delay too long. We do not offer second chances.\" Edward's jaw clenched tight, but he nodded once. Caius smirked and drifted back to where Marcus still sat, unmoving and uninterested. Felix groaned. \"Ah, Felix.\" Aro smiled, amused. \"Heidi will be here at any moment. Patience.\" \"Hmm.\" Edward's voice had a new edge to it. \"In that case, perhaps we'd better leave sooner rather than later.\" \"Yes,\" Aro agreed. \"That's a good idea. Accidents do happen. Please wait below until after dark, though, if you don't mind.\" \"Of course,\" Edward agreed, while I cringed at the thought of waiting out the day before we could escape. \"And here,\" Aro added, motioning to Felix with one finger. Felix came forward at once, and Aro unfastened the gray cloak the huge vampire wore, pulling from his shoulders. He tossed it to Edward. \"Take this. You're a little conspicuous.\" Edward put the long cloak on, leaving the hood down. Aro sighed. \"It suits you.\" Edward chuckled, but broke off suddenly, glancing over his shoulder. \"Thank you, Aro. We'll wait below.\" \"Goodbye, young friends,\" Aro said, his eyes bright as he stared in the same direction. \"Let's go,\" Edward said, urgent now. Demetri gestured that we should follow, and then set off the way we'd come in, the only exit by the look of things. Edward pulled me swiftly along beside him. Alice was close by my other side, her face hard. \"Not fast enough,\" she muttered. I stared up at her, frightened, but she only seemed chagrined. It was then that I first heard the babble of voices\u2014loud, rough voices\u2014coming from the antechamber. \"Well this is unusual,\" a man's coarse voice boomed. \"So medieval,\" an unpleasantly shrill, female voice gushed back. A large crowd was coming through the little door, filling the smaller stone chamber. Demetri motioned for us to make room. We pressed back against the cold wall to let them pass. The couple in front, Americans from the sound of them, glanced around themselves with appraising eyes. \"Welcome, guests! Welcome to Volterra!\" I could hear Aro sing from the big turret room. The rest of them, maybe forty or more, filed in after the couple. Some studied the setting like tourists. A few even snapped pictures. Others looked confused, as if the story that had led them to this room was not making sense anymore. I noticed one small, dark woman in particular. Around her neck was a rosary, and she gripped the cross tightly in one hand. She walked more slowly than the others, touching someone now and then and asking a question in an unfamiliar language. No one seemed to understand her, and her voice grew more panicked. Edward pulled my face against his chest, but it was too late. I already understood. As soon as the smallest break appeared, Edward pushed me quickly toward the door. I could feel the horrified expression on my face, and the tears beginning to pool in my eyes. The ornate golden hallway was quiet, empty except for one gorgeous, statuesque woman. She stared at us curiously, me in particular. \"Welcome home, Heidi,\" Demetri greeted her from behind us. Heidi smiled absently. She reminded me of Rosalie, though they looked nothing alike\u2014it was just that her beauty, too, was exceptional, unforgettable. I couldn't seem to look away. She was dressed to emphasize that beauty. Her amazingly long legs, darkened with tights, were exposed by the shortest of miniskirts. Her top was long-sleeved and high-necked, but extremely close-fitting, and constructed of red vinyl. Her long mahogany hair was lustrous, and her eyes were the strangest shade of violet\u2014a color that might result from blue-tinted contacts over red irises. \"Demetri,\" she responded in a silky voice, her eyes flickering between my face and Edward's gray cloak. \"Nice fishing,\" Demetri complimented her, and I suddenly understood the attention-grabbing outfit she wore\u2026 she was not only the fisherman, but also the bait. \"Thanks.\" She flashed a stunning smile. \"Aren't you coming?\" \"In a minute. Save a few for me.\" Heidi nodded and ducked through the door with one last curious look at me. Edward set a pace that had me running to keep up. But we still couldn't get through the ornate door at the end of the hallway before the screaming started.",

            "en": "11        11. COMPLICATIONS Everyone watched us as we walked together to our lab table. I noticed that he no longer angled the chair to sit as far from me as the desk would allow. Instead, he sat quite close beside me, our arms almost touching. Mr. Banner backed into the room then \u2014 what superb timing the man had \u2014 pulling a tall metal frame on wheels that held a heavy-looking, outdated TV and VCR. A movie day \u2014 the lift in the class atmosphere was almost tangible. Mr. Banner shoved the tape into the reluctant VCR and walked to the wall to turn off the lights. And then, as the room went black, I was suddenly hyperaware that Edward was sitting less than an inch from me. I was stunned by the unexpected electricity that flowed through me, amazed that it was possible to be more aware of him than I already was. A crazy impulse to reach over and touch him, to stroke his perfect face just once in the darkness, nearly overwhelmed me. I crossed my arms tightly across my chest, my hands balling into fists. I was losing my mind. The opening credits began, lighting the room by a token amount. My eyes, of their own accord, flickered to him. I smiled sheepishly as I realized his posture was identical to mine, fists clenched under his arms, right down to the eyes, peering sideways at me. He grinned back, his eyes somehow managing to smolder, even in the dark. I looked away before I could start hyperventilating. It was absolutely ridiculous that I should feel dizzy. The hour seemed very long. I couldn't concentrate on the movie \u2014 I didn't even know what subject it was on. I tried unsuccessfully to relax, but the electric current that seemed to be originating from somewhere in his body never slackened. Occasionally I would permit myself a quick glance in his direction, but he never seemed to relax, either. The overpowering craving to touch him also refused to fade, and I crushed my fists safely against my ribs until my fingers were aching with the effort. I breathed a sigh of relief when Mr. Banner flicked the lights back on at the end of class, and stretched my arms out in front of me, flexing my stiff fingers. Edward \u00a0chuckled beside me. \"Well, that was interesting,\" he murmured. His voice was dark and his eyes were cautious. \"Umm,\" was all I was able to respond. \"Shall we?\" he asked, rising fluidly. I almost groaned. Time for Gym. I stood with care, worried my balance might have been affected by the strange new intensity between us. He walked me to my next class in silence and paused at the door; I turned to say goodbye. His face startled me \u2014 his expression was torn, almost pained, and so fiercely beautiful that the ache to touch him flared as strong as before. My goodbye stuck in my throat. He raised his hand, hesitant, conflict raging in his eyes, and then swiftly brushed the length of my cheekbone with his fingertips. His skin was as icy as ever, but the trail his fingers left on my skin was alarmingly warm \u2014 like I'd been burned, but didn't feel the pain of it yet. He turned without a word and strode quickly away from me. I walked into the gym, lightheaded and wobbly. I drifted to the locker room, changing in a trance like state, only vaguely aware that there were other people surrounding me. Reality didn't fully set in until I was handed a racket. It wasn't heavy, yet it felt very unsafe in my hand. I could see a few of the other kids in class eyeing me furtively. Coach Clapp ordered us to pair up into teams. Mercifully, some vestiges of Mike's chivalry still survived; he came to stand beside me. \"Do you want to be a team?\" \"Thanks, Mike \u2014 you don't have to do this, you know.\" I grimaced apologetically. \"Don't worry, I'll keep out of your way.\" He grinned. Sometimes it was so easy to like Mike. It didn't go smoothly. I somehow managed to hit myself in the head with my racket and clip Mike's shoulder on the same swing. I spent the rest of the hour in the back corner of the court, the racket held safely behind my back. Despite being handicapped by me, Mike was pretty good; he won three games out of four single handedly. He gave me an unearned high five when the coach finally blew the whistle ending class. \"So,\" he said as we walked off the court. \"So what?\" \"You and Cullen, huh?\" he asked, his tone rebellious. My previous feeling of affection disappeared. \"That's none of your business, Mike,\" I warned, internally cursing Jessica straight to the fiery pits of Hades. \"I don't like it,\" he muttered anyway. \"You don't have to,\" I snapped. \"He looks at you like\u2026 like you're something to eat,\" he continued, ignoring me. I choked back the hysteria that threatened to explode, but a small giggle managed to get out despite my efforts. He glowered at me. I waved and fled to the locker room. I dressed quickly, something stronger than butterflies battering recklessly against the walls of my stomach, my argument with Mike already a distant memory. I was wondering if Edward would be waiting, or if I should meet him at his car. What if his family was there? I felt a wave of real terror. Did they know that I knew? Was I supposed to know that they knew that I knew, or not? By the time I walked out of the gym, I had just about decided to walk straight home without even looking toward the parking lot. But my worries were unnecessary. Edward was waiting, leaning casually against the side of the gym, his breathtaking face untroubled now. As I walked to his side, I felt a peculiar sense of release. \"Hi,\" I breathed, smiling hugely. \"Hello.\" His answering smile was brilliant. \"How was Gym?\" My face fell a tiny bit. \"Fine,\" I lied. \"Really?\" He was unconvinced. His eyes shifted their focus slightly, looking over my shoulder and narrowing. I glanced behind me to see Mike's back as he walked away. \"What?\" I demanded. His eyes slid back to mine, still tight. \"Newton's getting on my nerves.\" \"You weren't listening again?\" I was horror-struck. All traces of my sudden good humor vanished. \"How's your head?\" he asked innocently. \"You're unbelievable!\" I turned, stomping away in the general direction of the parking lot, though I hadn't ruled out walking at this point. He kept up with me easily. \"You were the one who mentioned how I'd never seen you in Gym \u2014 it made me curious.\" He didn't sound repentant, so I ignored him. We walked in silence \u2014 a furious, embarrassed silence on my part \u2014 to his car. But I had to stop a few steps away \u2014 a crowd of people, all boys, were surrounding it. Then I realized they weren't surrounding the Volvo, they were actually circled around Rosalie's red convertible, unmistakable lust in their eyes. None of them even looked up as Edward slid between them to open his door. I climbed quickly in the passenger side, also unnoticed. \"Ostentatious,\" he muttered. \"What kind of car is that?\" I asked. \"An M3.\" \"I don't speak Car and Driver.\" \"It's a BMW.\" He rolled his eyes, not looking at me, trying to back out without running over the car enthusiasts. I nodded \u2014 I'd heard of that one. \"Are you still angry?\" he asked as he carefully maneuvered his way out. \"Definitely.\" He sighed. \"Will you forgive me if I apologize?\" \"Maybe\u2026 if you mean it. And if you promise not to do it again,\" I insisted. His eyes were suddenly shrewd. \"How about if I mean it, and I agree to let you drive Saturday?\" he countered my conditions. I considered, and decided it was probably the best offer I would get. \"Deal,\" I agreed. \"Then I'm very sorry I upset you.\" His eyes burned with sincerity for a protracted moment \u2014 playing havoc with the rhythm of my heart \u2014 and then turned playful. \"And I'll be on your doorstep bright and early Saturday morning.\" \"Um, it doesn't help with the Charlie situation if an unexplained Volvo is left in the driveway.\" His smile was condescending now. \"I wasn't intending to bring a car.\" \"How \u2014\" He cut me off. \"Don't worry about it. I'll be there, no car.\" I let it go. I had a more pressing question. \"Is it later yet?\" I asked significantly. He frowned. \"I supposed it is later.\" I kept my expression polite as I waited. He stopped the car. I looked up, surprised \u2014 of course we were already at Charlie's house, parked behind the truck. It was easier to ride with him if I only looked when it was over. When I looked back at him, he was staring at me, measuring with his eyes.  \"And you still want to know why you can't see me hunt?\" He seemed solemn, but I thought I saw a trace of humor deep in his eyes. \"Well,\" I clarified, \"I was mostly wondering about your reaction.\" \"Did I frighten you?\" Yes, there was definitely humor there. \"No,\" I lied. He didn't buy it. \"I apologize for scaring you,\" he persisted with a slight smile, but then all evidence of teasing disappeared. \"It was just the very thought of you being there\u2026 while we hunted.\" His jaw tightened. \"That would be bad?\" He spoke from between clenched teeth. \"Extremely.\" \"Because\u2026 ?\" He took a deep breath and stared through the windshield at the thick, rolling clouds that seemed to press down, almost within reach. \"When we hunt,\" he spoke slowly, unwillingly, \"we give ourselves over to our senses\u2026 govern less with our minds. Especially our sense of smell. If you were anywhere near me when I lost control that way\u2026\" He shook his head, still gazing morosely at the heavy clouds. I kept my expression firmly under control, expecting the swift flash of his eyes to judge my reaction that soon followed. My face gave nothing away. But our eyes held, and the silence deepened \u2014 and changed. Flickers of the electricity I'd felt this afternoon began to charge the atmosphere as he gazed unrelentingly into my eyes. It wasn't until my head started to swim that I realized I wasn't breathing. When I drew in a jagged breath, breaking the stillness, he closed his eyes. \"Bella, I think you should go inside now.\" His low voice was rough, his eyes on the clouds again. I opened the door, and the arctic draft that burst into the car helped clear my head. Afraid I might stumble in my woozy state, I stepped carefully out of the car and shut the door behind me without looking back. The whir of the automatic window unrolling made me turn. \"Oh, Bella?\" he called after me, his voice more even. He leaned toward the open window with a faint smile on his lips. \"Yes?\" \"Tomorrow it's my turn.\" \"Your turn to what?\" He smiled wider, flashing his gleaming teeth. \"Ask the questions.\" And then he was gone, the car speeding down the street and disappearing around the corner before I could even collect my thoughts. I smiled as I walked to the house. It was clear he was planning to see me tomorrow, if nothing else. That night Edward starred in my dreams, as usual. However, the climate of my unconsciousness had changed. It thrilled with the same electricity that had charged the afternoon, and I tossed and turned restlessly, waking often. It was only in the early hours of the morning that I finally sank into an exhausted, dreamless sleep. When I woke I was still tired, but edgy as well. I pulled on my brown turtleneck and the inescapable jeans, sighing as I daydreamed of spaghetti straps and shorts. Breakfast was the usual, quiet event I expected. Charlie fried eggs for himself; I had my bowl of cereal. I wondered if he had forgotten about this Saturday. He answered my unspoken question as he stood up to take his plate to the sink. \"About this Saturday\u2026\" he began, walking across the kitchen and turning on the faucet. I cringed. \"Yes, Dad?\" \"Are you still set on going to Seattle?\" he asked. \"That was the plan.\" I grimaced, wishing he hadn't brought it up so I wouldn't have to compose careful half-truths. He squeezed some dish soap onto his plate and swirled it around with the brush. \"And you're sure you can't make it back in time for the dance?\" \"I'm not going to the dance, Dad.\" I glared. \"Didn't anyone ask you?\" he asked, trying to hide his concern by focusing on rinsing the plate. I sidestepped the minefield. \"It's a girl's choice.\" \"Oh.\" He frowned as he dried his plate. I sympathized with him. It must be a hard thing, to be a father; living in fear that your daughter would meet a boy she liked, but also having to worry if she didn't. How ghastly it would be, I thought, shuddering, if Charlie had even the slightest inkling of exactly what I did like. Charlie left then, with a goodbye wave, and I went upstairs to brush my teeth and gather my books. When I heard the cruiser pull away, I could only wait a few seconds before I had to peek out of my window. The silver car was already there, waiting in Charlie's spot on the driveway. I bounded down the stairs and out the front door, wondering how long this bizarre routine would continue. I never wanted it to end.  He waited in the car, not appearing to watch as I shut the door behind me without bothering to lock the dead-bolt. I walked to the car, pausing shyly before opening the door and stepping in. He was smiling, relaxed \u2014 and, as usual, perfect and beautiful to an excruciating degree. \"Good morning.\" His voice was silky. \"How are you today?\" His eyes roamed over my face, as if his question was something more than simple courtesy. \"Good, thank you.\" I was always good \u2014 much more than good \u2014 when I was near him. His gaze lingered on the circles under my eyes. \"You look tired.\" \"I couldn't sleep,\" I confessed, automatically swinging my hair around my shoulder to provide some measure of cover. \"Neither could I,\" he teased as he started the engine. I was becoming used to the quiet purr. I was sure the roar of my truck would scare me, whenever I got to drive it again. I laughed. \"I guess that's right. I suppose I slept just a little bit more than you did.\" \"I'd wager you did.\" \"So what did you do last night?\" I asked. He chuckled. \"Not a chance. It's my day to ask questions.\" \"Oh, that's right. What do you want to know?\" My forehead creased. I couldn't imagine anything about me that could be in any way interesting to him. \"What's your favorite color?\" he asked, his face grave. I rolled my eyes. \"It changes from day to day.\" \"What's your favorite color today?\" He was still solemn. \"Probably brown.\" I tended to dress according to my mood. He snorted, dropping his serious expression. \"Brown?\" he asked skeptically. \"Sure. Brown is warm. I miss brown. Everything that's supposed to be brown \u2014 tree trunks, rocks, dirt \u2014 is all covered up with squashy green stuff here,\" I complained. He seemed fascinated by my little rant. He considered for a moment, staring into my eyes. \"You're right,\" he decided, serious again. \"Brown is warm.\" He reached over, swiftly, but somehow still hesitantly, to sweep my hair back behind my shoulder. We were at the school by now. He turned back to me as he pulled into a parking space. \"What music is in your CD player right now?\" he asked, his face as somber as if he'd asked for a murder confession. I realized I'd never removed the CD Phil had given me. When I said the name of the band, he smiled crookedly, a peculiar expression in his eyes. He flipped open a compartment under his car's CD player, pulled out one of thirty or so CDs that were jammed into the small space, and handed it to me, \"Debussy to this?\" He raised an eyebrow. It was the same CD. I examined the familiar cover art, keeping my eyes down. It continued like that for the rest of the day. While he walked me to English, when he met me after Spanish, all through the lunch hour, he questioned me relentlessly about every insignificant detail of my existence. Movies I'd liked and hated, the few places I'd been and the many places I wanted to go, and books \u2014 endlessly books. I couldn't remember the last time I'd talked so much. More often than not, I felt self-conscious, certain I must be boring him. But the absolute absorption of his face, and his never-ending stream of questions, compelled me to continue. Mostly his questions were easy, only a very few triggering my easy blushes. But when I did flush, it brought on a whole new round of questions. Such as the time he asked my favorite gemstone, and I blurted out topaz before thinking. He'd been flinging questions at me with such speed that I felt like I was taking one of those psychiatric tests where you answer with the first word that comes to mind. I was sure he would have continued down whatever mental list he was following, except for the blush. My face reddened because, until very recently, my favorite gemstone was garnet. It was impossible, while staring back into his topaz eyes, not to remember the reason for the switch. And, naturally, he wouldn't rest until I'd admitted why I was embarrassed. \"Tell me,\" he finally commanded after persuasion failed \u2014 failed only because I kept my eyes safely away from his face. \"It's the color of your eyes today,\" I sighed, surrendering, staring down at my hands as I fiddled with a piece of my hair. \"I suppose if you asked me in two weeks I'd say onyx.\" I'd given more information than necessary in my unwilling honesty, and I worried it would provoke the strange anger that flared whenever I slipped and revealed too clearly how obsessed I was. But his pause was very short. \"What kinds of flowers do you prefer?\" he fired off. I sighed in relief, and continued with the psychoanalysis. Biology was a complication again. Edward had continued with his quizzing up until Mr. Banner entered the room, dragging the audiovisual frame again. As the teacher approached the light switch, I noticed Edward slide his chair slightly farther away from mine. It didn't help. As soon as the room was dark, there was the same electric spark, the same restless craving to stretch my hand across the short space and touch his cold skin, as yesterday. I leaned forward on the table, resting my chin on my folded arms, my hidden fingers gripping the table's edge as I fought to ignore the irrational longing that unsettled me. I didn't look at him, afraid that if he was looking at me, it would only make self-control that much harder. I sincerely tried to watch the movie, but at the end of the hour I had no idea what I'd just seen. I sighed in relief again when Mr. Banner turned the lights on, finally glancing at Edward; he was looking at me, his eyes ambivalent. He rose in silence and then stood still, waiting for me. We walked toward the gym in silence, like yesterday. And, also like yesterday, he touched my face wordlessly \u2014 this time with the back of his cool hand, stroking once from my temple to my jaw \u2014 before he turned and walked away. Gym passed quickly as I watched Mike's one-man badminton show. He didn't speak to me today, either in response to my vacant expression or because he was still angry about our squabble yesterday. Somewhere, in a corner of my mind, I felt bad about that. But I couldn't concentrate on him. I hurried to change afterward, ill at ease, knowing the faster I moved, the sooner I would be with Edward. The pressure made me more clumsy than usual, but eventually I made it out the door, feeling the same release when I saw him standing there, a wide smile automatically spreading across my face. He smiled in reaction before launching into more cross-examination. His questions were different now, though, not as easily answered. He wanted to know what I missed about home, insisting on descriptions of anything he wasn't familiar with. We sat in front of Charlie's house for hours, as the sky darkened and rain plummeted around us in a sudden deluge. I tried to describe impossible things like the scent of creosote \u2014 bitter, slightly resinous, but still pleasant \u2014 the high, keening sound of the cicadas in July, the <em>feathery</em> barrenness of the trees, the very size of the sky, extending white-blue from horizon to horizon, barely interrupted by the low mountains covered with purple volcanic rock. The hardest thing to explain was why it was so beautiful to me \u2014 to justify a beauty that didn't depend on the sparse, spiny vegetation that often looked half dead, a beauty that had more to do with the exposed shape of the land, with the shallow bowls of valleys between the craggy hills, and the way they held on to the sun. I found myself using my hands as I tried to describe it to him. His quiet, probing questions kept me talking freely, forgetting, in the dim light of the storm, to be embarrassed for monopolizing the conversation. Finally, when I had finished detailing my cluttered room at home, he paused instead of responding with another question.  \"Are you finished?\" I asked in relief. \"Not even close \u2014 but your father will be home soon.\" \"Charlie!\" I suddenly recalled his existence, and sighed. I looked out at the rain-darkened sky, but it gave nothing away. \"How late is it?\" I wondered out loud as I glanced at the clock. I was surprised by the time \u2014 Charlie would be driving home now. \"It's twilight,\" Edward murmured, looking at the western horizon, obscured as it was with clouds. His voice was thoughtful, as if his mind were somewhere far away. I stared at him as he gazed unseeingly out the windshield. I was still staring when his eyes suddenly shifted back to mine. \"It's the safest time of day for us,\" he said, answering the unspoken question in my eyes. \"The easiest time. But also the saddest, in a way\u2026 the end of another day, the return of the night. Darkness is so predictable, don't you think?\" He smiled wistfully. \"I like the night. Without the dark, we'd never see the stars.\" I frowned. \"Not that you see them here much.\" He laughed, and the mood abruptly lightened. \"Charlie will be here in a few minutes. So, unless you want to tell him that you'll be with me Saturday\u2026\" He raised one eyebrow. \"Thanks, but no thanks.\" I gathered my books, realizing I was stiff from sitting still so long. \"So is it my turn tomorrow, then?\" \"Certainly not!\" His face was teasingly outraged. \"I told you I wasn't done, didn't I?\" \"What more is there?\" \"You'll find out tomorrow.\" He reached across to open my door for me, and his sudden proximity sent my heart into frenzied palpitations. But his hand froze on the handle. \"Not good,\" he muttered. \"What is it?\" I was surprised to see that his jaw was clenched, his eyes disturbed. He glanced at me for a brief second. \"Another complication,\" he said glumly. He flung the door open in one swift movement, and then moved, almost cringed, swiftly away from me. The flash of headlights through the rain caught my attention as a dark car pulled up to the curb just a few feet away, facing us. \"Charlie's around the corner,\" he warned, staring through the downpour at the other vehicle. I hopped out at once, despite my confusion and curiosity. The rain was louder as it glanced off my jacket. I tried to make out the shapes in the front seat of the other car, but it was too dark. I could see Edward illuminated in the glare of the new car's headlights; he was still staring ahead, his gaze locked on something or someone I couldn't see. His expression was a strange mix of frustration and defiance. Then he revved the engine, and the tires squealed against the wet pavement. The Volvo was out of sight in seconds. \"Hey, Bella,\" called a familiar, husky voice from the driver's side of the little black car. \"Jacob?\" I asked, squinting through the rain. Just then, Charlie's cruiser swung around the corner, his lights shining on the occupants of the car in front of me. Jacob was already climbing out, his wide grin visible even through the darkness. In the passenger seat was a much older man, a heavyset man with a memorable face \u2014 a face that overflowed, the cheeks resting against his shoulders, with creases running through the russet skin like an old leather jacket. And the surprisingly familiar eyes, black eyes that seemed at the same time both too young and too ancient for the broad face they were set in. Jacob's father, Billy Black. I knew him immediately, though in the more than five years since I'd seen him last I'd managed to forget his name when Charlie had spoken of him my first day here. He was staring at me, scrutinizing my face, so I smiled tentatively at him. His eyes were wide, as if in shock or fear, his nostrils flared. My smile faded. Another complication, Edward had said. Billy still stared at me with intense, anxious eyes. I groaned internally. Had Billy recognized Edward so easily? Could he really believe the impossible legends his son had scoffed at? The answer was clear in Billy's eyes. Yes. Yes, he could.",
