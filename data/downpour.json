            "en": "Back hair By the mid-20s, a man will know his \u201cback hair destiny\u201d: barely there, a few tufts, or full and bushy. Is yours a magnet for women? Or a throwback to the Stone Age? If you want to tame the shag, laser hair removal can thin back hair or remove it all, and the results are nearly permanent. Cheaper options include waxing, hair removal creams, and razors, with results that last up to a few weeks. Beer belly You don\u2019t have to drink beer to get a beer belly. Men are more likely to gain fat around the waist, so anything fattening can pad the paunch. Unfortunately, belly fat raises the risk of heart disease, especially if your waist size is more than 40 inches. But there is good news: If you follow a weight loss plan, belly fat is usually the first to go. Excessive sweating Men have a higher \"sweat output\" than women. That's a fact. But if you always need to wipe your hands or often sweat through your clothes, it may be more than a \"guy\" thing. It could be excessive sweating, called hyperhidrosis. Emotions or heat can trigger the <em>downpour</em> -- or nothing at all. It usually affects the armpits, palms, or soles of the feet. Effective treatments are available through a health professional. Unibrow Now here\u2019s a hair problem that affects men of all ages. The same hormones that make your beard grow can make your eyebrows so thick and bushy that they meet in the center. \"Unibrow\" is the most common reason young men get electrolysis. This procedure uses tiny electric shocks to permanently destroy the hair follicles. Waxing is another way to shape your brows, but it must be repeated every 4-6 weeks. Razor bumps You work hard for that close shave. So it can be exasperating when small bumps mar your smooth skin. Razor bumps form when hairs curl back on themselves and grow into the skin. They\u2019re most common in African-Americans and men with curly hair. To keep the bumps at bay, take a hot shower before shaving. Apply a thick gel, and always shave in the direction your beard grows. Rosacea Maybe it\u2019s not embarrassment that\u2019s causing all that blushing. Rosacea is a condition that causes the face to flush, and symptoms tend to be worse in men. The nose may become thick, red, or bulbous. Pimples and tiny red lines can appear on the cheeks. Alcohol can trigger a flare up, but the distinctive, red nose of rosacea can occur in a teetotaler. Medications can prevent it from getting worse, so be sure to discuss your symptoms with your doctor. Receding hairline The painful truth is most guys have noticeably thinner hair by age 35 and significant hair loss by age 50. The pattern usually begins with a receding hairline and may progress to bald spots on the top of the scalp. Hair restoration surgery offers a way to reduce bald patches. Or you can talk to your doctor about prescription medications for hair loss. But beware of other products that promise the moon. Color blindness Color blindness usually does not mean seeing the world in black and white. The most common form makes it difficult to tell red from green, a problem that affects about 10 million American men. The way the condition is inherited makes it far less common in women. There\u2019s no treatment, but most people can learn to work around the color confusion. Snoring Snoring is a surefire way to disrupt your bed partner\u2019s sleep, and men are more likely to be the perpetrators. In most cases, snoring is not harmful. But snoring regularly can chip away at the quality of your own sleep. It can also be a sign of a more serious problem called sleep apnea. If you feel snoring is disrupting you or your partner\u2019s sleep, consult a doctor. Belching Burping may not be the picture of politeness in American society, but in some cultures a hearty belch shows appreciation for a good meal. In either case, burping a few times after eating is normal. It\u2019s the body\u2019s way of freeing the air that you\u2019ve swallowed. Frequent burping combined with other symptoms, such as nausea or belly pain, could be a sign of a digestive disorder. Check with your doctor if the problem continues. Gas Perhaps no bodily function has inspired as many jokes as gas. While the sound and smell can be embarrassing, passing gas is harmless. It\u2019s nothing more than air moving through the digestive tract or gas from the breakdown of food by bacteria in your gut coming out \u2013 well, we all know where. Gas facts: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Most people pass gas 6-20 times a day. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Beer, soda, beans, and many fruits and vegetables are all likely to gas you up. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Foods that cause gas differ for each person. Body odor Whether you\u2019re working hard or playing hard, any strenuous activity can result in strong body odor. The culprit is not sweat itself, but the bacteria that use sweaty skin as a breeding ground. You can fight the bacteria by showering regularly with soap and using antiperspirant. Also be sure to wash workout clothes often. If body odor persists, try avoiding smelly foods like garlic and onions. Jock itch You don\u2019t have to be a pro athlete to get jock itch. This fungal infection spreads easily at your local gym -- or from another part of your own body. Hands, towels, and stepping into underwear are common culprits. The symptoms include a patchy rash on the groin or inner thighs, along with the telltale itching. It\u2019s treated with nonprescription antifungal creams. Keeping the area dry and avoiding tight clothing helps to avoid a repeat engagement. Athlete\u2019s foot When the fungus that causes jock itch targets the feet, you have athlete\u2019s foot. Walking barefoot in locker rooms or near pools is the most common way to pick up this infection. Symptoms include itching, burning, blisters, or cracks on the feet and toes. Athlete\u2019s foot is treated with antifungal cream. If you have both jock itch and athlete\u2019s foot, be sure to treat them at the same time. Ingrown nails Grooming your nails may not be the highlight of your day, but it\u2019s worth your time to get the job done right. Clumsy nail trimming is the top cause of ingrown toenails, which can cause pain, swelling, and infections. The most common mistake is trimming the nails too short. To avoid this, check your drugstore for nail \u201cnippers\u201d that are shaped to follow the natural curve of the nail. Bad breath You probably know that smelly foods and smoking can sabotage your breath. But the most common culprit is bacteria. When you brush your teeth, brush your tongue as well to banish the bacteria that thrive there. If good hygiene doesn\u2019t sweeten your breath, see your dentist and your doctor. Gum disease, dry mouth, or acid reflux could be part of the problem. Sexual dysfunction Men may not be eager to discuss sexual troubles, but nearly a third of guys experience problems. This may include a sagging libido, premature ejaculation, or erectile dysfunction (ED). ED means a man is unable to develop or sustain an erection. Risk factors for ED include diabetes, heart disease, neurologic conditions, smoking, circulation problems, and some medications. Talk to your doctor if you have ED or other sexual problems to help evaluate the problem and recommend treatment. Hearing loss Men are more likely to experience hearing loss than women, and noisy jobs may contribute. Think miners, carpenters, and soldiers. But any loud or continuous noise can damage delicate ear structures. On the job, use special ear protection. Keep personal music players at or below 85 decibels (dB). Most can crank up to 105 dB, louder than a motorcycle, wood shop, or snowmobile. Enlarged prostate Along with wrinkles and gray hair, an enlarged prostate is an unavoidable part of aging for many men. The medical term is benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH, an enlargement of the gland that surrounds the urethra. This growth causes symptoms in about half of men over age 75. As the prostate grows, it may squeeze the urethra, making you feel nature\u2019s call more often. There are strategies and medications to help reduce the symptoms. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0",

            "en": "11        11. COMPLICATIONS Everyone watched us as we walked together to our lab table. I noticed that he no longer angled the chair to sit as far from me as the desk would allow. Instead, he sat quite close beside me, our arms almost touching. Mr. Banner backed into the room then \u2014 what superb timing the man had \u2014 pulling a tall metal frame on wheels that held a heavy-looking, outdated TV and VCR. A movie day \u2014 the lift in the class atmosphere was almost tangible. Mr. Banner shoved the tape into the reluctant VCR and walked to the wall to turn off the lights. And then, as the room went black, I was suddenly hyperaware that Edward was sitting less than an inch from me. I was stunned by the unexpected electricity that flowed through me, amazed that it was possible to be more aware of him than I already was. A crazy impulse to reach over and touch him, to stroke his perfect face just once in the darkness, nearly overwhelmed me. I crossed my arms tightly across my chest, my hands balling into fists. I was losing my mind. The opening credits began, lighting the room by a token amount. My eyes, of their own accord, flickered to him. I smiled sheepishly as I realized his posture was identical to mine, fists clenched under his arms, right down to the eyes, peering sideways at me. He grinned back, his eyes somehow managing to smolder, even in the dark. I looked away before I could start hyperventilating. It was absolutely ridiculous that I should feel dizzy. The hour seemed very long. I couldn't concentrate on the movie \u2014 I didn't even know what subject it was on. I tried unsuccessfully to relax, but the electric current that seemed to be originating from somewhere in his body never slackened. Occasionally I would permit myself a quick glance in his direction, but he never seemed to relax, either. The overpowering craving to touch him also refused to fade, and I crushed my fists safely against my ribs until my fingers were aching with the effort. I breathed a sigh of relief when Mr. Banner flicked the lights back on at the end of class, and stretched my arms out in front of me, flexing my stiff fingers. Edward \u00a0chuckled beside me. \"Well, that was interesting,\" he murmured. His voice was dark and his eyes were cautious. \"Umm,\" was all I was able to respond. \"Shall we?\" he asked, rising fluidly. I almost groaned. Time for Gym. I stood with care, worried my balance might have been affected by the strange new intensity between us. He walked me to my next class in silence and paused at the door; I turned to say goodbye. His face startled me \u2014 his expression was torn, almost pained, and so fiercely beautiful that the ache to touch him flared as strong as before. My goodbye stuck in my throat. He raised his hand, hesitant, conflict raging in his eyes, and then swiftly brushed the length of my cheekbone with his fingertips. His skin was as icy as ever, but the trail his fingers left on my skin was alarmingly warm \u2014 like I'd been burned, but didn't feel the pain of it yet. He turned without a word and strode quickly away from me. I walked into the gym, lightheaded and wobbly. I drifted to the locker room, changing in a trance like state, only vaguely aware that there were other people surrounding me. Reality didn't fully set in until I was handed a racket. It wasn't heavy, yet it felt very unsafe in my hand. I could see a few of the other kids in class eyeing me furtively. Coach Clapp ordered us to pair up into teams. Mercifully, some vestiges of Mike's chivalry still survived; he came to stand beside me. \"Do you want to be a team?\" \"Thanks, Mike \u2014 you don't have to do this, you know.\" I grimaced apologetically. \"Don't worry, I'll keep out of your way.\" He grinned. Sometimes it was so easy to like Mike. It didn't go smoothly. I somehow managed to hit myself in the head with my racket and clip Mike's shoulder on the same swing. I spent the rest of the hour in the back corner of the court, the racket held safely behind my back. Despite being handicapped by me, Mike was pretty good; he won three games out of four single handedly. He gave me an unearned high five when the coach finally blew the whistle ending class. \"So,\" he said as we walked off the court. \"So what?\" \"You and Cullen, huh?\" he asked, his tone rebellious. My previous feeling of affection disappeared. \"That's none of your business, Mike,\" I warned, internally cursing Jessica straight to the fiery pits of Hades. \"I don't like it,\" he muttered anyway. \"You don't have to,\" I snapped. \"He looks at you like\u2026 like you're something to eat,\" he continued, ignoring me. I choked back the hysteria that threatened to explode, but a small giggle managed to get out despite my efforts. He glowered at me. I waved and fled to the locker room. I dressed quickly, something stronger than butterflies battering recklessly against the walls of my stomach, my argument with Mike already a distant memory. I was wondering if Edward would be waiting, or if I should meet him at his car. What if his family was there? I felt a wave of real terror. Did they know that I knew? Was I supposed to know that they knew that I knew, or not? By the time I walked out of the gym, I had just about decided to walk straight home without even looking toward the parking lot. But my worries were unnecessary. Edward was waiting, leaning casually against the side of the gym, his breathtaking face untroubled now. As I walked to his side, I felt a peculiar sense of release. \"Hi,\" I breathed, smiling hugely. \"Hello.\" His answering smile was brilliant. \"How was Gym?\" My face fell a tiny bit. \"Fine,\" I lied. \"Really?\" He was unconvinced. His eyes shifted their focus slightly, looking over my shoulder and narrowing. I glanced behind me to see Mike's back as he walked away. \"What?\" I demanded. His eyes slid back to mine, still tight. \"Newton's getting on my nerves.\" \"You weren't listening again?\" I was horror-struck. All traces of my sudden good humor vanished. \"How's your head?\" he asked innocently. \"You're unbelievable!\" I turned, stomping away in the general direction of the parking lot, though I hadn't ruled out walking at this point. He kept up with me easily. \"You were the one who mentioned how I'd never seen you in Gym \u2014 it made me curious.\" He didn't sound repentant, so I ignored him. We walked in silence \u2014 a furious, embarrassed silence on my part \u2014 to his car. But I had to stop a few steps away \u2014 a crowd of people, all boys, were surrounding it. Then I realized they weren't surrounding the Volvo, they were actually circled around Rosalie's red convertible, unmistakable lust in their eyes. None of them even looked up as Edward slid between them to open his door. I climbed quickly in the passenger side, also unnoticed. \"Ostentatious,\" he muttered. \"What kind of car is that?\" I asked. \"An M3.\" \"I don't speak Car and Driver.\" \"It's a BMW.\" He rolled his eyes, not looking at me, trying to back out without running over the car enthusiasts. I nodded \u2014 I'd heard of that one. \"Are you still angry?\" he asked as he carefully maneuvered his way out. \"Definitely.\" He sighed. \"Will you forgive me if I apologize?\" \"Maybe\u2026 if you mean it. And if you promise not to do it again,\" I insisted. His eyes were suddenly shrewd. \"How about if I mean it, and I agree to let you drive Saturday?\" he countered my conditions. I considered, and decided it was probably the best offer I would get. \"Deal,\" I agreed. \"Then I'm very sorry I upset you.\" His eyes burned with sincerity for a protracted moment \u2014 playing havoc with the rhythm of my heart \u2014 and then turned playful. \"And I'll be on your doorstep bright and early Saturday morning.\" \"Um, it doesn't help with the Charlie situation if an unexplained Volvo is left in the driveway.\" His smile was condescending now. \"I wasn't intending to bring a car.\" \"How \u2014\" He cut me off. \"Don't worry about it. I'll be there, no car.\" I let it go. I had a more pressing question. \"Is it later yet?\" I asked significantly. He frowned. \"I supposed it is later.\" I kept my expression polite as I waited. He stopped the car. I looked up, surprised \u2014 of course we were already at Charlie's house, parked behind the truck. It was easier to ride with him if I only looked when it was over. When I looked back at him, he was staring at me, measuring with his eyes.  \"And you still want to know why you can't see me hunt?\" He seemed solemn, but I thought I saw a trace of humor deep in his eyes. \"Well,\" I clarified, \"I was mostly wondering about your reaction.\" \"Did I frighten you?\" Yes, there was definitely humor there. \"No,\" I lied. He didn't buy it. \"I apologize for scaring you,\" he persisted with a slight smile, but then all evidence of teasing disappeared. \"It was just the very thought of you being there\u2026 while we hunted.\" His jaw tightened. \"That would be bad?\" He spoke from between clenched teeth. \"Extremely.\" \"Because\u2026 ?\" He took a deep breath and stared through the windshield at the thick, rolling clouds that seemed to press down, almost within reach. \"When we hunt,\" he spoke slowly, unwillingly, \"we give ourselves over to our senses\u2026 govern less with our minds. Especially our sense of smell. If you were anywhere near me when I lost control that way\u2026\" He shook his head, still gazing morosely at the heavy clouds. I kept my expression firmly under control, expecting the swift flash of his eyes to judge my reaction that soon followed. My face gave nothing away. But our eyes held, and the silence deepened \u2014 and changed. Flickers of the electricity I'd felt this afternoon began to charge the atmosphere as he gazed unrelentingly into my eyes. It wasn't until my head started to swim that I realized I wasn't breathing. When I drew in a jagged breath, breaking the stillness, he closed his eyes. \"Bella, I think you should go inside now.\" His low voice was rough, his eyes on the clouds again. I opened the door, and the arctic draft that burst into the car helped clear my head. Afraid I might stumble in my woozy state, I stepped carefully out of the car and shut the door behind me without looking back. The whir of the automatic window unrolling made me turn. \"Oh, Bella?\" he called after me, his voice more even. He leaned toward the open window with a faint smile on his lips. \"Yes?\" \"Tomorrow it's my turn.\" \"Your turn to what?\" He smiled wider, flashing his gleaming teeth. \"Ask the questions.\" And then he was gone, the car speeding down the street and disappearing around the corner before I could even collect my thoughts. I smiled as I walked to the house. It was clear he was planning to see me tomorrow, if nothing else. That night Edward starred in my dreams, as usual. However, the climate of my unconsciousness had changed. It thrilled with the same electricity that had charged the afternoon, and I tossed and turned restlessly, waking often. It was only in the early hours of the morning that I finally sank into an exhausted, dreamless sleep. When I woke I was still tired, but edgy as well. I pulled on my brown turtleneck and the inescapable jeans, sighing as I daydreamed of spaghetti straps and shorts. Breakfast was the usual, quiet event I expected. Charlie fried eggs for himself; I had my bowl of cereal. I wondered if he had forgotten about this Saturday. He answered my unspoken question as he stood up to take his plate to the sink. \"About this Saturday\u2026\" he began, walking across the kitchen and turning on the faucet. I cringed. \"Yes, Dad?\" \"Are you still set on going to Seattle?\" he asked. \"That was the plan.\" I grimaced, wishing he hadn't brought it up so I wouldn't have to compose careful half-truths. He squeezed some dish soap onto his plate and swirled it around with the brush. \"And you're sure you can't make it back in time for the dance?\" \"I'm not going to the dance, Dad.\" I glared. \"Didn't anyone ask you?\" he asked, trying to hide his concern by focusing on rinsing the plate. I sidestepped the minefield. \"It's a girl's choice.\" \"Oh.\" He frowned as he dried his plate. I sympathized with him. It must be a hard thing, to be a father; living in fear that your daughter would meet a boy she liked, but also having to worry if she didn't. How ghastly it would be, I thought, shuddering, if Charlie had even the slightest inkling of exactly what I did like. Charlie left then, with a goodbye wave, and I went upstairs to brush my teeth and gather my books. When I heard the cruiser pull away, I could only wait a few seconds before I had to peek out of my window. The silver car was already there, waiting in Charlie's spot on the driveway. I bounded down the stairs and out the front door, wondering how long this bizarre routine would continue. I never wanted it to end.  He waited in the car, not appearing to watch as I shut the door behind me without bothering to lock the dead-bolt. I walked to the car, pausing shyly before opening the door and stepping in. He was smiling, relaxed \u2014 and, as usual, perfect and beautiful to an excruciating degree. \"Good morning.\" His voice was silky. \"How are you today?\" His eyes roamed over my face, as if his question was something more than simple courtesy. \"Good, thank you.\" I was always good \u2014 much more than good \u2014 when I was near him. His gaze lingered on the circles under my eyes. \"You look tired.\" \"I couldn't sleep,\" I confessed, automatically swinging my hair around my shoulder to provide some measure of cover. \"Neither could I,\" he teased as he started the engine. I was becoming used to the quiet purr. I was sure the roar of my truck would scare me, whenever I got to drive it again. I laughed. \"I guess that's right. I suppose I slept just a little bit more than you did.\" \"I'd wager you did.\" \"So what did you do last night?\" I asked. He chuckled. \"Not a chance. It's my day to ask questions.\" \"Oh, that's right. What do you want to know?\" My forehead creased. I couldn't imagine anything about me that could be in any way interesting to him. \"What's your favorite color?\" he asked, his face grave. I rolled my eyes. \"It changes from day to day.\" \"What's your favorite color today?\" He was still solemn. \"Probably brown.\" I tended to dress according to my mood. He snorted, dropping his serious expression. \"Brown?\" he asked skeptically. \"Sure. Brown is warm. I miss brown. Everything that's supposed to be brown \u2014 tree trunks, rocks, dirt \u2014 is all covered up with squashy green stuff here,\" I complained. He seemed fascinated by my little rant. He considered for a moment, staring into my eyes. \"You're right,\" he decided, serious again. \"Brown is warm.\" He reached over, swiftly, but somehow still hesitantly, to sweep my hair back behind my shoulder. We were at the school by now. He turned back to me as he pulled into a parking space. \"What music is in your CD player right now?\" he asked, his face as somber as if he'd asked for a murder confession. I realized I'd never removed the CD Phil had given me. When I said the name of the band, he smiled crookedly, a peculiar expression in his eyes. He flipped open a compartment under his car's CD player, pulled out one of thirty or so CDs that were jammed into the small space, and handed it to me, \"Debussy to this?\" He raised an eyebrow. It was the same CD. I examined the familiar cover art, keeping my eyes down. It continued like that for the rest of the day. While he walked me to English, when he met me after Spanish, all through the lunch hour, he questioned me relentlessly about every insignificant detail of my existence. Movies I'd liked and hated, the few places I'd been and the many places I wanted to go, and books \u2014 endlessly books. I couldn't remember the last time I'd talked so much. More often than not, I felt self-conscious, certain I must be boring him. But the absolute absorption of his face, and his never-ending stream of questions, compelled me to continue. Mostly his questions were easy, only a very few triggering my easy blushes. But when I did flush, it brought on a whole new round of questions. Such as the time he asked my favorite gemstone, and I blurted out topaz before thinking. He'd been flinging questions at me with such speed that I felt like I was taking one of those psychiatric tests where you answer with the first word that comes to mind. I was sure he would have continued down whatever mental list he was following, except for the blush. My face reddened because, until very recently, my favorite gemstone was garnet. It was impossible, while staring back into his topaz eyes, not to remember the reason for the switch. And, naturally, he wouldn't rest until I'd admitted why I was embarrassed. \"Tell me,\" he finally commanded after persuasion failed \u2014 failed only because I kept my eyes safely away from his face. \"It's the color of your eyes today,\" I sighed, surrendering, staring down at my hands as I fiddled with a piece of my hair. \"I suppose if you asked me in two weeks I'd say onyx.\" I'd given more information than necessary in my unwilling honesty, and I worried it would provoke the strange anger that flared whenever I slipped and revealed too clearly how obsessed I was. But his pause was very short. \"What kinds of flowers do you prefer?\" he fired off. I sighed in relief, and continued with the psychoanalysis. Biology was a complication again. Edward had continued with his quizzing up until Mr. Banner entered the room, dragging the audiovisual frame again. As the teacher approached the light switch, I noticed Edward slide his chair slightly farther away from mine. It didn't help. As soon as the room was dark, there was the same electric spark, the same restless craving to stretch my hand across the short space and touch his cold skin, as yesterday. I leaned forward on the table, resting my chin on my folded arms, my hidden fingers gripping the table's edge as I fought to ignore the irrational longing that unsettled me. I didn't look at him, afraid that if he was looking at me, it would only make self-control that much harder. I sincerely tried to watch the movie, but at the end of the hour I had no idea what I'd just seen. I sighed in relief again when Mr. Banner turned the lights on, finally glancing at Edward; he was looking at me, his eyes ambivalent. He rose in silence and then stood still, waiting for me. We walked toward the gym in silence, like yesterday. And, also like yesterday, he touched my face wordlessly \u2014 this time with the back of his cool hand, stroking once from my temple to my jaw \u2014 before he turned and walked away. Gym passed quickly as I watched Mike's one-man badminton show. He didn't speak to me today, either in response to my vacant expression or because he was still angry about our squabble yesterday. Somewhere, in a corner of my mind, I felt bad about that. But I couldn't concentrate on him. I hurried to change afterward, ill at ease, knowing the faster I moved, the sooner I would be with Edward. The pressure made me more clumsy than usual, but eventually I made it out the door, feeling the same release when I saw him standing there, a wide smile automatically spreading across my face. He smiled in reaction before launching into more cross-examination. His questions were different now, though, not as easily answered. He wanted to know what I missed about home, insisting on descriptions of anything he wasn't familiar with. We sat in front of Charlie's house for hours, as the sky darkened and rain plummeted around us in a sudden deluge. I tried to describe impossible things like the scent of creosote \u2014 bitter, slightly resinous, but still pleasant \u2014 the high, keening sound of the cicadas in July, the feathery barrenness of the trees, the very size of the sky, extending white-blue from horizon to horizon, barely interrupted by the low mountains covered with purple volcanic rock. The hardest thing to explain was why it was so beautiful to me \u2014 to justify a beauty that didn't depend on the sparse, spiny vegetation that often looked half dead, a beauty that had more to do with the exposed shape of the land, with the shallow bowls of valleys between the craggy hills, and the way they held on to the sun. I found myself using my hands as I tried to describe it to him. His quiet, probing questions kept me talking freely, forgetting, in the dim light of the storm, to be embarrassed for monopolizing the conversation. Finally, when I had finished detailing my cluttered room at home, he paused instead of responding with another question.  \"Are you finished?\" I asked in relief. \"Not even close \u2014 but your father will be home soon.\" \"Charlie!\" I suddenly recalled his existence, and sighed. I looked out at the rain-darkened sky, but it gave nothing away. \"How late is it?\" I wondered out loud as I glanced at the clock. I was surprised by the time \u2014 Charlie would be driving home now. \"It's twilight,\" Edward murmured, looking at the western horizon, obscured as it was with clouds. His voice was thoughtful, as if his mind were somewhere far away. I stared at him as he gazed unseeingly out the windshield. I was still staring when his eyes suddenly shifted back to mine. \"It's the safest time of day for us,\" he said, answering the unspoken question in my eyes. \"The easiest time. But also the saddest, in a way\u2026 the end of another day, the return of the night. Darkness is so predictable, don't you think?\" He smiled wistfully. \"I like the night. Without the dark, we'd never see the stars.\" I frowned. \"Not that you see them here much.\" He laughed, and the mood abruptly lightened. \"Charlie will be here in a few minutes. So, unless you want to tell him that you'll be with me Saturday\u2026\" He raised one eyebrow. \"Thanks, but no thanks.\" I gathered my books, realizing I was stiff from sitting still so long. \"So is it my turn tomorrow, then?\" \"Certainly not!\" His face was teasingly outraged. \"I told you I wasn't done, didn't I?\" \"What more is there?\" \"You'll find out tomorrow.\" He reached across to open my door for me, and his sudden proximity sent my heart into frenzied palpitations. But his hand froze on the handle. \"Not good,\" he muttered. \"What is it?\" I was surprised to see that his jaw was clenched, his eyes disturbed. He glanced at me for a brief second. \"Another complication,\" he said glumly. He flung the door open in one swift movement, and then moved, almost cringed, swiftly away from me. The flash of headlights through the rain caught my attention as a dark car pulled up to the curb just a few feet away, facing us. \"Charlie's around the corner,\" he warned, staring through the <em>downpour</em> at the other vehicle. I hopped out at once, despite my confusion and curiosity. The rain was louder as it glanced off my jacket. I tried to make out the shapes in the front seat of the other car, but it was too dark. I could see Edward illuminated in the glare of the new car's headlights; he was still staring ahead, his gaze locked on something or someone I couldn't see. His expression was a strange mix of frustration and defiance. Then he revved the engine, and the tires squealed against the wet pavement. The Volvo was out of sight in seconds. \"Hey, Bella,\" called a familiar, husky voice from the driver's side of the little black car. \"Jacob?\" I asked, squinting through the rain. Just then, Charlie's cruiser swung around the corner, his lights shining on the occupants of the car in front of me. Jacob was already climbing out, his wide grin visible even through the darkness. In the passenger seat was a much older man, a heavyset man with a memorable face \u2014 a face that overflowed, the cheeks resting against his shoulders, with creases running through the russet skin like an old leather jacket. And the surprisingly familiar eyes, black eyes that seemed at the same time both too young and too ancient for the broad face they were set in. Jacob's father, Billy Black. I knew him immediately, though in the more than five years since I'd seen him last I'd managed to forget his name when Charlie had spoken of him my first day here. He was staring at me, scrutinizing my face, so I smiled tentatively at him. His eyes were wide, as if in shock or fear, his nostrils flared. My smile faded. Another complication, Edward had said. Billy still stared at me with intense, anxious eyes. I groaned internally. Had Billy recognized Edward so easily? Could he really believe the impossible legends his son had scoffed at? The answer was clear in Billy's eyes. Yes. Yes, he could.",

            "en": "5          5. CHEATER \"BELLA, WHY DON'T YOU TAKE OFF,\" MIKE SUGGESTED, his eyes focused off to the side, not really looking at me. I wondered how long that had been going on without me noticing. It was a slow afternoon at Newton's. At the moment there were only two patrons in the store, dedicated backpackers from the sound of their conversation. Mike had spent the last hour going through the pros and cons of two brands of lightweight packs with them. But they'd taken a break from serious pricing to indulge in trying to one - up each other with their latest tales from the trail. Their distraction had given Mike a chance to escape. \"I don't mind staying,\" I said. I still hadn't been able to sink back into my protective shell of numbness, and everything seemed oddly close and loud today, like I'd taken cotton out of my ears. I tried to tune out the laughing hikers without success. \"I'm telling you,\" said the thickset man with the orange beard that didn't match his dark brown hair. \"I've seen grizzlies pretty close up in Yellowstone, but they had nothing on this brute.\" His hair was matted, and his clothes looked like they'd been on his back for more than a few days. Fresh from the mountains. \"Not a chance. Black bears don't get that big. The grizzlies you saw were probably cubs.\" The second man was tall and lean, his face tanned and wind-whipped into an impressive leathery crust. \"Seriously, Bella, as soon as these two give up, I'm closing the place down,\" Mike murmured. \"If you want me to go\u2026\" I shrugged. \u00a0\"On all fours it was taller than you,\" the bearded man insisted while I gathered my things together. \"Big as a house and pitch-black. I'm going to report it to the ranger here. People ought to be warned\u2014this wasn't up on the mountain, mind you\u2014this was only a few miles from the trailhead.\" Leather-face laughed and rolled his eyes. \"Let me guess\u2014you were on your way in? Hadn't eaten real food or slept off the ground in a week, right?\" \"Hey, uh, Mike, right?\" the bearded man called, looking toward us. \"See you Monday,\" I mumbled. \"Yes, sir,\" Mike replied, turning away. \"Say, have there been any warnings around here recently\u2014about black bears?\" \"No, sir. But it's always good to keep your distance and store your food correctly. Have you seen the new bear-safe canisters? They only weigh two pounds\u2026\" The doors slid open to let me out into the rain. I hunched over inside my jacket as I\u00a0 dashed for my truck. The rain hammering against my hood sounded unusually loud, too, but soon the roar of the engine drowned out everything else. I didn't want to go back to Charlie's empty house. Last night had been particularly brutal, and I had no desire to revisit the scene of the suffering. Even after the pain had subsided enough for me to sleep, it wasn't over. Like I'd told Jessica after the movie, there was never any doubt that I would have nightmares. I always had nightmares now, every night. Not nightmares really, not in the plural,\u00a0 because it was always the same nightmare. You'd think I'd get bored after so many months, grow immune to it. But the dream never failed to horrify me, and only ended when I woke myself with screaming. Charlie didn't come in to see what was wrong anymore, to make sure there was no intruder strangling me or something like that\u2014he was used to it now. My nightmare probably wouldn't even frighten someone else. Nothing jumped out and screamed, \"Boo!\" There were no zombies, no ghosts, no psychopaths. There was nothing, really. Only nothing. Just the endless maze of moss-covered trees, so quiet that the silence was an uncomfortable pressure against my eardrums. It was dark, like dusk on a cloudy day, with only enough light to see that there was nothing to see. I hurried through the gloom without a path, always searching, searching, searching, getting more frantic as the time stretched on, trying to move faster, though the speed made me clumsy\u2026 Then there would come the point in my dream\u2014and I could feel it coming now, but could never seem to wake myself up before it hit\u2014when I couldn't remember what it was that I was searching for. When I realized that there was nothing to search for, and nothing to find.  That there never had been anything more than just this empty, dreary wood, and there never would be anything more for me\u2026 nothing but nothing\u2026 That was usually about when the screaming started. I wasn't paying attention to where I was driving\u2014just wandering through empty, wet side roads as I avoided the ways that would take me home\u2014because I didn't have anywhere to go.  I wished I could feel numb again, but I couldn't remember how I'd managed it before. The nightmare was nagging at my mind and making me think about things that would cause me pain. I didn't want to remember the forest. Even as I shuddered away from the images, I felt my eyes fill with tears and the aching begin around the edges of the hole in my chest. I took one hand from the steering wheel and wrapped it around my torso to hold it in one piece. It will be as if I'd never existed. The words ran through my head, lacking the perfect clarity of my hallucination last night. They were just words, soundless, like print on a page. Just words, but they ripped the hole wide open, and I stomped on the brake, knowing I should not drive while this incapacitated. I curled over, pressing my face against the steering wheel and trying to breathe without lungs. S\u1ebd nh\u01b0 th\u1ec3 t\u00f4i ch\u01b0a h\u1ec1 t\u1ed3n t\u1ea1i tr\u00ean \u0111\u1eddi n\u00e0y I wondered how long this could last. Maybe someday, years from now\u2014if the pain would just decrease to the point where I could bear it\u2014I would be able to look back on those few short months that would always be the best of my life. And, if it were possible that the pain would ever soften enough to allow me to do that, I was sure that I would feel grateful for as much time as he'd given me. More than I'd asked for, more than I'd deserved. Maybe someday I'd be able to see it that way. But what if this hole never got any better? If the raw edges never healed? If the damage was permanent and irreversible? I held myself tightly together. As if he'd never existed, I thought in despair. What a stupid and impossible promise to make! He could steal my pictures and reclaim his gifts, but that didn't put things back the way they'd been before I'd met him. The physical evidence was the most insignificant part of the equation. I was changed, my insides altered almost past the point of recognition. Even my outsides looked different\u2014my face sallow, white except for the purple circles the nightmares had left under my eyes. My eyes were dark enough against my pallid skin that\u2014if I were beautiful, and seen from a distance\u2014I might even pass for a vampire now. But I was not beautiful, and I probably looked closer to a zombie. Nh\u01b0 th\u1ec3 anh ch\u01b0a t\u1eebng t\u1ed3n t\u1ea1i tr\u00ean \u0111\u1eddi n\u00e0y As if he'd never existed? That was insanity. It was a promise that he could never keep, a promise that was broken as soon as he'd made it. I thumped my head against the steering wheel, trying to distract myself from the sharper pain. It made me feel silly for ever worrying about keeping my promise. Where was the logic in sticking to an agreement that had already been violated by the other party? Who cared if I was reckless and stupid? There was no reason to avoid recklessness, no reason why I shouldn't get to be stupid. I laughed humorlessly to myself, still gasping for air. Reckless in Forks\u2014now there was a hopeless proposition. The dark humor distracted me, and the distraction eased the pain. My breath came easier, and I was able to lean back against the seat. Though it was cold today, my forehead was damp with sweat. I concentrated on my hopeless proposition to keep from sliding back into the excruciating memories. To be reckless in Forks would take a lot of creativity\u2014maybe more than I had. But I wished I could find some way\u2026 I might feel better if I weren't holding fast, all alone, to a broken pact. If I were an oath-breaker, too. But how could I cheat on my side of the deal, here in this harmless little town? Of course, Forks hadn't always been so harmless, but now it was exactly what it had always appeared to be. It was dull, it was safe. I stared out the windshield for a long moment, my thoughts moving sluggishly\u2014I couldn't seem to make those thoughts go anywhere. I cut the engine, which was groaning in a pitiful way after idling for so long, and stepped out into the drizzle. The cold rain dripped through my hair and then trickled across my cheeks like freshwater tears. It helped to clear my head. I blinked the water from my eyes, staring blankly across the road. After a minute of staring, I recognized where I was. I'd parked in the middle of the north lane of Russell Avenue. I was standing in front of the Cheneys' house\u2014my truck was blocking their driveway\u2014and across the road lived the Markses. I knew I needed to move my truck, and that I ought to go home. It was wrong to wander the way I had, distracted and impaired, a menace on the roads of Forks. Besides, someone would notice me soon enough, and report me to Charlie. As I took a deep breath in preparation to move, a sign in the Markses' yard caught my eye\u2014it was just a big piece of cardboard leaning against their mailbox post, with black letters scrawled in caps across it. Sometimes, kismet happens. Coincidence? Or was it meant to be? I didn't know, but it seemed kind of silly to think that it was somehow fated, that the dilapidated motorcycles rusting in the Markses' front yard beside the hand-printed FOR SALE, AS IS sign were serving some higher purpose by existing there, right where I needed them to be. So maybe it wasn't kismet. Maybe there were just all kinds of ways to be reckless, and I only now had my eyes open to them. Reckless and stupid. Those were Charlie's two very favorite words to apply to motorcycles. Charlie's job didn't get a lot of action compared to cops in bigger towns, but he did get called in on traffic accidents. With the long, wet stretches of freeway twisting and turning through the forest, blind corner after blind corner, there was no shortage of that kind of action. But even with all the huge log-haulers barreling around the turns, mostly people walked away. The exceptions to that rule were often on motorcycles, and Charlie had seen one too many victims, almost always kids, smeared on the highway. He'd made me promise before I was ten that I would never accept a ride on a motorcycle. Even at that age, I didn't have to think twice before promising. Who would want to ride a motorcycle here? It would be like taking a sixty-mile-per-hour bath. So many promises I kept\u2026 It clicked together for me then. I wanted to be stupid and reckless, and I wanted to break promises. Why stop at one? That's as far as I thought it through. I sloshed through the rain to the Markses' front door and rang the bell. One of the Marks boys opened the door, the younger one, the freshman. I couldn't remember his name. His sandy hair only came up to my shoulder. He had no trouble remembering my name. \"Bella Swan?\" he asked in surprise. \"How much do you want for the bike?\" I panted, jerking my thumb over my shoulder toward the sales display. \"Are you serious?\" he demanded. \"Of course I am.\" \"They don't work.\" I sighed impatiently\u2014this was something I'd already inferred from the sign. \"How much?\" \"If you really want one, just take it. My mom made my dad move them down to the road so they'd get picked up with the garbage.\" I glanced at the bikes again and saw that they were resting on a pile of yard clippings and dead branches. \"Are you positive about that?\" \"Sure, you want to ask her?\" It was probably better not to involve adults who might mention this to Charlie. \"No, I believe you.\" \"You want me to help you?\" he offered. \"They're not light.\" \"Okay, thanks. I only need one, though.\" \"Might as well take both,\" the boy said. \"Maybe you could scavenge some parts.\" He followed me out into the <em>downpour</em> and helped me load both of the heavy bikes into the back of my truck. He seemed eager to be rid of them, so I didn't argue. \"What are you going to do with them, anyway?\" he asked. \"They haven't worked in years.\" \"I kind of guessed that,\" I said, shrugging. My spur-of-the-moment whim hadn't come with a plan intact. \"Maybe I'll take them to Dowling's.\" He snorted. \"Dowling would charge more to fix them than they'd be worth running.\" I couldn't argue with that. John Dowling had earned a reputation for his pricing; no one went to him except in an emergency. Most people preferred to make the drive up to Port Angeles, if their car was able. I'd been very lucky on that front\u2014I'd been worried, when Charlie first gifted me my ancient truck, that I wouldn't be able to afford to keep it running. But I'd never had a single problem with it, other than the screaming-loud engine and the fifty-five-mile-per-hour maximum speed limit. Jacob Black had kept it in great shape when it had belonged to his father, Billy\u2026 Inspiration hit like a bolt of lightning\u2014not unreasonable, considering the storm. \"You know what? That's okay. I know someone who builds cars.\" \"Oh. That's good.\" He smiled in relief. He waved as I pulled away, still smiling. Friendly kid. I drove quickly and purposefully now, in a hurry to get home before there was the slightest chance of Charlie appearing, even in the highly unlikely event that he might knock off early. I dashed through the house to the phone, keys still in hand. \"Chief Swan, please,\" I said when the deputy answered. \"It's Bella.\" \"Oh, hey, Bella,\" Deputy Steve said affably. \"I'll go get him.\" I waited. \"What's wrong, Bella?\" Charlie demanded as soon as he picked up the phone. \"Can't I call you at work without there being an emergency?\" He was quiet for a minute. \"You never have before. Is there an emergency?\" \"No. I just wanted directions to the Blacks' place\u2014I'm not sure I can remember the way. I want to visit Jacob. I haven't seen him in months.\" When Charlie spoke again, his voice was much happier. \"That's a great idea, Bells. Do you have a pen?\" The directions he gave me were very simple. I assured him that I would be back for dinner, though he tried to tell me not to hurry. He wanted to join me in La Push, and I wasn't having that. So it was with a deadline that I drove too quickly through the storm-darkened streets out of town. I hoped I could get Jacob alone. Billy would probably tell on me if he knew what I was up to. While I drove, I worried a little bit about Billy's reaction to seeing me. He would be too pleased. In Billy's mind, no doubt, this had all worked out better than he had dared to hope. His pleasure and relief would only remind me of the one I couldn't bear to be reminded of. Not again today, I pleaded silently. I was spent. The Blacks' house was vaguely familiar, a small wooden place with narrow windows, the dull red paint making it resemble a tiny barn. Jacob's head peered out of the window before I could even get out of the truck. No doubt the familiar roar of the engine had tipped him off to my approach. Jacob had been very grateful when Charlie bought Billy's truck for me, saving Jacob from having to drive it when he came of age. I liked my truck very much, but Jacob seemed to consider the speed restrictions a shortcoming. He met me halfway to the house. \"Bella!\" His excited grin stretched wide across his face, the bright teeth standing in vivid contrast to the deep russet color of his skin. I'd never seen his hair out of its usual ponytail before. It fell like black satin curtains on either side of his broad face. Jacob had grown into some of his potential in the last eight months. He'd passed that point where the soft muscles of childhood hardened into the solid, lanky build of a teenager; the tendons and veins had become prominent under the red-brown skin of his arms, his hands. His face was still sweet like I remembered it, though it had hardened, too\u2014the planes of his cheekbones sharper, his jaw squared off, all childish roundness gone. \"Hey, Jacob!\" I felt an unfamiliar surge of enthusiasm at his smile. I realized that I was pleased to see him. This knowledge surprised me. I smiled back, and something clicked silently into place, like two corresponding puzzle pieces. I'd forgotten how much I really liked Jacob Black. He stopped a few feet away from me, and I stared up at him in surprise, leaning my head back though the rain pelted my face. \"You grew again!\" I accused in amazement. He laughed, his smile widening impossibly. \"Six five,\" he announced with self-satisfaction. His voice was deeper, but it had the husky tone I remembered. \"Is it ever going to stop?\" I shook my head in disbelief. \"You're huge.\" \"Still a beanpole, though.\" He grimaced. \"Come inside! You're getting all wet.\" He led the way, twisting his hair in his big hands as he walked. He pulled a rubber band from his hip pocket and wound it around the bundle. \"Hey, Dad,\" he called as he ducked to get through the front door. \"Look who stopped by.\" Billy was in the tiny square living room, a book in his hands. He set the book in his lap and wheeled himself forward when he saw me. \"Well, what do you know! It's good to see you, Bella.\" We shook hands. Mine was lost in his wide grasp. \"What brings you out here? Everything okay with Charlie?\" \"Yes, absolutely. I just wanted to see Jacob\u2014I haven't seen him in forever.\" Jacob's eyes brightened at my words. He was smiling so big it looked like it would hurt his cheeks.  \"Can you stay for dinner?\" Billy was eager, too. \"No, I've got to feed Charlie, you know.\" \"I'll call him now,\" Billy suggested. \"He's always invited.\" I laughed to hide my discomfort. \"It's not like you'll never see me again. I promise I'll be back again soon\u2014so much you'll get sick of me.\" After all, if Jacob could fix the bike, someone had to teach me how to ride it. Billy chuckled in response. \"Okay, maybe next time.\" \"So, Bella, what do you want to do?\" Jacob asked. \"Whatever. What were you doing before I interrupted?\" I was strangely comfortable here. It was familiar, but only distantly. There were no painful reminders of the recent past. Jacob hesitated. \"I was just heading out to work on my car, but we can do something else\u2026\" \"No, that's perfect!\" I interrupted. \"I'd love to see your car.\" \"Okay,\" he said, not convinced. \"It's out back, in the garage.\" Even better, I thought to myself. I waved at Billy. \"See you later.\" A thick stand of trees and shrubbery concealed his garage from the house. The garage\u00a0\u00a0 was no more than a couple of big preformed sheds that had been bolted together with their interior walls knocked out.  Under this shelter, raised on cinder blocks, was what looked to me like a completed automobile. I recognized the symbol on the grille, at least. \"What kind of Volkswagen is that?\" I asked. \"It's an old Rabbit\u20141986, a classic.\" \"How's it going?\" \"Almost finished,\" he said cheerfully. And then his voice dropped into a lower key. \"My dad made good on his promise last spring.\" \"Ah,\" I said. He seemed to understand my reluctance to open the subject. I tried not to remember last May at the prom. Jacob had been bribed by his father with money and car parts to deliver a message there. Billy wanted me to stay a safe distance from the most important person in my life. It turned out that his concern was, in the end, unnecessary. I was all too safe now. But I was going to see what I could do to change that. \"Jacob, what do you know about motorcycles?\" I asked. He shrugged. \"Some. My friend Embry has a dirt bike. We work on it together sometimes. Why?\" \"Well\u2026\" I pursed my lips as I considered. I wasn't sure if he could keep his mouth shut, but I didn't have many other options. \"I recently acquired a couple of bikes, and they're not in the greatest condition. I wonder if you could get them running?\" \"Cool.\" He seemed truly pleased by the challenge. His face glowed. \"I'll give it a try.\" I held up one finger in warning. \"The thing is,\" I explained, \"Charlie doesn't approve of motorcycles. \u00a0Honestly, he'd probably bust a vein in his forehead if he knew about this. So you can't tell Billy.\" \"Sure, sure.\" Jacob smiled. \"I understand.\" \"I'll pay you,\" I continued. This offended him. \"No. I want to help. You can't pay me.\" \"Well\u2026 how about a trade, then?\" I was making this up as I went, but it seemed reasonable enough. \"I only need one bike\u2014and I'll need lessons, too. So how about this? I'll give you the other bike, and then you can teach me.\" \"Swee-eet.\" He made the word into two syllables. \"Wait a sec\u2014are you legal yet? When's your birthday?\" \"You missed it,\" he teased, narrowing his eyes in mock resentment. \"I'm sixteen.\" \"Not that your age ever stopped you before,\" I muttered. \"Sorry about your birthday.\" \"Don't worry about it. I missed yours. What are you, forty?\" I sniffed. \"Close.\" \"We'll have a joint party to make up for it.\" \"Sounds like a date.\" His eyes sparkled at the word. I needed to reign in the enthusiasm before I gave him the wrong idea\u2014it was just that it had been a long time since I'd felt so light and buoyant. The rarity of the feeling made it more difficult to manage. \"Maybe when the bikes are finished\u2014our present to ourselves,\" I added. \"Deal. When will you bring them down?\" I bit my lip, embarrassed. \"They're in my truck now,\" I admitted. \"Great.\" He seemed to mean it. \"Will Billy see if we bring them around?\" He winked at me. \"We'll be sneaky.\" We eased around from the east, sticking to the trees when we were in view of the windows, affecting a casual-looking stroll, just in case. Jacob unloaded the bikes swiftly from the truck bed, wheeling them one by one into the shrubbery where I hid. It looked too easy for him\u2014I'd remembered the bikes being much, much heavier than that. \"These aren't half bad,\" Jacob appraised as we pushed them through the cover of the trees. \"This one here will actually be worth something when I'm done\u2014it's an old Harley Sprint.\" \"That one's yours, then.\" \"Are you sure?\" \"Absolutely.\" \"These are going to take some cash, though,\" he said, frowning down at the blackened metal. \"We'll have to save up for parts first.\" \"We nothing,\" I disagreed. \"If you're doing this for free, I'll pay for the parts.\" \"I don't know\u2026\" he muttered. \"I've got some money saved. College fund, you know.\" College, schmollege, I thought to myself. It wasn't like I'd saved up enough to go anywhere special\u2014and besides, I had no desire to leave Forks anyway. What difference would it make if I skimmed a little bit off the top? Jacob just nodded. This all made perfect sense to him. As we skulked back to the makeshift garage, I contemplated my luck. Only a teenage boy would agree to this: deceiving both our parents while repairing dangerous vehicles using money meant for my college education. He didn't see anything wrong with that picture. Jacob was a gift from the gods.",

            "en": "17         17. THE GAME It was just beginning to drizzle when Edward turned onto my street. Up until that moment, I'd had no doubt that he'd be staying with me while I spent a few interim hours in the real world. And then I saw the black car, a weathered Ford, parked in Charlie's driveway \u2014 and heard Edward mutter something unintelligible in a low, harsh voice. Leaning away from the rain under the shallow front porch, Jacob Black stood behind his father's wheelchair. Billy's face was impassive as stone as Edward parked my truck against the curb. Jacob stared down, his expression mortified. Edward's low voice was furious. \"This is crossing the line.\" \"He came to warn Charlie?\" I guessed, more horrified than angry. Edward just nodded, answering Billy's gaze through the rain with narrowed eyes. I felt weak with relief that Charlie wasn't home yet. \"Let me deal with this,\" I suggested. Edward's black glare made me anxious. To my surprise, he agreed. \"That's probably best. Be careful, though. The child has no idea.\" I bridled a little at the word child. \"Jacob is not that much younger than I am,\" I reminded him. He looked at me then, his anger abruptly fading. \"Oh, I know,\" he assured me with a grin. I sighed and put my hand on the door handle. \"Get them inside,\" he instructed, \"so I can leave. I'll be back around dusk.\" \"Do you want my truck?\" I offered, meanwhile wondering how I would explain its absence to Charlie. He rolled his eyes. \"I could walk home faster than this truck moves.\" \"You don't have to leave,\" I said wistfully. He smiled at my glum expression. \"Actually, I do. After you get rid of them\" \u2014 he threw a dark glance in the Blacks' direction \u2014 \"you still have to prepare Charlie to meet your new boyfriend.\" He grinned widely, showing all of his teeth. I groaned. \"Thanks a lot.\" He smiled the crooked smile that I loved. \"I'll be back soon,\" he promised. His eyes flickered back to the porch, and then he leaned in to swiftly kiss me just under the edge of my jaw. My heart lurched frantically, and I, too, glanced toward the porch. Billy's face was no longer impassive, and his hands clutched at the armrests of his chair. \"Soon,\" I stressed as I opened the door and stepped out into the rain. I could feel his eyes on my back as I half-ran through the light sprinkle toward the porch. \"Hey, Billy. Hi, Jacob.\" I greeted them as cheerfully as I could manage. \"Charlie's gone for the day \u2014 I hope you haven't been waiting long.\" \"Not long,\" Billy said in a subdued tone. His black eyes were piercing. \"I just wanted to bring this up.\" He indicated a brown paper sack resting in his lap. \"Thanks,\" I said, though I had no idea what it could be. \"Why don't you come in for a minute and dry off?\" I pretended to be oblivious to his intense scrutiny as I unlocked the door, and waved them in ahead of me. \"Here, let me take that,\" I offered, turning to shut the door. I allowed myself one last glance at Edward. He was waiting, perfectly still, his eyes solemn. \"You'll want to put it in the fridge,\" Billy noted as he handed me the package. \"It's some of Harry Clearwater's homemade fish fry \u2014 Charlie's favorite. The fridge keeps it drier.\" He shrugged. \"Thanks,\" I repeated, but with feeling this time. \"I was running out of new ways to fix fish, and he's bound to bring home more tonight.\" \"Fishing again?\" Billy asked with a subtle gleam in his eye. \"Down at the usual spot? Maybe I'll run by and see him.\" \"No,\" I quickly lied, my face going hard. \"He was headed someplace new\u2026 but I have no idea where.\" He took in my changed expression, and it made him thoughtful. \"Jake,\" he said, still appraising me. \"Why don't you go get that new picture of Rebecca out of the car? I'll leave that for Charlie, too.\" \"Where is it?\" Jacob asked, his voice morose. I glanced at him, but he was staring at the floor, his eyebrows pulling together. \"I think I saw it in the trunk,\" Billy said. \"You may have to dig for it.\" Jacob slouched back out into the rain. Billy and I faced each other in silence. After a few seconds, the quiet started to feel awkward, so I turned and headed to the kitchen. I could hear his wet wheels squeak against the linoleum as he followed. I shoved the bag onto the crowded top shelf of the fridge, and spun around to confront him. His deeply lined face was unreadable. \"Charlie won't be back for a long time.\" My voice was almost rude. He nodded in agreement, but said nothing. \"Thanks again for the fish fry,\" I hinted. He continued nodding. I sighed and folded my arms across my chest. He seemed to sense that I had given up on small talk. \"Bella,\" he said, and then he hesitated. I waited. \"Bella,\" he said again, \"Charlie is one of my best friends.\" \"Yes.\" He spoke each word carefully in his rumbling voice. \"I noticed you've been spending time with one of the Cullens.\" \"Yes,\" I repeated curtly. His eyes narrowed. \"Maybe it's none of my business, but I don't think that is such a good idea.\" \"You're right,\" I agreed. \"It is none of your business.\" He raised his graying eyebrows at my tone. \"You probably don't know this, but the Cullen family has an unpleasant reputation on the reservation.\" \"Actually, I did know that,\" I informed him in a hard voice. This surprised him. \"But that reputation couldn't be deserved, could it?\u00a0 Because the Cullens never set foot on the reservation, do they?\" I could see that my less than subtle reminder of the agreement that both bound and protected his tribe pulled him up short. \"That's true,\" he acceded, his eyes guarded. \"You seem\u2026 well informed about the Cullens. More informed than I expected.\" I stared him down. \"Maybe even better informed than you are.\" He pursed his thick lips as he considered that. \"Maybe.\" he allowed, but his eyes were shrewd. \"Is Charlie as well informed?\" He had found the weak chink in my armor. \"Charlie likes the Cullens a lot,\" I hedged. He clearly understood my evasion. His expression was unhappy, but unsurprised. \"It's not my business,\" he said. \"But it may be Charlie's.\" \"Though it would be my business, again, whether or not I think that it's Charlie's business, right?\" I wondered if he even understood my confused question as I struggled not to say anything compromising. But he seemed to. He thought about it while the rain picked up against the roof, the only sound breaking the silence. \"Yes,\" he finally surrendered. \"I guess that's your business, too.\" I sighed with relief. \"Thanks, Billy.\" \"Just think about what you're doing, Bella,\" he urged. \"Okay,\" I agreed quickly. He frowned. \"What I meant to say was, don't do what you're doing.\" I looked into his eyes, filled with nothing but concern for me, and there was nothing I could say. Just then the front door banged loudly, and I jumped at the sound. \"There's no picture anywhere in that car.\" Jacob's complaining voice reached us before he did. The shoulders of his shirt were stained with the rain, his hair dripping, when he rounded the corner. \"Hmm,\" Billy grunted, suddenly detached, spinning his chair around to face his son. \"I guess I left it at home.\" Jacob rolled his eyes dramatically. \"Great.\" \"Well, Bella, tell Charlie\" \u2014 Billy paused before continuing \u2014 \"that we stopped by, I mean.\" \"I will,\" I muttered. Jacob was surprised. \"Are we leaving already?\" \"Charlie's gonna be out late,\" Billy explained as he rolled himself past Jacob. \"Oh.\" Jacob looked disappointed. \"Well, I guess I'll see you later, then, Bella.\" \"Sure,\" I agreed. \"Take care,\" Billy warned me. I didn't answer. Jacob helped his father out the door. I waved briefly, glancing swiftly toward my now-empty truck, and then shut the door before they were gone. I stood in the hallway for a minute, listening to the sound of their car as it backed out and drove away. I stayed where I was, waiting for the irritation and anxiety to subside. When the tension eventually faded a bit, I headed upstairs to change out of my dressy clothes. I tried on a couple of different tops, not sure what to expect tonight. As I concentrated on what was coming, what had just passed became insignificant. Now that I was removed from Jasper's and Edward's influence, I began to make up for not being terrified before. I gave up quickly on choosing an outfit \u2014 throwing on an old flannel shirt and jeans \u2014 knowing I would be in my raincoat all night anyway. The phone rang and I sprinted downstairs to get it. There was only one voice I wanted to hear; anything else would be a disappointment. But I knew that if he wanted to talk to me, he'd probably just materialize in my room. \"Hello?\" I asked, breathless. \"Bella? It's me,\" Jessica said. \"Oh, hey, Jess.\" I scrambled for a moment to come back down to reality. It felt like months rather than days since I'd spoken to Jess. \"How was the dance?\" \"It was so much fun!\" Jessica gushed. Needing no more invitation than that, she launched into a minute-by-minute account of the previous night. I mmm'd and ahh'd at the right places, but it wasn't easy to concentrate. Jessica, Mike, the dance, the school \u2014 they all seemed strangely irrelevant at the moment. My eyes kept flashing to the window, trying to judge the degree of light behind the heavy clouds. \"Did you hear what I said, Bella?\" Jess asked, irritated. \"I'm sorry, what?\" \"I said, Mike kissed me! Can you believe it?\" \"That's wonderful, Jess,\" I said. \"So what did you do yesterday?\" Jessica challenged, still sounding bothered by my lack of attention. Or maybe she was upset because I hadn't asked for details. \"Nothing, really. I just hung around outside to enjoy the sun.\" I heard Charlie's car in the garage. \"Did you ever hear anything more from Edward Cullen?\" The front door slammed and I could hear Charlie banging around under the stairs, putting his tackle away. \"Um.\" I hesitated, not sure what my story was anymore. \"Hi there, kiddo!\" Charlie called as he walked into the kitchen. I waved at him. Jess heard his voice. \"Oh, your dad's there. Never mind \u2014 we'll talk tomorrow. See you in Trig.\" \"See ya, Jess.\" I hung up the phone. \"Hey, Dad,\" I said. He was scrubbing his hands in the sink. \"Where's the fish?\" \"I put it out in the freezer.\" \"I'll go grab a few pieces before they freeze \u2014 Billy dropped off some of Harry Clearwater's fish fry this afternoon.\" I worked to sound enthusiastic. \"He did?\" Charlie's eyes lit up. \"That's my favorite.\" Charlie cleaned up while I got dinner ready. It didn't take long till we were sitting at the table, eating in silence. Charlie was enjoying his food. I was wondering desperately how to fulfill my assignment, struggling to think of a way to broach the subject. \"What did you do with yourself today?\" he asked, snapping me out of my reverie. \"Well, this afternoon I just hung out around the house\u2026\" Only the very recent part of this afternoon, actually. I tried to keep my voice upbeat, but my stomach was hollow. \"And this morning I was over at the Cullens'.\" Charlie dropped his fork. \"Dr. Cullen's place?\" he asked in astonishment. I pretended not to notice his reaction. \"Yeah.\" \"What were you doing there?\" He hadn't picked his fork back up. \"Well, I sort of have a date with Edward Cullen tonight, and he wanted to introduce me to his parents\u2026 Dad?\" It appeared that Charlie was having an aneurysm. \"Dad, are you all right?\" \"You are going out with Edward Cullen?\" he thundered. Uh-oh. \"I thought you liked the Cullens.\" \"He's too old for you,\" he ranted. \"We're both juniors,\" I corrected, though he was more right than he dreamed. \"Wait\u2026\" He paused. \"Which one is Edwin?\" \"Edward is the youngest, the one with the reddish brown hair.\" The beautiful one, the godlike one\u2026 \"Oh, well, that's\" \u2014 he struggled \u2014 \"better, I guess. I don't like the look of that big one. I'm sure he's a nice boy and all, but he looks too\u2026 mature for you. Is this Edwin your boyfriend?\" \"It's Edward, Dad.\" \"Is he?\" \"Sort of, I guess.\" \"You said last night that you weren't interested in any of the boys in town.\" But he picked up his fork again, so I could see the worst was over. \"Well, Edward doesn't live in town, Dad.\" He gave me a disparaging look as he chewed. \"And, anyways,\" I continued, \"it's kind of at an early stage, you know.\u00a0 Don't embarrass me with all the boyfriend talk, okay?\" \"When is he coming over?\" \"He'll be here in a few minutes.\" \"Where is he taking you?\" I groaned loudly. \"I hope you're getting the Spanish Inquisition out of your system now. We're going to play baseball with his family.\" His face puckered, and then he finally chuckled. \"You're playing baseball?\" \"Well, I'll probably watch most of the time.\" \"You must really like this guy,\" he observed suspiciously. I sighed and rolled my eyes for his benefit. I heard the roar of an engine pull up in front of the house. I jumped up and started cleaning my dishes. \"Leave the dishes, I can do them tonight. You baby me too much.\" The doorbell rang, and Charlie stalked off to answer it. I was half a step behind him. I hadn't realized how hard it was pouring outside. Edward stood in the halo of the porch light, looking like a male model in an advertisement for raincoats. \"Come on in, Edward.\" I breathed a sigh of relief when Charlie got his name right. \"Thanks, Chief Swan,\" Edward said in a respectful voice. \"Go ahead and call me Charlie. Here, I'll take your jacket.\" \"Thanks, sir.\" \"Have a seat there, Edward.\" I grimaced. Edward sat down fluidly in the only chair, forcing me to sit next to Chief Swan on the sofa. I quickly shot him a dirty look. He winked behind Charlie's back. \"So I hear you're getting my girl to watch baseball.\" Only in Washington would the fact that it was raining buckets have no bearing at all on the playing of outdoor sports. \"Yes, sir, that's the plan.\" He didn't look surprised that I'd told my father the truth. He might have been listening, though. \"Well, more power to you, I guess.\" Charlie laughed, and Edward joined in. \"Okay.\" I stood up. \"Enough humor at my expense. Let's go.\" I walked back to the hall and pulled on my jacket. They followed. \"Not too late, Bell.\" \"Don't worry, Charlie, I'll have her home early,\" Edward promised. \"You take care of my girl, all right?\" I groaned, but they ignored me. \"She'll be safe with me, I promise, sir.\" Charlie couldn't doubt Edward's sincerity, it rang in every word. I stalked out. They both laughed, and Edward followed me. I stopped dead on the porch. There, behind my truck, was a monster Jeep. Its tires were higher than my waist. There were metal guards over the headlights and tail-lights, and four large spotlights attached to the crash bar. The hardtop was shiny red. Charlie let out a low whistle. \"Wear your seat belts,\" he choked out. Edward followed me around to my side and opened the door. I gauged the distance to the seat and prepared to jump for it. He sighed, and then lifted me in with one hand. I hoped Charlie didn't notice. As he went around to the driver's side, at a normal, human pace, I tried to put on my seat belt. But there were too many buckles. \"What's all this?\" I asked when he opened the door. \"It's an off-roading harness.\" \"Uh-oh.\" I tried to find the right places for all the buckles to fit, but it wasn't going too quickly. He sighed again and reached over to help me. I was glad that the rain was too heavy to see Charlie clearly on the porch. That meant he couldn't see how Edward's hands lingered at my neck, brushed along my collarbones. I gave up trying to help him and focused on not hyperventilating. Edward turned the key and the engine roared to life. We pulled away from the house. \"This is a\u2026 um\u2026 big Jeep you have.\" \"It's Emmett's. I didn't think you'd want to run the whole way.\" \"Where do you keep this thing?\" \"We remodeled one of the outbuildings into a garage.\" \"Aren't you going to put on your seat belt?\" He threw me a disbelieving look. Then something sunk in. \"Run the whole way? As in, we're still going to run part of the way?\" My voice edged up a few octaves. He grinned tightly. \"You're not going to run.\" \"I'm going to be sick.\" \"Keep your eyes closed, you'll be fine.\" I bit my lip, fighting the panic. He leaned over to kiss the top of my head, and then groaned. I looked at him, puzzled. \"You smell so good in the rain,\" he explained. \"In a good way, or in a bad way?\" I asked cautiously. He sighed. \"Both, always both.\" I don't know how he found his way in the gloom and <em>downpour</em>, but he somehow found a side road that was less of a road and more of a mountain path. For a long while conversation was impossible, because I was bouncing up and down on the seat like a jackhammer. He seemed to enjoy the ride, though, smiling hugely the whole way. And then we came to the end of the road; the trees formed green walls on three sides of the Jeep. The rain was a mere drizzle, slowing every second, the sky brighter through the clouds. \"Sorry, Bella, we have to go on foot from here.\" \"You know what? I'll just wait here.\" \"What happened to all your courage? You were extraordinary this morning.\" \"I haven't forgotten the last time yet.\" Could it have been only yesterday? He was around to my side of the car in a blur. He started unbuckling me. \"I'll get those, you go on ahead,\" I protested. \"Hmmm\u2026\" he mused as he quickly finished. \"It seems I'm going to have to tamper with your memory.\" Before I could react, he pulled me from the Jeep and set my feet on the ground. It was barely misting now; Alice was going to be right. \"Tamper with my memory?\" I asked nervously. \"Something like that.\" He was watching me intently, carefully, but there was humor deep in his eyes. He placed his hands against the Jeep on either side of my head and leaned forward, forcing me to press back against the door. He leaned in even closer, his face inches from mine. I had no room to escape. \"Now,\" he breathed, and just his smell disturbed my thought processes, \"what exactly are you worrying about?\" \"Well, um, hitting a tree \u2014\" I gulped \"\u2014 and dying. And then getting sick.\" He fought back a smile. Then he bent his head down and touched his cold lips softly to the hollow at the base of my throat. \"Are you still worried now?\" he murmured against my skin. \"Yes.\" I struggled to concentrate. \"About hitting trees and getting sick.\" His nose drew a line up the skin of my throat to the point of my chin. His cold breath tickled my skin. \"And now?\" His lips whispered against my jaw. \"Trees,\" I gasped. \"Motion sickness.\" He lifted his face to kiss my eyelids. \"Bella, you don't really think I would hit a tree, do you?\" \"No, but I might.\" There was no confidence in my voice. He smelled an easy victory. He kissed slowly down my cheek, stopping just at the corner of my mouth. \"Would I let a tree hurt you?\" His lips barely brushed against my trembling lower lip. \"No,\" I breathed. I knew there was a second part to my brilliant defense, but I couldn't quite call it back. \"You see,\" he said, his lips moving against mine. \"There's nothing to be afraid of, is there?\" \"No,\" I sighed, giving up. Then he took my face in his hands almost roughly, and kissed me in earnest, his unyielding lips moving against mine. There really was no excuse for my behavior. Obviously I knew better by now. And yet I couldn't seem to stop from reacting exactly as I had the first time. Instead of keeping safely motionless, my arms reached up to twine tightly around his neck, and I was suddenly welded to his stone figure. I sighed, and my lips parted. He staggered back, breaking my grip effortlessly. \"Damn it, Bella!\" he broke off, gasping. \"You'll be the death of me, I swear you will.\" I leaned over, bracing my hands against my knees for support. \"You're indestructible,\" I mumbled, trying to catch my breath. \"I might have believed that before I met you. Now let's get out of here before I do something really stupid,\" he growled. He threw me across his back as he had before, and I could see the extra effort it took for him to be as gentle as he was. I locked my legs around his waist and secured my arms in a choke hold around his neck. \"Don't forget to close your eyes,\" he warned severely. I quickly tucked my face into his shoulder blade, under my own arm, and squeezed my eyes shut. And I could hardly tell we were moving. I could feel him gliding along beneath me, but he could have been strolling down the sidewalk, the movement was so smooth. I was tempted to peek, just to see if he was really flying through the forest like before, but I resisted. It wasn't worth that awful dizziness. I contented myself with listening to his breath come and go evenly. I wasn't quite sure we had stopped until he reached back and touched my hair. \"It's over, Bella.\" I dared to open my eyes, and, sure enough, we were at a standstill. I stiffly unlocked my stranglehold on his body and slipped to the ground, landing on my backside. \"Oh!\" I huffed as I hit the wet ground. He stared at me incredulously, evidently not sure whether he was still too mad to find me funny. But my bewildered expression pushed him over the edge, and he broke into a roar of laughter. I picked myself up, ignoring him as I brushed the mud and bracken off the back of my jacket. That only made him laugh harder. Annoyed, I began to stride off into the forest. I felt his arm around my waist. \"Where are you going, Bella?\" \"To watch a baseball game. You don't seem to be interested in playing anymore, but I'm sure the others will have fun without you.\" \"You're going the wrong way.\" I turned around without looking at him, and stalked off in the opposite direction. He caught me again. \"Don't be mad, I couldn't help myself. You should have seen your face.\" He chuckled before he could stop himself. \"Oh, you're the only one who's allowed to get mad?\" I asked, raising my eyebrows. \"I wasn't mad at you.\" \"'Bella, you'll be the death of me'?\" I quoted sourly. \"That was simply a statement of fact.\" I tried to turn away from him again, but he held me fast. \"You were mad,\" I insisted. \"Yes.\" \"But you just said \u2014\" \"That I wasn't mad at you. Can't you see that, Bella?\" He was suddenly intense, all trace of teasing gone. \"Don't you understand?\" \"See what?\" I demanded, confused by his sudden mood swing as much as his words. \"I'm never angry with you \u2014 how could I be? Brave, trusting\u2026 warm as you are.\" \"Then why?\" I whispered, remembering the black moods that pulled him away from me, that I'd always interpreted as well-justified frustration \u2014 frustration at my weakness, my slowness, my unruly human reactions\u2026 He put his hands carefully on both sides of my face. \"I infuriate myself,\" he said gently. \"The way I can't seem to keep from putting you in danger. My very existence puts you at risk. Sometimes I truly hate myself. I should be stronger, I should be able to \u2014\"  I placed my hand over his mouth. \"Don't.\" He took my hand, moving it from his lips, but holding it to his face. \"I love you,\" he said. \"It's a poor excuse for what I'm doing, but it's still true.\" It was the first time he'd said he loved me \u2014 in so many words. He might not realize it, but I certainly did. \"Now, please try to behave yourself,\" he continued, and he bent to softly brush his lips against mine. I held properly still. Then I sighed. \"You promised Chief Swan that you would have me home early, remember? We'd better get going.\" \"Yes, ma'am.\" He smiled wistfully and released all of me but one hand. He led me a few feet through the tall, wet ferns and draping moss, around a massive hemlock tree, and we were there, on the edge of an enormous open field in the lap of the Olympic peaks. It was twice the size of any baseball stadium. I could see the others all there; Esme, Emmett, and Rosalie, sitting on a bare outcropping of rock, were the closest to us, maybe a hundred yards away. Much farther out I could see Jasper and Alice, at least a quarter of a mile apart, appearing to throw something back and forth, but I never saw any ball. It looked like Carlisle was marking bases, but could they really be that far apart? When we came into view, the three on the rocks rose. Esme started toward us. Emmett followed after a long look at Rosalie's back; Rosalie had risen gracefully and strode off toward the field without a glance in our direction. My stomach quivered uneasily in response. \"Was that you we heard, Edward?\" Esme asked as she approached. \"It sounded like a bear choking,\" Emmett clarified. I smiled hesitantly at Esme. \"That was him.\" \"Bella was being unintentionally funny,\" Edward explained, quickly settling the score. Alice had left her position and was running, or dancing, toward us. She hurtled to a fluid stop at our feet. \"It's time,\" she announced. As soon as she spoke, a deep rumble of thunder shook the forest beyond us, and then crashed westward toward town. \"Eerie, isn't it?\" Emmett said with easy familiarity, winking at me. \"Let's go.\" Alice reached for Emmett's hand and they darted toward the oversized field; she ran like a gazelle. He was nearly as graceful and just as fast \u2014 yet Emmett could never be compared to a gazelle. \"Are you ready for some ball?\" Edward asked, his eyes eager, bright. I tried to sound appropriately enthusiastic. \"Go team!\" He snickered and, after mussing my hair, bounded off after the other two. His run was more aggressive, a cheetah rather than a gazelle, and he quickly overtook them. The grace and power took my breath away. \"Shall we go down?\" Esme asked in her soft, melodic voice, and I realized I was staring openmouthed after him. I quickly reassembled my expression and nodded. Esme kept a few feet between us, and I wondered if she was still being careful not to frighten me. She matched her stride to mine without seeming impatient at the pace.  \"You don't play with them?\" I asked shyly. \"No, I prefer to referee \u2014 I like keeping them honest,\" she explained. \"Do they like to cheat, then?\" \"Oh yes \u2014 you should hear the arguments they get into! Actually, I hope you don't, you would think they were raised by a pack of wolves.\" \"You sound like my mom,\" I laughed, surprised. She laughed, too. \"Well, I do think of them as my children in most ways. I never could get over my mothering instincts \u2014 did Edward tell you I had lost a child?\" \"No,\" I murmured, stunned, scrambling to understand what lifetime she was remembering. \"Yes, my first and only baby. He died just a few days after he was born, the poor tiny thing,\" she sighed. \"It broke my heart \u2014 that's why I jumped off the cliff, you know,\" she added matter-of-factly. \"Edward just said you f-fell,\" I stammered. \"Always the gentleman.\" She smiled. \"Edward was the first of my new sons. I've always thought of him that way, even though he's older than I, in one way at least.\" She smiled at me warmly. \"That's why I'm so happy that he's found you, dear.\" The endearment sounded very natural on her lips. \"He's been the odd man out for far too long; it's hurt me to see him alone.\" \"You don't mind, then?\" I asked, hesitant again. \"That I'm\u2026 all wrong for him?\" \"No.\" She was thoughtful. \"You're what he wants. It will work out, somehow,\" she said, though her forehead creased with worry. Another peal of thunder began. Esme stopped then; apparently, we'd reached the edge of the field. It looked as if they had formed teams. Edward was far out in left field, Carlisle stood between the first and second bases, and Alice held the ball, positioned on the spot that must be the pitcher's mound. Emmett was swinging an aluminum bat; it whistled almost untraceably through the air. I waited for him to approach home plate, but then I realized, as he took his stance, that he was already there \u2014 farther from the pitcher's mound than I would have thought possible. Jasper stood several feet behind him, catching for the other team. Of course, none of them had gloves. \"All right,\" Esme called in a clear voice, which I knew even Edward would hear, as far out as he was. \"Batter up.\" Alice stood straight, deceptively motionless. Her style seemed to be stealth rather than an intimidating windup. She held the ball in both hands at her waist, and then, like the strike of a cobra, her right hand flicked out and the ball smacked into Jasper's hand. \"Was that a strike?\" I whispered to Esme. \"If they don't hit it, it's a strike,\" she told me. Jasper hurled the ball back to Alice's waiting hand. She permitted herself a brief grin. And then her hand spun out again. This time the bat somehow made it around in time to smash into the invisible ball. The crack of impact was shattering, thunderous; it echoed off the mountains \u2014 I immediately understood the necessity of the thunderstorm. The ball shot like a meteor above the field, flying deep into the surrounding forest. \"Home run,\" I murmured. \"Wait,\" Esme cautioned, listening intently, one hand raised. Emmett was a blur around the bases, Carlisle shadowing him. I realized Edward was missing. \"Out!\" Esme cried in a clear voice. I stared in disbelief as Edward sprang from the fringe of the trees, ball in his upraised hand, his wide grin visible even to me. \"Emmett hits the hardest,\" Esme explained, \"but Edward runs the fastest.\" The inning continued before my incredulous eyes. It was impossible to keep up with the speed at which the ball flew, the rate at which their bodies raced around the field. I learned the other reason they waited for a thunderstorm to play when Jasper, trying to avoid Edward's infallible fielding, hit a ground ball toward Carlisle. Carlisle ran into the ball, and then raced Jasper to first base. When they collided, the sound was like the crash of two massive falling boulders. I jumped up in concern, but they were somehow unscathed. \"Safe,\" Esme called in a calm voice. Emmett's team was up by one \u2014 Rosalie managed to flit around the bases after tagging up on one of Emmett's long flies \u2014 when Edward caught the third out. He sprinted to my side, sparkling with excitement. \"What do you think?\" he asked. \"One thing's for sure, I'll never be able to sit through dull old Major League Baseball again.\" \"And it sounds like you did so much of that before,\" he laughed. \"I am a little disappointed,\" I teased. \"Why?\" he asked, puzzled. \"Well, it would be nice if I could find just one thing you didn't do better than everyone else on the planet.\" He flashed his special crooked smile, leaving me breathless. \"I'm up,\" he said, heading for the plate. He played intelligently, keeping the ball low, out of the reach of Rosalie's always-ready hand in the outfield, gaining two bases like lightning before Emmett could get the ball back in play. Carlisle knocked one so far out of the field \u2014 with a boom that hurt my ears \u2014 that he and Edward both made it in. Alice slapped them dainty high fives. The score constantly changed as the game continued, and they razzed each other like any street ballplayers as they took turns with the lead. Occasionally Esme would call them to order. The thunder rumbled on, but we stayed dry, as Alice had predicted. Carlisle was up to bat, Edward catching, when Alice suddenly gasped. My eyes were on Edward, as usual, and I saw his head snap up to look at her. Their eyes met and something flowed between them in an instant. He was at my side before the others could ask Alice what was wrong. \"Alice?\" Esme's voice was tense. \"I didn't see \u2014 I couldn't tell,\" she whispered. All the others were gathered by this time. \"What is it, Alice?\" Carlisle asked with the calm voice of authority. \"They were traveling much quicker than I thought. I can see I had the perspective wrong before,\" she murmured. Jasper leaned over her, his posture protective. \"What changed?\" he asked. \"They heard us playing, and it changed their path,\" she said, contrite, as if she felt responsible for whatever had frightened her. Seven pairs of quick eyes flashed to my face and away. \"How soon?\" Carlisle said, turning toward Edward. A look of intense concentration crossed his face. \"Less than five minutes. They're running \u2014 they want to play.\" He scowled. \"Can you make it?\" Carlisle asked him, his eyes flicking toward me again. \"No, not carrying \u2014\" He cut short. \"Besides, the last thing we need is for them to catch the scent and start hunting.\" \"How many?\" Emmett asked Alice. \"Three,\" she answered tersely. \"Three!\" he scoffed. \"Let them come.\" The steel bands of muscle flexed along his massive arms. For a split second that seemed much longer than it really was, Carlisle deliberated. Only Emmett seemed unperturbed; the rest stared at Carlisle's face with anxious eyes. \"Let's just continue the game,\" Carlisle finally decided. His voice was cool and level. \"Alice said they were simply curious.\" All this was said in a flurry of words that lasted only a few seconds. I had listened carefully and caught most of it, though I couldn't hear what Esme now asked Edward with a silent vibration of her lips. I only saw the slight shake of his head and the look of relief on her face. \"You catch, Esme,\" he said. \"I'll call it now.\" And he planted himself in front of me. The others returned to the field, warily sweeping the dark forest with their sharp eyes. Alice and Esme seemed to orient themselves around where I stood. \"Take your hair down,\" Edward said in a low, even voice. I obediently slid the rubber band out of my hair and shook it out around me. I stated the obvious. \"The others are coming now.\" \"Yes, stay very still, keep quiet, and don't move from my side, please.\" He hid the stress in his voice well, but I could hear it. He pulled my long hair forward, around my face. \"That won't help,\" Alice said softly. \"I could smell her across the field.\" \"I know.\" A hint of frustration colored his tone. Carlisle stood at the plate, and the others joined the game halfheartedly. \"What did Esme ask you?\" I whispered. He hesitated for a second before he answered. \"Whether they were thirsty,\" he muttered unwillingly. The seconds ticked by; the game progressed with apathy now. No one dared to hit harder than a bunt, and Emmett, Rosalie, and Jasper hovered in the infield.  Now and again, despite the fear that numbed my brain, I was aware of Rosalie's eyes on me. They were expressionless, but something about the way she held her mouth made me think she was angry. Edward paid no attention to the game at all, eyes and mind ranging the forest. \"I'm sorry, Bella,\" he muttered fiercely. \"It was stupid, irresponsible, to expose you like this. I'm so sorry.\" I heard his breath stop, and his eyes zeroed in on right field. He took a half step, angling himself between me and what was coming. Carlisle, Emmett, and the others turned in the same direction, hearing sounds of passage much too faint for my ears.",
