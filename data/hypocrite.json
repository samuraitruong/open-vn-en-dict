            "en": "1 3            13. KILLER If it was anyone but Jacob, i thought to myself, shaking my head as I drove down  the forest-lined highway to La Push. I still wasn't sure if I was doing the right thing, but I'd made a compromise with myself. I couldn't condone what Jacob and his friends, his pack, were doing. I understood now what he'd said last night\u2014that I might not want to see him again\u2014and I could have called him as he'd suggested, but that felt cowardly. I owed him a face-to-face conversation, at least. I would tell him to his face that I couldn't just overlook what was going on. I couldn't be friends with a killer and say nothing, let the killing continue\u2026 That would make me a monster, too. But I couldn't not warn him, either. I had to do what I could to protect him. I pulled up to the Blacks' house with my lips pressed together into a hard line. It was bad enough that my best friend was a werewolf. Did he have to be a monster, too? The house was dark, no lights in the windows, but I didn't care if I woke them. My fist thudded against the front door with angry energy; the sound reverberated through the walls. \"Come in,\" I heard Billy call after a minute, and a light flicked on. I twisted the knob; it was unlocked. Billy was leaning around an open doorway just off the little kitchen, a bathrobe around his shoulders, not in his chair yet. When he saw who it was, his eyes widened briefly, and then his face turned stoic. \"Well, good morning, Bella. What are you doing up so early?\" \"Hey, Billy. I need to talk to Jake\u2014where is he?\" \"Um\u2026 I don't really know,\" he lied, straight-faced. \"Do you know what Charlie is doing this morning?\" I demanded, sick of the stalling. \"Should I?\" \"He and half the other men in town are all out in the woods with guns, hunting giant wolves.\" Billy's expression flickered, and then went blank. \"So I'd like to talk to Jake about that, if you don't mind,\" I continued. Billy pursed his thick lips for a long moment. \"I'd bet he's still asleep,\" he finally said, nodding toward the tiny hallway off the front room. \"He's out late a lot these days. Kid needs his rest\u2014probably you shouldn't wake him.\" \"It's my turn,\" I muttered under my breath as I stalked to the hallway. Billy sighed. Jacob's tiny closet of a room was the only door in the yard-long hallway. I didn't bother to knock. I threw the door open; it slammed against the wall with a bang. Jacob\u2014still wearing just the same black cut-off sweats he'd worn last night\u2014was stretched diagonally across the double bed that took up all of his room but a few inches around the edges. Even on a slant, it wasn't long enough; his feet hung off the one end and his head off the other. He was fast asleep, snoring lightly with his mouth hanging open. The sound of the door hadn't even made him twitch. His face was peaceful with deep sleep, all the angry lines smoothed out. There were circles under his eyes that I hadn't noticed before. Despite his ridiculous size, he looked very young now, and very weary. Pity shook me. I stepped back out, and shut the door quietly behind me. Billy stared with curious, guarded eyes as I walked slowly back into the front room. \"I think I'll let him get some rest.\" Billy nodded, and then we gazed at each other for a minute. I was dying to ask him about his part in this. What did he think of what his son had become? But I knew how he'd supported Sam from the very beginning, and so I supposed the murders must not bother him. How he justified that to himself I couldn't imagine. I could see many questions for me in his dark eyes, but he didn't voice them either. \"Look,\" I said, breaking the loud silence. \"I'll be down at the beach for a while. When he wakes up, tell him I'm waiting for him, okay?\" \"Sure, sure,\" Billy agreed. I wondered if he really would. Well, if he didn't, I'd tried, right? I drove down to First Beach and parked in the empty dirt lot. It was still dark\u2014the gloomy predawn of a cloudy day\u2014and when I cut the headlights it was hard to see. I had to let my eyes adjust before I could find the path that led through the tall hedge of weeds. It was colder here, with the wind whipping off the black water, and I shoved my hands deep into the pockets of my winter jacket. At least the rain had stopped. I paced down the beach toward the north seawall. I couldn't see St. James or the other islands, just the vague shape of the water's edge. I picked my way carefully across the rocks, watching out for driftwood that might trip me. I found what I was looking for before I realized I was looking for it. It materialized out of the gloom when it was just a few feet away: a long bone-white driftwood tree stranded deep on the rocks. The roots twisted up at the seaward end, like a hundred brittle tentacles. I couldn't be sure that it was the same tree where Jacob and I had had our first conversation\u2014a conversation that had begun so many different, tangled threads of my life\u2014but it seemed to be in about the same place I sat down where I'd sat before, and stared out across the invisible sea. Seeing Jacob like that\u2014innocent and vulnerable in sleep\u2014had stolen all my revulsion, dissolved all my anger. I still couldn't turn a blind eye to what was happening, like Billy seemed to, but I couldn't condemn Jacob for it either. Love didn't work that way, I decided. Once you cared about a person, it was impossible to be logical about them anymore. Jacob was my friend whether he killed people or not. And I didn't know what I was going to do about that. When I pictured him sleeping so peacefully, I felt an overpowering urge to protect him. Completely illogical. Illogical or not, I brooded over the memory his peaceful face, trying to come up with some answer, some way to shelter him, while the sky slowly turned gray. \"Hi, Bella.\" Jacob's voice came from the darkness and made me jump. It was soft, almost shy, but I'd been expecting some forewarning from the noisy rocks, and so it still startled me. I could see his silhouette against the coming sunrise\u2014it looked enormous. \"Jake?\" He stood several paces away, shifting his weight from foot to foot anxiously. \"Billy told me you came by\u2014didn't take you very long, did it? I knew you could figure it out.\" \"Yeah, I remember the right story now,\" I whispered. It was quiet for a long moment and, though it was still too dark to see well, my skin prickled as if his eyes were searching my face. There must have been enough light for him to read my expression, because when he spoke again, his voice was suddenly acidic. \"You could have just called,\" he said harshly. I nodded. \"I know.\" Jacob started pacing along the rocks. If I listened very hard, I could just hear the gentle brush of his feet on the rocks behind the sound of the waves. The rocks had clattered like castanets for me. \"Why did you come?\" he demanded, not halting his angry stride. \"I thought it would be better face-to-face.\" He snorted. \"Oh, much better.\" \"Jacob, I have to warn you\u2014\" \"About the rangers and the hunters? Don't worry about it. We already know.\" \"Don't worry about it?\" I demanded in disbelief. \"Jake, they've got guns! They're setting traps and offering rewards and\u2014\" \"We can take care of ourselves,\" he growled, still pacing. \"They're not going to catch anything. They're only making it more difficult\u2014they'll start disappearing soon enough, too.\" \"Jake!\" I hissed. \"What? It's just a fact.\" My voice was pale with revulsion. \"How can you\u2026 feel that way? You know these people. Charlie's out there!\" The thought made my stomach twist. He came to an abrupt stop. \"What more can we do?\" he retorted. The sun turned the clouds a slivery pink above us. I could see his expression now; it was angry, frustrated, betrayed. \"Could you\u2026 well, try to not be a\u2026 werewolf?\" I suggested in a whisper. He threw his hands up in the air. \"Like I have a choice about it!\" he shouted. \"And how would that help anything, if you're worried about people disappearing?\" \"I don't understand you.\" He glared at me, his eyes narrowing and his mouth twisting into a snarl. \"You know what makes me so mad I could just spit?\" I flinched away from his hostile expression. He seemed to be waiting for an answer, so I shook my head. \"You're such a <em>hypocrite</em>, Bella\u2014there you sit, terrified of me! How is that fair?\" His hands shook with anger. \"<em>Hypocrite</em>? How does being afraid of a monster make me a <em>hypocrite</em>?\" \"Ugh!\" he groaned, pressing his trembling fists to his temples and squeezing his eyes shut. \"Would you listen to yourself?\" \"What?\" He took two steps toward me, leaning over me and glaring with fury. \"Well, I'm so sorry that I can't be the right kind of monster for you, Bella. I guess I'm just not as great as a bloodsucker, am I?\" I jumped to my feet and glared back. \"No, you're not!\" I shouted. \"It's not what you are, stupid, it's what you do!\" \"What's that supposed to mean?\" He roared, his entire frame quivering with rage. I was taken entirely by surprise when Edward's voice cautioned me. \"Be very careful, Bella,\" his velvet voice warned. \"Don't push him too far. You need to calm him down.\" Even the voice in my head was making no sense today. I listened to him, though. I would do anything for that voice. \"Jacob,\" I pleaded, making my tone soft and even. \"Is it really necessary to kill people, Jacob? Isn't there some other way? I mean, if vampires can find a way to survive without murdering people, couldn't you give it a try, too?\" He straightened up with a jerk, like my words had sent an electric shock through him. His eyebrows shot up and his eyes stared wide. \"Killing people?\" he demanded. \"What did you think we were talking about?\" He wasn't trembling anymore. He looked at me with half-hopeful disbelief. \"I thought we were talking about your disgust for werewolves.\" \"No, Jake, no. It's not that you're a\u2026 wolf. That's fine,\" I promised him, and I knew as I said the words that I meant them. I really didn't care if he turned into a big wolf\u2014he was still Jacob. \"If you could just find a way not to hurt people\u2026 that's all that upsets me. These ate innocent people, Jake, people like Charlie, and I can't just look the other way while you\u2014\" \"Is that all? Really?\" he interrupted me, a smile breaking across his face. \"You're just scared because I'm a murderer? That's the only reason?\" \"Isn't that reason enough?\" He started to laugh. \"Jacob Black, this is so not funny!\" \"Sure, sure,\" he agreed, still chortling. He took one long stride and caught me in another vice-tight bear hug. \"You really, honestly don't mind that I morph into a giant dog?\" he asked, his voice joyful in my ear. \"No,\" I gasped. \"Can't\u2014breathe\u2014Jake!\" He let me go, but took both my hands. \"I'm not a killer, Bella.\" I studied his face, and it was clear that this was the truth. Relief pulsed through me. \"Really?\" I asked. \"Really,\" he promised solemnly. I threw my arms around him. It reminded me of that first day with the motorcycles\u2014he was bigger, though, and I felt even more like a child now. Like that other time, he stroked my hair. \"Sorry I called you a <em>hypocrite</em>,\" he apologized. \"Sorry I called you a murderer.\" He laughed. I thought of something then, and pulled away from him so that I could see his face. My eyebrows furrowed in anxiety. \"What about Sam? And the others?\" He shook his head, smiling like a huge burden had been removed from his shoulders.  \"Of course not. Don't you remember what we call ourselves?\" The memory was clear\u2014I'd just been thinking of that very day. \"Protectors?\" \"Exactly.\" \"But I don't understand. What's happening in the woods? The missing hikers, the blood?\" His face was serious, worried at once. \"We're trying to do our job, Bella. We're trying to protect them, but we're always just a little too late.\" \"Protect them from what? Is there really a bear out there, too?\" \"Bella, honey, we only protect people from one thing\u2014our one enemy. It's the reason we exist\u2014because they do.\" I stared at him blankly for one second before I understood. Then the blood drained from my face and a thin, wordless cry of horror broke through my lips. He nodded. \"I thought you, of all people, would realize what was really going on.\" \"Laurent,\" I whispered. \"He's still here.\" Jacob blinked twice, and cocked his head to one side. \"Who's Laurent?\" I tried to sort out the chaos in my head so that I could answer. \"You know\u2014you saw him in the meadow. You were there\u2026\" The words came out in a wondering tone as it all sunk in. \"You were there, and you kept him from killing me\u2026\" \"Oh, the black-haired leech?\" He grinned, a tight, fierce grin. \"Was that his name?\" I shuddered. \"What were you thinking?\" I whispered. \"He could have killed you! Jake, you don't realize how dangerous\u2014\" Another laugh interrupted me \"Bella, one lone vampire isn't much of a problem for a pack as big as ours. It was so easy, it was hardly even fun!\" \"What was so easy?\" \"Killing the bloodsucker who was going to kill you. Now, I don't count that towards the whole murder thing,\" he added quickly. \"Vampires don't count as people.\" I could only mouth the words. \"You\u2026 killed\u2026 Laurent?\" He nodded. \"Well, it was a group effort,\" he qualified. \"Laurent is dead?\" I whispered. His expression changed. \"You're not upset about that, are you? He was going to kill you\u2014he was going for the kill, Bella, we were sure of that before we attacked. You know that, right?\" \"I know that. No, I'm not upset\u2014I'm\u2026\" I had to sit down. I stumbled back a step until I felt the driftwood against my calves, and then sank down onto it. \"Laurent is dead. He's not coming back for me.\" \"You're not mad? He wasn't one of your friends or anything, was he?\" \"My friend?\" I stared up at him, confused and dizzy with relief. I started babbling, my eyes getting moist. \"No, Jake. I'm so\u2026 so relieved. I thought he was going to find me\u2014I've been waiting for him every night, just hoping that he'd stop with me and leave Charlie alone. I've been so frightened, Jacob\u2026 But how? He was a vampire! How did you kill him? He was so strong, so hard, like marble\u2026\" He sat down next to me and put one big arm around me comfortingly. \"It's what we're made for, Bells. \u00a0We're strong, too. I wish you would have told me that you were so afraid. You didn't need to be.\" \"You weren't around,\" I mumbled, lost in thought. \"Oh, right.\" \"Wait, Jake\u2014I thought you knew, though. Last night, you said it wasn't safe for you to be in my room. I thought you knew that a vampire might be coming. Isn't that what you were talking about?\" He looked confused for a minute, and then he ducked his head. \"No, that's not what I meant.\" \"Then why didn't you think it was safe for you there?\" He looked at me with guilt-ridden eyes. \"I didn't say it wasn't safe for me. I was thinking of you.\" \"What do you mean?\" He looked down and kicked a rock. \"There's more than one reason I'm not supposed to be around you, Bella. I wasn't supposed to tell you our secret, for one thing, but the other part is that it's not safe for you.\u00a0 If I get too mad\u2026 too upset\u2026 you might get hurt.\" I thought about that carefully. \"When you were mad before\u2026 when I was yelling at you\u2026 and you were shaking\u2026 ?\" \"Yeah.\" His face dropped even lower. \"That was pretty stupid of me. I have to keep a better hold on myself. I swore I wasn't going to get mad, no matter what you said to me. But\u2026 I just got so upset that I was going to lose you\u2026 that you couldn't deal with what I am\u2026\" \"What would happen\u2026 if you got too mad?\" I whispered. \"I'd turn into a wolf,\" he whispered back. \"You don't need a full moon.\" He rolled his eyes. \"Hollywood's version doesn't get much right.\" Then he sighed, and was serious again. \"You don't need to be so stressed out, Bells. We're going to take care of this. And we're keeping a special eye on Charlie and the others\u2014we won't let anything happen to him. Trust me on that.\" Something very, very obvious, something I should have grasped at once\u2014but I'd been so distracted by the idea of Jacob and his friends fighting with Laurent, that I'd completely missed it at the time\u2014occurred to me only then, when Jacob used the present tense again. We're going to take care of this. It wasn't over. \"Laurent is dead,\" I gasped, and my entire body went ice cold. \"Bella?\" Jacob asked anxiously, touching my ashen cheek. \"If Laurent died\u2026 a week ago\u2026 then someone else is killing people now.\" Jacob nodded; his teeth clenched together, and he spoke through them. \"There were two of them. We thought his mate would want to fight us\u2014in our stories, they usually get pretty pissed off if you kill their mate\u2014but she just keeps running away, and then coming back again. If we could figure out what she was after, it would be easier to take her down. But she makes no sense. She keeps dancing around the edges, like she's testing our defenses, looking for a way in\u2014but in where? Where does she want to go?\u00a0 Sam thinks she's trying to separate us, so she'll have a better chance\u2026\" His voice faded until it sounded like it was coming through a long tunnel; I couldn't make out the individual words anymore. My forehead dewed with sweat and my stomach rolled like I had the stomach flu again. Exactly like I had the flu. I turned away from him quickly, and leaned over the tree trunk. My body convulsed with useless heaves, my empty stomach contracting with horrified nausea, though there was nothing in it to expel. Victoria was here. Looking for me. Killing strangers in the woods. The woods where Charlie was searching\u2026 My head spun sickeningly. Jacob's hands caught my shoulders\u2014kept me from sliding forward onto the rocks. I could feel his hot breath on my cheek. \"Bella! What's wrong?\" \"Victoria,\" I gasped as soon as I could catch my breath around the nauseous spasms. In my head, Edward snarled in fury at the name. I felt Jacob pull me up from my slump. He draped me awkwardly across his lap, laying my limp head against his shoulder. He struggled to balance me, to keep me from sagging over, one way or the other he brushed the sweaty hair back from my face. \"Who?\" Jacob asked. \"Can you hear me, Bella? Bella?\" \"She wasn't Laurent's mate,\" I moaned into his shoulder. \"They were just old friends\u2026\" \"Do you need some water? A doctor? Tell me what to do,\" he demanded, frantic. \"I'm not sick\u2014I'm scared,\" I explained in a whisper. The word scared didn't really seem to cover it. Jacob patted my back. \"Scared of this Victoria?\" I nodded, shuddering. \"Victoria is the red-haired female?\" I trembled again, and whimpered, \"Yes.\" \"How do you know she wasn't his mate?\" \"Laurent told me James was her mate,\" I explained, automatically flexing the hand with the scar. He pulled my face around, holding it steady in his big hand. He stared intently into my eyes. \"Did he tell you anything else, Bella? This is important. Do you know what she wants?\" \"Of course,\" I whispered. \"She wants me.\" His eyes flipped wide, then narrowed into slits. \"Why?\" he demanded. \"Edward killed James,\" I whispered. Jacob held me so tightly that there was no need for me to clutch at the hole\u2014he kept me in one piece. \"She did get\u2026 pissed off. But Laurent said she thought it was fairer to kill me than Edward. Mate for mate. She didn't know\u2014still doesn't know, I guess\u2014that\u2026 that\u2026\" I swallowed hard. \"That things aren't like that with us anymore. Not for Edward, anyway.\" Jacob was distracted by that, his face torn between several different expressions. \"Is that what happened? Why the Cullens left?\" \"I'm nothing but a human, after all. Nothing special,\" I explained, shrugging weakly. Something like a growl\u2014not a real growl, just a human approximation\u2014rumbled in Jacob's chest under my ear. \"If that idiot bloodsucker is honestly stupid enough\u2014\" \"Please,\" I moaned. \"Please. Don't.\" Jacob hesitated, then nodded once. \"This is important,\" he said again, his face all business now. \"This is exactly what we needed to know.We've got to tell the others right away.\" He stood, pulling me to my feet. He kept two hands on my waist until he was sure I wasn't going to fall. \"I'm okay,\" I lied. He traded his hold on my waist for one of my hands. \"Let's go.\" He pulled me back toward the truck. \"Where are we going?\" I asked. \"I'm not sure yet,\" he admitted. \"I'll call a meeting. Hey, wait here for just a minute, okay?\" He leaned me against the side of the truck and released my hand. \"Where are you going?\" \"I'll be right back,\" he promised. Then he turned and sprinted through the parking lot, across the road, and into the bordering forest. He flitted into the trees, swift and sleek as a deer. \"Jacob!\" I yelled after him hoarsely, but he was already gone. It was not a good time to be left alone. Seconds after Jacob was out of sight, I was hyperventilating. I dragged myself into the cab of the truck, and mashed the locks down at once. It didn't make me feel any better. Victoria was already hunting me. It was just luck that she hadn't found me yet\u2014just luck and five teenage werewolves. I exhaled sharply. No matter what Jacob said, the thought of him coming anywhere close to Victoria was horrifying. I didn't care what he could turn into when he got mad. I could see her in my head, her face wild, her hair like flames, deadly, indestructible\u2026 But, according to Jacob, Laurent was gone. Was that really possible? Edward\u2014I clutched automatically at my chest\u2014had told me how difficult it was to kill a vampire. Only another vampire could do the job. Yet Jake said this was what werewolves were made for\u2026 He said they were keeping a special eye on Charlie\u2014that I should trust the werewolves to keep my father safe. How could I trust that? None of us were safe! Jacob the very least of all, if he was trying to put himself between Victoria and Charlie\u2026 between Victoria and me. I felt like I might be about to throw up again. A sharp rap on the truck's window made me yelp in terror\u2014but it was just Jacob, back already. I unlocked the door with trembling, grateful fingers. \"You're really scared, aren't you?\" he asked as he climbed in. I nodded. \"Don't be. We'll take care of you\u2014and Charlie, too. I promise.\" \"The idea of you finding Victoria is scarier than the idea of her finding me,\" I whispered. He laughed. \"You've got to have a little more confidence in us than that. It's insulting.\" I just shook my head. I'd seen too many vampires in action. \"Where did you go just now?\" I asked. He pursed his lips, and said nothing. \"What? Is it a secret?\" He frowned. \"Not really. It's kind of weird, though. I don't want to freak you out.\" \"I'm sort of used to weird by this point, you know.\" I tried to smile without much success. Jacob grinned back easily. \"Guess you'd have to be. Okay. See, when we're wolves, we can\u2026 hear each other.\" My eyebrows pulled down in confusion. \"Not hear sounds,\" he went on, \"but we can hear\u2026 thoughts\u2014each other's anyway\u2014no matter how far away from each other we are. It really helps when we hunt, but it's a big pain otherwise. It's embarrassing\u2014having no secrets like that. Freaky, eh?\" \"Is that what you meant last night, when you said you would tell them you'd seen me, even though you didn't want to?\" \"You're quick.\" \"Thanks.\" \"You're also very good with weird. I thought that would bother you.\" \"It's not\u2026 well, you're not the first person I've known who could do that. So it doesn't seem so weird to me.\" \"Really?\u2026 Wait\u2014are you talking about your bloodsuckers?\" \"I wish you wouldn't call them that.\" He laughed. \"Whatever. The Cullens, then?\" \"Just\u2026 just Edward.\" I pulled one arm surreptitiously around my torso. Jacob looked surprised\u2014unpleasantly so. \"I thought those were just stories. I've heard legends about vampires who could do\u2026 extra stuff, but I thought that was just a myth.\" \"Is anything just a myth anymore?\" I asked him wryly. He scowled. \"Guess not. Okay, we're going to meet Sam and the others at the place we go to ride our bikes.\" I started the truck and headed back up the road. \"So did you just turn into a wolf now, to talk to Sam?\" I asked, curious. Jacob nodded, seeming embarrassed. \"I kept it real short\u2014I tried not to think about you so they wouldn't know what was going on. I was afraid Sam would tell me I couldn't bring you.\" \"That wouldn't have stopped me.\" I couldn't get rid of my perception of Sam as the bad guy. My teeth clenched together whenever I heard his name. \"Well, it would have stopped me,\" Jacob said, morose now. \"Remember how I couldn't finish my sentences last night? How I couldn't just tell you the whole story?\" \"Yeah. You looked like you were choking on something.\" He chuckled darkly. \"Close enough. Sam told me I couldn't tell you. He's\u2026 the head of the pack, you know. He's the Alpha. When he tells us to do something, or not to do something\u2014when he really means it, well, we can't just ignore him.\" \"Weird,\" I muttered. \"Very,\" he agreed. \"It's kind of a wolf thing.\" \"Huh\" was the best response I could think of. \"Yeah, there's a load of stuff like that\u2014wolf things. I'm still learning. I can't imagine what it was like for Sam, trying to deal with this alone.\u00a0 It sucks bad enough to go through it with a whole pack for support.\" \"Sam was alone?\" \"Yeah.\" Jacob's voice lowered. \"When I\u2026 changed, it was the most\u2026 horrible, the most terrifying thing I've ever been through\u2014worse than anything I could have imagined. But I wasn't alone\u2014there were the voices there, in my head, telling me what had happened and what I had to do. That kept me from losing my mind, I think. But Sam\u2026\" He shook his head. \"Sam had no help.\" This was going to take some adjusting. When Jacob explained it like that, it was hard not to feel compassion for Sam. I had to keep reminding myself that there was no reason to hate him anymore. \"Will they be angry that I'm with you?\" I asked. He made a face. \"Probably.\" \"Maybe I shouldn't\u2014\" \"No, it's okay,\" he assured me. \"You know a ton of things that can help us. It's not like you're just some ignorant human. You're like a\u2026 I don't know, spy or something. You've been behind enemy lines.\" I frowned to myself. Was that what Jacob would want from me? Insider information to help them destroy their enemies? I wasn't a spy, though. I hadn't been collecting that kind of information. Already, his words made me feel like a traitor. But I wanted him to stop Victoria, didn't I? No. I did want Victoria to be stopped, preferably before she tortured me to death or ran into Charlie or killed another stranger. I just didn't want Jacob to be the one to stop her, or rather to try. I didn't want Jacob within a hundred miles of her. \"Like the stuff about the mind-reading bloodsucker,\" he continued, oblivious to my reverie. \"That's the kind of thing we need to know about. That really sucks that those stories are true. It makes everything more complicated. Hey, do you think this Victoria can do anything special?\" \"I don't think so,\" I hesitated, and then sighed. \"He would have mentioned it.\" \"He? Oh, you mean Edward\u2014oops, sorry. I forgot. You don't like to say his name. Or hear it.\" I squeezed my midsection, trying to ignore the throbbing around the edges of my chest. \"Not really, no.\" \"Sorry.\" \"How do you know me so well, Jacob? Sometimes it's like you can read my mind.\" \"Naw. I just pay attention.\" We were on the little dirt road where Jacob had first taught me to ride the motorcycle. \"This good?\" I asked. \"Sure, sure.\" I pulled over and cut the engine. \"You're still pretty unhappy, aren't you?\" he murmured. I nodded, staring unseeingly into the gloomy forest. \"Did you ever think\u2026 that maybe\u2026 you're better off?\" I inhaled slowly, and then let my breath out. \"No.\" \"'Cause he wasn't the best\u2014\" \"Please, Jacob,\" I interrupted, begging in a whisper. \"Could we please not talk about this? I can't stand it.\" \"Okay.\" He took a deep breath. \"I'm sorry I said anything.\" \"Don't feel bad. If things were different, it would be nice to finally be able to talk to someone about it.\" He nodded. \"Yeah, I had a hard time keeping a secret from you for two weeks. It must be hell to not be able to talk to anyone.\" \"Hell,\" I agreed. Jacob sucked in a sharp breath. \"They're here. Let's go.\" \"Are you sure?\" I asked while he popped his door open. \"Maybe I shouldn't be here.\" \"They'll deal with it,\" he said, and then he grinned. \"Who's afraid of the big, bad wolf?\" \"Ha ha,\" I said. But I got out of the truck, hurrying around the front end to stand close beside Jacob. I remembered only too clearly the giant monsters in the meadow. My hands were trembling like Jacob's had been before, but with fear rather than rage. Jake took my hand and squeezed it. \"Here we go.\"",

            "en": "7 REPETITION          14. FAMILY I COWERED INTO JACOB'S SIDE, MY EYES SCANNING the forest for the other werewolves. When they appeared, striding out from between the trees, they weren't what I was expecting. I'd gotten the image of the wolves stuck in my head. These were just four really big half-naked boys. Again, they reminded me of brothers, quadruplets. Something about the way they moved almost in synchronization to stand across the road from us, the way they all had the same long, round muscles under the same red-brown skin, the same cropped black hair, and the way their expressions altered at exactly the same moment. They started out curious and cautious. When they saw me there, half-hidden beside Jacob, they all became furious in the same second. Sam was still the biggest, though Jacob was getting close to catching up with him. Sam didn't really count as a boy. His face was older\u2014not in the sense of lines or signs of aging, but in the maturity, the patience of his expression. \"What have you done, Jacob?\" he demanded. One of the others, one I didn't recognize\u2014Jared or Paul\u2014thrust past Sam and spoke before Jacob could defend himself. \"Why can't you just follow the rules, Jacob?\" he yelled, throwing his arms in the air. \"What the hell are you thinking? Is she more important than everything\u2014than the whole tribe? Than the people getting killed?\" \"She can help,\" Jacob said quietly. \"Help!\" the angry boy shouted. His arms begin to quiver. \"Oh, that's likely! I'm sure the leech-lover is just dying to help us out!\" \"Don't talk about her like that!\" Jacob shouted back, stung by the boy's criticism. A shudder rippled through the other boy, along his shoulders and down his spine. \"Paul! Relax!\" Sam commanded. Paul shook his head back and forth, not in defiance, but as though he were trying to concentrate. \"Jeez, Paul,\" one of the other boys\u2014probably Jared\u2014muttered. \"Get a grip.\" Paul twisted his head toward Jared, his lips curling back in irritation. Then he shifted his glare in my direction. Jacob took a step to put himself in front of me. That did it. \"Right, protect her!\" Paul roared in outrage. Another shudder, a convulsion, heaved through his body. He threw his head back, a real growl tearing from between his teeth. \"Paul!\" Sam and Jacob shouted together. Paul seemed to fall forward, vibrating violently. Halfway to the ground, there was a loud ripping noise, and the boy exploded. Dark silver fur blew out from the boy, coalescing into a shape more than five-times his size\u2014a massive, crouched shape, ready to spring. The wolf's muzzle wrinkled back over his teeth, and another growl rolled through his colossal chest. His dark, enraged eyes focused on me. In the same second, Jacob was running across the road straight for the monster. \"Jacob!\" I screamed. Mid-stride, a long tremor shivered down Jacob's spine. He leaped forward, diving headfirst into the empty air. With another sharp tearing sound, Jacob exploded, too. He burst out of his skin\u2014shreds of black and white cloth blasted up into the air. It happened so quickly that if I'd blinked, I'd have missed the entire transformation. One second it was Jacob diving into the air, and then it was the gigantic, russet brown wolf\u2014so enormous that I couldn't make sense of its mass somehow fitting inside Jacob\u2014charging the crouched silver beast. Jacob met the other werewolf's attack head-on. Their angry snarls echoed like thunder off the trees. The black and white scraps\u2014the remains of Jacob's clothes\u2014fluttered to the ground where he'd disappeared. \"Jacob!\" I screamed again, staggering forward. \"Stay where you are, Bella,\" Sam ordered. It was hard to hear him over the roar of the fighting wolves. They were snapping and tearing at each other, their sharp teeth flashing toward each other's throats. The Jacob-wolf seemed to have the upper hand\u2014he was visibly bigger than the other wolf, and it looked like he was stronger, too. He rammed his shoulder against the gray wolf again and again, knocking him back toward the trees. \"Take her to Emily's,\" Sam shouted toward the other boys, who were watching the conflict with rapt expressions. Jacob had successfully shoved the gray wolf off the road, and they were disappearing into the forest, though the sound of their snarls was still loud. Sam ran after them, kicking off his shoes on the way. As he darted into the trees, he was quivering from head to toe.  The growling and snapping was fading into the distance. Suddenly, the sound cut off and it was very quiet on the road. One of the boys started laughing. I turned to stare at him\u2014my wide eyes felt frozen, like I couldn't even blink them. The boy seemed to be laughing at my expression. \"Well, there's something you don't see every day,\" he snickered. His face was vaguely familiar\u2014thinner than the others\u2026 Embry Call. \"I do,\" the other boy, Jared, grumbled. \"Every single day.\" \"Aw, Paul doesn't lose his temper every day,\" Embry disagreed, still grinning. \"Maybe two out of three.\" Jared stopped to pick something white up off the ground. He held it up toward Embry; it dangled in limp strips from his hand. \"Totally shredded,\" Jared said. \"Billy said this was the last pair he could afford\u2014guess Jacob's going barefoot now.\" \"This one survived,\" Embry said, holding up a white sneaker. \"Jake can hop,\" he added with a laugh. Jared started collecting various pieces of fabric from the dirt. \"Get Sam's shoes, will you? All the rest of this is headed for the trash.\" Embry grabbed the shoes and then jogged into the trees where Sam had disappeared. He was back in a few seconds with a pair of cut-off jeans draped over his arm. Jared gathered the torn remnants of Jacob's and Paul's clothes and wadded them into a ball. Suddenly, he seemed to remember me. He looked at me carefully, assessing. \"Hey, you're not going to faint or puke or anything?\" he demanded. \"I don't think so,\" I gasped. \"You don't look so good. Maybe you should sit down.\" \"Okay,\" I mumbled. For the second time in one morning, I put my head between my\u00a0 knees. \"Jake should have warned us,\" Embry complained. \"He shouldn't have brought his girlfriend into this. What did he expect?\" \"Well, the wolf's out of the bag now.\" Embry sighed. \"Way to go, Jake.\" I raised my head to glare at the two boys who seemed to be taking this all so lightly. \"Aren't you worried about them at all?\" I demanded. Embry blinked once in surprise \"Worried? Why?\" \"They could hurt each other!\" Embry and Jared guffawed. \"I hope Paul gets a mouthful of him,\" Jared said. \"Teach him a lesson.\" I blanched. \"Yeah, right!\" Embry disagreed. \"Did you see Jake? Even Sam couldn't have phased on the fly like that.\u00a0 He saw Paul losing it, and it took him, what, half a second to attack? The boy's got a gift.\" \"Paul's been fighting longer. I'll bet you ten bucks he leaves a mark.\" \"You're on. Jake's a natural. Paul doesn't have a prayer.\" They shook hands, grinning. I tried to comfort myself with their lack of concern, but I couldn't drive the brutal image of the fighting werewolves from my head. My stomach churned, sore and empty, my head ached with worry. \"Let's go see Emily. You know she'll have food waiting.\" Embry looked down at me. \"Mind giving us a ride?\" \"No problem,\" I choked. Jared raised one eyebrow. \"Maybe you'd better drive, Embry. She still looks like she might hurl.\" \"Good idea. Where are the keys?\" Embry asked me. \"Ignition.\" Embry opened the passenger-side door. \"In you go,\" he said cheerfully, hauling me up from the ground with one hand and stuffing me into my seat. He appraised the available space. \"You'll have to ride in the back,\" he told Jared. \"That's fine. I got a weak stomach. I don't want to be in there when she blows.\" \"I bet she's tougher than that. She runs with vampires.\" \"Five bucks?\" Jared asked. \"Done. I feel guilty, taking your money like this.\" Embry got in and started the engine while Jared leapt agilely into the bed. As soon as his door was closed, Embry muttered to me, \"Don't throw up, okay? I've only got a ten, and if Paul got his teeth into Jacob\u2026\" \"Okay,\" I whispered. Embry drove us back toward the village. \"Hey, how did Jake get around the injunction anyway?\" \"The\u2026 what?\" \"Er, the order. You know, to not spill the beans. How did he tell you about this?\" \"Oh, that,\" I said, remembering Jacob trying to choke out the truth to me last night. \"He didn't. I guessed right.\" Embry pursed his lips, looking surprised. \"Hmm. S'pose that would work.\" \"Where are we going?\" I asked. \"Emily's house. She's Sam's girlfriend\u2026 no, fianc\u00e9e, now, I guess. They'll meet us back there after Sam gives it to them for what just happened. And after Paul and Jake scrounge up some new clothes, if Paul even has any left.\" \"Does Emily know about\u2026 ?\" \"Yeah. And hey, don't stare at her. That bugs Sam.\" I frowned at him. \"Why would I stare?\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Embry looked uncomfortable. \"Like you saw just now, hanging out around werewolves has its risks.\" He changed the subject quickly. \"Hey, are you okay about the whole thing with the black-haired bloodsucker in the meadow? It didn't look like he was a friend of yours, but. .\" Embry shrugged. \"No, he wasn't my friend.\" \"That's good. We didn't want to start anything, break the treaty, you know.\" \"Oh, yeah, Jake told me about the treaty once, a long time ago. Why would killing Laurent break the treaty?\" \"Laurent,\" he repeated, snorting, like he was amused the vampire had had a name. \"Well, we were technically on Cullen turf. We're not allowed to attack any of them, the Cullens, at least, off our land\u2014unless they break the treaty first. We didn't know if the black-haired one was a relative of theirs or something. Looked like you knew him.\" \"How would they go about breaking the treaty?\" \"If they bite a human. Jake wasn't so keen on the idea of letting it go that far.\" \"Oh. Um, thanks. I'm glad you didn't wait.\" \"Our pleasure.\" He sounded like he meant that in a literal sense. Embry drove past the easternmost house on the highway before turning off onto a narrow dirt road. \"Your truck is slow,\" he noted. \"Sorry.\" At the end of the lane was a tiny house that had once been gray. There was only one narrow window beside the weathered blue door, but the window box under it was filled with bright orange and yellow marigolds, giving the whole place a cheerful look. Embry opened the truck door and inhaled. \"Mmm, Emily's cooking.\" Jared jumped out of the back of the truck and headed for the door, but Embry stopped him with one hand on his chest. He looked at me meaningfully, and cleared his throat. \"I don't have my wallet on me,\" Jared said. \"That's okay. I won't forget.\" They climbed up the one step and entered the house without knocking. I followed timidly after them. The front room, like Billy's house, was mostly kitchen. A young woman with satiny copper skin and long, straight, crow-black hair was standing at the counter by the sink, popping big muffins out of a tin and placing them on a paper plate. For one second, I thought the reason Embry had told me not to stare was because the girl was so beautiful. And then she asked \"You guys hungry?\" in a melodic voice, and she turned to face us full on, a smile on half of her face. The right side of her face was scarred from hairline to chin by three thick, red lines, livid in color though they were long healed. One line pulled down the corner of her dark, almond-shaped right eye, another twisted the right side of her mouth into a permanent grimace. Thankful for Embry's warning, I quickly turned my eyes to the muffins in her hands. They smelled wonderful\u2014like fresh blueberries. \"Oh,\" Emily said, surprised. \"Who's this?\" I looked up, trying to focus on the left half of her face. \"Bella Swan,\" Jared told her, shrugging. Apparently, I'd been a topic of conversation before. \"Who else?\" \"Leave it to Jacob to find a way around,\" Emily murmured. She stared at me, and neither half of her once-beautiful face was friendly. \"So, you're the vampire girl.\" I stiffened. \"Yes. Are you the wolf girl?\" She laughed, as did Embry and Jared. The left half of her face warmed. \"I guess I am.\" She turned to Jared. \"Where's Sam?\" \"Bella, er, surprised Paul this morning.\" Emily rolled her good eye. \"Ah, Paul,\" she sighed. \"Do you think they'll be long? I was just about to start the eggs.\" \"Don't worry,\" Embry told her. \"If they're late, we won't let anything go to waste.\" Emily chuckled, and then opened the refrigerator. \"No doubt,\" she agreed. \"Bella, are you hungry? Go ahead and help yourself to a muffin.\" \"Thanks.\" I took one from the plate and started nibbling around the edges. It was delicious, and it felt good in my tender stomach. Embry picked up his third and shoved it into his mouth whole. \"Save some for your brothers,\" Emily chastised him, hitting him on the head with a wooden spoon. The word surprised me, but the others thought nothing of it. \"Pig,\" Jared commented. I leaned against the counter and watched the three of them banter like a family. Emily's kitchen was a friendly place, bright with white cupboards and pale wooden floorboards. On the little round table, a cracked blue-and-white china pitcher was overflowing with wildflowers. Embry and Jared seemed entirely at ease here. Emily was mixing a humongous batch of eggs, several dozen, in a big yellow bowl. She had the sleeves of her lavender shirt pushed up, and I could see that the scars extended all the way down her arm to the back of her right hand. Hanging out with werewolves truly did have its risks, just as Embry had said. The front door opened, and Sam stepped through. \"Emily,\" he said, and so much love saturated his voice that I felt embarrassed, intrusive, as I watched him cross the room in one stride and take her face in his wide hands. He leaned down and kissed the dark scars on her right cheek before he kissed her lips. \"Hey, none of that,\" Jared complained. \"I'm eating.\" \"Then shut up and eat,\" Sam suggested, kissing Emily's ruined mouth again. \"Ugh,\" Embry groaned. This was worse than any romantic movie; this was so real that it sang out loud with joy and life and true love. I put my muffin down and folded my arms across my empty chest. I stared at the flowers, trying to ignore the utter peace of their moment, and the wretched throbbing of my wounds. I was grateful for the distraction when Jacob and Paul came through the door, and then shocked when I saw that they were laughing. While I watched, Paul punched Jacob on the shoulder and Jacob went for a kidney jab in return. They laughed again. They both appeared to be in one piece. Jacob scanned the room, his eyes stopping when he found me leaning, awkward and out of place, against the counter in the far corner of the kitchen. \"Hey, Bells,\" he greeted me cheerfully. He grabbed two muffins as he passed the table and came to stand beside me. \"Sorry about before,\" he muttered under his breath. \"How are you holding up.'\" \"Don't worry, I'm okay. Good muffins.\" I picked mine back up and started libber again. My chest felt better as soon as Jacob was beside me. \"Oh, man!\" Jared wailed, interrupting us. I looked up, and he and Embry were examining a fading pink line on Paul's forearm. Embry was grinning, exultant. \"Fifteen dollars,\" he crowed. \"Did you do that?\" I whispered to Jacob, remembering the bet. \"I barely touched him. He'll be perfect by sundown.\" \"By sundown?\" I looked at the line on Paul's arm. Odd, but it looked weeks old. \"Wolf thing,\" Jacob whispered. I nodded, trying to not look weirded out. \"You okay?\" I asked him under my breath. \"Not a scratch on me.\" His expression was smug. \"Hey, guys,\" Sam said in a loud voice, interrupting all the conversations going on in the small room. Emily was at the stove, scraping the egg mixture around a big skillet, but Sam still had one hand touching the small of her back, an unconscious gesture. \"Jacob has information for us.\" Paul looked unsurprised. Jacob must have explained this to him and Sam already. Or\u2026 they'd just heard his thoughts. \"I know what the redhead wants.\" Jacob directed his words toward Jared and Embry. \"That's what I was trying to tell you before.\" He kicked the leg of the chair Paul had settled into. \"And?\" Jared asked. Jacob's face got serious. \"She is trying to avenge her mate\u2014only it wasn't the black-haired leech we killed. The Cullens got her mate last year, and she's after Bella now.\" This wasn't news to me, but I still shivered. Jared, Embry, and Emily stared at me with open-mouthed surprise. \"She's just a girl,\" Embry protested. \"I didn't say it made sense. But that's why the bloodsucker's been trying to get past us. She's been heading for Forks.\" They continued to stare at me, mouths still hanging open, for a long moment. I ducked my head. \"Excellent,\" Jared finally said, a smile beginning to pull up the corners of his mouth. \"We've got bait.\" With stunning speed, Jacob yanked a can opener from the counter and launched it at Jared's head. Jared's hand flicked up faster than I would have thought possible, and he snagged the tool just before it hit his face. \"Bella is not bait.\" \"You know what I mean,\" Jared said, unabashed. \"So we'll be changing our patterns,\" Sam said, ignoring their squabble. \"We'll try leaving a few holes, and see if she falls for it. We'll have to split up, and I don't like that. But if she's really after Bella, she probably won't try to take advantage of our divided numbers.\" \"Quit's got to be close to joining us,\" Embry murmured. \"Then we'll be able to split evenly.\" Everyone looked down. I glanced at Jacob's face, and it was hopeless, like it had been yesterday afternoon, outside his house. No matter how comfortable they seemed to be with their fate, here in this happy kitchen, none of these werewolves wanted the same fate for their friend. \"Well, we won't count on that,\" Sam said in a low voice, and then continued at his regular volume. \"Paul, Jared, and Embry will take the outer perimeter, and Jacob and I will take the inner. We'll collapse in when we've got her trapped.\" I noticed that Emily didn't particularly like that Sam would be in the smaller grouping. Her worry had me glancing up at Jacob, worrying, too. Sam caught my eye. \"Jacob thinks it would be best if you spent as much time as possible here in La Push.\u00a0 She won't know where to find you so easily, just in case.\" \"What about Charlie?\" I demanded. \"March Madness is still going,\" Jacob said. \"I think Billy and Harry can manage to keep Charlie down here when he's not at work.\" \"Wait,\" Sam said, holding one hand up. His glance flickered to Emily and then back to me. \"That's what Jacob thinks is best, but you need to decide for yourself. You should weigh the risks of both options very seriously. You saw this morning how easily things can get dangerous here, how quickly they get out of hand. If you choose to stay with us, I can't make any guarantees about your safety.\" \"I won't hurt her,\" Jacob mumbled, looking down. Sam acted as if he hadn't heard him speak. \"If there was somewhere else you felt safe\u2026\" I bit my lip. Where could I go that wouldn't put someone else in danger? I recoiled again from the idea of bringing Renee into this\u2014pulling her into the circle of the target I wore\u2026 \"I don't want to lead Victoria anywhere else,\" I whispered. Sam nodded. \"That's true. It's better to have her here, where we can end this.\" I flinched. I didn't want Jacob or any of the rest of them trying to end Victoria. I glanced at Jake's face; it was relaxed, almost the same as I remembered it from before the onset of the wolf thing, and utterly unconcerned by the idea of hunting vampires. \"You'll be careful, right?\" I asked, an audible lump in my throat. The boys burst into loud hoots of amusement. Everyone laughed at me\u2014except Emily. She met my eyes, and I could suddenly see the symmetry underlying her deformity. Her face was still beautiful, and alive with a concern even more fierce than mine. I had to look away, before the love behind that concern could start me aching again. \"Food's ready,\" she announced then, and the strategic conversation was history. The guys hurried to surround the table\u2014which looked tiny and in danger of being crushed by them\u2014and devoured the buffet-sized pan of eggs Emily placed in their midst in record time. Emily ate leaning against the counter like me\u2014avoiding the bedlam at the table\u2014and watched them with affectionate eyes. Her expression clearly stated that this was her family. All in all, it wasn't exactly what I'd been expecting from a pack of werewolves. I spent the day in La Push, the majority of it in Billy's house. He left a message on Charlie's phone and at the station, and Charlie showed up around dinnertime with two pizzas. It was good he brought two larges; Jacob ate one all by himself. I saw Charlie eyeing the two of us suspiciously all night, especially the much-changed Jacob. He asked about the hair; Jacob shrugged and told him it was just more convenient. I knew that as soon as Charlie and I were headed home, Jacob would take off\u2014off to run around as a wolf, as he had done intermittently through the entire day. He and his brothers of sorts kept up a constant watch, looking for some sign of Victoria's return. But since they'd chased her away from the hot springs last night\u2014chased her halfway to Canada, according to Jacob\u2014she'd yet to make another foray. I had no hope at all that she might just give up. I didn't have that kind of luck. Jacob walked me to my truck after dinner and lingered by the window, waiting for Charlie to drive away first. \"Don't be afraid tonight,\" Jacob said, while Charlie pretended to be having trouble with his seat belt. \"We'll be out there, watching.\" \"I won't worry about myself,\" I promised. \"You're silly. Hunting vampires is fun. It's the best part of this whole mess.\" I shook my head. \"If I'm silly, then you're dangerously unbalanced.\" He chuckled. \"Get some rest, Bella, honey. You look exhausted.\" \"I'll try.\" Charlie honked his horn impatiently. \"See you tomorrow,\" Jacob said. \"Come down first thing.\" \"I will.\" Charlie followed me home. I paid scant attention to the lights in my rearview mirror. Instead, I wondered where Sam and Jared and Embry and Paul were, out running in the night. I wondered if Jacob had joined them yet. When we got home, I hurried for the stairs, but Charlie was right behind me. \"What's going on, Bella?\" he demanded before I could escape. \"I thought Jacob was part of a gang and you two were fighting.\" \"We made up.\" \"And the gang?\" \"I don't know\u2014who can understand teenage boys? They're a mystery. But I met Sam Uley and his fianc\u00e9e, Emily. They seemed pretty nice to me.\" I shrugged. \"Must have all been a misunderstanding.\" His face changed. \"I hadn't heard that he and Emily had made it official. That's nice. Poor girl.\" \"Do you know what happened to her?\" \"Mauled by a bear, up north, during salmon spawning season\u2014horrible accident .\u00a0 It was more than a year ago now. I heard Sam was really messed up over it.\" \"That's horrible,\" I echoed. More than a year ago. I'd bet that meant it had happened when there was just one werewolf in La Push. I shuddered at the thought of how Sam must have felt every time he looked at Emily's face. That night, I lay awake for a long time trying to sort through the day. I worked my way backward through dinner with Billy, Jacob, and Charlie, to the long afternoon in the Blacks' house, waiting anxiously to hear something from Jacob, to Emily's kitchen, to the horror of the werewolf fight, to talking with Jacob on the beach. I thought about what Jacob had said early this morning, about hypocrisy. I thought about that for a long time. I didn't like to think that I was a <em>hypocrite</em>, only what was the point of lying to myself? I curled into a tight ball. No, Edward wasn't a killer. Even in his darker past, he'd never been a murderer of innocents, at least. But what if he had been? What if, during the time I that I'd known him, he'd been just like any other vampire? What if people had been disappearing from the woods, just like now? Would that have kept me away from him? I shook my head sadly. Love is irrational, I reminded myself. The more you loved someone, the less sense anything made. I rolled over and tried to think of something else\u2014and I thought of Jacob and his brothers, out running in the darkness. I fell asleep imagining the wolves, invisible in the night, guarding me from danger. When I dreamed, I stood in the forest again, but I didn't wander. I was holding Emily's scarred hand as we faced into the shadows and waited anxiously for our werewolves to come home.",
