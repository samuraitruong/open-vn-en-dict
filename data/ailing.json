            "en": "Obama chooses Chicago schools ch WASHINGTON -- President-elect Barack Obama has chosen Chicago schools chief Arne Duncan to serve as education secretary, people with knowledge of the decision said Monday. Obama planned to announce his choice Tuesday morning. These individuals confirmed Duncan's selection Monday on condition of anonymity because Obama had not made the decision public. Duncan has run the country's third-biggest school district for the past seven years. He has focused on improving struggling schools, closing those that fail. Obama highlighted this work by choosing for the announcement a turnaround story for Duncan -- Dodge Renaissance Academy, a school Duncan closed and then reopened. The two had visited the school together three years ago, although they share more than an interest in education: Duncan has played pickup basketball with Obama since the 1990s. In fact, Duncan co-captained the Harvard basketball team and played professionally in Australia before his career in education. Duncan ran an education nonprofit on Chicago's South Side before working in Chicago Public Schools under former chief Paul Vallas, now the schools chief in New Orleans.  Obama's choice has been anticipated, and argued about, by education groups anxious to see what Obama will do to fix the country's <em>ailing</em> schools. Obama managed throughout his campaign to avoid taking sides in the contentious debate between reform advocates and teachers' unions over the direction of education and the fate of President Bush's No Child Left Behind accountability law. Duncan's selection may satisfy both factions. Reform advocates wanted a big-city school superintendent who, like Duncan, has sought accountability for schools and teachers. And teachers' unions, an influential segment of the party base, wanted an advocate for their members; they have said they believe Duncan is willing to work with them. \"Arne Duncan actually reaches out and tries to do things in a collaborative way,\" Randi Weingarten, head of the 1.4 million-member American Federation of Teachers, told The Associated Press earlier this month. Duncan deliberately straddled the factions earlier this year when he signed competing manifestos from each side of the debate. Sen. Edward Kennedy, chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which must confirm the education nomination, said Duncan was a consensus candidate. \"Arne has been a pragmatic and effective leader of Chicago's schools,\" Kennedy, D-Mass., said in a statement. \"He's brought people together to address difficult challenges and expand opportunities so that every child can succeed.\" House Education and Labor Committee Chairman George Miller called Duncan \"a very good choice for school reform and our schoolchildren.\" \"He is an experienced and accomplished leader who is open to new ideas for improving our schools,\" Miller, D-Calif., said in a statement. In the education debate, the competing sides break down over the degree to which teachers and schools should be held accountable for how kids are learning, and the role test scores should play in making that determination. At the heart of the dispute: No Child Left Behind, the law that has grown as unpopular as George W. Bush, the outgoing president who championed it. The reform group agrees with the law's general principle of penalties for schools if test scores fail to improve, although nearly everyone agrees the law has problems that need fixing. The union coalition says test scores aren't the only measure, and that factors far beyond the classroom affect how well kids learn.",

            "en": "Explosion at Japan nuclear plant          Residents of the coastal city of Sendai are continuing the search for survivors amid the devastation A second explosion has hit the nuclear plant in Japan that was damaged in Friday's earthquake, but officials said it had resisted the blast. TV footage showed smoke rising from Fukushima plant's reactor 3, two days after an explosion hit reactor 1. Japan's nuclear safety agency said the blast was believed to have been caused by the build-up of hydrogen.  Officials said the reactor core was still intact, and that radiation levels were below legal limits. Technicians have been battling to cool three reactors at the Fukushima 1 plant since Friday, when the quake and tsunami combined to knock out the cooling system. The government said an operation pumping seawater into the reactors to help lower the temperature was still going on despite the explosion. Evacuations  The natural disaster killed hundreds and left thousands missing, sparking a huge rescue operation. We headed towards where the tsunami hit land, close to the little village of Higashiro. We had to pick our way through a sea of mud.  What should have been a road was covered in broken branches, a squashed tractor and lots of electricity cables that had been brought down. The destruction goes on and on. The seashore was in the distance behind a row of trees. Here the waves toppled houses; they lie at crazy angles. Trees have been smashed into the buildings. A motorcycle lies twisted and bent. Inside the houses, the furniture has been turned to matchsticks, possessions tossed everywhere, and on a few walls are portraits with the faces of those who once lived here, now stained by the waters which filled everything. As you gaze over the wrecked landscape, it feels as if the natural order of things has been shaken, and nobody knows when it will settle down again. 'Everything is gone'  The BBC's Rachel Harvey in the port town of Minami Sanriku describes it as a scene of utter devastation, with the landscape strewn with debris. She says everything has been flattened until about 2km inland, and says it looks unlikely that many survivors will be found.  Japanese police have so far confirmed 1.597 deaths, but the final toll is expected to be much higher. Kyodo news agency reported that 2,000 bodies had been found on the shores of Miyagi prefecture on Monday, but the claims could not be verified. Tens of thousands of people have been evacuated from the area around Fukushima nuclear plant. At least 22 people are now said to be undergoing treatment for radiation exposure.   Government spokesman Yukio Edano said there was a low possibility of radioactive contamination from the latest explosion at the plant. He said the reactor's containment vessel had resisted the explosion. The operators of the Fukushima plant said seven people were missing and three were injured by the blast.  Experts say a disaster on the scale of Chernobyl in the 1980s is highly unlikely because the reactors are built to a much higher standard and have much more rigorous safety measures. Powerful aftershocks  Earlier, Prime Minister Naoto Kan said the situation at the nuclear plant was alarming, and the earthquake had thrown Japan into \"the most severe crisis since World War II\". But later, the government announced that the planned blackouts had been postponed, saying they may not be needed if householders could conserve energy. The government advised people not to go to work or school on Monday because the transport network would not be able to cope with demand. The capital is also still experiencing regular aftershocks, amid warnings that another powerful earthquake is likely to strike very soon. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of relief workers, soldiers and police have been deployed to the disaster area. Rescue workers have found scenes of total devastation in isolated coastal towns north-east of the main port city of Sendai, which was itself partially destroyed by the waves. Preliminary estimates put repair costs from the earthquake and tsunami in the tens of billions of dollars, a huge blow for the Japanese economy that - while the world's third largest - has been <em>ailing</em> for two decades. The government announced it was pumping 15 trillion yen ($182bn; \u00a3113bn) into the economy to prop up the markets - which slumped on opening.",

            "en": "In recent months, some doomsayers have predicted there will be another market crash in 2011, and that Wall Street's \"con game\" will be once again exposed. As the years have passed, it has become more apparent that we're incapable of learning from our mistakes, as evidenced by the subprime credit meltdown that was foretold well-before it occurred. Economics, like sociology, is a fascinating study with complex twists and turns, many of which have been repeated throughout history. The following gloomy days in Wall Street history are stark reminders of its instability \u2014 and even our gullibility.\n \u00a0\n \nMarch 14, 1907: Real estate speculation and attempted company takeovers after the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 contributed to the crash 1907, in which the Dow suffered a loss of more than eight percent, closing at 76.23. Because many people were borrowing for speculation and a large portion of the real estate in the quake-ravaged region was insured by companies in the U.K., interest rates increased dramatically. Those rates, along with uncharacteristically high real estate prices, slowed investments on capital goods. The resulting instability fed the Panic of 1907.\n \u00a0\n \nOctober 24, 1929: An event that will forever live in infamy, the Stock Market Crash of 1929 dealt a crushing blow to the U.S. economy. Most notably, it signified the beginning of the Great Depression, which lasted all the way until World War II. The onset of the ordeal occurred on Black Thursday, when share prices on the New York Stock Exchange plummeted. In a mass panic, $5 billion vanished as almost 13 million shares were traded, more than three times the normal volume. A brief rally at the end of the day, led by Richard Whitney, head of the New York Stock Exchange, boosted confidence slightly, but ultimately failed to halt a full-blown meltdown.\n \u00a0\n \nOctober 28, 1929: Following a better Friday, investors returned on Monday to experience another rapid deterioration. They attempted to flee the market while they could, but for many it was too late. By the end of the day, trading volumes almost reached 9.25 million and the Dow fell 13 percent (38 points), a record loss. The confidence that was established at the end of the previous week was gone, and the stage was set for the most unforgettable day of 1929.\n \u00a0\n \nOctober 29, 1929: Black Tuesday is when the crisis reached its apex. In just a matter of a few hours, the financial gains of the previous year were eliminated, and consumer confidence tumbled. Everyone was selling and nobody was buying, causing the ticker to lag behind by almost two hours. An astonishing 16 million shares were traded on the day, a record that stood for 40 years, and the Dow closed with a 12 percent loss (30 points). The hoards of people who had previously borrowed to participate in the bull market were forced to sell their belongings in an effort to pay back their debts. Banks and businesses closes, and many American citizens would be left destitute without their jobs or any financial assistance.\n\n\nJuly 8, 1932: Almost three years after the dark days of October 1929, the Dow's long and steady decline hit its lowest point, closing at 42.22, an 89 percent decrease from its peak. Although it wasn't a one day catastrophe like the aforementioned events, it serves as a benchmark in history. Not only did it squelch any remnants of consumer confidence, but it also helped Franklin Roosevelt win the upcoming presidential election, enabling him to implement his New Deal initiatives, which some credit with eventually ending the Depression.\n \u00a0\n \nOctober 19, 1987: One widely agreed upon conclusion hasn't been reached regarding the events that led to Black Monday, when the Dow dropped by its largest margin in history at the time, more than 22 percent (508 points). The worldwide crash included drops of 45.5 percent in Hong Kong, 41.8 percent in Australia, 31 percent in Spain and 26.5 in the U.K., a sequence of events that spread westward. In addition to turmoil in international markets, economists have attributed it to the faltering dollar, market psychology and program trading, the latter of which was predicted by Congressman Edward J. Markey before the crash. Fortunately, the market swiftly stabilized afterward, improving by 15 percent above the closing number on Black Monday at the end of the month.\n \u00a0\n \nSeptember 17, 2001: The September 11th attacks impacted different aspects of our lives \u2014 security, defense, freedom and, of course, the economy. When the market reopened after a four-day closure following the attacks, stocks plunged to three-year lows, decreasing more than seven percent. Boeing and United Technologies, an aviation parts supplier, suffered the biggest losses. At that point, it was the biggest one-day and one-week point losses in the history of the Dow, which had previously been unaffected by the ongoing recession.\n \u00a0\n \nFebruary 27, 2007: Overshadowed by the events of the following year, the 2007 crash was quickly forgotten by those who weren't directly affected by it. Even still, it stands as one of the largest drops point-wise in the history of the Dow. Investors sold en masse amid worries of economic growth in the U.S. and worldwide, plummeting Chinese stocks and an apparent assignation attempt on Vice President Cheney by the Taliban in Afghanistan. Fears of a major selloff had been looming for months after the Dow had reached record highs during an eight-month rally.\n \u00a0\n \nSeptember 15, 2008: With more than $600 billion in assets, the demise of Lehman Brothers, the fourth largest investment bank in the U.S., had major repercussions on the economic health of the nation. The largest bankruptcy in the history of the country, along with the sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America to avoid financial crisis, resulted in a 504-point drop in the Dow, and helped set forth the panic of the following weeks. The struggling AIG, formerly the 18th-largest public company in the world, was spared thanks to assistance from the government, which, among other things, immediately provided an $85 billion credit facility.\n \u00a0\n \nSeptember 29, 2008: It was a catastrophe that defined a generation on Wall Street. After the House of Representatives failed to pass Bush's $700 million bailout plan for the <em>ailing</em> financial institutions, more than $1.2 trillion was gone from the U.S. stock market, the biggest decrease in the history of the Dow Jones. The biggest drop, 400 points, came in just 10 minutes, not long after it became evident the bill was going to fail.\n \u00a0 \u00a0",
