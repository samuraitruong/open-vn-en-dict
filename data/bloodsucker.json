            "en": "1 3            13. KILLER If it was anyone but Jacob, i thought to myself, shaking my head as I drove down  the forest-lined highway to La Push. I still wasn't sure if I was doing the right thing, but I'd made a compromise with myself. I couldn't condone what Jacob and his friends, his pack, were doing. I understood now what he'd said last night\u2014that I might not want to see him again\u2014and I could have called him as he'd suggested, but that felt cowardly. I owed him a face-to-face conversation, at least. I would tell him to his face that I couldn't just overlook what was going on. I couldn't be friends with a killer and say nothing, let the killing continue\u2026 That would make me a monster, too. But I couldn't not warn him, either. I had to do what I could to protect him. I pulled up to the Blacks' house with my lips pressed together into a hard line. It was bad enough that my best friend was a werewolf. Did he have to be a monster, too? The house was dark, no lights in the windows, but I didn't care if I woke them. My fist thudded against the front door with angry energy; the sound reverberated through the walls. \"Come in,\" I heard Billy call after a minute, and a light flicked on. I twisted the knob; it was unlocked. Billy was leaning around an open doorway just off the little kitchen, a bathrobe around his shoulders, not in his chair yet. When he saw who it was, his eyes widened briefly, and then his face turned stoic. \"Well, good morning, Bella. What are you doing up so early?\" \"Hey, Billy. I need to talk to Jake\u2014where is he?\" \"Um\u2026 I don't really know,\" he lied, straight-faced. \"Do you know what Charlie is doing this morning?\" I demanded, sick of the stalling. \"Should I?\" \"He and half the other men in town are all out in the woods with guns, hunting giant wolves.\" Billy's expression flickered, and then went blank. \"So I'd like to talk to Jake about that, if you don't mind,\" I continued. Billy pursed his thick lips for a long moment. \"I'd bet he's still asleep,\" he finally said, nodding toward the tiny hallway off the front room. \"He's out late a lot these days. Kid needs his rest\u2014probably you shouldn't wake him.\" \"It's my turn,\" I muttered under my breath as I stalked to the hallway. Billy sighed. Jacob's tiny closet of a room was the only door in the yard-long hallway. I didn't bother to knock. I threw the door open; it slammed against the wall with a bang. Jacob\u2014still wearing just the same black cut-off sweats he'd worn last night\u2014was stretched diagonally across the double bed that took up all of his room but a few inches around the edges. Even on a slant, it wasn't long enough; his feet hung off the one end and his head off the other. He was fast asleep, snoring lightly with his mouth hanging open. The sound of the door hadn't even made him twitch. His face was peaceful with deep sleep, all the angry lines smoothed out. There were circles under his eyes that I hadn't noticed before. Despite his ridiculous size, he looked very young now, and very weary. Pity shook me. I stepped back out, and shut the door quietly behind me. Billy stared with curious, guarded eyes as I walked slowly back into the front room. \"I think I'll let him get some rest.\" Billy nodded, and then we gazed at each other for a minute. I was dying to ask him about his part in this. What did he think of what his son had become? But I knew how he'd supported Sam from the very beginning, and so I supposed the murders must not bother him. How he justified that to himself I couldn't imagine. I could see many questions for me in his dark eyes, but he didn't voice them either. \"Look,\" I said, breaking the loud silence. \"I'll be down at the beach for a while. When he wakes up, tell him I'm waiting for him, okay?\" \"Sure, sure,\" Billy agreed. I wondered if he really would. Well, if he didn't, I'd tried, right? I drove down to First Beach and parked in the empty dirt lot. It was still dark\u2014the gloomy predawn of a cloudy day\u2014and when I cut the headlights it was hard to see. I had to let my eyes adjust before I could find the path that led through the tall hedge of weeds. It was colder here, with the wind whipping off the black water, and I shoved my hands deep into the pockets of my winter jacket. At least the rain had stopped. I paced down the beach toward the north seawall. I couldn't see St. James or the other islands, just the vague shape of the water's edge. I picked my way carefully across the rocks, watching out for driftwood that might trip me. I found what I was looking for before I realized I was looking for it. It materialized out of the gloom when it was just a few feet away: a long bone-white driftwood tree stranded deep on the rocks. The roots twisted up at the seaward end, like a hundred brittle tentacles. I couldn't be sure that it was the same tree where Jacob and I had had our first conversation\u2014a conversation that had begun so many different, tangled threads of my life\u2014but it seemed to be in about the same place I sat down where I'd sat before, and stared out across the invisible sea. Seeing Jacob like that\u2014innocent and vulnerable in sleep\u2014had stolen all my revulsion, dissolved all my anger. I still couldn't turn a blind eye to what was happening, like Billy seemed to, but I couldn't condemn Jacob for it either. Love didn't work that way, I decided. Once you cared about a person, it was impossible to be logical about them anymore. Jacob was my friend whether he killed people or not. And I didn't know what I was going to do about that. When I pictured him sleeping so peacefully, I felt an overpowering urge to protect him. Completely illogical. Illogical or not, I brooded over the memory his peaceful face, trying to come up with some answer, some way to shelter him, while the sky slowly turned gray. \"Hi, Bella.\" Jacob's voice came from the darkness and made me jump. It was soft, almost shy, but I'd been expecting some forewarning from the noisy rocks, and so it still startled me. I could see his silhouette against the coming sunrise\u2014it looked enormous. \"Jake?\" He stood several paces away, shifting his weight from foot to foot anxiously. \"Billy told me you came by\u2014didn't take you very long, did it? I knew you could figure it out.\" \"Yeah, I remember the right story now,\" I whispered. It was quiet for a long moment and, though it was still too dark to see well, my skin prickled as if his eyes were searching my face. There must have been enough light for him to read my expression, because when he spoke again, his voice was suddenly acidic. \"You could have just called,\" he said harshly. I nodded. \"I know.\" Jacob started pacing along the rocks. If I listened very hard, I could just hear the gentle brush of his feet on the rocks behind the sound of the waves. The rocks had clattered like castanets for me. \"Why did you come?\" he demanded, not halting his angry stride. \"I thought it would be better face-to-face.\" He snorted. \"Oh, much better.\" \"Jacob, I have to warn you\u2014\" \"About the rangers and the hunters? Don't worry about it. We already know.\" \"Don't worry about it?\" I demanded in disbelief. \"Jake, they've got guns! They're setting traps and offering rewards and\u2014\" \"We can take care of ourselves,\" he growled, still pacing. \"They're not going to catch anything. They're only making it more difficult\u2014they'll start disappearing soon enough, too.\" \"Jake!\" I hissed. \"What? It's just a fact.\" My voice was pale with revulsion. \"How can you\u2026 feel that way? You know these people. Charlie's out there!\" The thought made my stomach twist. He came to an abrupt stop. \"What more can we do?\" he retorted. The sun turned the clouds a slivery pink above us. I could see his expression now; it was angry, frustrated, betrayed. \"Could you\u2026 well, try to not be a\u2026 werewolf?\" I suggested in a whisper. He threw his hands up in the air. \"Like I have a choice about it!\" he shouted. \"And how would that help anything, if you're worried about people disappearing?\" \"I don't understand you.\" He glared at me, his eyes narrowing and his mouth twisting into a snarl. \"You know what makes me so mad I could just spit?\" I flinched away from his hostile expression. He seemed to be waiting for an answer, so I shook my head. \"You're such a hypocrite, Bella\u2014there you sit, terrified of me! How is that fair?\" His hands shook with anger. \"Hypocrite? How does being afraid of a monster make me a hypocrite?\" \"Ugh!\" he groaned, pressing his trembling fists to his temples and squeezing his eyes shut. \"Would you listen to yourself?\" \"What?\" He took two steps toward me, leaning over me and glaring with fury. \"Well, I'm so sorry that I can't be the right kind of monster for you, Bella. I guess I'm just not as great as a <em>bloodsucker</em>, am I?\" I jumped to my feet and glared back. \"No, you're not!\" I shouted. \"It's not what you are, stupid, it's what you do!\" \"What's that supposed to mean?\" He roared, his entire frame quivering with rage. I was taken entirely by surprise when Edward's voice cautioned me. \"Be very careful, Bella,\" his velvet voice warned. \"Don't push him too far. You need to calm him down.\" Even the voice in my head was making no sense today. I listened to him, though. I would do anything for that voice. \"Jacob,\" I pleaded, making my tone soft and even. \"Is it really necessary to kill people, Jacob? Isn't there some other way? I mean, if vampires can find a way to survive without murdering people, couldn't you give it a try, too?\" He straightened up with a jerk, like my words had sent an electric shock through him. His eyebrows shot up and his eyes stared wide. \"Killing people?\" he demanded. \"What did you think we were talking about?\" He wasn't trembling anymore. He looked at me with half-hopeful disbelief. \"I thought we were talking about your disgust for werewolves.\" \"No, Jake, no. It's not that you're a\u2026 wolf. That's fine,\" I promised him, and I knew as I said the words that I meant them. I really didn't care if he turned into a big wolf\u2014he was still Jacob. \"If you could just find a way not to hurt people\u2026 that's all that upsets me. These ate innocent people, Jake, people like Charlie, and I can't just look the other way while you\u2014\" \"Is that all? Really?\" he interrupted me, a smile breaking across his face. \"You're just scared because I'm a murderer? That's the only reason?\" \"Isn't that reason enough?\" He started to laugh. \"Jacob Black, this is so not funny!\" \"Sure, sure,\" he agreed, still chortling. He took one long stride and caught me in another vice-tight bear hug. \"You really, honestly don't mind that I morph into a giant dog?\" he asked, his voice joyful in my ear. \"No,\" I gasped. \"Can't\u2014breathe\u2014Jake!\" He let me go, but took both my hands. \"I'm not a killer, Bella.\" I studied his face, and it was clear that this was the truth. Relief pulsed through me. \"Really?\" I asked. \"Really,\" he promised solemnly. I threw my arms around him. It reminded me of that first day with the motorcycles\u2014he was bigger, though, and I felt even more like a child now. Like that other time, he stroked my hair. \"Sorry I called you a hypocrite,\" he apologized. \"Sorry I called you a murderer.\" He laughed. I thought of something then, and pulled away from him so that I could see his face. My eyebrows furrowed in anxiety. \"What about Sam? And the others?\" He shook his head, smiling like a huge burden had been removed from his shoulders.  \"Of course not. Don't you remember what we call ourselves?\" The memory was clear\u2014I'd just been thinking of that very day. \"Protectors?\" \"Exactly.\" \"But I don't understand. What's happening in the woods? The missing hikers, the blood?\" His face was serious, worried at once. \"We're trying to do our job, Bella. We're trying to protect them, but we're always just a little too late.\" \"Protect them from what? Is there really a bear out there, too?\" \"Bella, honey, we only protect people from one thing\u2014our one enemy. It's the reason we exist\u2014because they do.\" I stared at him blankly for one second before I understood. Then the blood drained from my face and a thin, wordless cry of horror broke through my lips. He nodded. \"I thought you, of all people, would realize what was really going on.\" \"Laurent,\" I whispered. \"He's still here.\" Jacob blinked twice, and cocked his head to one side. \"Who's Laurent?\" I tried to sort out the chaos in my head so that I could answer. \"You know\u2014you saw him in the meadow. You were there\u2026\" The words came out in a wondering tone as it all sunk in. \"You were there, and you kept him from killing me\u2026\" \"Oh, the black-haired leech?\" He grinned, a tight, fierce grin. \"Was that his name?\" I shuddered. \"What were you thinking?\" I whispered. \"He could have killed you! Jake, you don't realize how dangerous\u2014\" Another laugh interrupted me \"Bella, one lone vampire isn't much of a problem for a pack as big as ours. It was so easy, it was hardly even fun!\" \"What was so easy?\" \"Killing the <em>bloodsucker</em> who was going to kill you. Now, I don't count that towards the whole murder thing,\" he added quickly. \"Vampires don't count as people.\" I could only mouth the words. \"You\u2026 killed\u2026 Laurent?\" He nodded. \"Well, it was a group effort,\" he qualified. \"Laurent is dead?\" I whispered. His expression changed. \"You're not upset about that, are you? He was going to kill you\u2014he was going for the kill, Bella, we were sure of that before we attacked. You know that, right?\" \"I know that. No, I'm not upset\u2014I'm\u2026\" I had to sit down. I stumbled back a step until I felt the driftwood against my calves, and then sank down onto it. \"Laurent is dead. He's not coming back for me.\" \"You're not mad? He wasn't one of your friends or anything, was he?\" \"My friend?\" I stared up at him, confused and dizzy with relief. I started babbling, my eyes getting moist. \"No, Jake. I'm so\u2026 so relieved. I thought he was going to find me\u2014I've been waiting for him every night, just hoping that he'd stop with me and leave Charlie alone. I've been so frightened, Jacob\u2026 But how? He was a vampire! How did you kill him? He was so strong, so hard, like marble\u2026\" He sat down next to me and put one big arm around me comfortingly. \"It's what we're made for, Bells. \u00a0We're strong, too. I wish you would have told me that you were so afraid. You didn't need to be.\" \"You weren't around,\" I mumbled, lost in thought. \"Oh, right.\" \"Wait, Jake\u2014I thought you knew, though. Last night, you said it wasn't safe for you to be in my room. I thought you knew that a vampire might be coming. Isn't that what you were talking about?\" He looked confused for a minute, and then he ducked his head. \"No, that's not what I meant.\" \"Then why didn't you think it was safe for you there?\" He looked at me with guilt-ridden eyes. \"I didn't say it wasn't safe for me. I was thinking of you.\" \"What do you mean?\" He looked down and kicked a rock. \"There's more than one reason I'm not supposed to be around you, Bella. I wasn't supposed to tell you our secret, for one thing, but the other part is that it's not safe for you.\u00a0 If I get too mad\u2026 too upset\u2026 you might get hurt.\" I thought about that carefully. \"When you were mad before\u2026 when I was yelling at you\u2026 and you were shaking\u2026 ?\" \"Yeah.\" His face dropped even lower. \"That was pretty stupid of me. I have to keep a better hold on myself. I swore I wasn't going to get mad, no matter what you said to me. But\u2026 I just got so upset that I was going to lose you\u2026 that you couldn't deal with what I am\u2026\" \"What would happen\u2026 if you got too mad?\" I whispered. \"I'd turn into a wolf,\" he whispered back. \"You don't need a full moon.\" He rolled his eyes. \"Hollywood's version doesn't get much right.\" Then he sighed, and was serious again. \"You don't need to be so stressed out, Bells. We're going to take care of this. And we're keeping a special eye on Charlie and the others\u2014we won't let anything happen to him. Trust me on that.\" Something very, very obvious, something I should have grasped at once\u2014but I'd been so distracted by the idea of Jacob and his friends fighting with Laurent, that I'd completely missed it at the time\u2014occurred to me only then, when Jacob used the present tense again. We're going to take care of this. It wasn't over. \"Laurent is dead,\" I gasped, and my entire body went ice cold. \"Bella?\" Jacob asked anxiously, touching my ashen cheek. \"If Laurent died\u2026 a week ago\u2026 then someone else is killing people now.\" Jacob nodded; his teeth clenched together, and he spoke through them. \"There were two of them. We thought his mate would want to fight us\u2014in our stories, they usually get pretty pissed off if you kill their mate\u2014but she just keeps running away, and then coming back again. If we could figure out what she was after, it would be easier to take her down. But she makes no sense. She keeps dancing around the edges, like she's testing our defenses, looking for a way in\u2014but in where? Where does she want to go?\u00a0 Sam thinks she's trying to separate us, so she'll have a better chance\u2026\" His voice faded until it sounded like it was coming through a long tunnel; I couldn't make out the individual words anymore. My forehead dewed with sweat and my stomach rolled like I had the stomach flu again. Exactly like I had the flu. I turned away from him quickly, and leaned over the tree trunk. My body convulsed with useless heaves, my empty stomach contracting with horrified nausea, though there was nothing in it to expel. Victoria was here. Looking for me. Killing strangers in the woods. The woods where Charlie was searching\u2026 My head spun sickeningly. Jacob's hands caught my shoulders\u2014kept me from sliding forward onto the rocks. I could feel his hot breath on my cheek. \"Bella! What's wrong?\" \"Victoria,\" I gasped as soon as I could catch my breath around the nauseous spasms. In my head, Edward snarled in fury at the name. I felt Jacob pull me up from my slump. He draped me awkwardly across his lap, laying my limp head against his shoulder. He struggled to balance me, to keep me from sagging over, one way or the other he brushed the sweaty hair back from my face. \"Who?\" Jacob asked. \"Can you hear me, Bella? Bella?\" \"She wasn't Laurent's mate,\" I moaned into his shoulder. \"They were just old friends\u2026\" \"Do you need some water? A doctor? Tell me what to do,\" he demanded, frantic. \"I'm not sick\u2014I'm scared,\" I explained in a whisper. The word scared didn't really seem to cover it. Jacob patted my back. \"Scared of this Victoria?\" I nodded, shuddering. \"Victoria is the red-haired female?\" I trembled again, and whimpered, \"Yes.\" \"How do you know she wasn't his mate?\" \"Laurent told me James was her mate,\" I explained, automatically flexing the hand with the scar. He pulled my face around, holding it steady in his big hand. He stared intently into my eyes. \"Did he tell you anything else, Bella? This is important. Do you know what she wants?\" \"Of course,\" I whispered. \"She wants me.\" His eyes flipped wide, then narrowed into slits. \"Why?\" he demanded. \"Edward killed James,\" I whispered. Jacob held me so tightly that there was no need for me to clutch at the hole\u2014he kept me in one piece. \"She did get\u2026 pissed off. But Laurent said she thought it was fairer to kill me than Edward. Mate for mate. She didn't know\u2014still doesn't know, I guess\u2014that\u2026 that\u2026\" I swallowed hard. \"That things aren't like that with us anymore. Not for Edward, anyway.\" Jacob was distracted by that, his face torn between several different expressions. \"Is that what happened? Why the Cullens left?\" \"I'm nothing but a human, after all. Nothing special,\" I explained, shrugging weakly. Something like a growl\u2014not a real growl, just a human approximation\u2014rumbled in Jacob's chest under my ear. \"If that idiot <em>bloodsucker</em> is honestly stupid enough\u2014\" \"Please,\" I moaned. \"Please. Don't.\" Jacob hesitated, then nodded once. \"This is important,\" he said again, his face all business now. \"This is exactly what we needed to know.We've got to tell the others right away.\" He stood, pulling me to my feet. He kept two hands on my waist until he was sure I wasn't going to fall. \"I'm okay,\" I lied. He traded his hold on my waist for one of my hands. \"Let's go.\" He pulled me back toward the truck. \"Where are we going?\" I asked. \"I'm not sure yet,\" he admitted. \"I'll call a meeting. Hey, wait here for just a minute, okay?\" He leaned me against the side of the truck and released my hand. \"Where are you going?\" \"I'll be right back,\" he promised. Then he turned and sprinted through the parking lot, across the road, and into the bordering forest. He flitted into the trees, swift and sleek as a deer. \"Jacob!\" I yelled after him hoarsely, but he was already gone. It was not a good time to be left alone. Seconds after Jacob was out of sight, I was hyperventilating. I dragged myself into the cab of the truck, and mashed the locks down at once. It didn't make me feel any better. Victoria was already hunting me. It was just luck that she hadn't found me yet\u2014just luck and five teenage werewolves. I exhaled sharply. No matter what Jacob said, the thought of him coming anywhere close to Victoria was horrifying. I didn't care what he could turn into when he got mad. I could see her in my head, her face wild, her hair like flames, deadly, indestructible\u2026 But, according to Jacob, Laurent was gone. Was that really possible? Edward\u2014I clutched automatically at my chest\u2014had told me how difficult it was to kill a vampire. Only another vampire could do the job. Yet Jake said this was what werewolves were made for\u2026 He said they were keeping a special eye on Charlie\u2014that I should trust the werewolves to keep my father safe. How could I trust that? None of us were safe! Jacob the very least of all, if he was trying to put himself between Victoria and Charlie\u2026 between Victoria and me. I felt like I might be about to throw up again. A sharp rap on the truck's window made me yelp in terror\u2014but it was just Jacob, back already. I unlocked the door with trembling, grateful fingers. \"You're really scared, aren't you?\" he asked as he climbed in. I nodded. \"Don't be. We'll take care of you\u2014and Charlie, too. I promise.\" \"The idea of you finding Victoria is scarier than the idea of her finding me,\" I whispered. He laughed. \"You've got to have a little more confidence in us than that. It's insulting.\" I just shook my head. I'd seen too many vampires in action. \"Where did you go just now?\" I asked. He pursed his lips, and said nothing. \"What? Is it a secret?\" He frowned. \"Not really. It's kind of weird, though. I don't want to freak you out.\" \"I'm sort of used to weird by this point, you know.\" I tried to smile without much success. Jacob grinned back easily. \"Guess you'd have to be. Okay. See, when we're wolves, we can\u2026 hear each other.\" My eyebrows pulled down in confusion. \"Not hear sounds,\" he went on, \"but we can hear\u2026 thoughts\u2014each other's anyway\u2014no matter how far away from each other we are. It really helps when we hunt, but it's a big pain otherwise. It's embarrassing\u2014having no secrets like that. Freaky, eh?\" \"Is that what you meant last night, when you said you would tell them you'd seen me, even though you didn't want to?\" \"You're quick.\" \"Thanks.\" \"You're also very good with weird. I thought that would bother you.\" \"It's not\u2026 well, you're not the first person I've known who could do that. So it doesn't seem so weird to me.\" \"Really?\u2026 Wait\u2014are you talking about your bloodsuckers?\" \"I wish you wouldn't call them that.\" He laughed. \"Whatever. The Cullens, then?\" \"Just\u2026 just Edward.\" I pulled one arm surreptitiously around my torso. Jacob looked surprised\u2014unpleasantly so. \"I thought those were just stories. I've heard legends about vampires who could do\u2026 extra stuff, but I thought that was just a myth.\" \"Is anything just a myth anymore?\" I asked him wryly. He scowled. \"Guess not. Okay, we're going to meet Sam and the others at the place we go to ride our bikes.\" I started the truck and headed back up the road. \"So did you just turn into a wolf now, to talk to Sam?\" I asked, curious. Jacob nodded, seeming embarrassed. \"I kept it real short\u2014I tried not to think about you so they wouldn't know what was going on. I was afraid Sam would tell me I couldn't bring you.\" \"That wouldn't have stopped me.\" I couldn't get rid of my perception of Sam as the bad guy. My teeth clenched together whenever I heard his name. \"Well, it would have stopped me,\" Jacob said, morose now. \"Remember how I couldn't finish my sentences last night? How I couldn't just tell you the whole story?\" \"Yeah. You looked like you were choking on something.\" He chuckled darkly. \"Close enough. Sam told me I couldn't tell you. He's\u2026 the head of the pack, you know. He's the Alpha. When he tells us to do something, or not to do something\u2014when he really means it, well, we can't just ignore him.\" \"Weird,\" I muttered. \"Very,\" he agreed. \"It's kind of a wolf thing.\" \"Huh\" was the best response I could think of. \"Yeah, there's a load of stuff like that\u2014wolf things. I'm still learning. I can't imagine what it was like for Sam, trying to deal with this alone.\u00a0 It sucks bad enough to go through it with a whole pack for support.\" \"Sam was alone?\" \"Yeah.\" Jacob's voice lowered. \"When I\u2026 changed, it was the most\u2026 horrible, the most terrifying thing I've ever been through\u2014worse than anything I could have imagined. But I wasn't alone\u2014there were the voices there, in my head, telling me what had happened and what I had to do. That kept me from losing my mind, I think. But Sam\u2026\" He shook his head. \"Sam had no help.\" This was going to take some adjusting. When Jacob explained it like that, it was hard not to feel compassion for Sam. I had to keep reminding myself that there was no reason to hate him anymore. \"Will they be angry that I'm with you?\" I asked. He made a face. \"Probably.\" \"Maybe I shouldn't\u2014\" \"No, it's okay,\" he assured me. \"You know a ton of things that can help us. It's not like you're just some ignorant human. You're like a\u2026 I don't know, spy or something. You've been behind enemy lines.\" I frowned to myself. Was that what Jacob would want from me? Insider information to help them destroy their enemies? I wasn't a spy, though. I hadn't been collecting that kind of information. Already, his words made me feel like a traitor. But I wanted him to stop Victoria, didn't I? No. I did want Victoria to be stopped, preferably before she tortured me to death or ran into Charlie or killed another stranger. I just didn't want Jacob to be the one to stop her, or rather to try. I didn't want Jacob within a hundred miles of her. \"Like the stuff about the mind-reading <em>bloodsucker</em>,\" he continued, oblivious to my reverie. \"That's the kind of thing we need to know about. That really sucks that those stories are true. It makes everything more complicated. Hey, do you think this Victoria can do anything special?\" \"I don't think so,\" I hesitated, and then sighed. \"He would have mentioned it.\" \"He? Oh, you mean Edward\u2014oops, sorry. I forgot. You don't like to say his name. Or hear it.\" I squeezed my midsection, trying to ignore the throbbing around the edges of my chest. \"Not really, no.\" \"Sorry.\" \"How do you know me so well, Jacob? Sometimes it's like you can read my mind.\" \"Naw. I just pay attention.\" We were on the little dirt road where Jacob had first taught me to ride the motorcycle. \"This good?\" I asked. \"Sure, sure.\" I pulled over and cut the engine. \"You're still pretty unhappy, aren't you?\" he murmured. I nodded, staring unseeingly into the gloomy forest. \"Did you ever think\u2026 that maybe\u2026 you're better off?\" I inhaled slowly, and then let my breath out. \"No.\" \"'Cause he wasn't the best\u2014\" \"Please, Jacob,\" I interrupted, begging in a whisper. \"Could we please not talk about this? I can't stand it.\" \"Okay.\" He took a deep breath. \"I'm sorry I said anything.\" \"Don't feel bad. If things were different, it would be nice to finally be able to talk to someone about it.\" He nodded. \"Yeah, I had a hard time keeping a secret from you for two weeks. It must be hell to not be able to talk to anyone.\" \"Hell,\" I agreed. Jacob sucked in a sharp breath. \"They're here. Let's go.\" \"Are you sure?\" I asked while he popped his door open. \"Maybe I shouldn't be here.\" \"They'll deal with it,\" he said, and then he grinned. \"Who's afraid of the big, bad wolf?\" \"Ha ha,\" I said. But I got out of the truck, hurrying around the front end to stand close beside Jacob. I remembered only too clearly the giant monsters in the meadow. My hands were trembling like Jacob's had been before, but with fear rather than rage. Jake took my hand and squeezed it. \"Here we go.\"",

            "en": "5         5. IMPRINT \u201cAre you okay, Jake?\u00a0 Charlie said you were having a hard time. . . . Isn\u2019t it getting any better?\u201d His warm hand curled around mine. \u201cIt\u2019s not so bad,\u201d he said, but he wouldn\u2019t meet my eyes. He walked slowly back to the driftwood bench, staring at the rainbow-colored pebbles, and pulling me along at his side. I sat back down on our tree, but he sat on the wet, rocky ground rather than next to me. I wondered if it was so that he could hide his face more easily. He kept my hand. I started babbling to fill the silence. \u201cIt\u2019s been so long since I was here. I\u2019ve probably missed a ton of things. How are Sam and Emily? And Embry? Did Quil \u2014?\u201d I broke off mid-sentence, remembering that Jacob\u2019s friend Quil had been a sensitive subject. \u201cAh, Quil,\u201d Jacob sighed. So then it must have happened \u2014 Quil must have joined the pack. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I mumbled. To my surprise, Jacob snorted. \u201cDon\u2019t say that to him.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cQuil\u2019s not looking for pity. Just the opposite \u2014 he\u2019s jazzed. Totally thrilled.\u201d This made no sense to me. All the other wolves had been so depressed at the idea of their friend sharing their fate. \u201cHuh?\u201d Jacob tilted his head back to look at me. He smiled and rolled his eyes.    \u201cQuil thinks it\u2019s the coolest thing that\u2019s ever happened to him. Part of it is finally knowing what\u2019s going on. And he\u2019s excited to have his friends back \u2014 to be part of the \u2018in crowd.\u2019\u201d Jacob snorted again. \u201cShouldn\u2019t be surprised, I guess. It\u2019s so Quil.\u201d \u201cHe likes it?\u201d \u201cHonestly . . . most of them do,\u201d Jacob admitted slowly. \u201cThere are definitely good sides to this \u2014 the speed, the freedom, the strength . . . the sense of \u2014 of family . . . . Sam and I are the only ones who ever felt really bitter. And Sam got past that a long time ago. So I\u2019m the crybaby now.\u201d Jacob laughed at himself. There were so many things I wanted to know. \u201cWhy are you and Sam different? What happened to Sam anyway? What\u2019s his problem?\u201d The questions tumbled out without room to answer them, and Jacob laughed again. \u201cThat\u2019s a long story.\u201d \u201cI told you a long story. Besides, I\u2019m not in any hurry to get back,\u201d I said, and then I grimaced as I thought of the trouble I would be in. He looked up at me swiftly, hearing the double edge in my words. \u201cWill he be mad at you?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d I admitted. \u201cHe really hates it when I do things he considers . . . risky.\u201d \u201cLike hanging out with werewolves.\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d Jacob shrugged. \u201cSo don\u2019t go back. I\u2019ll sleep on the couch.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a great idea,\u201d I grumbled. \u201cBecause then he would come looking for me.\u201d Jacob stiffened, and then smiled bleakly. \u201cWould he?\u201d \u201cIf he was afraid I was hurt or something \u2014 probably.\u201d \u201cMy idea\u2019s sounding better all the time.\u201d \u201cPlease, Jake. That really bugs me.\u201d \u00a0\u201cWhat does?\u201d \u201cThat you two are so ready to kill each other!\u201d I complained. \u201cIt makes me crazy. Why can\u2019t you both just be civilized?\u201d \u201cIs he ready to kill me?\u201d Jacob asked with a grim smile, unconcerned by my anger. \u201cNot like you seem to be!\u201d I realized I was yelling. \u201cAt least he can be a grown-up about this. He knows that hurting you would hurt me \u2014 and so he never would. You don\u2019t seem to care about that at all!\u201d \u201cYeah, right,\u201d Jacob muttered. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s quite the pacifist.\u201d \u201cUgh!\u201d I ripped my hand out of his and shoved his head away. Then I pulled my knees up to my chest and wrapped my arms tightly around them. I glared out toward the horizon, fuming. Jacob was quiet for a few minutes. Finally, he got up off the ground and sat beside me, putting his arm around my shoulders. I shook it off. \u201cSorry,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI\u2019ll try to behave myself.\u201d I didn\u2019t answer. \u201cDo you still want to hear about Sam?\u201d he offered. I shrugged. \u00a0\u201cLike I said, it\u2019s a long story. And very . . . strange. There\u2019re so many strange things about this new life. I haven\u2019t had time to tell you the half of it. And this thing with Sam \u2014 well, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll even be able to explain it right.\u201d His words pricked my curiosity in spite of my irritation. \u201cI\u2019m listening,\u201d I said stiffly. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the side of his face pull up in a smile. \u201cSam had it so much harder than the rest of us. Because he was the first, and he was alone, and he didn\u2019t have anyone to tell him what was happening. Sam\u2019s grandfather died before he was born, and his father has never been around. There was no one there to recognize the signs. The first time it happened \u2014 the first time he phased \u2014 he thought he\u2019d gone insane. It took him two weeks to calm down enough to change back. \u00a0\u201cThis was before you came to Forks, so you wouldn\u2019t remember. Sam\u2019s mother and Leah Clearwater had the forest rangers searching for him, the police. People thought there had been an accident or something. . . .\u201d \u201cLeah?\u201d I asked, surprised. Leah was Harry\u2019s daughter. Hearing her name sent an automatic surge of pity through me. Harry Clearwater, Charlie\u2019s life-long friend, had died of a heart attack this past spring. His voice changed, became heavier. \u201cYeah. Leah and Sam were high school sweethearts. They started dating when she was just a freshman. She was frantic when he disappeared.\u201d \u201cBut he and Emily \u2014\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll get to that \u2014 it\u2019s part of the story,\u201d he said. He inhaled slowly, and then exhaled in a gust. I supposed it was silly for me to imagine that Sam had never loved anyone before Emily. Most people fall in and out of love many times in their lives. It was just that I\u2019d seen Sam with Emily, and I couldn\u2019t imagine him with someone else. The way he looked at her . . . well, it reminded me of a look I\u2019d seen sometimes in Edward\u2019s eyes \u2014 when he was looking at me. \u00a0\u201cSam came back,\u201d Jacob said, \u201cbut he wouldn\u2019t talk to anyone about where he\u2019d been. Rumors flew \u2014 that he was up to no good, mostly. And then Sam happened to run in to Quil\u2019s grandfather one afternoon when Old Quil Ateara came to visit Mrs. Uley. Sam shook his hand. Old Quil just about had a stroke.\u201d Jacob paused to laugh. \u201cWhy?\u201d Jacob put his hand on my cheek and pulled my face around to look at him \u2014 he was leaning toward me, his face was just a few inches away. His palm burned my skin, like he had a fever. \u00a0\u201cOh, right,\u201d I said. It was uncomfortable, having my face so close to his with his hand hot against my skin. \u201cSam was running a temperature.\u201d Jacob laughed again. \u201cSam\u2019s hand felt like he\u2019d left it sitting on a hot stovetop.\u201d He was so close, I could feel his warm breath. I reached up casually, to take his hand away and free my face, but wound my fingers through his so that I wouldn\u2019t hurt his feelings. He smiled and leaned back, undeceived by my attempt at nonchalance. \u201cSo Mr. Ateara went straight to the other elders,\u201d Jacob went on. \u201cThey were the only ones left who still knew, who remembered. Mr. Ateara, Billy, and Harry had actually seen their grandfathers make the change. When Old Quil told them, they met with Sam secretly and explained. \u201cIt was easier when he understood \u2014 when he wasn\u2019t alone anymore. They knew he wouldn\u2019t be the only one affected by the Cullens\u2019 return\u201d \u2014 he pronounced the name with unconscious bitterness \u2014 \u201cbut no one else was old enough. So Sam waited for the rest of us to join him. . . .\u201d  \u201cThe Cullens had no idea,\u201d I said in a whisper. \u201cThey didn\u2019t think that werewolves still existed here. They didn\u2019t know that coming here would change you.\u201d \u201cIt doesn\u2019t change the fact that it did.\u201d \u201cRemind me not to get on your bad side.\u201d \u201cYou think I should be as forgiving as you are? We can\u2019t all be saints and martyrs.\u201d \u201cGrow up, Jacob.\u201d \u00a0\u201cI wish I could,\u201d he murmured quietly. I stared at him, trying to make sense of his response. \u201cWhat?\u201d Jacob chuckled. \u201cOne of those many strange things I mentioned.\u201d \u201cYou . . . can\u2019t . . . grow up?\u201d I said blankly. \u201cYou\u2019re what? Not . . .aging? Is that a joke?\u201d \u201cNope.\u201d He popped his lips on the P. I felt blood flood my face. Tears \u2014 tears of rage \u2014 filled my eyes. My teeth mashed together with an audible grinding sound. \u201cBella? What did I say?\u201d I was on my feet again, my hands balled up into fists, my whole frame shaking. \u201cYou. Are. Not. Aging,\u201d I growled through my teeth. Jacob tugged my arm gently, trying to make me sit. \u201cNone of us are. What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d \u201cAm I the only one who has to get old? I get older every stinking day!\u201d I nearly shrieked, throwing my hands in the air. Some little part of me recognized that I was throwing a Charlie-esque fit, but that rational part was greatly overshadowed by the irrational part. \u201cDamn it! What kind of world is this? Where\u2019s the justice?\u201d \u201cTake it easy, Bella.\u201d \u201cShut up, Jacob. Just shut up! This is so unfair!\u201d \u201cDid you seriously just stamp your foot? I thought girls only did that on TV.\u201d I growled unimpressively. \u201cIt\u2019s not as bad as you seem to think it is. Sit down and I\u2019ll explain.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll stand.\u201d He rolled his eyes. \u201cOkay. Whatever you want. But listen, Iwill get older . . . someday.\u201d \u201cExplain.\u201d He patted the tree. I glowered for a second, but then sat; my temper had burned out as suddenly as it had flared and I\u2019d calmed down enough to realize that I was making a fool of myself. \u201cWhen we get enough control to quit . . . ,\u201d Jacob said. \u201cWhen we stop phasing for a solid length of time, we age again. It\u2019s not easy.\u201d He shook his head, abruptly doubtful. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna take a really long time to learn that kind of restraint, I think. Even Sam\u2019s not there yet. \u2019Course it doesn\u2019t help that there\u2019s a huge coven of vampires right down the road. We can\u2019t even think about quitting when the tribe needs protectors. But you shouldn\u2019t get all bent out of shape about it, anyway, because I\u2019m already older than you, physically at least.\u201d \u00a0\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d \u201cLook at me, Bells. Do I look sixteen?\u201d I glanced up and down his mammoth frame, trying to be unbiased. \u201cNot exactly, I guess.\u201d \u201cNot at all. Because we reach full growth inside of a few months when the werewolf gene gets triggered. It\u2019s one hell of a growth spurt.\u201d He made a face. \u201cPhysically, I\u2019m probably twenty-five or something. So there\u2019s no need for you to freak out about being too old for me for at least another seven years.\u201d Twenty-five or something.The idea messed with my head. But I remembered that growth spurt \u2014 I remembered watching him shoot up and fill out right before my eyes. I remembered how he would look different from one day to the next. . . . I shook my head, feeling dizzy. \u201cSo, did you want to hear about Sam, or did you want to scream at me some more for things that are out of my control?\u201d I took a deep breath. \u201cSorry. Age is a touchy subject for me. That hit a nerve.\u201d Jacob\u2019s eyes tightened, and he looked as if he were trying to decide how to word something. Since I didn\u2019t want to talk about the truly touchy stuff \u2014 my plans for the future, or treaties that might be broken by said plans, I prompted him. \u201cSo once Sam understood what was going on, once he had Billy and Harry and Mr. Ateara, you said it wasn\u2019t so hard anymore. And, like you also said, there are the cool parts. . . .\u201d I hesitated briefly. \u201cWhy does Sam hate them so much? Why does he wish I would hate them?\u201d Jacob sighed. \u201cThis is the really weird part.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a pro at weird.\u201d \u201cYeah, I know.\u201d He grinned before he continued. \u201cSo, you\u2019re right. Sam knew what was going on, and everything was almost okay. In most ways, his life was back to, well, not normal. But better.\u201d Then Jacob\u2019s expression tightened, like something painful was coming. \u201cSam couldn\u2019t tell Leah. We aren\u2019t supposed to tell anyone who doesn\u2019t have to know. And it wasn\u2019t really safe for him to be around her \u2014 but he cheated, just like I did with you. Leah was furious that he wouldn\u2019t tell her what was going on \u2014 where he\u2019d been, where he went at night, why he was always so exhausted \u2014 but they were working it out. They were trying. They really loved each other.\u201d \u201cDid she find out? Is that what happened?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cNo, that wasn\u2019t the problem. Her cousin, Emily Young, came down from the Makah reservation to visit her one weekend.\u201d I gasped. \u201cEmily is Leah\u2019s cousin?\u201d \u201cSecond cousins. They\u2019re close, though. They were like sisters when they were kids.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s . . . horrible. How could Sam . . . ?\u201d I trailed off, shaking my head. \u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t judge him just yet. Did anyone ever tell you . . . Have you ever heard of imprinting ?\u201d \u201cImprinting?\u201d I repeated the unfamiliar word. \u201cNo. What\u2019s that mean?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s one of those bizarre things we have to deal with. It doesn\u2019t happen to everyone. In fact, it\u2019s the rare exception, not the rule. Sam had heard all the stories by then, the stories we all used to think were legends. He\u2019d heard of imprinting, but he never dreamed . . .\u201d \u201cWhat is it?\u201d I prodded. Jacob\u2019s eyes strayed to the ocean. \u201cSam did love Leah. But when he saw Emily, that didn\u2019t matter anymore. Sometimes . . . we don\u2019t exactly know why . . . we find our mates that way.\u201d His eyes flashed back to me, his face reddening. \u201cI mean . . . our soul mates.\u201d \u00a0\u201cWhat way? Love at first sight?\u201d I snickered. Jacob wasn\u2019t smiling. His dark eyes were critical of my reaction. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit more powerful than that. More absolute.\u201d \u201cSorry,\u201d I muttered. \u201cYou\u2019re serious, aren\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cYeah, I am.\u201d \u201cLove at first sight? But more powerful?\u201d My voice still sounded dubious, and he could hear that. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to explain. It doesn\u2019t matter, anyway.\u201d He shrugged indifferently.  \u00a0\u201cYou wanted to know what happened to Sam to make him hate the vampires for changing him, to make him hate himself. And that\u2019s what happened. He broke Leah\u2019s heart. He went back on every promise he\u2019d ever made her. Every day he has to see the accusation in her eyes, and know that she\u2019s right.\u201d He stopped talking abruptly, as if he\u2019d said something he hadn\u2019t meant to. \u201cHow did Emily deal with this? If she was so close to Leah . . . ?\u201d Sam and Emily were utterly right together, two puzzle pieces, shaped for each other exactly. Still . . . how had Emily gotten past the fact that he\u2019d belonged to someone else? Her sister, almost. \u00a0\u201cShe was real angry, in the beginning. But it\u2019s hard to resist that level of commitment and adoration.\u201d Jacob sighed. \u201cAnd then, Sam could tell her everything. There are no rules that can bind you when you find your other half. You know how she got hurt?\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d The story in Forks was that she was mauled by a bear, but I was in on the secret. Werewolves are unstable, Edward had said.The people near them get hurt. \u201cWell, weirdly enough, that was sort of how they resolved things. Sam was so horrified, so sickened by himself, so full of hate for what he\u2019d done. . . . He would have thrown himself under a bus if it would have made her feel better. He might have anyway, just to escape what he\u2019d done. He was shattered. . . . Then, somehow, she was the one comforting him , and after that. . . .\u201d Jacob didn\u2019t finish his thought, and I sensed the story had gotten too personal to share. \u00a0\u201cPoor Emily,\u201d I whispered. \u201cPoor Sam. Poor Leah. . . .\u201d \u201cYeah, Leah got the worst end of the stick,\u201d he agreed. \u201cShe puts on a brave face. She\u2019s going to be a bridesmaid.\u201d I gazed away, toward the jagged rocks that rose from the ocean like stubby broken-off fingers on the south rim of the harbor, while I tried to make sense of it all. I could feel his eyes on my face, waiting for me to say something.   \u201cDid it happen to you?\u201d I finally asked, still looking away. \u201cThis love-at-first-sight thing?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d he answered briskly. \u201cSam and Jared are the only ones.\u201d \u201cHmm,\u201d I said, trying to sound only politely interested. I was relieved, and I tried to explain my reaction to myself. I decided I was just glad he didn\u2019t claim there was some mystical, wolfy connection between the two of us. Our relationship was confusing enough as it was. I didn\u2019t need any more of the supernatural than I already had to deal with. He was quiet, too, and the silence felt a little awkward. My intuition told me that I didn\u2019t want to hear what he was thinking.   \u00a0\u201cHow did that work out for Jared?\u201d I asked to break the silence. \u201cNo drama there. It was just a girl he\u2019d sat next to in school every day for a year and never looked at twice. And then, after he changed, he saw her again and never looked away. Kim was thrilled. She\u2019d had a huge crush on him. She\u2019d had his last name tacked on to the end of hers all over in her diary.\u201d He laughed mockingly. I frowned. \u201cDid Jared tell you that? He shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d  Jacob bit his lip. \u201cI guess I shouldn\u2019t laugh. It was funny, though.\u201d \u201cSome soul mate.\u201d He sighed. \u201cJared didn\u2019t tell us anything on purpose. I already told you this part, remember?\u201d \u201cOh, yeah. You can hear each other\u2019s thoughts, but only when you\u2019re wolves, right?\u201d \u201cRight. Just like your <em>bloodsucker</em>.\u201d He glowered. \u201cEdward,\u201d I corrected. \u00a0\u201cSure, sure. That\u2019s how come I know so much about how Sam felt. It\u2019s not like he would have told us all that if he\u2019d had a choice. Actually, that\u2019s something we all hate.\u201d The bitterness was abruptly harsh in his voice. \u201cIt\u2019s awful. No privacy, no secrets. Everything you\u2019re ashamed of, laid out for everyone to see.\u201d He shuddered. \u201cIt sounds horrible,\u201d I whispered. \u201cIt is sometimes helpful when we need to coordinate,\u201d he said grudgingly. \u201cOnce in a blue moon, when some <em>bloodsucker</em> crosses into our territory. Laurent was fun. And if the Cullens hadn\u2019t gotten in our way last Saturday . . . ugh!\u201d he groaned. \u201cWe could have had her!\u201d His fists clenched into angry balls. I flinched. As much as I worried about Jasper or Emmett getting hurt, it was nothing like the panic I felt at the idea of Jacob going up against Victoria. Emmett and Jasper were the closest thing to indestructible I could imagine. Jacob was still warm, still comparatively human. Mortal. I thought of Jacob facing Victoria, her brilliant hair blowing around her oddly feline face . . . and shuddered. Jacob looked up at me with a curious expression. \u201cBut isn\u2019t it like that for you all the time? Having him in your head?\u201d  \u201cOh, no. Edward\u2019s never in my head. He only wishes.\u201d Jacob\u2019s expression became confused. \u201cHe can\u2019t hear me,\u201d I explained, my voice a tiny bit smug from old habit. \u201cI\u2019m the only one like that, for him. We don\u2019t know why he can\u2019t.\u201d \u201cWeird,\u201d Jacob said. \u201cYeah.\u201d The smugness faded. \u201cIt probably means there\u2019s something wrong with my brain,\u201d I admitted. \u201cI already knew there was something wrong with your brain,\u201d Jacob muttered. \u201cThanks.\u201d The sun broke through the clouds suddenly, a surprise I hadn\u2019t been expecting, and I had to narrow my eyes against the glare off the water. Everything changed color \u2014 the waves turned from gray to blue, the trees from dull olive to brilliant jade, and the rainbow-hued pebbles glittered like jewels. We squinted for a moment, letting our eyes adjust. There were no sounds besides the hollow roar of the waves that echoed from every side of the sheltered harbor, the soft grinding of the stones against each other under the water\u2019s movement, and the cry of gulls high overhead. It was very peaceful. He settled closer to me, so that he was leaning against my arm. He was so warm. After a minute of this, I shrugged out of my rain jacket. He made a little sound of contentment in the back of his throat, and rested his cheek on the top of my head. I could feel the sun heat my skin \u2014 thought it was not quite as warm as Jacob \u2014 and I wondered idly how long it would take me to burn. Absentmindedly, I twisted my right hand to the side, and watched the sunlight glitter subtly off the scar James had left there. \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d he murmured. \u201cThe sun.\u201d \u201cMmm. It\u2019s nice.\u201d \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d I asked. He chuckled to himself. \u201cI was remembering that moronic movie you took me to. And Mike Newton puking all over everything.\u201d I laughed, too, surprised by how time had changed the memory. It used to be one of stress, of confusion. So much had changed that night. . . . And now I could laugh. It was the last night Jacob and I had had before he\u2019d learned the truth about his heritage. The last human memory. An oddly pleasant memory now. \u201cI miss that,\u201d Jacob said. \u201cThe way it used to be so easy . . . uncomplicated. I\u2019m glad I\u2019ve got a good memory.\u201d He sighed. He felt the sudden tension in my body as his words triggered a memory of my own. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked. \u201cAbout that good memory of yours . . .\u201d I pulled away from him so that I could read his face. At the moment, it was confused. \u201cDo you mind telling me what you were doing Monday morning? You were thinking something that bothered Edward.\u201d Bothered wasn\u2019t quite the word for it, but I wanted an answer, so I thought it was best not to start out too severely. Jacob\u2019s face brightened with understanding, and he laughed. \u201cI was just thinking about you. Didn\u2019t like that much, did he?\u201d \u201cMe? What about me?\u201d Jacob laughed, with a harder edge this time. \u201cI was remembering the way you looked that night Sam found you \u2014 I\u2019ve seen it in his head, and it\u2019s like I was there; that memory has always haunted Sam, you know. And then I remembered how you looked the first time you came to my place. I bet you don\u2019t even realize what a mess you were then, Bella. It was weeks before you started to look human again. And I remembered how you always used to have your arms wrapped around yourself, trying to hold yourself together. . . .\u201d Jacob winced, and then shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to remember how sad you were, and it wasn\u2019t my fault. So I figured it would be harder for him. And I thought he ought to get a look at what he\u2019d done.\u201d I smacked his shoulder. It hurt my hand. \u201cJacob Black, don\u2019t you ever do that again! Promise me you won\u2019t.\u201d \u201cNo way. I haven\u2019t had that much fun in months.\u201d \u201cSo help me, Jake \u2014\u201d \u201cOh, get a grip, Bella. When am I ever going to see him again? Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d I got to my feet, and he caught my hand as I started to walk away. I tried to tug free. \u201cI\u2019m leaving, Jacob.\u201d \u201cNo, don\u2019t go yet,\u201d he protested, his hand tightening around mine. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. And . . . okay, I won\u2019t do it again. Promise.\u201d I sighed. \u201cThanks, Jake.\u201d \u201cCome on, we\u2019ll go back to my house,\u201d he said eagerly. \u00a0\u201cActually, I think I really do need to go. Angela Weber is expecting me, and I know Alice is worried. I don\u2019t want to upset her too much.\u201d \u201cBut you just got here!\u201d \u201cIt feels that way,\u201d I agreed. I glared up at the sun, somehow already directly overhead. How had the time passed so quickly? His eyebrows pulled down over his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll see you again,\u201d he said in a hurt voice. \u201cI\u2019ll come back the next time he\u2019s away,\u201d I promised impulsively. \u201cAway?\u201d Jacob rolled his eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s a nice way to describe what he\u2019s doing. Disgusting parasites.\u201d \u201cIf you can\u2019t be nice, I won\u2019t come back at all!\u201d I threatened, trying to pull my hand free. He refused to let go. \u201cAw, don\u2019t be mad,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cKnee-jerk reaction.\u201d \u201cIf I\u2019m going to try to come back again, you\u2019re going to have to get something straight, okay?\u201d He waited. \u201cSee,\u201d I explained. \u201cI don\u2019t care who\u2019s a vampire and who\u2019s a werewolf. That\u2019s irrelevant. You are Jacob, and he is Edward, and I am Bella. And nothing else matters.\u201d His eyes narrowed slightly. \u201cBut I am a werewolf,\u201d he said unwillingly. \u201cAnd he is a vampire,\u201d he added with obvious revulsion. \u201cAnd I\u2019m a Virgo!\u201d I shouted, exasperated. He raised his eyebrows, measuring my expression with curious eyes. Finally, he shrugged. \u201cIf you can really see it that way . . .\u201d \u201cI can. I do.\u201d   \u201cOkay. Just Bella and Jacob. None of those freaky Virgos here.\u201d He smiled at me, the warm, familiar smile that I had missed so much. I felt the answering smile spread across my face. \u201cI\u2019ve really missed you, Jake,\u201d I admitted impulsively. \u201cMe, too,\u201d his smile widened. His eyes were happy and clear, free for once of the angry bitterness. \u201cMore than you know. Will you come back soon?\u201d \u201cAs soon as I can,\u201d I promised.",

            "en": "7 REPETITION          18. THE FUNERAL I SPRINTED DOWN THE STAIRS AND THREW THE DOOR open. It was Jacob, of course. Even blind, Alice wasn't slow. He was standing about six feet back from the door, his nose wrinkled in distaste, but his face otherwise smooth\u2014masklike. He didn't fool me; I could see the faint trembling of his hands. Hostility rolled off of him in waves. It brought back that awful afternoon when he'd chosen Sam over me, and I felt my chin jerk up defensively in response. Jacob's Rabbit idled by the curb with Jared behind the wheel and Embry in the passenger seat. I understood what this meant: they were afraid to let him come here alone. It made me sad, and a little annoyed. The Cullens weren't like that. \"Hey,\" I finally said when he didn't speak. Jake pursed his lips, still hanging back from the door. His eyes flickered across the front of the house. I ground my teeth. \"She's not here. Do you need something?\" He hesitated. \"You're alone?\" \"Yes.\" I sighed. \"Can I talk to you a minute?\" \"Of course you can, Jacob. Come on in.\" Jacob glanced over his shoulder at his friends in the car. I saw Embry shake his head just a tiny bit. For some reason, this bugged me to no end. My teeth clenched together again. \"Chicken\" I mumbled under my breath. Jake's eyes flashed back to me, his thick, black brows pushing into a furious angle over \u00a0his deep-set eyes. His jaw set, and he marched\u2014there was no other way to describe the way he moved\u2014up the sidewalk and shrugged past me into the house. I locked gazes with first Jared and then Embry\u2014I didn't like the hard way they eyed me; did they really think I would let anything hurt Jacob?\u2014before I shut the door on them. Jacob was in the hall behind me, staring at the mess of blankets in the living room. \"Slumber party?\" he asked, his tone sarcastic. \"Yeah,\" I answered with the same level of acid. I didn't like Jacob when he acted this way. \"What's it to you? He wrinkled his nose again like he smelled something unpleasant. \"Where's your friend'?\" I could hear the quotation marks in his tone. \"She had some errands to run. Look, Jacob, what do you want?\" Something about the room seemed to make him edgier\u2014his long arms were quivering. He didn't answer my question. Instead he moved on to the kitchen, his restless eyes darting everywhere. I followed him. He paced back and forth along the short counter. \"Hey,\" I said, putting myself in his way. He stopped pacing and stared down at me. \"What's your problem?\" \"I don't like having to be here.\" That stung. I winced, and his eyes tightened. \"Then I'm sorry you had to come,\" I muttered. \"Why don't you tell me what you need so you can leave?\" \"I just have to ask you a couple of questions. It shouldn't take long. We have to get back for the funeral.\" \"Okay. Get it over with then.\" I was probably overdoing it with the antagonism, but I didn't want him to see how much this hurt. I knew I wasn't being fair. After all, I'd picked the <em>bloodsucker</em> over him last night. I'd hurt him first. He took a deep breath, and his trembling fingers were suddenly still. His face smoothed into a serene mask. \"One of the Cullens is staying here with you,\" he stated. \"Yes. Alice Cullen.\" He nodded thoughtfully. \"How long is she here for?\" \"As long as she wants to be.\" The belligerence was still there in my tone. \"It's an open invitation.\" \"Do you think you could\u2026 please\u2026 explain to her about the other one\u2014Victoria?\" I paled. \"I told her about that.\" He nodded. \"You should know that we can only watch our own lands with a Cullen here. You'll only be safe in La Push. I can't protect you here anymore.\" \"Okay,\" I said in a small voice. He looked away then, out the back windows. He didn't continue. \"Is that all?\" He kept his eyes on the glass as he answered. \"Just one more thing.\" I waited, but he didn't continue. \"Yes?\" I finally prompted. \"Are the rest of them coming back now?\" he asked in a cool, quiet voice. It reminded me of Sam's always calm manner. Jacob was becoming more like Sam\u2026 I wondered why that bothered me so much. Now I didn't speak. He looked back at my face with probing eyes. \"Well?\" he asked. He struggled to conceal the tension behind his serene expression. \"No.\" I said finally. Grudgingly. \"They aren't coming back.\" His expression didn't change. \"Okay. That's all.\" I glared at him, annoyance rekindled. \"Well, run along now. Go tell Sam that the scary monsters aren't coming to get you.\" \"Okay,\" he repeated, still calm. That seemed to be it. Jacob walked swiftly from the kitchen. I waited to hear the front door open, but I heard nothing. I could hear the clock over the stove ticking, and I marveled again at how quiet he'd become. What a disaster. How could I have alienated him so completely in such a short amount of time?  Would he forgive me when Alice was gone? What if he didn't? I slumped against the counter and buried my face in my hands. How had I made such a mess of everything? But what could I have done differently? Even in hindsight, I couldn't think of any better way, any perfect course of action. \"Bella\u2026 ?\" Jacob asked in a troubled voice. I pulled my face out of my hands to see Jacob hesitating in the kitchen doorway; he hadn't left when I'd thought. It was only when I saw the clear drops sparkling in my hands that I realized I was crying. Jacob's calm expression was gone; his face was anxious and unsure. He walked quickly back to stand in front of me, ducking his head so that his eyes were closer to being on the same level with mine. \"Did it again, didn't I?\" \"Did what?\" I asked, my voice cracking. \"Broke my promise. Sorry.\" \"'It\u2019s okay,\" I mumbled. \"I started it this time.\" His face twisted. \"I knew how you felt about them. It shouldn't have taken me by surprise like that.\" I could see the revulsion in his eyes. I wanted to explain to him what Alice was really like, to defend her against the judgments he'd made, but something warned me that now was not the time. So I just said, \"Sorry,\" again. \"Let's not worry about it, okay? She's just visiting, right? She'll leave, and things will go back to normal.\" \"Can't I be friends with you both at the same time?\" I asked, my voice not hiding an ounce of the hurt I felt. He shook his head slowly. \"No, I don't think you can.\" I sniffed and stared at his big feet. \"But you'll wait, right? You'll still be my friend, even though I love Alice, too?\" I didn't look up, afraid to see what he'd think of that last part. It took him a minute to answer, so I was probably right not to look. \"Yeah, I'll always be your friend,\" he said gruffly. \"No matter what you love.\" \"Promise?\" \"Promise.\" I felt his arms wind around me, and I leaned against his chest, still sniffling. \"This sucks.\" \"Yeah.\" Then he sniffed my hair and said, \"Ew.\" \"What?\" I demanded. I looked up to see that his nose was wrinkled again. \"Why does everyone keep doing that to me? I don't smell!\" He smiled a little. \"Yes, you do\u2014you smell like them. Blech. Too sweet\u2014sickly sweet. And\u2026 icy. It burns my nose.\" \"Really?\" That was strange. Alice smelled unbelievably wonderful. To a human, anyway. \"But why would Alice think I smelled, too, then?\" That wiped his smile away. \"Huh. Maybe I don't smell so good to her, either. Huh.\" \"Well, you both smell fine to me.\" I rested my head against him again. I was going to miss him terribly when he walked out my door. It was a nasty catch-22\u2014on the one hand, I wanted Alice to stay forever. I was going to die\u2014metaphorically\u2014when she left me. But how was I supposed to go without seeing Jake for any length of time? What a mess, I thought again. \"I'll miss you,\" Jacob whispered, echoing my thoughts. \"Every minute. I hope she leaves soon.\" \"It really doesn't have to be that way, Jake.\" He sighed. \"Yes, it really does. Bella. You\u2026 love her. So I'd better not get anywhere near her. I'm not sure that I'm even-tempered enough to handle that. Sam would be mad if I broke the treaty, and\"\u2014his voice turned sarcastic\u2014\"you probably wouldn't like it too much if I killed your friend.\" I recoiled from him when he said that, but he only tightened his arms, refusing to let me escape. \"There's no point in avoiding the truth. That's the way things are, Bells.\" \"I do not like the way things are.\" Jacob freed one arm so that he could cup his big brown hand under my chin and make me look at him. \"Yeah. It was easier when we were both human, wasn't it?\" I sighed. We stared at each other for a long moment. His hand smoldered against my skin. In my face, I knew there was nothing but wistful sadness\u2014I didn't want to have to say goodbye now, no matter for how short a time. At first his face reflected mine, but then, as neither of us looked away, his expression changed. He released me, lifting his other hand to brush his fingertips along my cheek, trailing them down to my jaw. I could feel his fingers tremble\u2014not with anger this time. He pressed his palm against my cheek, so that my face was trapped between his burning hands. \"Bella,\" he whispered. I was frozen. No! I hadn't made this decision yet. I didn't know if I could do this, and now I was out of time to think. But I would have been a fool if I thought rejecting him now would have no consequences. I stared back at him. He was not my Jacob, but he could be. His face was familiar and beloved. In so many real ways, I did love him. He was my comfort, my safe harbor. Right now, I could choose to have him belong to me. Alice was back for the moment, but that changed nothing. True love was forever lost. The prince was never coming back to kiss me awake from my enchanted sleep. I was not a princess, after all. So what was the fairy-tale protocol for other kisses? The mundane kind that didn't break any spells? Maybe it would be easy\u2014like holding his hand or having his arms around me. Maybe it would feel nice. Maybe it wouldn't feel like a betrayal. Besides, who was I betraying, anyway? Just \u00a0myself. Keeping his eyes on mine, Jacob began to bend his face toward me. And I was still absolutely undecided. .  The shrill ring of the phone made us both jump, but it did not break his focus. He took his hand from under my chin and reached over me to grab the receiver, but still held my face securely with the hand against my cheek. His dark eyes did not free mine. I was too muddled to react, even to take advantage of the distraction. \"Swan residence,\" Jacob said, his husky voice low and intense. Someone answered, and Jacob altered in an instant. He straightened up, and his hand dropped from my face. His eyes went flat, his face blank, and I would have bet the measly remainder of my college and that it was Alice. I recovered myself and held out my hand for the phone. Jacob ignored me. \"He's not here,\" Jacob said, and the words were menacing. There was some very short reply, a request for more information it seemed, because he added unwillingly, \"He's at the funeral.\" Then Jacob hung up the phone. \"Filthy <em>bloodsucker</em>,\" he muttered under his breath. The face he turned back to me was the bitter mask again. \"Who did you just hang up on?\" I gasped, infuriated. \"In my house, and on my phone?\" \"Easy! He hung up on me!\" \"He? Who was it?!\" He sneered the title. \"Dr. Carlisle Cullen.\" \"Why didn't you let me talk to him?!\" \"He didn't ask for you,\" Jacob said coldly. His face was smooth, expressionless, but his hands shook. \"He asked where Charlie was and I told him. I don't think I broke any rules of etiquette.\" \"You listen to me, Jacob Black\u2014\" But he obviously wasn't listening. He looked quickly over his shoulder, as if someone had called his name from the other room. His eyes went wide and his body stiff, then he started trembling. I listened too, automatically, but heard nothing. \"Bye, Bells,\" he spit out, and wheeled toward the front door. I ran after him. \"What is it?\" And then I ran into him, as he rocked back on his heels, cussing under his breath. He spun around again, knocking me sideways. I bobbled and fell to the floor, my legs tangled with his. \"Shoot, ow!\" I protested as he hurriedly jerked his legs free one at a time. I struggled to pull myself up as he darted for the back door; he suddenly froze again. Alice stood motionless at the foot of the stairs. \"Bella,\" she choked. I scrambled to my feet and lurched to her side. Her eyes were dazed and far away, her face drawn and whiter than bone. Her slim body trembled to an inner turmoil. \"Alice, what's wrong?\" I cried. I put my hands on her face, trying to calm her. Her eyes focused on mine abruptly, wide with pain. \"Edward,\" was all she whispered. My body reacted faster than my mind was able to catch up with the implications of her reply. I didn't at first understand why the room was spinning or where the hollow roar in my ears was coming from. My mind labored, unable to make sense of Alice's bleak face and how it could possibly relate to Edward, while my body was already swaying, seeking the relief of unconsciousness before the reality could hit me. The stairway tilted at the oddest angle. Jacob's furious voice was suddenly in my ear, hissing out a stream of profanities. I felt a vague disapproval. His new friends were clearly a bad influence. I was on the couch without understanding how I got there, and Jacob was still swearing. It felt like there was an earthquake\u2014the couch was shaking under me. \"What did you do to her?\" he demanded. Alice ignored him. \"Bella? Bella, snap out of it. We have to hurry.\" \"Stay back,\" Jacob warned. \"Calm down, Jacob Black,\" Alice ordered. \"You don't want to do that so close to her.\" \"I don't think I'll have any problem keeping my focus,\" he retorted, but his voice sounded a little cooler. \"Alice?\" My voice was weak. \"What happened?\" I asked, even though I didn't want to hear. \"I don't know,\" she suddenly wailed. \"What is he thinking?!\" I labored to pull myself up despite the dizziness. I realized it was Jacob's arm I was gripping for balance. He was the one shaking, not the couch. Alice was pulling a small silver phone from her bag when my eyes relocated her. Her fingers dialed the numbers so fast they were a blur. \"Rose, I need to talk to Carlisle now.\" Her voice whipped through the words. \"Fine, as soon as he's back. No, I'll be on a plane. Look, have you heard anything from Edward?\" Alice paused now, listening with an expression that grew more appalled every second. Her mouth opened into a little O of horror, and the phone shook in her hand. \"Why?\" she gasped. \"Why would you do that, Rosalie?\" Whatever the answer was, it made her jaw tighten in anger. Her eyes flashed and narrowed. \"Well, you're wrong on both counts, though, Rosalie, so that would be a problem, don't you think?\" she asked acidly. \"Yes, that's right. She's absolutely fine\u2014I was wrong\u2026 It's a long story\u2026 But you're wrong about that part, too, that's why I'm calling\u2026 Yes, that's exactly what I saw.\" Alice's voice was very hard and her lips were pulled back from her teeth.  \"It's a bit late for that, Rose.\u00a0 Save your remorse for someone who believes it.\" Alice snapped the phone shut with a sharp twist of her fingers. Her eyes were tortured as she turned to face me. \"Alice,\" I blurted out quickly. I couldn't let her speak yet. I needed a few more seconds before she spoke and her words destroyed what was left of my life. \"Alice, Carlisle is back, though. He called just before\u2026\" She stared at me blankly. \"How long ago?\" she asked in a hollow voice. \"Half a minute before you showed up.\" \"What did he say?\" She really focused now, waiting for my answer. \"I didn't talk to him.\" My eyes flickered to Jacob. Alice turned her penetrating gaze on him. He flinched, but held his place next to me. He sit awkwardly, almost as if he were trying to shield me with his body. \"He asked for Charlie, and I told him Charlie wasn't here,\" Jacob muttered resentfully. \"Is that everything?\" Alice demanded, her voice like ice. \"Then he hung up on me,\" Jacob spit back. A tremor rolled down his spine, shaking me with it.  \"You told him Charlie was at the funeral,\" I reminded him. Alice jerked her head back toward me \"What were his exact words?\" \"He said, 'He's not here,' and when Carlisle asked where Charlie was, Jacob said, 'At the funeral.'\" Alice moaned and sank to her knees. \"Tell me Alice,\" I whispered. \"That wasn't Carlisle on the phone,\" she said hopelessly. \"Are you calling me a liar?\" Jacob snarled from beside me. Alice ignored him, focusing on my bewildered face. \"It was Edward.\" The words were just a choked whisper. \"He thinks you're dead.\" My mind started to work again. These words weren't the ones I'd been afraid of, and the relief cleared my head. \"Rosalie told him I killed myself, didn't she?\" I said, sighing as I relaxed. \"Yes,\" Alice admitted, her eyes flashing hard again. \"In her defense, she did believe it. They rely on my sight far too much for something that works so imperfectly. But for her to track him down to tell him this! Didn't she realize\u2026 or care\u2026 ?\" Her voice faded away in horror. \"And when Edward called here, he thought Jacob meant my funeral,\" I realized. It stung to know how close I'd been, just inches away from his voice. My nails dug into Jacob's arm, but he didn't flinch. Alice looked at me strangely. \"You're not upset,\" she whispered. \"Well, it's really rotten timing, but it will all get straightened out. The next time he calls, someone will tell him\u2026 what\u2026 really\u2026\" I trailed off. Her gaze strangled the words in my throat. Why was she so panicked? Why was her face twisting now with pity and horror? What was it she had said to Rosalie on the phone just now? Something about what she'd seen\u2026 and Rosalie's remorse; Rosalie would never feel remorse for anything that happened to me. But if she'd hurt her family, hurt her brother\u2026 \"Bella,\" Alice whispered. \"Edward won't call again. He believed her.\" \"I. Don't. Understand.\" My mouth framed each word in silence. I couldn't push the air out to actually say the words that would make her explain what that meant. \"He's going to Italy.\" It took the length of one heartbeat for me to comprehend. When Edward's voice came back to me now, it was not the perfect imitation of my \u00a0delusions. It was just the weak, flat tone of my memories. But the words alone were enough to shred through my chest and leave it gaping open. Words from a time when I would have bet everything that I owned or could borrow on that fact that he loved me. Well, I wasn't going to live without you, he'd said as we watched Romeo and Juliet die, here in this very room. But I wasn't sure how to do it\u2026 I knew Emmett and Jasper would never help\u2026 so I was thinking maybe I would go to Italy and do something to provoke the Volturi\u2026 You don't irritate them. Not unless you want to die. Not unless you want to die. \"NO!\" The half-shrieked denial was so loud after the whispered words, it made us all jump. I felt the blood rushing to my face as I realized what she'd seen. \"No! No, no, no! He can't! He can't do that!\" \"He made up his mind as soon as your friend confirmed that it was too late to save you.\" \"But he\u2026 he left! He didn't want me anymore! What difference does it make now? He knew I would die sometime!\" \"I don't think he ever planned to outlive you by long,\" Alice said quietly. \"How dare he!\" I screamed. I was on my feet now, and Jacob rose uncertainly to put himself between Alice and me again. \"Oh, get out of the way, Jacob!\" I elbowed my way around his trembling body with desperate impatience. \"What do we do?\" I begged Alice. There had to be something. \"Can't we call him? Can Carlisle?\" She was shaking her head. \"That was the first thing I tried. He left his phone in a trash can in Rio\u2014someone answered it\u2026\" she whispered. \"You said before we had to hurry. Hurry how? Let's do it, whatever it is!\" \"Bella, I\u2014I don't think I can ask you to\u2026\" She trailed off in indecision. \"Ask me!\" I commanded. She put her hands on my shoulders, holding me in place, her fingers flexing sporadically to emphasize her words. \"We may already be too late. I saw him going to the Volturi\u2026 and asking to die.\" We both cringed, and my eyes were suddenly blind. I blinked feverishly at the tears. \"It all depends on what they choose. I can't see that till they make a decision. \"But if they say no, and they might\u2014Aro is fond of Carlisle, and wouldn't want to offend him\u2014Edward has a backup plan. They're very protective of their city. If Edward does something to upset the peace, he thinks they'll act to stop him. And he's right. They will.\" I stared at her with my jaw clenched in frustration. I'd heard nothing yet that would explain why we were still standing here. \"So if they agree to grant his favor, we're too late. If they say no, and he comes up with a plan to offend them quickly enough, we're too late. If he gives into his more theatrical tendencies\u2026 we might have time.\" \"Let's go!\" \"Listen, Bella! Whether we are in time or not, we will be in the heart of the Volturi city. I will be considered his accomplice if he is successful. You will be a human who not only knows too much, but also smells too good. There's a very good chance that they will eliminate us all\u2014though in your case it won't be punishment so much as dinnertime.\" \"This is what's keeping us here?\" I asked in disbelief. \"I'll go alone if you're afraid.\" I mentally tabulated what money was left in my account, and wondered if Alice would lend me the rest. \"I'm only afraid of getting you killed.\" I snorted in disgust. \"I almost get myself killed on a daily basis! Tell me what I need to do!\" \"You write a note to Charlie. I'll call the airlines.\" \"Charlie,\" I gasped. Not that my presence was protecting him, but could I leave him here alone to face\u2026 \"I'm not going to let anything happen to Charlie.\" Jacob's low voice was gruff and angry. \"Screw the treaty.\" I glanced up at him, and he scowled at my panicked expression. \"Hurry, Bella,\" Alice interrupted urgently. I ran to the kitchen, yanking the drawers open and throwing the contents all over the floor as I searched for a pen. A smooth, brown hand held one out to me. \"Thanks,\" I mumbled, pulling the cap off with my teeth. He silently handed me the pad of paper we wrote phone messages on. I tore off the top sheet and threw it over my shoulder. Dad, I wrote. I'm with Alice. Edward's in trouble. You can ground me when I get back. I know it's a bad time. So sorry. Love you so much. Bella. \"Don't go,\" Jacob whispered. The anger was all gone now that Alice was out of sight. I wasn't about to waste time arguing with him. \"Please, please, please take care of \u00a0Charlie,\" I said as I dashed back out to the front room. Alice was waiting in the doorway with a bag over her shoulder. \"Get your wallet\u2014you'll need ID. Please tell me you have a passport. I don't have time to forge one.\" I nodded and then raced up the stairs, my knees weak with gratitude that my mother had wanted to marry Phil on a beach in Mexico. Of course, like all her plans, it had fallen through. But not before I'd made all the practical arrangements I could for her. I tore through my room. I stuffed my old wallet, a clean T-shirt, and sweatpants into my backpack, and then threw my toothbrush on top. I hurled myself back down the stairs. The sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu was nearly stifling by this point. At least, unlike the last time\u2014when I'd run away from Forks to escape thirsty vampires rather than to find them\u2014I wouldn't have to say goodbye to Charlie in person. Jacob and Alice were locked in some kind of confrontation in front of the open door, standing so far apart you wouldn't assume at first that they were having a conversation. Neither one seemed to notice my noisy reappearance. \"You might control yourself on occasion, but these leeches you're taking her to\u2014\" Jacob was furiously accusing her. \"Yes. You're right, dog.\" Alice was snarling, too. \"The Volturi are the very essence of our kind\u2014they're the reason your hair stands on end when you smell me. They are the substance of your nightmares, the dread behind your instincts. I'm not unaware of that.\" \"And you take her to them like a bottle of wine for a party!\" he shouted. \"You think she'd be better off if I left her here alone, with Victoria stalking her?\" \"We can handle the redhead.\" \"Then why is she still hunting?\" Jacob growled, and a shudder rippled through his torso. \"Stop that!\" I shouted at them both, wild with impatience. \"Argue when we get back, let's \u00a0go!\" Alice turned for the car, disappearing in her haste. I hurried after her, pausing automatically to turn and lock the door. Jacob caught my arm with a shivering hand. \"Please, Bella. I'm begging.\" His dark eyes were glistening with tears. A lump filled my throat. \"Jake, I have to\u2014\" \"You don't, though. You really don't. You could stay here with me. You could stay alive. For Charlie. For me.\" The engine of Carlisle's Mercedes purred; the rhythm of the thrumming spiked when Alice revved it impatiently. I shook my head, tears spattering from my eyes with the sharp motion. I pulled my arm free, and he didn't fight me. \"Don't die, Bella,\" he choked out. \"Don't go. Don't.\" What if I never saw him again? The thought pushed me past the silent tears; a sob broke out from my chest. I threw my arms around his waist and hugged for one too-short moment, burying my tear-wet face against his chest. He put his big hand on the back of my hair, as if to hold me there. \"Bye, Jake.\" I pulled his hand from my hair, and kissed his palm. I couldn't bear to look at his face. \"Sorry,\" I whispered. Then I spun and raced for the car. The door on the passenger side was open and waiting. I threw my backpack over the headrest and slid in, slamming the door behind me. \"Take care of Charlie!\" I turned to shout out the window, but Jacob was nowhere in sight. As Alice stomped on the gas and\u2014with the tires screeching like human screams\u2014spun us around to face the road, I caught sight of a shred of white near the edge of the trees. A piece of a shoe.",

            "en": "4. NATURE I WAS HAVING A BAD WEEK. I knew that essentially nothing had changed. Okay, so Victoria had not given up, but had I ever dreamed for one moment that she had? Her reappearance had only confirmed what I\u2019d already known. No reason for fresh panic. In theory. Not panicking was easier said than done. Graduation was only a few weeks away, but I wondered if it wasn\u2019t a little foolish to sit around, weak and tasty, waiting for the next disaster. It seemed too dangerous to be human \u2014 just begging for trouble. Someone like me shouldn\u2019t be human. Someone with my luck ought to be a little less helpless. But no one would listen to me. Carlisle had said, \u201cThere are seven of us, Bella. And with Alice on our side, I don\u2019t think Victoria\u2019s going to catch us off guard. I think it\u2019s important, for Charlie\u2019s sake, that we stick with the original plan.\u201d Esme had said, \u201cWe\u2019d never allow anything to happen to you, sweetheart. You know that. Please don\u2019t be anxious.\u201d And then she\u2019d kissed my forehead. Emmett had said, \u201cI\u2019m really glad Edward didn\u2019t kill you. Everything\u2019s so much more fun with you around.\u201d Rosalie had glared at him. Alice had rolled her eyes and said, \u201cI\u2019m offended. You\u2019re not honestly worried about this, are you?\u201d \u201cIf it\u2019s no big deal, then why did Edward drag me to Florida?\u201d I\u2019d demanded. \u201cHaven\u2019t you noticed yet, Bella, that Edward is just the teeniest bit prone to overreaction?\u201d Jasper had silently erased all the panic and tension in my body with his curious talent of controlling emotional atmospheres. I\u2019d felt reassured, and let them talk me out of my desperate pleading. Of course, that calm had worn off as soon as Edward and I had walked out of the room. So the consensus was that I was just supposed to forget that a deranged vampire was stalking me, intent on my death. Go about my business. I did try. And surprisingly, there were other things almost as stressful to dwell on besides my status on the endangered species list. . . . Because Edward\u2019s response had been the most frustrating of them all. \u201cThat\u2019s between you and Carlisle,\u201d he\u2019d said. \u201cOf course, you know that I\u2019m willing to make it between you and me at any time that you wish. You know my condition.\u201d And he had smiled angelically. Ugh. I did know his condition. Edward had promised that he would change me himself whenever I wanted . . . just as long as I was married to him first. Sometimes I wondered if he was only pretending that he couldn\u2019t read my mind. How else had he struck upon the one condition that I would have trouble accepting? The one condition that would slow me down. All in all, a very bad week. And today was the worst day in it. It was always a bad day when Edward was away. Alice had foreseen nothing out of the ordinary this weekend, and so I\u2019d insisted that he take the opportunity to go hunting with his brothers. I knew how it bored him to hunt the easy, nearby prey. \u201cGo have fun,\u201d I\u2019d told him. \u201cBag a few mountain lions for me.\u201d I would never admit to him how hard it was for me when he was gone \u2014 how it brought back the abandonment nightmares. If he knew that, it would make him feel horrible and he would be afraid to ever leave me, even for the most necessary reasons. It had been like that in the beginning, when he\u2019d first returned from Italy. His golden eyes had turned black and he\u2019d suffered from his thirst more than it was already necessary that he suffer. So I put on a brave face and all but kicked him out the door whenever Emmett and Jasper wanted to go. I think he saw through me, though. A little. This morning there had been a note left on my pillow: I\u2019ll be back so soon you won\u2019t have time to miss me. Look after my heart \u2014 I\u2019ve left it with you. So now I had a big empty Saturday with nothing but my morning shift at Newton\u2019s Olympic Outfitters to distract me. And, of course, the oh-so-comforting promise from Alice. \u201cI\u2019m staying close to home to hunt. I\u2019ll only be fifteen minutes away if you need me. I\u2019ll keep an eye out for trouble.\u201d Translation: don\u2019t try anything funny just because Edward is gone. Alice was certainly just as capable of crippling my truck as Edward was. I tried to look on the bright side. After work, I had plans to help Angela with her announcements, so that would be a distraction. And Charlie was in an excellent mood due to Edward\u2019s absence, so I might as well enjoy that while it lasted. Alice would spend the night with me if I was pathetic enough to ask her to. And then tomorrow, Edward would be home. I would survive. Not wanting to be ridiculously early for work, I ate my breakfast slowly, one Cheerio at a time. Then, when I\u2019d washed the dishes, I arranged the magnets on the fridge into a perfect line. Maybe I was developing obsessive-compulsive disorder. The last two magnets \u2014 round black utilitarian pieces that were my favorites because they could hold ten sheets of paper to the fridge without breaking a sweat \u2014 did not want to cooperate with my fixation. Their polarities were reversed; every time I tried to line the last one up, the other jumped out of place. For some reason \u2014 impending mania, perhaps \u2014 this really irritated me. Why couldn\u2019t they just play nice? Stupid with stubbornness, I kept shoving them together as if I was expecting them to suddenly give up. I could have flipped one over, but that felt like losing. Finally, exasperated at myself more than the magnets, I pulled them from the fridge and held them together with two hands. It took a little effort \u2014 they were strong enough to put up a fight \u2014 but I forced them to coexist side-by-side. \u201cSee,\u201d I said out loud \u2014 talking to inanimate objects, never a good sign \u2014 \u201cThat\u2019s not so horrible, is it?\u201d I stood there like an idiot for a second, not quite able to admit that I wasn\u2019t having any lasting effect against scientific principles. Then, with a sigh, I put the magnets back on the fridge, a foot apart. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to be so inflexible,\u201d I muttered. It was still too early, but I decided I\u2019d better get out of the house before the inanimate objects started talking back. When I got to Newton\u2019s, Mike was methodically dry mopping the aisles while his mom arranged a new counter display. I caught them in the middle of an argument, unaware that I had arrived. \u201cBut it\u2019s the only time that Tyler can go,\u201d Mike complained. \u201cYou said after graduation \u2014 \u201cYou\u2019re just going to have to wait,\u201d Mrs. Newton snapped. \u201cYou and Tyler can think of something else to do. You are not going to Seattle until the police stop whatever it is that is going on there. I know Beth Crowley has told Tyler the same thing, so don\u2019t act like I\u2019m the bad guy \u2014 oh, good morning, Bella,\u201d she said when she caught sight of me, brightening her tone quickly. \u201cYou\u2019re early.\u201d Karen Newton was the last person I\u2019d think to ask for help in an outdoor sports equipment store. Her perfectly highlighted blond hair was always smoothed into an elegant twist on the back of her neck, her fingernails were polished by professionals, as were her toenails \u2014 visible through the strappy high heels that didn\u2019t resemble anything Newton\u2019s offered on the long row of hiking boots. \u201cLight traffic,\u201d I joked as I grabbed my hideous fluorescent orange vest out from under the counter. I was surprised that Mrs. Newton was as worked up about this Seattle thing as Charlie. I\u2019d thought he was going to extremes. \u201cWell, er . . .\u201d Mrs. Newton hesitated for a moment, playing uncomfortably with a stack of flyers she was arranging by the register. I stopped with one arm in my vest. I knew that look. When I\u2019d let the Newtons know that I wouldn\u2019t be working here this summer \u2014 abandoning them in their busiest season, in effect \u2014 they\u2019d started training Katie Marshall to take my place. They couldn\u2019t really afford both of us on the payroll at the same time, so when it looked like a slow day . . . \u201cI was going to call,\u201d Mrs. Newton continued. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re expecting a ton of business today.\u00a0 Mike and I can probably handle things. I\u2019m sorry you got up and drove out. . . .\u201d On a normal day, I would be ecstatic with this turn of events. Today . . . not so much. \u201cOkay,\u201d I sighed. My shoulders slumped. What was I going to do now? \u201cThat\u2019s not fair, Mom,\u201d Mike said. \u201cIf Bella wants to work \u2014\u201d \u201cNo, it\u2019s okay, Mrs. Newton. Really, Mike. I\u2019ve got finals to study for and stuff. . . .\u201d I didn\u2019t want to be a source of familial discord when they were already arguing. \u201cThanks, Bella. Mike, you missed aisle four. Um, Bella, do you mind throwing these flyers in a Dumpster on the way out? I told the girl who left them here that I\u2019d put them on the counter, but I really don\u2019t have the room.\u201d \u201cSure, no problem.\u201d I put my vest away, and then tucked the flyers under my arm and headed out into the misty rain. The Dumpster was around the side of Newton\u2019s, next to where we employees were supposed to park. I shuffled along, kicking pebbles petulantly on my way. I was about to fling the stack of bright yellow papers into the trash when the heading printed in bold across the top caught my eye. One word in particular seized my attention. I clutched the papers in both hands as I stared at the picture beneath the caption. A lump rose in my throat. SAVE THE OLYMPIC WOLF Under the words, there was a detailed drawing of a wolf in front of a fir tree, its head thrown back in the act of baying at the moon. It was a disconcerting picture; something about the wolf\u2019s plaintive posture made him look forlorn. Like he was howling in grief. And then I was running to my truck, the flyers still locked in my grip. Fifteen minutes \u2014 that\u2019s all I had. But it should be long enough. It was only fifteen minutes to La Push, and surely I would cross the boundary line a few minutes before I hit the town. My truck roared to life without any difficulty.  Alice couldn\u2019t have seen me doing this, because I hadn\u2019t been planning it. A snap decision, that was the key! And as long as I moved fast enough, I should be able to capitalize on it. I\u2019d thrown the damp flyers in my haste and they were scattered in a bright mess across the passenger seat \u2014 a hundred bolded captions, a hundred dark howling wolves outlined against the yellow background. I barreled down the wet highway, turning the windshield wipers on high and ignoring the groan of the ancient engine. Fifty-five was the most I could coax out of my truck, and I prayed it would be enough. I had no clue where the boundary line was, but I began to feel safer as I passed the first houses outside La Push. This must be beyond where Alice was allowed to follow. I\u2019d call her when I got to Angela\u2019s this afternoon, I reasoned, so that she\u2019d know I was fine. There was no reason for her to get worked up. She didn\u2019t need to be mad at me \u2014 Edward would be angry enough for two when he got back. My truck was positively wheezing by the time it grated to a stop in front of the familiar faded red house. The lump came back to my throat as I stared at the little place that had once been my refuge. It had been so long since I\u2019d been here. Before I could cut the engine, Jacob was standing in the door, his face blank with shock. In the sudden silence when the truck-roar died, I heard him gasp. \u201cBella?\u201d \u201cHey, Jake!\u201d \u201cBella!\u201d he yelled back, and the smile I\u2019d been waiting for stretched across his face like the sun breaking free of the clouds. His teeth gleamed bright against his russet skin. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it!\u201d He ran to the truck and half-yanked me through the open door, and then we were both jumping up and down like kids. \u201cHow did you get here?\u201d \u201cI snuck out!\u201d \u201cAwesome!\u201d \u201cHey, Bella!\u201d Billy had rolled himself into the doorway to see what all the commotion was about. \u201cHey, Bil \u2014!\u201d Just then my air choked off \u2014 Jacob grabbed me up in a bear hug too tight to breathe and swung me around in a circle. \u201cWow, it\u2019s good to see you here!\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t . . . breathe,\u201d I gasped. He laughed and put me down. \u201cWelcome back, Bella,\u201d he said, grinning. And the way he said the words made it sound like welcome home . We started walking, too keyed up to sit still in the house. Jacob was practically bouncing as he moved, and I had to remind him a few times that my legs weren\u2019t ten feet long. As we walked, I felt myself settling into another version of myself, the self I had been with Jacob. A little younger, a little less responsible. Someone who might, on occasion, do something really stupid for no good reason. Our exuberance lasted through the first few topics of conversation: how we were doing, what we were up to, how long I had, and what had brought me here. When I hesitantly told him about the wolf flyer, his bellowing laugh echoed back from the trees. But then, as we ambled past the back of the store and shoved through the thick scrub that ringed the far edge of First Beach, we got to the hard parts. All too soon we had to talk about the reasons behind our long separation, and I watched as the face of my friend hardened into the bitter mask that was already too familiar. \u201cSo what\u2019s the story, anyway?\u201d Jacob asked me, kicking a piece of driftwood out of his way with too much force. It sailed over the sand and then clattered against the rocks. \u201cI mean, since the last time we . . . well, before, you know . . .\u201d He struggled for the words. He took a deep breath and tried again. \u201cWhat I\u2019m asking is . . . everything is just back to the way it was before he left? You forgave him for all of that?\u201d I took a deep breath. \u201cThere was nothing to forgive.\u201d I wanted to skip past this part, the betrayals, the accusations, but I knew that we had to talk it through before we\u2019d be able to move on to anything else. Jacob\u2019s face puckered up like he\u2019d just licked a lemon. \u201cI wish Sam had taken a picture when he found you that night last September. It would be exhibit A.\u201d \u201cNobody\u2019s on trial.\u201d \u201cMaybe somebody should be.\u201d \u201cNot even you would blame him for leaving, if you knew the reason why.\u201d He glared at me for a few seconds. \u201cOkay,\u201d he challenged acidly. \u201cAmaze me.\u201d His hostility was wearing on me \u2014 chafing against the raw; it hurt to have him angry with me. It reminded me of the bleak afternoon, long ago, when \u2014 under orders from Sam \u2014 he\u2019d told me we couldn\u2019t be friends. I took a second to compose myself. \u201cEdward left me last fall because he didn\u2019t think I should be hanging out with vampires. He thought it would be healthier for me if he left.\u201d Jacob did a double take. He had to scramble for a minute. Whatever he\u2019d been planning to say, it clearly no longer applied. I was glad he didn\u2019t know the catalyst behind Edward\u2019s decision. I could only imagine what he\u2019d think if he knew Jasper had tried to kill me. \u201cHe came back, though, didn\u2019t he?\u201d Jacob muttered. \u201cToo bad he can\u2019t stick to a decision.\u201d \u201cIf you remember,I went and got him .\u201d Jacob stared at me for a moment, and then he backed off. His face relaxed, and his voice was calmer when he spoke. \u201cThat\u2019s true. So I never did get the story. What happened?\u201d I hesitated, biting my lip. \u201cIs it a secret?\u201d His voice took on a taunting edge. \u201cAre you not allowed to tell me?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I snapped. \u201cIt\u2019s just a really long story.\u201d Jacob smiled, arrogant, and turned to walk up the beach, expecting me to follow. It was no fun being with Jacob if he was going to act like this. I trailed behind him automatically, not sure if I shouldn\u2019t turn around and leave. I was going to have to face Alice, though, when I got home. . . . I supposed I wasn\u2019t in any rush. Jacob walked to a huge, familiar piece of driftwood \u2014 an entire tree, roots and all, bleached white and beached deep in the sand; it was our tree, in a way. Jacob sat down on the natural bench, and patted the space next to him. \u201cI don\u2019t mind long stories. Is there any action?\u201d I rolled my eyes as I sat next to him. \u201cThere\u2019s some action,\u201d I allowed. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be real horror without action.\u201d \u201cHorror!\u201d I scoffed. \u201cCan you listen, or will you be interrupting me with rude comments about my friends?\u201d He pretended to lock his lips and then threw the invisible key over his shoulder. I tried not to smile, and failed. \u201cI\u2019ll have to start with the stuff you were already there for,\u201d I decided, working to organize the stories in my head before I began. Jacob raised his hand. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand much that was going on at the time.\u201d \u201cYeah, well, it gets complicated, so pay attention. You know how Alice sees things?\u201d I took his scowl \u2014 the wolves weren\u2019t thrilled that the legends of vampires possessing supernatural gifts were true \u2014 for a yes, and proceeded with the account of my race through Italy to rescue Edward. I kept it as succinct as possible \u2014 leaving out anything that wasn\u2019t essential. I tried to read Jacob\u2019s reactions, but his face was enigmatic as I explained how Alice had seen Edward plan to kill himself when he\u2019d heard that I was dead. Sometimes Jacob seemed so deep in thought, I wasn\u2019t sure if he was listening. He only interrupted one time. \u201cThe fortune-telling <em>bloodsucker</em> can\u2019t see us?\u201d he echoed, his face both fierce and gleeful. \u201cSeriously? That\u2019s excellent !\u201d I clenched my teeth together, and we sat in silence, his face expectant as he waited for me to continue. I glared at him until he realized his mistake. \u201cOops!\u201d he said. \u201cSorry.\u201d He locked his lips again. His response was easier to read when I got to the part about the Volturi. His teeth clenched together, goose bumps rose on his arms, and his nostrils flared. I didn\u2019t go into specifics, I just told him that Edward had talked us out of trouble, without revealing the promise we\u2019d had to make, or the visit we were anticipating. Jacob didn\u2019t need to have my nightmares. \u201cNow you know the whole story,\u201d I concluded. \u201cSo it\u2019s your turn to talk. What happened while I was with my mom this weekend?\u201d I knew Jacob would give me more details than Edward had. He wasn\u2019t afraid of scaring me. Jacob leaned forward, instantly animated. \u201cSo Embry and Quil and I were running patrol on Saturday night, just routine stuff, when out of nowhere \u2014 bam!\u201d He threw his arms out, impersonating an explosion. \u201cThere it is \u2014 a fresh trail, not fifteen minutes old. Sam wanted us to wait for him, but I didn\u2019t know you were gone, and I didn\u2019t know if your bloodsuckers were keeping an eye on you or not. So we took off after her at full speed, but she\u2019d crossed the treaty line before we caught up. We spread out along the line, hoping she\u2019d cross back over. It was frustrating, let me tell you.\u201d He wagged his head and his hair \u2014 growing out from the short crop he\u2019d adopted when he\u2019d joined the pack \u2014 flopped into his eyes. \u201cWe ended up too far south. The Cullens chased her back to our side just a few miles north of us. Would have been the perfect ambush if we\u2019d known where to wait.\u201d He shook his head, grimacing now. \u201cThat\u2019s when it got dicey. Sam and the others caught up to her before we did, but she was dancing right along the line, and the whole coven was right there on the other side. The big one, what\u2019s-his-name \u2014\u201d \u201cEmmett.\u201d \u201cYeah, him. He made a lunge for her, but that redhead is fast! He flew right behind her and almost rammed into Paul. So, Paul . . . well, you know Paul.\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cLost his focus. Can\u2019t say that I blame him \u2014 the big <em>bloodsucker</em> was right on top of him. He sprang \u2014 hey, don\u2019t give me that look. The vampire was on our land.\u201d I tried to compose my face so that he would go on. My nails were digging into my palms with the stress of the story, even though I knew it had turned out fine. \u201cAnyway, Paul missed, and the big one got back on his side. But by then the, er, well the, uh, blonde . . .\u201d Jacob\u2019s expression was a comical mix of disgust and unwilling admiration as he tried to come up with a word to describe Edward\u2019s sister. \u201cRosalie.\u201d \u201cWhatever. She got real territorial, so Sam and I fell back to get Paul\u2019s flanks. Then their leader and the other blond male \u2014\u201d \u201cCarlisle and Jasper.\u201d He gave me an exasperated look. \u201cYou know I don\u2019t really care. Anyway, so Carlisle spoke to Sam, trying to calm things down. Then it was weird, because everyone got really calm really fast. It was that other one you told me about, messing with our heads. But even though we knew what he was doing, we couldn\u2019t not be calm.\u201d \u201cYeah, I know how it feels.\u201d \u201cReally annoying, that\u2019s how it feels. Only you can\u2019t be annoyed until afterwards.\u201d He shook his head angrily. \u201cSo Sam and the head vamp agreed that Victoria was the priority, and we started after her again.  Carlisle gave us the line, so that we could follow the scent properly, but then she hit the cliffs just north of Makah country, right where the line hugs the coast for a few miles. She took off into the water again. The big one and the calm one wanted permission to cross the line to go after her, but of course we said no.\u201d \u201cGood. I mean, you were being stupid, but I\u2019m glad. Emmett\u2019s never cautious enough. He could have gotten hurt.\u201d Jacob snorted. \u201cSo did your vampire tell you we attacked for no reason and his totally innocent coven \u2014\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I interrupted. \u201cEdward told me the same story, just without quite as many details.\u201d \u201cHuh,\u201d Jacob said under his breath, and he bent over to pick up a rock from among the millions of pebbles at our feet. With a casual flick, he sent it flying a good hundred meters out into the bay. \u201cWell, she\u2019ll be back, I guess. We\u2019ll get another shot at her.\u201d I shuddered; of course she would be back. Would Edward really tell me next time? I wasn\u2019t sure. I\u2019d have to keep an eye on Alice, to look for the signs that the pattern was about to repeat. . . . Jacob didn\u2019t seem to notice my reaction. He was staring across the waves with a thoughtful expression on his face, his broad lips pursed. \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d I asked after a long, quiet time. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about what you told me. About when the fortune-teller saw you cliff jumping and thought you\u2019d committed suicide, and how it all got out of control. . . . Do you realize that if you had just waited for me like you were supposed to, then the bl \u2014Alice wouldn\u2019t have been able to see you jump? Nothing would have changed. We\u2019d probably be in my garage right now, like any other Saturday. There wouldn\u2019t be any vampires in Forks, and you and me . . .\u201d He trailed off, deep in thought. It was disconcerting the way he said this, like it would be a good thing to have no vampires in Forks. My heart thumped unevenly at the emptiness of the picture he painted. \u201cEdward would have come back anyway.\u201d \u201cAre you sure about that?\u201d he asked, belligerent again as soon as I spoke Edward\u2019s name. \u201cBeing apart . . . It didn\u2019t work out so well for either of us.\u201d He started to say something, something angry from his expression, but he stopped himself, took a breath, and began again. \u201cDid you know Sam is mad at you?\u201d \u201cMe?\u201d It took me a second. \u201cOh. I see. He thinks they would have stayed away if I wasn\u2019t here.\u201d \u201cNo. That\u2019s not it.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s his problem then?\u201d Jacob leaned down to scoop up another rock. He turned it over and over in his fingers; his eyes were riveted on the black stone while he spoke in a low voice. \u201cWhen Sam saw . . . how you were in the beginning, when Billy told them how Charlie worried when you didn\u2019t get better, and then when you started jumping off cliffs . . .\u201d I made a face. No one was ever going to let me forget that. Jacob\u2019s eyes flashed up to mine. \u201cHe thought you were the one person in the world with as much reason to hate the Cullens as he does. Sam feels sort of . . . betrayed that you would just let them back into your life like they never hurt you.\u201d I didn\u2019t believe for a second that Sam was the only one who felt that way. And the acid in my voice now was for both of them. \u201cYou can tell Sam to go right to \u2014\u201d \u201cLook at that,\u201d Jacob interrupted me, pointing to an eagle in the act of plummeting down toward the ocean from an incredible height. It checked itself at the last minute, only its talons breaking the surface of the waves, just for an instant. Then it flapped away, its wings straining against the load of the huge fish it had snagged. \u201cYou see it everywhere,\u201d Jacob said, his voice suddenly distant. \u201cNature taking its course \u2014 hunter and prey, the endless cycle of life and death.\u201d I didn\u2019t understand the point of the nature lecture; I guessed that he was just trying to change the subject. But then he looked down at me with dark humor in his eyes. \u201cAnd yet, you don\u2019t see the fish trying to plant a kiss on the eagle. You never see that .\u201d He grinned a mocking grin. I grinned back tightly, though the acid taste was still in my mouth. \u201cMaybe the fish was trying,\u201d I suggested. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell what a fish is thinking. Eagles are good-looking birds, you know.\u201d \u201cIs that what it comes down to?\u201d His voice was abruptly sharper. \u201cGood looks?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be stupid, Jacob.\u201d \u201cIs it the money, then?\u201d he persisted. \u201cThat\u2019s nice,\u201d I muttered, getting up from the tree. \u201cI\u2019m flattered that you think so much of me.\u201d I turned my back on him and paced away. \u201cAw, don\u2019t get mad.\u201d He was right behind me; he caught my wrist and spun me around. \u201cI\u2019m serious!\u00a0 I\u2019m trying to understand here, and I\u2019m coming up blank.\u201d His eyebrows pushed together angrily, and his eyes were black in their deep shadow. \u201cI love him . Not because he\u2019s beautiful or because he\u2019s rich !\u201d I spat the word at Jacob. \u201cI\u2019d much rather he weren\u2019t either one. It would even out the gap between us just a little bit \u2014 because he\u2019d still be the most loving and unselfish and brilliant and decent person I\u2019ve ever met. Of course I love him. How hard is that to understand?\u201d \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to understand.\u201d \u201cPlease enlighten me, then, Jacob.\u201d I let the sarcasm flow thick. \u201cWhat is a valid reason for someone to love someone else? Since apparently I\u2019m doing it wrong.\u201d \u201cI think the best place to start would be to look within your own species. That usually works.\u201d \u201cWell, that just sucks!\u201d I snapped. \u201cI guess I\u2019m stuck with Mike Newton after all.\u201d Jacob flinched back and bit his lip. I could see that my words had hurt him, but I was too mad to feel bad about that yet. He dropped my wrist and folded his arms across his chest, turning from me to glare toward the ocean. \u201cI\u2019m human,\u201d he muttered, his voice almost inaudible. \u201cYou\u2019re not as human as Mike,\u201d I continued ruthlessly. \u201cDo you still think that\u2019s the most important consideration?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not the same thing.\u201d Jacob didn\u2019t look away from the gray waves. \u201cI didn\u2019t choose this.\u201d I laughed once in disbelief. \u201cDo you think Edward did? He didn\u2019t know what was happening to him any more than you did. He didn\u2019t exactly sign up for this.\u201d Jacob was shaking his head back and forth with a small, quick movement. \u201cYou know, Jacob, you\u2019re awfully self-righteous \u2014 considering that you\u2019re a werewolf and all.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not the same,\u201d Jacob repeated, glowering at me. \u201cI don\u2019t see why not. You could be a bit more understanding about the Cullens. You have no idea how truly good they are \u2014 to the core, Jacob.\u201d He frowned more deeply. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t exist. Their existence goes against nature.\u201d I stared at him for a long moment with one eyebrow raised incredulously. It was a while before he noticed. \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cSpeaking of unnatural . . . ,\u201d I hinted. \u201cBella,\u201d he said, his voice slow and different. Aged. I realized that he sounded suddenly older than me \u2014 like a parent or a teacher. \u201cWhat I am was born in me. It\u2019s a part of who I am, who my family is, who we all are as a tribe \u2014 it\u2019s the reason why we\u2019re still here. \u201cBesides that\u201d \u2014 he looked down at me, his black eyes unreadable \u2014 \u201cI am still human.\u201d He picked up my hand and pressed it to his fever-warm chest. Through his t-shirt, I could feel the steady beating of his heart under my palm. \u201cNormal humans can\u2019t throw motorcycles around the way you can.\u201d He smiled a faint, half-smile. \u201cNormal humans run away from monsters, Bella. And I never claimed to be normal. Just human.\u201d Staying angry with Jacob was too much work. I started to smile as I pulled my hand away from his chest. \u201cYou look plenty human to me,\u201d I allowed. \u201cAt the moment.\u201d \u201cI feel human.\u201d He stared past me, his face far away. His lower lip trembled, and he bit down on it hard. \u201cOh, Jake,\u201d I whispered, reaching for his hand. This was why I was here. This was why I would take whatever reception waited for me when I got back. Because, underneath all the anger and the sarcasm, Jacob was in pain. Right now, it was very clear in his eyes. I didn\u2019t know how to help him, but I knew I had to try. It was more than that I owed him. It was because his pain hurt me, too. Jacob had become a part of me, and there was no changing that now.",

            "en": "8          8. TEMPER We ended up on the beach again, wandering aimlessly. Jacob was still full of himself for engineering my escape. \u201cDo you think they\u2019ll come looking for you?\u201d he asked, sounding hopeful. \u201cNo.\u201d I was certain about that. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be furious with me tonight, though.\u201d He picked up a rock and chucked it into the waves. \u201cDon\u2019t go back, then,\u201d he suggested again. \u00a0\u201cCharlie would love that,\u201d I said sarcastically. \u201cI bet he wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d I didn\u2019t answer. Jacob was probably right, and that made me grind my teeth together. Charlie\u2019s blatant preference for my Quileute friends was so unfair. I wondered if he would feel the same if he knew the choice was really between vampires and werewolves. \u201cSo what\u2019s the latest pack scandal?\u201d I asked lightly. Jacob skidded to a halt, and he stared down at me with shocked eyes. \u201cWhat? That was a joke.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d He looked away. I waited for him to start walking again, but he seemed lost in thought.  \u201cIs there a scandal?\u201d I wondered. Jacob chuckled once. \u201cI forget what it\u2019s like, not having everyone know everything all the time. Having a quiet, private place inside my head.\u201d We walked along the stony beach quietly for a few minutes. \u00a0\u201cSo what is it?\u201d I finally asked. \u201cThat everyone in your head already knows?\u201d He hesitated for a moment, as if he weren\u2019t sure how much he was going to tell me. Then he sighed and said, \u201cQuil imprinted. That\u2019s three now. The rest of us are starting to get worried. Maybe it\u2019s more common than the stories say. . . .\u201d He frowned, and then turned to stare at me. He gazed into my eyes without speaking, his eyebrows furrowed in concentration. \u201cWhat are you staring at?\u201d I asked, feeling self-conscious. He sighed. \u201cNothing.\u201d Jacob started walking again. Without seeming to think about it, he reached out and took my hand. We paced silently across the rocks. I thought of how we must look walking hand and hand down the beach \u2014 like a couple, certainly \u2014 and wondered if I should object. But this was the way it had always been with Jacob. . . . No reason to get worked up about it now. \u201cWhy is Quil\u2019s imprinting such a scandal?\u201d I asked when it didn\u2019t look like he was going to go on. \u201cIs it because he\u2019s the newest one?\u201d  \u201cThat doesn\u2019t have anything to do with it.\u201d \u201cThen what\u2019s the problem?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s another one of those legend things. I wonder when we\u2019re going to stop being surprised that they\u2019re all true?\u201d he muttered to himself. \u00a0\u201cAre you going to tell me? Or do I have to guess?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d never get it right. See, Quil hasn\u2019t been hanging out with us, you know, until just recently. So he hadn\u2019t been around Emily\u2019s place much.\u201d \u201cQuil imprinted on Emily, too?\u201d I gasped. \u201cNo! I told you not to guess. Emily had her two nieces down for a visit . . . and Quil met Claire.\u201d He didn\u2019t continue. I thought about that for a moment. \u201cEmily doesn\u2019t want her niece with a werewolf? That\u2019s a little hypocritical,\u201d I said. But I could understand why she of all people might feel that way. I thought again of the long scars that marred her face and extended all the way down her right arm. Sam had lost control just once when he was standing too close to her. Once was all it took. . . . I\u2019d seen the pain in Sam\u2019s eyes when he looked at what he\u2019d done to Emily. I could understand why Emily might want to protect her niece from that. \u00a0\u201cWould you please stop guessing? You\u2019re way off. Emily doesn\u2019t mind that part, it\u2019s just, well, a little early.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean early?\u201d Jacob appraised me with narrowed eyes. \u201cTry not to be judgmental, okay?\u201d I nodded cautiously. \u201cClaire is two,\u201d Jacob told me. Rain started to fall. I blinked furiously as the drops pelted my face. Jacob waited in silence. He wore no jacket, as usual; the rain left a spatter of dark spots on his black T-shirt, and dripped through his shaggy hair. His face was expressionless as he watched mine. \u201cQuil . . . imprinted . . . with a two-year-old?\u201d I was finally able to ask. \u201cIt happens.\u201d Jacob shrugged. He bent to grab another rock and sent it flying out into the bay. \u201cOr so the stories say.\u201d \u201cBut she\u2019s a baby,\u201d I protested. He looked at me with dark amusement. \u201cQuil\u2019s not getting any older,\u201d he reminded me, a bit of acid in his tone. \u201cHe\u2019ll just have to be patient for a few decades.\u201d \u201cI . . . don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d I was trying my hardest not to be critical, but, in truth, I was horrified. Until now, nothing about the werewolves had bothered me since the day I\u2019d found out they weren\u2019t committing the murders I\u2019d suspected them of. \u201cYou\u2019re making judgments,\u201d he accused. \u201cI can see it on your face.\u201d \u201cSorry,\u201d I muttered. \u201cBut it sounds really creepy.\u201d \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not like that; you\u2019ve got it all wrong,\u201d Jacob defended his friend, suddenly vehement. \u201cI\u2019ve seen what it\u2019s like, through his eyes. There\u2019s nothing romantic about it at all, not for Quil, not now.\u201d He took a deep breath, frustrated. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard to describe. It\u2019s not like love at first sight, really. It\u2019s more like . . .gravity moves. When you see her, suddenly it\u2019s not the earth holding you here anymore. She does. And nothing matters more than her. And you would do anything for her, be anything for her. . . . You become whatever she needs you to be, whether that\u2019s a protector, or a lover, or a friend, or a brother.   \u201cQuil will be the best, kindest big brother any kid ever had. There isn\u2019t a toddler on the planet that will be more carefully looked after than that little girl will be. And then, when she\u2019s older and needs a friend, he\u2019ll be more understanding, trustworthy, and reliable than anyone else she knows. And then, when she\u2019s grown up, they\u2019ll be as happy as Emily and Sam.\u201d A strange, bitter edge sharpened his tone at the very end, when he spoke of Sam. \u00a0\u201cDoesn\u2019t Claire get a choice here?\u201d \u201cOf course. But why wouldn\u2019t she choose him, in the end? He\u2019ll be her perfect match. Like he was designed for her alone.\u201d We walked in silence for a moment, till I paused to toss a rock toward the ocean. It fell to the beach several meters short. Jacob laughed at me. \u201cWe can\u2019t all be freakishly strong,\u201d I muttered. He sighed. \u201cWhen do you think it will happen for you?\u201d I asked quietly. His answer was flat and immediate. \u201cNever.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not something you can control, is it?\u201d He was silent for a few minutes. Unconsciously, we both walked slower, barely moving at all. \u201cIt\u2019s not supposed to be,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut you have to see her \u2014 the one that\u2019s supposedly meant for you.\u201d \u201cAnd you think that if you haven\u2019t seen her yet, then she\u2019s not out there?\u201d I asked skeptically. \u201cJacob, you haven\u2019t really seen much of the world \u2014 less than me, even.\u201d \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t,\u201d he said in a low voice. He looked at my face with suddenly piercing eyes. \u201cBut I\u2019ll never see anyone else, Bella. I only see you. Even when I close my eyes and try to see something else. Ask Quil or Embry. It drives them all crazy.\u201d I dropped my eyes to the rocks. We weren\u2019t walking anymore. The only sound was of the waves beating against the shore. I couldn\u2019t hear the rain over their roar. \u201cMaybe I\u2019d better go home,\u201d I whispered. \u201cNo!\u201d he protested, surprised by this conclusion. I looked up at him again, and his eyes were anxious now. \u201cYou have the whole day off, right? The <em>bloodsucker</em> won\u2019t be home yet.\u201d I glared at him. \u201cNo offense intended,\u201d he said quickly. \u201cYes, I have the whole day. But, Jake . . .\u201d He held up his hands. \u201cSorry,\u201d he apologized. \u201cI won\u2019t be like that anymore. I\u2019ll just be Jacob.\u201d I sighed. \u201cBut if that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking . . .\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me,\u201d he insisted, smiling with deliberate cheer, too brightly. \u201cI know what I\u2019m doing. Just tell me if I\u2019m upsetting you.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. . . .\u201d \u201cC\u2019mon, Bella. Let\u2019s go back to the house and get our bikes. You\u2019ve got to ride a motorcycle regularly to keep it in tune.\u201d  \u201cI really don\u2019t think I\u2019m allowed.\u201d \u201cBy who? Charlie or the blood \u2014 or him?\u201d \u201cBoth.\u201d Jacob grinned my grin, and he was suddenly the Jacob I missed the most, sunny and warm. I couldn\u2019t help grinning back. The rain softened, turned to mist. \u201cI won\u2019t tell anyone,\u201d he promised. \u201cExcept every one of your friends.\u201d He shook his head soberly and raised his right hand. \u201cI promise not to think about it.\u201d I laughed. \u201cIf I get hurt, it was because I tripped.\u201d \u201cWhatever you say.\u201d We rode our motorcycles on the back roads around La Push until the rain made them too muddy and Jacob insisted that he was going to pass out if he didn\u2019t eat soon. Billy greeted me easily when we got to the house, as if my sudden reappearance meant nothing more complicated than that I\u2019d wanted to spend the day with my friend. After we ate the sandwiches Jacob made, we went out to the garage and I helped him clean up the bikes. I hadn\u2019t been here in months \u2014 since Edward had returned \u2014 but there was no sense of import to it. It was just another afternoon in the garage.  \u201cThis is nice,\u201d I commented when he pulled the warm sodas from the grocery bag. \u201cI\u2019ve missed this place.\u201d He smiled, looking around at the plastic sheds bolted together over our heads. \u201cYeah, I can understand that. All the splendor of the Taj Mahal, without the inconvenience and expense of traveling to India.\u201d \u201cTo Washington\u2019s little Taj Mahal,\u201d I toasted, holding up my can. He touched his can to mine.  \u201cDo you remember last Valentine\u2019s Day? I think that was the last time you were here \u2014 the last time when things were still . . . normal, I mean.\u201d I laughed. \u201cOf course I remember. I traded a lifetime of servitude for a box of conversation hearts. That\u2019s not something I\u2019m likely to forget.\u201d He laughed with me. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Hmm, servitude. I\u2019ll have to think of something good.\u201d Then he sighed. \u201cIt feels like it was years ago. Another era. A happier one.\u201d I couldn\u2019t agree with him. This was my happy era now. But I was surprised to realize how many things I missed from my own personal dark ages. I stared through the opening at the murky forest. The rain had picked up again, but it was warm in the little garage, sitting next to Jacob. He was as good as a furnace. His fingers brushed my hand. \u201cThings have really changed.\u201d \u00a0\u201cYeah,\u201d I said, and then I reached out and patted the back tire of my bike. \u201cCharlie used to like me. I hope Billy doesn\u2019t say anything about today. . . .\u201d I bit my lip. \u201cHe won\u2019t. He doesn\u2019t get worked up about things the way Charlie does. Hey, I never did apologize officially for that stupid move with the bike. I\u2019m real sorry about ratting you out to Charlie. I wish I hadn\u2019t.\u201d I rolled my eyes. \u201cMe, too.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m really, really sorry.\u201d He looked at me hopefully, his wet, tangled black hair sticking up in every direction around his pleading face. \u201cOh, fine! You\u2019re forgiven.\u201d \u201cThanks, Bells!\u201d We grinned at each other for a second, and then his face clouded over. \u201cYou know that day, when I brought the bike over . . . I\u2019ve been wanting to ask you something,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cBut also . . . not wanting to.\u201d I held very still \u2014 a reaction to stress. It was a habit I\u2019d picked up from Edward. \u201cWere you just being stubborn because you were mad at me, or were you really serious?\u201d he whispered. \u00a0\u201cAbout what?\u201d I whispered back, though I was sure I knew what he meant. He glared at me. \u201cYou know. When you said it was none of my business . . . if \u2014 if he bit you.\u201d He cringed visibly at the end. \u201cJake . . .\u201d My throat felt swollen. I couldn\u2019t finish. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. \u201cWere you serious?\u201d He was trembling just slightly. His eyes stayed closed.  \u201cYes,\u201d I whispered. Jacob inhaled, slow and deep. \u201cI guess I knew that.\u201d I stared at his face, waiting for his eyes to open. \u201cYou know what this will mean?\u201d He demanded suddenly. \u201cYou do understand that, don\u2019t you? What will happen if they break the treaty?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll leave first,\u201d I said in a small voice. His eyes flashed open, their black depths full of anger and pain. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a geographic limit to the treaty, Bella. Our great-grandfathers only agreed to keep the peace because the Cullens swore that they were different, that humans weren\u2019t in danger from them. They promised they would never kill or change anyone ever again. If they go back on their word, the treaty is meaningless, and they are no different than any other vampires. Once that\u2019s established, when we find them again \u2014\u201d.  \u00a0\u201cBut, Jake, didn\u2019t you break the treaty already?\u201d I asked, grasping at straws. \u201cWasn\u2019t part of it that you not tell people about the vampires? And you told me. So isn\u2019t the treaty sort of moot, anyhow?\u201d Jacob didn\u2019t like the reminder; the pain in his eyes hardened into animosity. \u201cYeah, I broke the treaty \u2014 back before I believed any of it. And I\u2019m sure they were informed of that.\u201d He glared sourly at my forehead, not meeting my shamed gaze. \u201cBut it\u2019s not like that gives them a freebie or anything. There\u2019s no fault for a fault. They have only one option if they object to what I did. The same option we\u2019ll have when they break the treaty: to attack. To start the war.\u201d He made it sound so inevitable. I shuddered. \u201cJake, it doesn\u2019t have to be that way.\u201d His teeth ground together. \u201cIt is that way.\u201d The silence after his declaration felt very loud. \u201cWill you never forgive me, Jacob?\u201d I whispered. As soon as I said the words, I wished I hadn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t want to hear his answer. \u201cYou won\u2019t be Bella anymore,\u201d he told me. \u201cMy friend won\u2019t exist. There\u2019ll be no one to forgive.\u201d \u201cThat sounds like a no, \u201d I whispered. We faced each other for an endless moment. \u201cIs this goodbye then, Jake?\u201d He blinked rapidly, his fierce expression melting in surprise. \u201cWhy? We still have a few years. Can\u2019t we be friends until we\u2019re out of time?\u201d \u201cYears? No, Jake, not years.\u201d I shook my head, and laughed once without humor. \u201cWeeks is more accurate.\u201d I was not expecting his reaction. He was suddenly on his feet, and there was a loud pop as the soda can exploded in his hand. Soda flew everywhere, soaking me, like it was spraying from a hose. \u201cJake!\u201d I started to complain, but I fell silent when I realized that his whole body was quivering with anger. He glared at me wildly, a growling sound building in his chest. I froze in place, too shocked to remember how to move. The shaking rolled through him, getting faster, until it looked like he was vibrating. His shape blurred. . . . And then Jacob gritted his teeth together, and the growling stopped. He squeezed his eyes tight in concentration; the quivering slowed until only his hands were shaking.  \u201cWeeks,\u201d Jacob said in a flat monotone. I couldn\u2019t respond; I was still frozen. He opened his eyes. They were beyond fury now. \u201cHe\u2019s going to change you into a filthy <em>bloodsucker</em> in just a few weeks!\u201d Jacob hissed through his teeth. Too stunned to take offense at his words, I just nodded mutely. His face turned green under the russet skin.  \u201cOf course, Jake,\u201d I whispered after a long minute of silence. \u201cHe\u2019s seventeen, Jacob. And I get closer to nineteen every day. Besides, what\u2019s the point in waiting? He\u2019s all I want. What else can I do?\u201d I\u2019d meant that as a rhetorical question. His words cracked like snaps of a whip. \u201cAnything. Anything else. You\u2019d be better off dead. I\u2019d rather you were.\u201d I recoiled like he\u2019d slapped me. It hurt worse than if he had. And then, as the pain shot through me, my own temper burst into flame. \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll get lucky,\u201d I said bleakly, lurching to my feet. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll get hit by a truck on my way back.\u201d I grabbed my motorcycle and pushed it out into the rain. He didn\u2019t move as I passed him. As soon as I was on the small, muddy path, I climbed on and kicked the bike to life. The rear tire spit a fountain of mud toward the garage, and I hoped that it hit him. I got absolutely soaked as I sped across the slick highway toward the Cullens\u2019 house. The wind felt like it was freezing the rain against my skin, and my teeth were chattering before I was halfway there. Motorcycles were too impractical for Washington. I would sell the stupid thing first chance I got. I walked the bike into the Cullens\u2019 cavernous garage and was unsurprised to find Alice waiting for me, perched lightly on the hood of her Porsche. Alice stroked the glossy yellow paint. \u00a0\u201cI haven\u2019t even had a chance to drive it.\u201d She sighed. \u201cSorry,\u201d I spit through my rattling teeth. \u201cYou look like you could use a hot shower,\u201d she said, offhand, as she sprang lightly to her feet. \u201cYep.\u201d She pursed her lips, taking in my expression carefully. \u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d \u201cNope.\u201d She nodded in assent, but her eyes were raging with curiosity. \u201cDo you want to go to Olympia tonight?\u201d \u201cNot really. Can\u2019t I go home?\u201d She grimaced. \u201cNever mind, Alice,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll stay if it makes things easier for you.\u201d \u201cThanks,\u201d she sighed in relief. I went to bed early that night, curling up on his sofa again. It was still dark when I woke. I was groggy, but I knew it wasn\u2019t near morning yet. My eyes closed, and I stretched, rolling over. It took me a second before I realized that the movement should have dumped me onto the floor. And that I was much too comfortable. I rolled back over, trying to see. It was darker than last night \u2014 the clouds were too thick for the moon to shine through. \u201cSorry,\u201d he murmured so softly that his voice was part of the darkness. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to wake you.\u201d I tensed, waiting for the fury \u2014 both his and mine \u2014 but it was only quiet and calm in the darkness of his room. I could almost taste the sweetness of reunion in the air, a separate fragrance from the perfume of his breath; the emptiness when we were apart left its own bitter aftertaste, something I didn\u2019t consciously notice until it was removed. There was no friction in the space between us. The stillness was peaceful \u2014 not like the calm before the tempest, but like a clear night untouched by even the dream of a storm. And I didn\u2019t care that I was supposed to be angry with him. I didn\u2019t care that I was supposed to be angry with everyone. I reached out for him, found his hands in the darkness, and pulled myself closer to him. His arms encircled me, cradling me to his chest. My lips searched, hunting along his throat, to his chin, till I finally found his lips. Edward kissed me softly for a moment, and then he chuckled. \u201cI was all braced for the wrath that was going to put grizzlies to shame, and this is what I get? I should infuriate you more often.\u201d \u00a0\u201cGive me a minute to work up to it,\u201d I teased, kissing him again. \u201cI\u2019ll wait as long as you want,\u201d he whispered against my lips. His fingers knotted in my hair. My breath was becoming uneven. \u201cMaybe in the morning.\u201d \u201cWhatever you prefer.\u201d \u201cWelcome home,\u201d I said while his cold lips pressed under my jaw. \u201cI\u2019m glad you came back.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a very good thing.\u201d \u201cMmm,\u201d I agreed, tightening my arms around his neck. His hand curved around my elbow, moving slowly down my arm, across my ribs and over my waist, tracing along my hip and down my leg, around my knee. He paused there, his hand curling around my calf. He pulled my leg up suddenly, hitching it around his hip. I stopped breathing. This wasn\u2019t the kind of thing he usually allowed. Despite his cold hands, I felt suddenly warm. His lips moved in the hollow at the base of my throat. \u201cNot to bring on the ire prematurely,\u201d he whispered, \u201cbut do you mind telling me what it is about this bed that you object to?\u201d Before I could answer, before I could even concentrate enough to make sense of his words, he rolled to the side, pulling me on top of him. He held my face in his hands, angling it up so that his mouth could reach my throat. My breathing was too loud \u2014 it was almost embarrassing, but I couldn\u2019t care quite enough to be ashamed. \u201cThe bed?\u201d he asked again. \u201cI think it\u2019s nice.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s unnecessary,\u201d I managed to gasp. He pulled my face back to his, and my lips shaped themselves around his. Slowly this time, he rolled till he hovered over me. He held himself carefully so that I felt none of his weight, but I could feel the cool marble of his body press against mine. My heart was hammering so loudly that it was hard to hear his quiet laughter. \u201cThat\u2019s debatable,\u201d he disagreed. \u201cThis would be difficult on a couch.\u201d Cold as ice, his tongue lightly traced the shape of my lips. My head was spinning \u2014 the air was coming too fast and shallow.  \u201cDid you change your mind?\u201d I asked breathlessly. Maybe he\u2019d rethought all his careful rules. Maybe there was more significance to this bed than I\u2019d originally guessed. My heart pounded almost painfully as I waited for his answer. Edward sighed, rolling back so that we were on our sides again. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous, Bella,\u201d he said, disapproval strong in his voice \u2014 clearly, he understood what I meant. \u201cI was just trying to illustrate the benefits of the bed you don\u2019t seem to like. Don\u2019t get carried away.\u201d \u201cToo late,\u201d I muttered. \u201cAnd I like the bed,\u201d I added. \u00a0\u201cGood.\u201d I could hear the smile in his voice as he kissed my forehead. \u201cI do, too.\u201d \u201cBut I still think it\u2019s unnecessary,\u201d I continued. \u201cIf we\u2019re not going to get carried away, what\u2019s the point?\u201d He sighed again. \u201cFor the hundredth time, Bella \u2014 it\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d \u201cI like danger,\u201d I insisted. \u201cI know.\u201d There was a sour edge to his voice, and I realized that he would have seen the motorcycle in the garage. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s dangerous,\u201d I said quickly, before he could move to a new topic of discussion. \u201cI\u2019m going to spontaneously combust one of these days \u2014 and you\u2019ll have no one but yourself to blame.\u201d He started to push me away. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I objected, clinging to him. \u201cProtecting you from combustion. If this too much for you. . . .\u201d \u201cI can handle it,\u201d I insisted. He let me worm myself back into the circle of his arms. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I gave you the wrong impression,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to make you unhappy. That wasn\u2019t nice.\u201d \u201cActually, it was very, very nice.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cAren\u2019t you tired? I should let you sleep.\u201d \u201cNo, I\u2019m not. I don\u2019t mind if you want to give me the wrong impression again.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s probably a bad idea. You\u2019re not the only one who gets carried away.\u201d \u201cYes, I am,\u201d I grumbled. He chuckled. \u201cYou have no idea, Bella. It doesn\u2019t help that you are so eager to undermine my self-control, either.\u201d  \u201cI\u2019m not going to apologize for that.\u201d \u201cCan I apologize?\u201d \u201cFor what?\u201d \u201cYou were angry with me, remember?\u201d \u201cOh, that.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was wrong. It\u2019s much easier to have the proper perspective when I have you safely here.\u201d His arms tightened around me. \u201cI go a little berserk when I try to leave you. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll go so far again. It\u2019s not worth it.\u201d I smiled. \u201cDidn\u2019t you find any mountain lions?\u201d \u201cYes, I did, actually. Still not worth the anxiety. I\u2019m sorry I had Alice hold you hostage, though. That was a bad idea.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d I agreed. \u201cI won\u2019t do it again.\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d I said easily. He was already forgiven. \u201cBut slumber parties do have their advantages. . . .\u201d I curled myself closer to him, pressing my lips into the indentation over his collarbone. \u201cYou can hold me hostage any time you want.\u201d \u201cMmm,\u201d he sighed. \u201cI may take you up on that.\u201d \u201cSo is it my turn now?\u201d \u201cYour turn?\u201d his voice was confused. \u201cTo apologize.\u201d \u201cWhat do you have to apologize for?\u201d \u201cAren\u2019t you mad at me?\u201d I asked blankly. \u201cNo.\u201d It sounded like he really meant it. I felt my eyebrows pull together. \u201cDidn\u2019t you see Alice when you got home?\u201d \u201cYes \u2014 why?\u201d \u201cAre you going to take her Porsche back?\u201d \u201cOf course not. It was a gift.\u201d I wished I could see his expression. His voice sounded as if I\u2019d insulted him. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to know what I did?\u201d I asked, starting to be puzzled by his apparent lack of concern. I felt him shrug. \u201cI\u2019m always interested in everything you do \u2014 but you don\u2019t have to tell me unless you want to.\u201d \u201cBut I went to La Push.\u201d \u201cI know.\u201d \u201cAnd I ditched school.\u201d \u201cSo did I.\u201d I stared toward the sound of his voice, tracing his features with my fingers, trying to understand his mood. \u201cWhere did all this tolerance come from?\u201d I demanded. He sighed. \u201cI decided that you were right. My problem before was more about my . . . prejudice against werewolves than anything else. I\u2019m going to try to be more reasonable and trust your judgment. If you say it\u2019s safe, then I\u2019ll believe you.\u201d \u201cWow.\u201d  \u201cAnd . . . most importantly . . . I\u2019m not willing to let this drive a wedge between us.\u201d I rested my head against his chest and closed my eyes, totally content. \u201cSo,\u201d he murmured in a casual tone. \u201cDid you make plans to go back to La Push again soon?\u201d I didn\u2019t answer. His question brought back the memory of Jacob\u2019s words, and my throat was suddenly tight. He misread my silence and the tension in my body. \u201cJust so that I can make my own plans,\u201d he explained quickly. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to feel like you have to hurry back because I\u2019m sitting around waiting for you.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I said in a voice that sounded strange to me. \u201cI don\u2019t have plans go back.\u201d \u201cOh. You don\u2019t have to do that for me.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m welcome anymore,\u201d I whispered.  \u201cDid you run over someone\u2019s cat?\u201d he asked lightly. I knew he didn\u2019t want to force the story out of me, but I could hear the curiosity burning behind his words. \u201cNo.\u201d I took a deep breath, and then mumbled quickly through the explanation. \u201cI thought Jacob would have realized . . . I didn\u2019t think it would surprise him.\u201d Edward waited while I hesitated. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t expecting . . . that it was so soon.\u201d \u201cAh,\u201d Edward said quietly. \u201cHe said he\u2019d rather see me dead.\u201d My voice broke on the last word. Edward was too still for a moment, controlling whatever reaction he didn\u2019t want me to see. Then he crushed me gently to his chest. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d \u201cI thought you\u2019d be glad,\u201d I whispered. \u201cGlad over something that\u2019s hurt you?\u201d he murmured into my hair. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, Bella.\u201d I sighed and relaxed, fitting myself to the stone shape of him. But he was motionless again, tense. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d \u201cYou can tell me.\u201d He paused for a minute. \u201cIt might make you angry.\u201d \u201cI still want to know.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI could quite literally kill him for saying that to you. I want to.\u201d I laughed halfheartedly. \u201cI guess it\u2019s a good thing you\u2019ve got so much self-control.\u201d \u201cI could slip.\u201d His tone was thoughtful. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to have a lapse in control, I can think of a better place for it.\u201d I reached for his face, trying to pull myself up to kiss him. His arms held me tighter, restraining. He sighed. \u201cMust I always be the responsible one?\u201d I grinned in the darkness. \u201cNo. Let me be in charge of responsibility for a few minutes . . . or hours.\u201d \u201cGoodnight, Bella.\u201d \u201cWait \u2014 there was something else I wanted to ask you about.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cI was talking to Rosalie last night. . . .\u201d His body tensed again. \u201cYes. She was thinking about that when I got in. She gave you quite a lot to consider, didn\u2019t she?\u201d His voice was anxious, and I realized that he thought I wanted to talk about the reasons Rosalie\u2019d given me for staying human. But I was interested in something much more pressing. \u201cShe told me a little bit . . . about the time your family lived in Denali.\u201d There was a short pause; this beginning took him by surprise. \u201cYes?\u201d \u201cShe mentioned something about a bunch of female vampires . . . and you.\u201d He didn\u2019t answer, though I waited for a long moment.  \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I said, after the silence had grown uncomfortable. \u201cShe told me you didn\u2019t . . . show any preference. But I was just wondering, you know, if any of them had. Shown a preference for you, I mean.\u201d Again he said nothing. \u201cWhich one?\u201d I asked, trying to keep my voice casual, and not quite managing. \u201cOr was there more than one?\u201d No answer. I wished I could see his face, so I could try to guess what this silence meant. \u201cAlice will tell me,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll go ask her right now.\u201d His arms tightened; I was unable to squirm even an inch away. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s late,\u201d he said. His voice had a little edge to it that was something new. Sort of nervous, maybe a little embarrassed. \u201cBesides, I think Alice stepped out. . . .\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s bad,\u201d I guessed. \u201cIt\u2019s really bad, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I started to panic, my heart accelerating as I imagined the gorgeous immortal rival I\u2019d never realized I had. \u201cCalm down, Bella,\u201d he said, kissing the tip of my nose. \u201cYou\u2019re being absurd.\u201d \u201cAm I? Then why won\u2019t you tell me?\u201d  \u201cBecause there\u2019s nothing to tell. You\u2019re blowing this wildly out of proportion.\u201d \u201cWhich one?\u201d I insisted. He sighed. \u201cTanya expressed a little interest. I let her know, in a very courteous, gentlemanly fashion, that I did not return that interest. End of story.\u201d I kept my voice as even as possible. \u201cTell me something \u2014 what does Tanya look like?\u201d \u201cJust like the rest of us \u2014 white skin, gold eyes,\u201d he answered too quickly. \u201cAnd, of course, extraordinarily beautiful.\u201d I felt him shrug.  \u201cI suppose, to human eyes,\u201d he said, indifferent. \u201cYou know what, though?\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d My voice was petulant. He put his lips right to my ear; his cold breath tickled. \u201cI prefer brunettes.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s a blonde. That figures.\u201d \u201cStrawberry blonde \u2014 not at all my type.\u201d I thought about that for a while, trying to concentrate as his lips moved slowly along my cheek, down my throat, and back up again. He made the circuit three times before I spoke. \u201cI guess that\u2019s okay, then,\u201d I decided. \u201cHmm,\u201d he whispered against my skin. \u201cYou\u2019re quite adorable when you\u2019re jealous. It\u2019s surprisingly enjoyable.\u201d I scowled into the darkness. \u201cIt\u2019s late,\u201d he said again, murmuring, almost crooning now, his voice smoother than silk. \u201cSleep, my Bella. Dream happy dreams. You are the only one who has ever touched my heart. It will always be yours.

            "en": "It made me sad that he had to try so hard. I comforted myself with the knowledge that I wouldn\u2019t be causing him pain much longer.  I heard Charlie approaching then, stamping his feet on the way to express his customary displeasure with our guest. Edward\u2019s eyes snapped open and he let our hands fall, keeping them twined.     \u201cGood evening, Charlie.\u201d Edward was always flawlessly polite, though Charlie didn\u2019t deserve it. Charlie grunted at him, and then stood there with his arms crossed over his chest. He was taking the idea of parental supervision to extremes lately.  \u201cI brought another set of applications,\u201d Edward told me then, holding up a stuffed manila envelope. He was wearing a roll of stamps like a ring around his littlest finger.    I groaned. How were there any colleges left that he hadn\u2019t forced me to apply to already? And how did he keep finding these loophole openings? It was so late in the year.  He smiled as if he could read my thoughts; they must have been very obvious on my face. \u201cThere are still a few open deadlines. And a few places willing to make exceptions.\u201d    I could just imagine the motivations behind such exceptions. And the dollar amounts involved.  Edward laughed at my expression.  \u201cShall we?\u201d he asked, towing me toward the kitchen table.  Charlie huffed and followed behind, though he could hardly complain about the activity on tonight\u2019s agenda. He\u2019d been pestering me to make a decision about college on a daily basis.    I cleared the table quickly while Edward organized an intimidating stack of forms. When I moved Wuthering Heights to the counter, Edward raised one eyebrow. I knew what he was thinking, but Charlie interrupted before Edward could comment.  \u201cSpeaking of college applications, Edward,\u201d Charlie said, his tone even more sullen \u2014 he tried to avoid addressing Edward directly, and when he had to, it exacerbated his bad mood. \u201cBella and I were just talking about next year. Have you decided where you\u2019re going to school?\u201d      Edward smiled up at Charlie and his voice was friendly. \u201cNot yet. I\u2019ve received a few acceptance letters, but I\u2019m still weighing my options.\u201d  \u201cWhere have you been accepted?\u201d Charlie pressed.  \u201cSyracuse . . . Harvard . . . Dartmouth . . . and I just got accepted to the University of Alaska Southeast today.\u201d Edward turned his face slightly to the side so that he could wink at me. I stifled a giggle.    \u201cHarvard? Dartmouth?\u201d Charlie mumbled, unable to conceal his awe. \u201cWell that\u2019s pretty . . . that\u2019s something. Yeah, but the University of Alaska . . . you wouldn\u2019t really consider that when you could go Ivy League. I mean, your father would want you to . . .\u201d  \u201cCarlisle\u2019s always fine with whatever I choose to do,\u201d Edward told him serenely.  \u201cHmph.\u201d     \u201cGuess what, Edward?\u201d I asked in a bright voice, playing along.  \u201cWhat, Bella?\u201d  I pointed to the thick envelope on the counter. \u201cI just got my acceptance to the University of Alaska!\u201d  \u201cCongratulations!\u201d He grinned. \u201cWhat a coincidence.\u201d  Charlie\u2019s eyes narrowed and he glared back and forth between the two of us. \u201cFine,\u201d he muttered after a minute. \u201cI\u2019m going to go watch the game, Bella. Nine-thirty.\u201d  That was his usual parting command.     \u201cEr, Dad? Remember the very recent discussion about my freedom . . . ?\u201d  He sighed. \u201cRight. Okay, ten -thirty. You still have a curfew on school nights.\u201d  \u201cBella\u2019s no longer grounded?\u201d Edward asked. Though I knew he wasn\u2019t really surprised, I couldn\u2019t detect any false note to the sudden excitement in his voice.  \u201cConditionally,\u201d Charlie corrected through his teeth. \u201cWhat\u2019s it to you?\u201d  I frowned at my dad, but he didn\u2019t see.  \u201cIt\u2019s just good to know,\u201d Edward said. \u201cAlice has been itching for a shopping partner, and I\u2019m sure Bella would love to see some city lights.\u201d He smiled at me.  But Charlie growled, \u201cNo!\u201d and his face flushed purple.      \u201cDad! What\u2019s the problem?\u201d  He made an effort to unclench his teeth. \u201cI don\u2019t want you going to Seattle right now.\u201d  \u201cHuh?\u201d  \u201cI told you about that story in the paper \u2014 there\u2019s some kind of gang on a killing spree in Seattle and I want you to steer clear, okay?\u201d    I rolled my eyes. \u201cDad, there\u2019s a better chance that I\u2019ll get struck by lightning than that the one day I\u2019m in Seattle \u2014\u201d  \u201cNo, that\u2019s fine, Charlie,\u201d Edward said, interrupting me. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean Seattle. I was thinking Portland, actually. I wouldn\u2019t have Bella in Seattle, either. Of course not.\u201d  I looked at him in disbelief, but he had Charlie\u2019s newspaper in his hands and he was reading the front page intently     He must have been trying to appease my father. The idea of being in danger from even the most deadly of humans while I was with Alice or Edward was downright hilarious.  It worked. Charlie stared at Edward for one second more, and then shrugged. \u201cFine.\u201d He stalked off toward the living room, in a bit of a hurry now \u2014 maybe he didn\u2019t want to miss tip-off.  I waited till the TV was on, so that Charlie wouldn\u2019t be able to hear me.  \u201cWhat \u2014,\u201d I started to ask.  \u201cHold on,\u201d Edward said without looking up from the paper. His eyes stayed focused on the page as he pushed the first application toward me across the table. \u201cI think you can recycle your essays for this one. Same questions.\u201d     Charlie must still be listening. I sighed and started to fill out the repetitive information: name, address, social. . . . After a few minutes I glanced up, but Edward was now staring pensively out the window. As I bent my head back to my work, I noticed for the first time the name of the school.  I snorted and shoved the papers aside.      \u201cBella?\u201d  \u201cBe serious, Edward. Dartmouth ?\u201d  Edward lifted the discarded application and laid it gently in front of me again. \u201cI think you\u2019d like New Hampshire,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a full complement of night courses for me, and the forests are very conveniently located for the avid hiker. Plentiful wildlife.\u201d He pulled out the crooked smile he knew I couldn\u2019t resist.     I took a deep breath through my nose.  \u201cI\u2019ll let you pay me back, if that makes you happy,\u201d he promised. \u201cIf you want, I can charge you interest.\u201d  \u201cLike I could even get in without some enormous bribe. Or was that part of the loan? The new Cullen wing of the library? Ugh. Why are we having this discussion again?\u201d     \u201cWill you just fill out the application, please, Bella? It won\u2019t hurt you to apply.\u201d  My jaw flexed. \u201cYou know what? I don\u2019t think I will.\u201d  I reached for the papers, planning to crumple them into a suitable shape for lobbing at the trashcan, but they were already gone. I stared at the empty table for a moment, and then at Edward. He didn\u2019t appear to have moved, but the application was probably already tucked away in his jacket.      \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I demanded.  \u201cI sign your name better than you do yourself. You\u2019ve already written the essays.\u201d  \u201cYou\u2019re going way overboard with this, you know.\u201d I whispered on the off chance that Charlie wasn\u2019t completely lost in his game. \u201cI really don\u2019t need to apply anywhere else. I\u2019ve been accepted in Alaska. I can almost afford the first semester\u2019s tuition. It\u2019s as good an alibi as any. There\u2019s no need to throw away a bunch of money, no matter whose it is.\u201d  A pained looked tightened his face. \u201cBella \u2014\u201d  \u201cDon\u2019t start. I agree that I need to go through the motions for Charlie\u2019s sake, but we both know I\u2019m not going to be in any condition to go to school next fall. To be anywhere near people.\u201d     My knowledge of those first few years as a new vampire was sketchy. Edward had never gone into details \u2014 it wasn\u2019t his favorite subject \u2014 but I knew it wasn\u2019t pretty. Self-control was apparently an acquired skill. Anything more than correspondence school was out of the question.  \u201cI thought the timing was still undecided,\u201d Edward reminded me softly. \u201cYou might enjoy a semester or two of college. There are a lot of human experiences you\u2019ve never had.\u201d  \u201cI\u2019ll get to those afterward.\u201d  \u201cThey won\u2019t be human experiences afterward. You don\u2019t get a second chance at humanity, Bella.\u201d  I sighed. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be reasonable about the timing, Edward. It\u2019s just too dangerous to mess around with.\u201d     \u201cThere\u2019s no danger yet,\u201d he insisted.  I glared at him. No danger? Sure. I only had a sadistic vampire trying to avenge her mate\u2019s death with my own, preferably through some slow and torturous method. Who was worried about Victoria? And, oh yeah, the Volturi \u2014 the vampire royal family with their small army of vampire warriors \u2014 who insisted that my heart stop beating one way or another in the near future, because humans weren\u2019t allowed to know they existed. Right. No reason at all to panic.  Even with Alice keeping watch \u2014 Edward was relying on her uncannily accurate visions of the future to give us advance warning \u2014 it was insane to take chances.    Besides, I\u2019d already won this argument. The date for my transformation was tentatively set for shortly after my graduation from high school, only a handful of weeks away.  A sharp jolt of unease pierced my stomach as I realized how short the time really was. Of course this change was necessary \u2014 and the key to what I wanted more than everything else in the world put together \u2014 but I was deeply conscious of Charlie sitting in the other room enjoying his game, just like every other night. And my mother, Ren\u00e9e, far away in sunny Florida, still pleading with me to spend the summer on the beach with her and her new husband. And Jacob, who, unlike my parents, would know exactly what was going on when I disappeared to some distant school. Even if my parents didn\u2019t grow suspicious for a long time, even if I could put off visits with excuses about travel expenses or study loads or illnesses, Jacob would know the truth.    For a moment, the idea of Jacob\u2019s certain revulsion overshadowed every other pain.  \u201cBella,\u201d Edward murmured, his face twisting when he read the distress in mine. \u201cThere\u2019s no hurry. I won\u2019t let anyone hurt you. You can take all the time you need.\u201d  \u201cI want to hurry,\u201d I whispered, smiling weakly, trying to make a joke of it. \u201cI want to be a monster, too.\u201d     His teeth clenched; he spoke through them. \u201cYou have no idea what you\u2019re saying.\u201d Abruptly, he flung the damp newspaper onto the table in between us. His finger stabbed the headline on the front page:  DEATH TOLL ON THE RISE, POLICE FEAR GANG ACTIVITY  \u201cWhat does that have to do with anything?\u201d  \u201cMonsters are not a joke, Bella.\u201d  I stared at the headline again, and then up to his hard expression. \u201cA . . . avampire is doing this?\u201d I whispered.     He smiled without humor. His voice was low and cold. \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised, Bella, at how often my kind are the source behind the horrors in your human news. It\u2019s easy to recognize, when you know what to look for. The information here indicates a newborn vampire is loose in Seattle. Bloodthirsty, wild, out of control. The way we all were.\u201d  I let my gaze drop to the paper again, avoiding his eyes.     \u201cWe\u2019ve been monitoring the situation for a few weeks. All the signs are there \u2014 the unlikely disappearances, always in the night, the poorly disposed-of corpses, the lack of other evidence. . . . Yes, someone brand-new. And no one seems to be taking responsibility for the neophyte. . . .\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not our problem. We wouldn\u2019t even pay attention to the situation if wasn\u2019t going on so close to home. Like I said, this happens all the time. The existence of monsters results in monstrous consequences.\u201d      I tried not to see the names on the page, but they jumped out from the rest of the print like they were in bold. The five people whose lives were over, whose families were mourning now. It was different from considering murder in the abstract, reading those names. Maureen Gardiner, Geoffrey Campbell, Grace Razi, Michelle O\u2019Connell, Ronald Albrook. People who\u2019d had parents and children and friends and pets and jobs and hopes and plans and memories and futures. . . .  \u201cIt won\u2019t be the same for me,\u201d I whispered, half to myself. \u201cYou won\u2019t let me be like that. We\u2019ll live in Antarctica.\u201d     Edward snorted, breaking the tension. \u201cPenguins. Lovely.\u201d  I laughed a shaky laugh and knocked the paper off the table so I wouldn\u2019t have to see those names; it hit the linoleum with a thud. Of course Edward would consider the hunting possibilities. He and his \u201cvegetarian\u201d family \u2014 all committed to protecting human life \u2014 preferred the flavor of large predators for satisfying their dietary needs. \u201cAlaska, then, as planned. Only somewhere much more remote than Juneau \u2014 somewhere with grizzlies galore.\u201d  \u201cBetter,\u201d he allowed. \u201cThere are polar bears, too. Very fierce. And the wolves get quite large.\u201d      My mouth fell open and my breath blew out in a sharp gust.  \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked. Before I could recover, the confusion vanished and his whole body seemed to harden. \u201cOh. Never mind the wolves, then, if the idea is offensive to you.\u201d His voice was stiff, formal, his shoulders rigid.  \u201cHe was my best friend, Edward,\u201d I muttered. It stung to use the past tense. \u201cOf course the idea offends me.\u201d  \u201cPlease forgive my thoughtlessness,\u201d he said, still very formal. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have suggested that.\u201d  \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d I stared at my hands, clenched into a double fist on the table.  We were both silent for a moment, and then his cool finger was under my chin, coaxing my face up. His expression was much softer now.       \u201cSorry. Really.\u201d  \u201cI know. I know it\u2019s not the same thing. I shouldn\u2019t have reacted that way. It\u2019s just that . . . well, I was already thinking about Jacob before you came over.\u201d I hesitated. His tawny eyes seemed to get a little bit darker whenever I said Jacob\u2019s name. My voice turned pleading in response. \u201cCharlie says Jake is having a hard time. He\u2019s hurting right now, and . . . it\u2019s my fault.\u201d  \u201cYou\u2019ve done nothing wrong, Bella.\u201d  I took a deep breath. \u201cI need to make it better, Edward. I owe him that. And it\u2019s one of Charlie\u2019s conditions, anyway \u2014\u201d     His face changed while I spoke, turning hard again, statue-like.  \u201cYou know it\u2019s out of the question for you to be around a werewolf unprotected, Bella. And it would break the treaty if any of us cross over onto their land. Do you want us to start a war?\u201d  \u201cOf course not!\u201d  \u201cThen there\u2019s really no point in discussing the matter further.\u201d He dropped his hand and looked away, searching for a subject change. His eyes paused on something behind me, and he smiled, though his eyes stayed wary.  \u201cI\u2019m glad Charlie has decided to let you out \u2014 you\u2019re sadly in need of a visit to the bookstore. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re reading Wuthering Heights again. Don\u2019t you know it by heart yet?\u201d     \u201cNot all of us have photographic memories,\u201d I said curtly.  \u201cPhotographic memory or not, I don\u2019t understand why you like it. The characters are ghastly people who ruin each others\u2019 lives. I don\u2019t know how Heathcliff and Cathy ended up being ranked with couples like Romeo and Juliet or Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy. It isn\u2019t a love story, it\u2019s a hate story.\u201d     \u201cYou have some serious issues with the classics,\u201d I snapped.  \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s because I\u2019m not impressed by antiquity.\u201d He smiled, evidently satisfied that he\u2019d distracted me. \u201cHonestly, though, why do you read it over and over?\u201d His eyes were vivid with real interest now, trying \u2014 again \u2014 to unravel the convoluted workings of my mind. He reached across the table to cradle my face in his hand. \u201cWhat is it that appeals to you?\u201d    His sincere curiosity disarmed me. \u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d I said, scrambling for coherency while his gaze unintentionally scattered my thoughts. \u201cI think it\u2019s something about the inevitability. How nothing can keep them apart \u2014 not her selfishness, or his evil, or even death, in the end. . . .\u201d  His face was thoughtful as he considered my words. After a moment he smiled a teasing smile. \u201cI still think it would be a better story if either of them had one redeeming quality.\u201d     \u201cI think that may be the point,\u201d I disagreed. \u201cTheir love is their only redeeming quality.\u201d  \u201cI hope you have better sense than that \u2014 to fall in love with someone so . . . malignant.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s a bit late for me to worry about who I fall in love with,\u201d I pointed out. \u201cBut even without the warning, I seem to have managed fairly well.\u201d      He laughed quietly. \u201cI\u2019m glad you think so.\u201d  \u201cWell, I hope you\u2019re smart enough to stay away from someone so selfish. Catherine is really the source of all the trouble, not Heathcliff.\u201d  \u201cI\u2019ll be on my guard,\u201d he promised.  I sighed. He was so good at distractions.  I put my hand over his to hold it to my face. \u201cI need to see Jacob.\u201d  His eyes closed. \u201cNo.\u201d      \u201cIt\u2019s truly not dangerous at all,\u201d I said, pleading again. \u201cI used to spend all day in La Push with the whole lot of them, and nothing ever happened.\u201d  But I made a slip; my voice faltered at the end because I realized as I was saying the words that they were a lie. It was not true that nothing had ever happened. A brief flash of memory \u2014 an enormous gray wolf crouched to spring, baring his dagger-like teeth at me \u2014 had my palms sweating with an echo of remembered panic.  Edward heard my heart accelerate and nodded as if I\u2019d acknowledged the lie aloud. \u201cWerewolves are unstable. Sometimes, the people near them get hurt. Sometimes, they get killed.\u201d     I wanted to deny it, but another image slowed my rebuttal. I saw in my head the once beautiful face of Emily Young, now marred by a trio of dark scars that dragged down the corner of her right eye and left her mouth warped forever into a lopsided scowl.  He waited, grimly triumphant, for me to find my voice.  \u201cYou don\u2019t know them,\u201d I whispered.  \u201cI know them better than you think, Bella. I was here the last time.\u201d  \u201cThe last time?\u201d     \u201cWe started crossing paths with the wolves about seventy years ago. . . . We had just settled near Hoquiam. That was before Alice and Jasper were with us. We outnumbered them, but that wouldn\u2019t have stopped it from turning into a fight if not for Carlisle. He managed to convince Ephraim Black that coexisting was possible, and eventually we made the truce.\u201d  Jacob\u2019s great-grandfather\u2019s name startled me.    \u201cWe thought the line had died out with Ephraim,\u201d Edward muttered; it sounded like he was talking to himself now. \u201cThat the genetic quirk which allowed the transmutation had been lost. . . .\u201d He broke off and stared at me accusingly. \u201cYour bad luck seems to get more potent every day. Do you realize that your insatiable pull for all things deadly was strong enough to recover a pack of mutant canines from extinction? If we could bottle your luck, we\u2019d have a weapon of mass destruction on our hands.\u201d  I ignored the ribbing, my attention caught by his assumption \u2014 was he serious? \u201cBut I didn\u2019t bring them back. Don\u2019t you know?\u201d     \u201cKnow what?\u201d  \u201cMy bad luck had nothing to do with it. The werewolves came back because the vampires did.\u201d  Edward stared at me, his body motionless with surprise.  \u201cJacob told me that your family being here set things in motion. I thought you would already know. . . .\u201d  His eyes narrowed. \u201cIs that what they think?\u201d  \u201cEdward, look at the facts. Seventy years ago, you came here, and the werewolves showed up. You come back now, and the werewolves show up again. Do you think that\u2019s a coincidence?\u201d     He blinked and his glare relaxed. \u201cCarlisle will be interested in that theory.\u201d  \u201cTheory,\u201d I scoffed.  He was silent for a moment, staring out the window into the rain; I imagined he was contemplating the fact that his family\u2019s presence was turning the locals into giant dogs.  \u201cInteresting, but not exactly relevant,\u201d he murmured after a moment. \u201cThe situation remains the same.\u201d  I could translate that easily enough: no werewolf friends.  I knew I must be patient with Edward. It wasn\u2019t that he was unreasonable, it was just that he didn\u2019t understand. He had no idea how very much I owed Jacob Black \u2014 my life many times over, and possibly my sanity, too.     I didn\u2019t like to talk about that barren time with anyone, and especially not Edward. He had only been trying to save me when he\u2019d left, trying to save my soul. I didn\u2019t hold him responsible for all the stupid things I\u2019d done in his absence, or the pain I had suffered.  He did.  So I would have to word my explanation very carefully.  I got up and walked around the table. He opened his arms for me and I sat on his lap, nestling into his cool stone embrace. I looked at his hands while I spoke.    \u201cPlease just listen for a minute. This is so much more important than some whim to drop in on an old friend. Jacob is in pain.\u201d My voice distorted around the word. \u201cI can\u2019t not try to help him \u2014 I can\u2019t give up on him now, when he needs me. Just because he\u2019s not human all the time. . . . Well, he was there for me when I was . . . not so human myself. You don\u2019t know what it was like. . . .\u201d I hesitated. Edward\u2019s arms were rigid around me; his hands were in fists now, the tendons standing out. \u201cIf Jacob hadn\u2019t helped me . . . I\u2019m not sure what you would have come home to. I owe him better than this, Edward.\u201d     I looked up at his face warily. His eyes were closed, and his jaw was strained.  \u201cI\u2019ll never forgive myself for leaving you,\u201d he whispered. \u201cNot if I live a hundred thousand years.\u201d  I put my hand against his cold face and waited until he sighed and opened his eyes.  \u201cYou were just trying to do the right thing. And I\u2019m sure it would have worked with anyone less mental than me. Besides, you\u2019re here now. That\u2019s the part that matters.\u201d  \u201cIf I\u2019d never left, you wouldn\u2019t feel the need to go risk your life to comfort a dog .\u201d  I flinched. I was used to Jacob and all his derogatory slurs \u2014<em>bloodsucker</em>, leech, parasite . . . .    Somehow it sounded harsher in Edward\u2019s velvet voice.  \u201cI don\u2019t know how to phrase this properly,\u201d Edward said, and his tone was bleak. \u201cIt\u2019s going to sound cruel, I suppose. But I\u2019ve come too close to losing you in the past. I know what it feels like to think I have. I am not going to tolerate anything dangerous.\u201d  \u201cYou have to trust me on this. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d  His face was pained again. \u201cPlease, Bella,\u201d he whispered.  I stared into his suddenly burning golden eyes. \u201cPlease what?\u201d  \u201cPlease, for me. Please make a conscious effort to keep yourself safe. I\u2019ll do everything I can, but I would appreciate a little help.\u201d      \u201cI\u2019ll work on it,\u201d I murmured.  \u201cDo you really have any idea how important you are to me? Any concept at all of how much I love you?\u201d He pulled me tighter against his hard chest, tucking my head under his chin.  I pressed my lips against his snow-cold neck. \u201cI know how much I love you ,\u201d I answered.  \u201cYou compare one small tree to the entire forest.\u201d  I rolled my eyes, but he couldn\u2019t see. \u201cImpossible.\u201d  He kissed the top of my head and sighed.  \u201cNo werewolves.\u201d  \u201cI\u2019m not going along with that. I have to see Jacob.\u201d  \u201cThen I\u2019ll have to stop you.\u201d    He sounded utterly confident that this wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  I was sure he was right.  \u201cWe\u2019ll see about that,\u201d I bluffed anyway. \u201cHe\u2019s still my friend.\u201d  I could feel Jacob\u2019s note in my pocket, like it suddenly weighed ten pounds. I could hear the words in his voice, and he seemed to be agreeing with Edward \u2014 something that would never happen in reality.  Doesn\u2019t change anything. Sorry.",

            "en": "6            6. SWITZERLAND AS I DROVE HOME , I WASN\u2019T PAYING MUCH ATTENTION TO the road that shimmered wetly in the sun. I was thinking about the flood of information Jacob had shared with me, trying to sort it out, to force it all to make sense. Despite the overload, I felt lighter. Seeing Jacob smile, having all the secrets thrashed out . . . it didn\u2019t make things perfect, but it made them better. I was right to have gone. Jacob needed me. And obviously, I thought as I squinted into the glare, there was no danger. It came out of nowhere. One minute there was nothing but bright highway in my rearview mirror. The next minute, the sun was glinting off a silver Volvo right on my tail. \u201cAw, crap,\u201d I whimpered. I considered pulling over. But I was too much of a coward to face him right away. I\u2019d been counting on some prep time . . . and having Charlie nearby as a buffer. At least that would force him to keep his voice down. The Volvo followed inches behind me. I kept my eyes on the road ahead. Chicken through and through, I drove straight to Angela\u2019s without once meeting the gaze I could feel burning a hole in my mirror. He followed me until I pulled to the curb in front of the Webers\u2019 house. He didn\u2019t stop, and I didn\u2019t look up as he passed. I didn\u2019t want to see the expression on his face. I ran up the short concrete walk to Angela\u2019s door as soon as he was out of sight. Ben answered the door before I could finish knocking, like he\u2019d been standing right behind it. \u201cHey, Bella!\u201d he said, surprised. \u201cHi, Ben. Er, is Angela here?\u201d I wondered if Angela had forgotten our plans, and cringed at the thought of going home early. \u201cSure,\u201d Ben said just as Angela called, \u201cBella!\u201d and appeared at the top of the stairs. Ben peered around me as we both heard the sound of a car on the road; the sound didn\u2019t scare me \u2014 this engine stuttered to a stop, followed by the loud pop of a backfire. Nothing like the purr of the Volvo. This must be the visitor Ben had been waiting for. \u201cAustin\u2019s here,\u201d Ben said as Angela reached his side. A horn honked on the street. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll see you later,\u201d Ben promised. \u201cMiss you already.\u201d He threw his arm around Angela\u2019s neck and pulled her face down to his height so that he could kiss her enthusiastically. After a second of this, Austin honked again. \u201c\u2019Bye, Ang! Love you!\u201d Ben shouted as he dashed past me. Angela swayed, her face slightly pink, then recovered herself and waved until Ben and Austin were out of sight. Then she turned to me and grinned ruefully. \u201cThank you for doing this, Bella,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom the bottom of my heart. Not only are you saving my hands from permanent injury, you also just spared me two long hours of a plot-less, badly dubbed martial arts film.\u201d She sighed in relief. \u201cHappy to be of service.\u201d I was feeling a bit less panicked, able to breathe a little more evenly. It felt so ordinary here. Angela\u2019s easy human dramas were oddly reassuring. It was nice to know that life was normal somewhere . I followed Angela up the stairs to her room. She kicked toys out of the way as she went. The house was unusually quiet. \u201cWhere\u2019s your family?\u201d \u201cMy parents took the twins to a birthday party in Port Angeles. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re really going to help me with this. Ben\u2019s pretending he has tendonitis.\u201d She made a face. \u201cI don\u2019t mind at all,\u201d I said, and then I walked into Angela\u2019s room and saw the stacks of waiting envelopes. \u00a0\u201cOh!\u201d I gasped. Angela turned to look at me, apologies in her eyes. I could see why she\u2019d been putting this off, and why Ben had weaseled out. \u201cI thought you were exaggerating,\u201d I admitted. \u201cI wish. Are you sure you want to do this?\u201d \u201cPut me to work. I\u2019ve got all day.\u201d Angela divided a pile in half and put her mother\u2019s address book between us on her desk. For a while we concentrated, and there was just the sound of our pens scratching quietly across the paper. \u201cWhat\u2019s Edward doing tonight?\u201d she asked after a few minutes. My pen dug into the envelope I was working on. \u201cEmmet\u2019s home for the weekend. They\u2019re supposed to be hiking.\u201d \u201cYou say that like you\u2019re not sure.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky Edward has his brothers for all the hiking and camping. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do if Ben didn\u2019t have Austin for the guy stuff.\u201d \u201cYeah, the outdoors thing is not really for me. And there\u2019s no way I\u2019d ever be able to keep up.\u201d Angela laughed. \u201cI prefer the indoors myself.\u201d She focused on her pile for a minute. I wrote out four more addresses. There was never any pressure to fill a pause with meaningless chatter around Angela. Like Charlie, she was comfortable with silence. But, like Charlie, she was also too observant sometimes. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d she asked in a low voice now. \u201cYou seem . . . anxious.\u201d I smiled sheepishly. \u201cIs it that obvious?\u201d \u201cNot really.\u201d She was probably lying to make me feel better. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to talk about it unless you want to,\u201d she assured me. \u201cI\u2019ll listen if you think it will help.\u201d I was about to say thanks, but no thanks . After all, there were just too many secrets I was bound to keep. I really couldn\u2019t discuss my problems with someone human. That was against the rules. And yet, with a strange, sudden intensity, that\u2019s exactly what I wanted. I wanted to talk to a normal human girlfriend. I wanted to moan a little bit, like any other teenage girl. I wanted my problems to be that simple. It would also be nice to have someone outside the whole vampire-werewolf mess to put things in perspective. Someone unbiased. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll mind my own business,\u201d Angela promised, smiling down at the address she was working on. \u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I am anxious. It\u2019s . . . it\u2019s Edward.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d It was so easy to talk to Angela. When she asked a question like that, I could tell that she wasn\u2019t just morbidly curious or looking for gossip, like Jessica would have been. She cared that I was upset. \u201cOh, he\u2019s mad at me.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s hard to imagine,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s he mad about?\u201d I sighed. \u201cDo you remember Jacob Black?\u201d \u201cAh,\u201d she said. \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s jealous.\u201d \u201cNo, not jealous . . .\u201d I should have kept my mouth shut. There was no way to explain this right. But I wanted to keep talking anyway. I hadn\u2019t realized I was so starved for human conversation. \u201cEdward thinks Jacob is . . . a bad influence, I guess. Sort of . . . dangerous. You know how much trouble I got in a few months back. . . . It\u2019s all ridiculous, though.\u201d I was surprised to see Angela shaking her head. \u201cWhat?\u201d I asked. \u201cBella, I\u2019ve seen how Jacob Black looks at you. I\u2019d bet the real problem is jealousy.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not like that with Jacob.\u201d \u201cFor you, maybe. But for Jacob . . .\u201d I frowned. \u201cJacob knows how I feel. I\u2019ve told him everything.\u201d \u201cEdward\u2019s only human, Bella. He\u2019s going to react like any other boy.\u201d I grimaced. I didn\u2019t have a response to that. She patted my hand. \u201cHe\u2019ll get over it.\u201d \u201cI hope so. Jake\u2019s going through kind of a tough time. He needs me.\u201d \u201cYou and Jacob are pretty close, aren\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cLike family,\u201d I agreed. \u201cAnd Edward doesn\u2019t like him. . . . That must be hard. I wonder how Ben would handle that?\u201d she mused. I half-smiled. \u201cProbably just like any other boy.\u201d She grinned. \u201cProbably.\u201d Then she changed the subject. Angela wasn\u2019t one to pry, and she seemed to sense I wouldn\u2019t \u2014 couldn\u2019t \u2014 say any more. \u201cI got my dorm assignment yesterday. The farthest building from campus, naturally.\u201d \u00a0\u201cDoes Ben know where he\u2019s staying yet?\u201d \u201cThe closest dorm to campus. He\u2019s got all the luck. How about you? Did you decide where you\u2019re going?\u201d I stared down, concentrating on the clumsy scrawl of my handwriting. For a second I was distracted by the thought of Angela and Ben at the University of Washington. They would be off to Seattle in just a few months. Would it be safe then? Would the wild young vampire menace have moved elsewhere? Would there be a new place by then, some other city flinching from horror-movie headlines? Would those new headlines be my fault? I tried to shake it off and answered her question a beat late. \u201cAlaska, I think. The university there in Juneau.\u201d I could hear the surprise in her voice. \u201cAlaska? Oh. Really? I mean, that\u2019s great. I just figured you\u2019d go somewhere . . . warmer.\u201d I laughed a little, still staring at the envelope. \u201cYeah. Forks has really changed my perspective on life.\u201d \u00a0\u201cAnd Edward?\u201d Though his name set butterflies fluttering in my stomach, I looked up and grinned at her. \u201cAlaska\u2019s not too cold for Edward, either.\u201d She grinned back. \u201cOf course not.\u201d And then she sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s so far. You won\u2019t be able to come home very often. I\u2019ll miss you. Will you e-mail me?\u201d A swell of quiet sadness crashed over me; maybe it was a mistake to get closer to Angela now. But wouldn\u2019t it be sadder still to miss out on these last chances? I shook off the unhappy thoughts, so that I could answer her teasingly. \u201cIf I can type again after this.\u201d I nodded toward the stack of envelopes I\u2019d done. We laughed, and it was easy then to chat cheerfully about classes and majors while we finished the rest \u2014 all I had to do was not think about it. Anyway, there were more urgent things to worry about today. I helped her put the stamps on, too. I was afraid to leave. \u201cHow\u2019s your hand?\u201d she asked. I flexed my fingers. \u201cI think I\u2019ll recover the full use of it . . . someday.\u201d The door banged downstairs, and we both looked up. \u201cAng?\u201d Ben called. I tried to smile, but my lips trembled. \u201cI guess that\u2019s my cue to leave.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go. Though he\u2019s probably going to describe the movie for me . . . in detail.\u201d \u201cCharlie will be wondering where I am anyway.\u201d \u201cThanks for helping me.\u201d \u201cI had a good time, actually. We should do something like this again. It was nice to have some girl time.\u201d \u201cDefinitely.\u201d There was a light knock on the bedroom door. \u201cCome in, Ben,\u201d Angela said. I got up and stretched. \u201cHey, Bella! You survived,\u201d Ben greeted me quickly before going to take my place by Angela. He eyed\u00a0 our work. \u201cNice job. Too bad there\u2019s nothing left to do, I would have . . .\u201d He let the thought trail off, and then restarted excitedly. \u201cAng, I can\u2019t believe you missed this one! It was awesome. There was this final fight sequence \u2014 the choreography was unbelievable! This one guy \u2014 well, you\u2019re going to have to see it to know what I\u2019m talking about \u2014\u201d Angela rolled her eyes at me. \u201cSee you at school,\u201d I said with a nervous laugh. She sighed. \u201cSee you.\u201d I was jumpy on the way out to my truck, but the street was empty. I spent the whole drive glancing anxiously in all my mirrors, but there was never any sign of the silver car. His car was not in front of the house, either, though that meant little. \u201cBella?\u201d Charlie called when I opened the front door. \u201cHey, Dad.\u201d I found him in the living room, in front of the TV. \u00a0\u201cSo, how was your day?\u201d \u201cGood,\u201d I said. Might as well tell him everything \u2014 he\u2019d hear it from Billy soon enough. Besides, it would make him happy. \u201cThey didn\u2019t need me at work, so I went down to La Push.\u201d There wasn\u2019t enough surprise in his face. Billy had already talked to him. \u201cHow\u2019s Jacob?\u201d Charlie asked, attempting to sound indifferent. \u201cGood,\u201d I said, just as casual. \u201cYou get over to the Webers\u2019?\u201d \u201cYep. We got all her announcements addressed.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s nice.\u201d Charlie smiled a wide smile. He was strangely focused, considering that there was a game on. \u201cI\u2019m glad you spent some time with your friends today.\u201d \u201cMe, too.\u201d I ambled toward the kitchen, looking for busy work. Unfortunately, Charlie had already cleaned up his lunch. I stood there for a few minutes, staring at the bright patch of light the sun made on the floor. But I knew I couldn\u2019t delay this forever. .  \u201cI\u2019m going to go study,\u201d I announced glumly as I headed up the stairs. \u201cSee you later,\u201d Charlie called after me. If I survive, I thought to myself. I shut my bedroom door carefully before I turned to face my room. Of course he was there. He stood against the wall across from me, in the shadow beside the open window. His face was hard and his posture tense. He glared at me wordlessly.  I cringed, waiting for the torrent, but it didn\u2019t come. He just continued to glare, possibly too angry to speak. \u201cHi,\u201d I finally said. His face could have been carved from stone. I counted to a hundred in my head, but there was no change. \u201cEr . . . so, I\u2019m still alive,\u201d I began. A growl rumbled low in his chest, but his expression didn\u2019t change. \u00a0\u201cNo harm done,\u201d I insisted with a shrug. He moved. His eyes closed, and he pinched the bridge of his nose between the fingers of his right hand. \u201cBella,\u201d he whispered. \u201cDo you have any idea how close I came to crossing the line today? To breaking the treaty and coming after you? Do you know what that would have meant?\u201d I gasped and his eyes opened. They were as cold and hard as night. \u00a0\u201cYou can\u2019t!\u201d I said too loudly. I worked to modulate the volume of my voice so Charlie wouldn\u2019t hear, but I wanted to shout the words. \u201cEdward, they\u2019d use any excuse for a fight. They\u2019d love that. You can\u2019t ever break the rules!\u201d \u201cMaybe they aren\u2019t the only ones who would enjoy a fight.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you start,\u201d I snapped. \u201cYou made the treaty \u2014 you stick to it.\u201d \u201cIf he\u2019d hurt you \u2014\u201d \u201cEnough!\u201d I cut him off. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to worry about. Jacob isn\u2019t dangerous.\u201d \u00a0\u201cBella.\u201d He rolled his eyes. \u201cYou aren\u2019t exactly the best judge of what is or isn\u2019t dangerous.\u201d \u201cI know I don\u2019t have to worry about Jake. And neither do you.\u201d He ground his teeth together. His hands were balled up in fists at his sides. He was still standing against the wall, and I hated the space between us. I took a deep breath, and crossed the room. He didn\u2019t move when I wrapped my arms around him. Next to the warmth of the last of the afternoon sun streaming through the window, his skin felt especially icy. He seemed like ice, too, frozen the way he was. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry I made you anxious,\u201d I muttered. He sighed, and relaxed a little. His arms wound around my waist. \u201cAnxious is a bit of an understatement,\u201d he murmured. \u201cIt was a very long day.\u201d \u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to know about it,\u201d I reminded him. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be hunting longer.\u201d I looked up at his face, at his defensive eyes; I hadn\u2019t noticed in the stress of the moment, but they were too dark. The rings under them were deep purple. I frowned in disapproval. \u00a0\u201cWhen Alice saw you disappear, I came back,\u201d he explained. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have done that. Now you\u2019ll have to go away again.\u201d My frown intensified. \u201cI can wait.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. I mean, I know she couldn\u2019t see me with Jacob, but you should have known \u2014\u201d \u201cBut I didn\u2019t,\u201d he broke in. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t expect me to let you \u2014\u201d \u201cOh, yes, I can,\u201d I interrupted him. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I expect \u2014\u201d \u201cThis won\u2019t happen again.\u201d \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s right! Because you\u2019re not going to overreact next time.\u201d \u201cBecause there isn\u2019t going to be a next time.\u201d \u201cI understand when you have to leave, even if I don\u2019t like it \u2014\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not the same. I\u2019m not risking my life.\u201d \u201cNeither am I.\u201d \u201cWerewolves constitute a risk.\u201d \u00a0\u201cI disagree.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not negotiating this, Bella.\u201d \u201cNeither am I.\u201d His hands were in fists again. I could feel them against my back. The words popped out thoughtlessly. \u201cIs this really just about my safety?\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he demanded. \u00a0\u201cYou aren\u2019t . . .\u201d Angela\u2019s theory seemed sillier now than before. It was hard to finish the thought. \u201cI mean, you know better than to be jealous, right?\u201d He raised one eyebrow. \u201cDo I?\u201d \u201cBe serious.\u201d \u201cEasily \u2014 there\u2019s nothing remotely humorous about this.\u201d I frowned suspiciously. \u201cOr . . . is this something else altogether? Some vampires-and-werewolves-are-always-enemies nonsense? Is this just a testosterone-fueled \u2014\u201d His eyes blazed. \u201cThis is only about you. All I care is that you\u2019re safe.\u201d The black fire in his eyes was impossible to doubt. \u201cOkay,\u201d I sighed. \u201cI believe that. But I want you to know something \u2014 when it comes to all this enemies nonsense, I\u2019m out. I am a neutral country. I am Switzerland. I refuse to be affected by territorial disputes between mythical creatures. Jacob is family. You are . . . well, not exactly the love of my life, because I expect to love you for much longer than that. The love of my existence. I don\u2019t care who\u2019s a werewolf and who\u2019s a vampire. \u00a0If Angela turns out to be a witch, she can join the party, too.\u201d He stared at me silently through narrowed eyes. \u201cSwitzerland,\u201d I repeated again for emphasis. He frowned at me, and then sighed. \u201cBella . . . ,\u201d he began, but he paused, and his nose wrinkled in disgust. \u201cWhat now?\u201d \u201cWell . . . don\u2019t be offended, but you smell like a dog,\u201d he told me. And then he smiled crookedly, so I knew the fight was over. For now. Edward had to make up for the missed hunting trip, and so he was leaving Friday night with Jasper, Emmett, and Carlisle to hit some reserve in Northern California with a mountain lion problem. We\u2019d come to no agreement on the werewolf issue, but I didn\u2019t feel guilty calling Jake \u2014 during my brief window of opportunity when Edward took the Volvo home before climbing back in through my window \u2014 to let him know I\u2019d be coming over on Saturday again. It wasn\u2019t sneaking around. Edward knew how I felt. And if he broke my truck again, then I\u2019d have Jacob pick me up. Forks was neutral, just like Switzerland \u2014 just like me. So when I got off work Thursday and it was Alice rather than Edward waiting for me in the Volvo, I was not suspicious at first. The passenger door was open, and music I didn\u2019t recognize was shaking the frame when the bass played. \u201cHey, Alice,\u201d I shouted over the wailing as I climbed in. \u201cWhere\u2019s your brother?\u201d She was singing along to the song, her voice an octave higher than the melody, weaving through it with a complicated harmony. She nodded at me, ignoring my question as she concentrated on the music. I shut my door and put my hands over my ears. She grinned, and turned the volume down until it was just background. Then she hit the locks and the gas in the same second. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I asked, starting to feel uneasy. \u201cWhere is Edward?\u201d She shrugged. \u201cThey left early.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d I tried to control the absurd disappointment. If he left early, that meant he\u2019d be back sooner, I reminded myself. \u00a0\u201cAll the boys went, and we\u2019re having a slumber party!\u201d she announced in a trilling, singsong voice. \u201cA slumber party?\u201d I repeated, the suspicion finally settling in. \u201cAren\u2019t you excited?\u201d she crowed. I met her animated gaze for a long second. \u201cYou\u2019re kidnapping me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d She laughed and nodded. \u201cTill Saturday. Esme cleared it with Charlie; you\u2019re staying with me two nights, and I will drive you to and from school tomorrow.\u201d I turned my face to the window, my teeth grinding together. \u201cSorry,\u201d Alice said, not sounding in the least bit penitent. \u201cHe paid me off.\u201d \u201cHow?\u201d I hissed through my teeth. \u201cThe Porsche. It\u2019s exactly like the one I stole in Italy.\u201d She sighed happily. \u201cI\u2019m not supposed to drive it around Forks, but if you want, we could see how long it takes to get from here to L.A. \u2014 I bet I could have you back by midnight.\u201d I took a deep breath. \u201cI think I\u2019ll pass,\u201d I sighed, repressing a shudder. We wound, always too fast, down the long drive. Alice pulled around to the garage, and I quickly looked over the cars. Emmett\u2019s big jeep was there, with a shiny canary yellow Porsche between it and Rosalie\u2019s red convertible. Alice hopped out gracefully and went to stroke her hand along the length of her bribe. \u201cPretty, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cPretty over-the-top,\u201d I grumbled, incredulous. \u201cHe gave you that just for two days of holding me hostage?\u201d Alice made a face. A second later, comprehension came and I gasped in horror. \u201cIt\u2019s for every time he\u2019s gone, isn\u2019t it?\u201d She nodded. I slammed my door and stomped toward the house. She danced along next to me, still unrepentant. \u201cAlice, don\u2019t you think this is just a little bit controlling? Just a tiny bit psychotic, maybe?\u201d \u201cNot really.\u201d She sniffed. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem to grasp how dangerous a young werewolf can be.\u00a0 Especially when I can\u2019t see them. Edward has no way to know if you\u2019re safe. You shouldn\u2019t be so reckless.\u201d My voice turned acidic. \u201cYes, because a vampire slumber party is the pinnacle of safety conscious behavior.\u201d Alice laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a pedicure and everything,\u201d she promised. It wasn\u2019t so bad, except for the fact that I was being held against my will. Esme brought Italian food \u2014 the good stuff, all the way from Port Angeles \u2014 and Alice was prepared with my favorite movies. Even Rosalie was there, quietly in the background. Alice did insist on the pedicure, and I wondered if she was working from a list \u2014 maybe something she\u2019d compiled from watching bad sitcoms. \u00a0\u201cHow late do you want to stay up?\u201d she asked when my toenails were glistening a bloody red. Her enthusiasm remained untouched by my mood. \u201cI don\u2019t want to stay up. We have school in the morning.\u201d She pouted. \u201cWhere am I supposed to sleep, anyway?\u201d I measured the couch with my eyes. It was a little short. \u201cCan\u2019t you just keep me under surveillance at my house?\u201d \u201cWhat kind of a slumber party would that be?\u201d Alice shook her head in exasperation. \u201cYou\u2019re sleeping in Edward\u2019s room.\u201d I sighed. His black leather sofa was longer than this one. Actually, the gold carpet in his room was probably thick enough that the floor wouldn\u2019t be half bad either. \u00a0\u201cCan I go back to my place to get my things, at least?\u201d She grinned. \u201cAlready taken care of.\u201d \u201cAm I allowed to use your phone?\u201d \u201cCharlie knows where you are.\u201d \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to call Charlie.\u201d I frowned. \u201cApparently, I have some plans to cancel.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d She deliberated. \u201cI\u2019m not sure about that.\u201d \u201cAlice!\u201d I whined loudly. \u201cC\u2019mon!\u201d \u00a0\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d she said, flitting from the room. She was back in half a second, cell phone in hand. \u201cHe didn\u2019t specifically prohibit this . . . ,\u201d she murmured to herself as she handed it to me. I dialed Jacob\u2019s number, hoping he wasn\u2019t out running with his friends tonight. Luck was with me \u2014 Jacob was the one to answer. \u201cHello?\u201d \u00a0\u201cHey, Jake, it\u2019s me.\u201d Alice watched me with expressionless eyes for a second, before she turned and went to sit between Rosalie and Esme on the sofa. \u201cHi, Bella,\u201d Jacob said, suddenly cautious. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d \u201cNothing good. I can\u2019t come over Saturday after all.\u201d It was silent for a minute. \u201cStupid <em>bloodsucker</em>,\u201d he finally muttered. \u201cI thought he was leaving. Can\u2019t you have a life when he\u2019s gone? Or does he lock you in a coffin?\u201d I laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s funny.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m only laughing because you\u2019re close,\u201d I told him. \u201cBut he\u2019s going to be here Saturday, so it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d \u201cWill he be feeding there in Forks, then?\u201d Jacob asked cuttingly. \u201cNo.\u201d I didn\u2019t let myself get irritated with him. I wasn\u2019t that far from being as angry as he was. \u201cHe left early.\u201d \u00a0\u201cOh. Well, hey, come over now, then,\u201d he said with sudden enthusiasm. \u201cIt\u2019s not that late. Or I\u2019ll come up to Charlie\u2019s.\u201d \u201cI wish. I\u2019m not at Charlie\u2019s,\u201d I said sourly. \u201cI\u2019m kind of being held prisoner.\u201d He was silent as that sunk in, and then he growled. \u201cWe\u2019ll come and get you,\u201d he promised in a flat voice, slipping automatically into a plural. A chill slid down my spine, but I answered in a light and teasing voice. \u201cTempting. I have been tortured \u2014 Alice painted my toenails.\u201d \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be. They\u2019re just trying to keep me safe.\u201d He growled again. \u201cI know it\u2019s silly, but their hearts are in the right place.\u201d \u201cTheir hearts !\u201d he scoffed. \u201cSorry about Saturday,\u201d I apologized. \u201cI\u2019ve got to hit the sack\u201d \u2014 the couch, I corrected mentally \u2014 \u201cbut I\u2019ll call you again soon.\u201d \u00a0\u201cAre you sure they\u2019ll let you?\u201d he asked in a scathing tone. \u201cNot completely.\u201d I sighed. \u201c\u2019Night, Jake.\u201d \u201cSee you around.\u201d Alice was abruptly at my side, her hand held out for the phone, but I was already dialing. She saw the number. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019ll have his phone on him,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll leave a message.\u201d The phone rang four times, followed by a beep. There was no greeting. \u201cYou are in trouble,\u201d I said slowly, emphasizing each word. \u201cEnormous trouble. Angry grizzly bears are going to look tame next to what is waiting for you at home.\u201d I snapped the phone shut and placed it in her waiting hand. \u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d She grinned. \u201cThis hostage stuff is fun.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to sleep now,\u201d I announced, heading for the stairs. Alice tagged along. \u201cAlice,\u201d I sighed. \u201cI\u2019m not going to sneak out. You would know if I was planning to, and you\u2019d catch me if I tried.\u201d \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m just going to show you where your things are,\u201d she said innocently. Edward\u2019s room was at the farthest end of the third floor hallway, hard to mistake even when the huge house had been less familiar. But when I switched the light on, I paused in confusion. Had I picked the wrong door? Alice giggled. It was the same room, I realized quickly; the furniture had just been rearranged. The couch was pushed to the north wall and the stereo shoved up against the vast shelves of CDs \u2014 to make room for the colossal bed that now dominated the central space. The southern wall of glass reflected the scene back like a mirror, making it look twice as bad. It matched. The coverlet was a dull gold, just lighter than the walls; the frame was black, made of intricately patterned wrought iron. Sculpted metal roses wound in vines up the tall posts and formed a bowery lattice overhead. My pajamas were folded neatly on the foot of the bed, my bag of toiletries to one side. \u201cWhat the hell is all this?\u201d I spluttered. \u00a0\u201cYou didn\u2019t really think he would make you sleep on the couch, did you?\u201d I mumbled unintelligibly as I stalked forward to snatch my things off the bed. \u201cI\u2019ll give you some privacy,\u201d Alice laughed. \u201cSee you in the morning.\u201d After my teeth were brushed and I was dressed, I grabbed a puffy feather pillow off the huge bed and dragged the gold cover to the couch. I knew I was being silly, but I didn\u2019t care. Porsches as bribes and king-sized beds in houses where nobody slept \u2014 it was beyond irritating. I flipped off the lights and curled up on the sofa, wondering if I was too annoyed to sleep. In the dark, the glass wall was no longer a black mirror, doubling the room. The light of the moon brightened the clouds outside the window. As my eyes adjusted, I could see the diffused glow highlighting the tops of the trees, and glinting off a small slice of the river. I watched the silver light, waiting for my eyes to get heavy. There was a light knock on the door. \u00a0\u201cWhat, Alice?\u201d I hissed. I was on the defensive, imagining her amusement when she saw my makeshift bed. \u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d Rosalie said softly, opening the door enough that I could see the silver glow touch her perfect face. \u201cCan I come in?",

            "en": "7 REPETITION         15. PRESSURE It was spring break in Forks again. When i woke up on Monday morning, I lay in bed for a few seconds absorbing that. Last spring break, I'd been hunted by a vampire, too. I hoped this wasn't some kind of tradition forming. Already I was falling into the pattern of things in La Push. I'd spent Sunday mostly on the beach, while Charlie hung out with Billy at the Blacks' house. I was supposed to be with Jacob, but Jacob had other things to do, so I wandered alone, keeping the secret from Charlie. When Jacob dropped in to check on me, he apologized for ditching me so much. He told me his schedule wasn't always this crazy, but until Victoria was stopped, the wolves were on red alert. When we walked along the beach now, he always held my hand. This made me brood over what Jared had said, about Jacob involving his \"girlfriend.\" I supposed that that was exactly what it looked like from the outside. As long as Jake and I knew how it really was, I shouldn't let those kinds of assumptions bother me. And maybe they wouldn't, if I hadn't known that Jacob would have loved for things to be what they appeared. But his hand felt nice as it warmed mine, and I didn't protest. I worked Tuesday afternoon\u2014Jacob followed me on his bike to make sure I arrived safely\u2014and Mike noticed. \"Are you dating that kid from La Push? The sophomore?\" He asked, poorly disguising the resentment in his tone. I shrugged. \"Not in the technical sense of the word. I do spent most of my time with Jacob, though. He's my best friend.\" Mike's eyes narrowed shrewdly. \"Don't kid yourself, Bella. The guy's head over heels for you.\" \"I know,\" I sighed. \"Life is complicated.\" \"And girls are cruel,\" Mike said under his breath. I supposed that was an easy assumption to make, too. That night, Sam and Emily joined Charlie and me for dessert at Billy's house. Emily brought a cake that would have won over a harder man than Charlie. I could see, as the conversation flowed naturally through a range of casual subjects, that any worries Charlie might have harbored about gangs in La Push were being dissolved. Jake and I skipped out early, to get some privacy. We went out to his garage and sat in the Rabbit. Jacob leaned his head back, his face drawn with exhaustion. \"You need some sleep, Jake.\" \"I'll get around to it.\" He reached over and took my hand. His skin was blazing on mine. \"Is that one of those wolf things?\" I asked him. \"The heat, I mean.\" \"Yeah. We run a little warmer than the normal people. About one-oh-eight, one-oh-nine. I never get cold anymore. I could stand like this\"\u2014he gestured to his bare torso\u2014\"in a snowstorm and it wouldn't bother me. The flakes would turn to rain where I stood.\" \"And you all heal fast\u2014that's a wolf thing, too?\" \"Yeah, wanna see? It's pretty cool.\" His eyes flipped open and he grinned. He reached around me to the glove compartment and dug around for a minute. His hand came out with a pocketknife. \"No, I do not want to see!\" I shouted as soon as I realized what he was thinking. \"Put that away!\" Jacob chuckled, but shoved the knife back where it belonged. \"Fine. It's a good thing we heal, though.\u00a0 You can't go see just any doctor when you're running a temperature that should mean you're dead.\" \"No, I guess not.\" I thought about that for a minute. \"\u2026 And being so big\u2014that's part of it? Is that why you're all worried about Quil?\" \"That and the fact that Quil's grandfather says the kid could fry an egg on his forehead.\" Jacob's face turned hopeless. \"It won't be long now. There's no exact age\u2026 it just builds and builds and then suddenly\u2014\" He broke off, and it was a moment before he could speak again. \"Sometimes, if you get really upset or something, that can trigger it early. But I wasn't upset about anything\u2014I was happy.\" He laughed bitterly. \"Because of you, mostly. That's why it didn't happen to me sooner. Instead it just kept on building up inside me\u2014I was like a time bomb. You know what set me off? I got back from that movie and Billy said I looked weird. That was all, but I just snapped. And then I\u2014I exploded. I almost ripped his face off\u2014my own father!\" He shuddered, and his face paled. \"Is it really bad, Jake?\" I asked anxiously, wishing I had some way to help him. \"Are you miserable?\" \"No, I'm not miserable,\" he told me. \"Not anymore. Not now that you know. That was hard, before.\" He leaned over so that his cheek was resting on top of my head. He was quiet for a moment, and I wondered what he was thinking about. Maybe I didn't want to know. \"What's the hardest part?\" I whispered, still wishing I could help. \"The hardest part is feeling\u2026 out of control,\" he said slowly. \"Feeling like I can't be sure of myself\u2014like maybe you shouldn't be around me, like maybe nobody should. Like I'm a monster who might hurt somebody. You've seen Emily. Sam lost control of his temper for just one second\u2026 and she was standing too close. And now there's nothing he can ever do to put it right again. I hear his thoughts\u2014I know what that feels like\u2026 \"Who wants to be a nightmare, a monster? \"And then, the way it comes so easily to me, the way I'm better at it than the rest of them\u2014does that make me even less human than Enbry or Sam? Sometimes I'm afraid that I'm losing myself.\" \"Is it hard? To find yourself again?\" \"At first,\" he said. \"It takes some practice to phase back and forth. But it's easier for me.\" \"Why?\" I wondered. \"Because Ephraim Black was my father's grandfather, and Quil Ateara was my mother's grandfather.\" \"Quil?\" I asked in confusion. \"His great-grandfather,\" Jacob clarified. \"The Quil you know is my second cousin.\" \"But why does it matter who your great-grandfathers are?\" \"Because Ephraim and Quil were in the last pack. Levi Uley was the third. It's in my blood on both sides.\u00a0 I never had a chance. Like Quil doesn't have a chance.\" His expression was bleak. \"What's the very best part?\" I asked, hoping to cheer him up. \"The best part,\" he said, suddenly smiling again, \"is the speed.\" \"Better than the motorcycles?\" He nodded, enthusiastic. \"There's no comparison.\" \"How fast can you\u2026 ?\" \"Run?\" he finished my question. \"Fast enough. What can I measure it by? We caught\u2026 what was his name? Laurent? I imagine that means more to you than it would to someone else.\" It did mean something to me. I couldn't imagine that\u2014the wolves running faster than a vampire. When the Cullens ran, they all but turned invisible with speed. \"So, tell me something I don't know,\" he said. \"Something about vampires. How did you stand it, being around them? Didn't it creep you out?\" \"No,\" I said curtly. My tone made him thoughtful for a moment. \"Say, why'd your <em>bloodsucker</em> kill that James, anyway?\" he asked suddenly. \"James was trying to kill me\u2014it was like a game for him. He lost. Do you remember last spring when I was in the hospital down in Phoenix?\" Jacob sucked in a breath. \"He got that close?\" \"He got very, very close.\" I stroked my scar. Jacob noticed, because he held the hand I moved. \"What's that?\" He traded hands, examining my right. \"This is your funny scar, the cold one.\" He looked at it closer, with new eyes, and gasped. \"Yes, it's what you think it is,\" I said. \"James bit me.\" His eyes bulged, and his face turned a strange, sallow color under the russet surface. He looked like he was about to be sick. \"But if he bit you\u2026 ? Shouldn't you be\u2026 ?\" He choked. \"Edward saved me twice,\" I whispered. \"He sucked the venom out\u2014you know, like with a rattlesnake.\" I twitched as the pain lashed around the edges of the hole. But I wasn't the only one twitching. I could feel Jacob's whole body trembling next to mine. Even the car shook. \"Careful, Jake. Easy. Calm down.\" \"Yeah,\" he panted. \"Calm.\" He shook his head back and forth quickly. After a moment, only his hands were shaking. \"You okay?\" \"Yeah, almost. Tell me something else. Give me something else to think about.\" \"What do you want to know?\" \"I don't know.\" He had his eyes closed, concentrating. \"The extra stuff I guess. Did any of the other Cullens have\u2026 extra talents? Like the mind reading?\" I hesitated a second. This felt like a question he would ask of his spy, not his friend. But what was the point of hiding what I knew? It didn't matter now, and it would help him control himself. So I spoke quickly, the image of Emily's ruined face in my mind, and the hair rising on my arms. I couldn't imagine how the russet wolf would fit inside the Rabbit\u2014Jacob would tear the whole garage apart if he changed now. \"Jasper could\u2026 sort of control the emotions of the people around him. Not in a bad way, just to calm someone down, that kind of thing. It would probably help Paul a lot,\" I added, teasing weakly. \"And then Alice could see things that were going to happen. The future, you know, but not absolutely. The things she saw would change when someone changed the path they were on\u2026\" Like how she'd seen me dying\u2026 and she'd seen me becoming one of them. Two things that had not happened. And one that never would. My head started to spin\u2014I couldn't seem to pull in enough oxygen from the air. No lungs. Jacob was entirely in control now, very still beside me. \"Why do you do that?\" he asked. He tugged lightly at one of my arms, which was bound around my chest, and then gave up when it wouldn't come loose easily. I hadn't even realized I'd moved them. \"You do that when you're upset. Why?\" \"It hurts to think about them,\" I whispered. \"It's like I can't breathe\u2026 like I'm breaking into pieces\u2026\"It was bizarre how much I could tell Jacob now. We had no more secrets. He smoothed my hair. \"It's okay, Bella, it's okay. I won't bring it up again. I'm sorry.\" \"I'm fine.\" I gasped. \"Happens all the time. Not your fault.\" \"We're a pretty messed-up pair, aren't we?\" Jacob said. \"Neither one of us can hold our shape together right.\" \"Pathetic,\" I agreed, still breathless. \"At least we have each other,\" he said, clearly comforted by the thought. I was comforted, too. \"At least there's that,\" I agreed. And when we were together, it was fine. But Jacob had a horrible, dangerous job he felt compelled to do, and so I was often alone, stuck in La Push for safety, with nothing to do to keep my mind off any of my worries. I felt awkward, always taking up space at Billy's. I did some studying for another Calculus test that was coming up next week, but I could only look at math for so long. When I didn't have something obvious to do in my hands,\u00a0 I felt like I ought to be making conversation with Billy\u2014the pressure of normal societal rules. But Billy wasn't one for filling up the long silences, and so the awkwardness continued. I tried hanging out at Emily's place Wednesday afternoon, for a change. At first it was kind of nice. Emily was a cheerful person who never sat still. I drifted behind her while she flitted around her little house and yard, scrubbing at the spotless floor, pulling a tiny weed, fixing a broken hinge, tugging a string of wool through an ancient loom, and always cooking, too. She complained lightly about the increase in the boys' appetites from all their extra running, but it was easy to see she didn't mind taking care of them. It wasn't hard to be with her\u2014after all, we were both wolf girls now. But Sam checked in after I'd been there for a few hours. I only stayed long enough to ascertain that Jacob was fine and there was no news, and then I had to escape. The aura of love and contentment that surrounded them was harder to take in concentrated doses, with no one else around to dilute it. So that left me wandering the beach, pacing the length of the rocky crescent back and forth, again and again. Alone time wasn't good for me. Thanks to the new honesty with Jacob, I'd been talking and thinking about the Cullens way too much. No matter how I tried to distract myself\u2014and I had plenty to think of: I was honestly and desperately worried about Jacob and his wolf-brothers, I was terrified for Charlie and the others who thought they were hunting animals, I was getting in deeper and deeper with Jacob without ever having consciously decided to progress in that direction and I didn't know what to do about it\u2014none of these very real, very deserving of thought, very pressing concerns could take my mind off the pain in my chest for long. Eventually, I couldn't even walk anymore, because I couldn't breathe. I sat down on a patch of semidry rocks and curled up in a ball. Jacob found me like that, and I could tell from his expression that he understood. \"Sorry,\" he said right away. He pulled me up from the ground and wrapped both arms around my shoulders. I hadn't realized that I was cold until then. His warmth made me shudder, but at least I could breathe with him there. \"I'm ruining your spring break,\" Jacob accused himself as we walked back up the beach. \"No, you're not. I didn't have any plans. I don't think I like spring breaks, anyway.\" \"I'll take tomorrow morning off. The others can run without me. We'll do something fun.\" The word seemed out of place in my life right now, barely comprehensible, bizarre. \"Fun?\" \"Fun is exactly what you need. Hmm\u2026\" he gazed out across the heaving gray waves, deliberating. As his eyes scanned the horizon, he had a flash of inspiration. \"Got it!\" he crowed. \"Another promise to keep.\" \"What are you talking about?\" He let go of my hand and pointed toward the southern edge of the beach, where the flat, rocky half-moon dead-ended against the sheer sea cliffs. I stared, uncomprehending. \"Didn't I promise to take you cliff diving?\" I shivered. \"Yeah, it'll be pretty cold\u2014not as cold as it is today. Can you feel the weather changing? The pressure?\u00a0 It will be warmer tomorrow. You up for it?\" The dark water did not look inviting, and, from this angle, the cliffs looked even higher than before. But it had been days since I'd heard Edward's voice. That was probably part of the problem. I was addicted to the sound of my delusions. It made things worse if I went too long without them. Jumping off a cliff was certain to remedy that situation. \"Sure, I'm up for it. Fun.\" \"It's a date,\" he said, and draped his arm around my shoulders. \"Okay\u2014now let's go get you some sleep.\" I didn't like the way the circles under his eyes were beginning to look permanently etched onto his skin. I woke early the next morning and snuck a change of clothes out to the truck. I had a feeling that Charlie would approve of today's plan just about as much as he would approve of the motorcycle. The idea of a distraction from all my worries had me almost excited. Maybe it would be fun. A date with Jacob, a date with Edward\u2026 I laughed darkly to myself. Jake could say what he wanted about us being a messed-up pair\u2014I was the one who was truly messed up. I made the werewolf seem downright normal. I expected Jacob to meet me out front, the way he usually did when my noisy truck announced my arrival. When he didn't, I guessed that he might still be sleeping. I would wait\u2014let him get as much rest as he could. He needed his sleep, and that would give the day time to warm a bit more. Jake had been right about the weather, though; it had changed in the night. A thick layer of clouds pressed heavily on the atmosphere now, making it almost sultry; it was warm and close under the gray blanket. I left my sweater in the truck. I knocked quietly on the door. \"C'mon in, Bella,\" Billy said. He was at the kitchen table, eating cold cereal. \"Jake sleeping?\" \"Er, no.\" He set his spoon down, and his eyebrows pulled together. \"What happened?\" I demanded. I could tell from his expression that something had. \"Embry, Jared, and Paul crossed a fresh trail early this morning. Sam and Jake took off to help. Sam was hopeful\u2014she's hedged herself in beside the mountains. He thinks they have a good chance to finish this.\" \"Oh, no, Billy,\" I whispered. \"Oh, no.\" He chuckled, deep and low. \"Do you really like La Push so well that you want to extend your sentence here?\" \"Don't make jokes, Billy. This is too scary for that.\" \"You're right,\" he agreed, still complacent. His ancient eyes were impossible to read. \"This one's tricky.\" I bit my lip. \"It's not as dangerous for them as you think it is. Sam knows what he's doing. You're the one that you should worry about. The vampire doesn't want to fight them. She's just trying to find a way around them\u2026 to you.\" \"How does Sam know what he's doing?\" I demanded, brushing aside his concern for me. \"They've only killed just the one vampire\u2014that could have been luck.\" \"We take what we do very seriously, Bella. Nothing's been forgotten. Everything they need to know has been passed down from father to son for generations.\" That didn't comfort me the way he probably intended it to. The memory of Victoria, wild, catlike, lethal, was too strong in my head. If she couldn't get around the wolves, she would eventually try to go through them. Billy went back to his breakfast; I sat down on the sofa and flipped aimlessly though the TV channels. That didn't last long. I started to feel closed in by the small room, claustrophobic, upset by the fact that I couldn't see out the curtained windows. \"I'll be at the beach,\" I told Billy abruptly, and hurried out the door. Being outside didn't help as much as I'd hoped. The clouds pushed down with an invisible weight that kept the claustrophobia from easing. The forest seemed strangely vacant as I walked toward the beach. I didn't see any animals\u2014no birds, no squirrels. I couldn't hear any birds, either. The silence was eerie; there wasn't even the sound of wind in the trees.  I knew it was all just a product of the weather, but it still made me edgy. The heavy, warm pressure of the atmosphere was perceptible even to my weak human senses, and it hinted at something major in the storm department. A glance at the sky backed this up; the clouds were churning sluggishly despite the lack of breeze on the ground. The closest clouds were a smoky gray, but between the cracks I could see another layer that was a gruesome purple color. The skies had a ferocious plan in store for today. The animals must be bunkering down. As soon as I reached the beach, I wished I hadn't come\u2014I'd already had enough of this place. I'd been here almost every day, wandering alone. Was it so much different from my nightmares? But where else to go? I trudged down to the driftwood tree, and sat at the end so that I could lean against the tangled roots. I stared up at the angry sky broodingly, waiting for the first drops to break the stillness. I tried not to think about the danger Jacob and his friends were in. Because nothing could happen to Jacob. The thought was unendurable. I'd lost too much already\u2014would fate take the last few shreds of peace left behind? That seemed unfair, out of balance. But maybe I'd violated some unknown rule, crossed some line that had condemned me. Maybe it was wrong to be so involved with myths and legends, to turn my back on the human world. Maybe\u2026 No. Nothing would happen to Jacob. I had to believe that or I wouldn't be able to function. \"Argh!\" I groaned, and jumped off the log. I couldn't sit still; it was worse than pacing.  I'd really been counting on hearing Edward this morning. It seemed like that was the one thing that might make it bearable to live through this day. The hole had been festering lately, like it was getting revenge for the times that Jacob's presence had tamed it. The edges burned. The waves picked up as I paced, beginning to crash against the rocks, but there was still no wind. I felt pinned down by the pressure of the storm. Everything swirled around me, but it was perfectly still where I stood. The air had a faint electric charge\u2014I could feel the static in my hair. Farther out, the waves were angrier than they were along the shore. I could see them battering against the line of the cliffs, spraying big white clouds of sea foam into the sky. There was still no movement in the air, though the clouds roiled more quickly now. It was eerie looking\u2014like the clouds were moving by their own will. I shivered, though I knew it was just a trick of the pressure. The cliffs were a black knife edge against the livid sky. Staring at them, I remembered the day Jacob had told me about Sam and his \"gang.\" I thought of the boys\u2014the werewolves\u2014throwing themselves into the empty air. The image of the falling, spiraling figures was still vivid in my mind. I imagined the utter freedom of the fall\u2026 I imagined the way Edward's voice would have sounded in my head\u2014furious, velvet, perfect\u2026 The burning in my chest flared agonizingly. There had to be some way to quench it. The pain was growing more and more intolerable by the second. I glared at the cliffs and the crashing waves. Well, why not? Why not quench it right now? Jacob had promised me cliff diving, hadn't he? Just because he was unavailable, should I have to give up the distraction I needed so badly\u2014needed even worse because Jacob was out risking his life? Risking it, in essence, for me. If it weren't for me, Victoria would not be killing people here\u2026 just somewhere else, far away. If anything happened to Jacob, it would be my fault. That realization stabbed deep and had me jogging back up to the road toward Billy's house, where my truck waited. I knew my way to the lane that passed closest to the cliffs, but I had to hunt for the little path that would take me out to the ledge. As I followed it, I looked for turns or forks, knowing that Jake had planned to take me off the lower outcropping rather than the top, but the path wound in a thin single line toward the brink with no options. I didn't have time to find another way down\u2014the storm was moving in quickly now. The wind was finally beginning to touch me, the clouds pressing closer to the ground. Just as I reached the place where the dirt path fanned out into the stone precipice, the first drops broke through and splattered on my face. It was not hard to convince myself that I didn't have time to search for another way\u2014I wanted to jump from the top. This was the image that had lingered in my head. I wanted the long fall that would feel like flying. I knew that this was the stupidest, most reckless thing I had done yet. The thought made me smile. The pain was already easing, as if my body knew that Edward's voice was just seconds away\u2026 The ocean sounded very far away, somehow farther than before, when I was on the path in the trees. I grimaced when I thought of the probable temperature of the water. But I wasn't going to let that stop me. The wind blew stronger now, whipping the rain into eddies around me. I stepped out to the edge, keeping my eyes on the empty space in front of me. My toes felt ahead blindly, caressing the edge of the rock when they encountered it. I drew in a deep breath and held it . . waiting. \"Bella.\" I smiled and exhaled. Yes? I didn't answer out loud, for fear that the sound of my voice would shatter the beautiful illusion. He sounded so real, so close. It was only when he was disapproving like this that I could hear the true memory of his voice\u2014the velvet texture and the musical intonation that made up the most perfect of all voices. \"Don't do this,\" he pleaded. You wanted me to be human, I reminded him. Well, watch me. \"Please. For me.\" But you won't stay with me any other way. \"Please.\" It was just a whisper in the blowing rain that tossed my hair and drenched my clothes\u2014making me as wet as if this were my second jump of the day. I rolled up onto the balls of my feet. \"No, Bella!\" He was angry now, and the anger was so lovely. I smiled and raised my arms straight out, as if I were going to dive, lifting my face into the rain. But it was too ingrained from years of swimming at the public pool\u2014feet first, first time. I leaned forward, crouching to get more spring\u2026 And I flung myself off the cliff. I screamed as I dropped through the open air like a meteor, but it was a scream of exhilaration and not fear. The wind resisted, trying vainly to fight the\u00a0 unconquerable gravity, pushing against me and twirling me in spirals like a rocket crashing to the earth. Yes! The word echoed through my head as I sliced through the surface of the water. It was icy, colder than I'd feared, and yet the chill only added to the high. I was proud of myself as I plunged deeper into the freezing black water. I hadn't had one moment of terror\u2014just pure adrenaline. Really, the fall wasn't scary at all. Where was the challenge? That was when the current caught me. I'd been so preoccupied by the size of the cliffs, by the obvious danger of their high, sheer faces, that I hadn't worried at all about the dark water waiting. I never dreamed that the true menace was lurking far below me, under the heaving surf. It felt like the waves were fighting over me, jerking me back and forth between them as if determined to share by pulling me into halves. I knew the right way to avoid a riptide: swim parallel to the beach rather than struggling for the shore. But the knowledge did me little good when I didn't know which way the shore was. I couldn't even tell which way the surface was. The angry water was black in every direction; there was no brightness to direct me upward. Gravity was all-powerful when it competed with the air, but it had nothing on the waves\u2014I couldn't feel a downward pull, a sinking in any direction. Just the battering of the current that flung me round and round like a rag doll. I fought to keep my breath in, to keep my lips locked around my last store of oxygen. It didn't surprise me that my delusion of Edward was there. He owed me that much, considering that I was dying. I was surprised by how sure that knowledge was. I was going to drown. I was drowning. \"Keep swimming!\" Edward begged urgently in my head. Where? There was nothing but the darkness. There was no place to swim to. \"Stop that!\" he ordered. \"Don't you dare give up!\" The cold of the water was numbing my arms and legs. I didn't feel the buffeting so much as before. It was more of just a dizziness now, a helpless spinning in the water. But I listened to him. I forced my arms to continue reaching, my legs to kick harder, though every second I was facing a new direction. It couldn't be doing any good. What was the point? \"Fight!\" he yelled. \"Damn it, Bella, keep fighting.\" Why? I didn't want to fight anymore. And it wasn't the light-headedness, or the cold, or the failure of my arms as the muscles gave out in exhaustion, that made me content to stay where I was. I was almost happy that it was over. This was an easier death than others I'd faced. Oddly peaceful. I thought briefly of the clich\u00e9s, about how you were suppose to see your life flash before your eyes. I was so much luckier. Who wanted to see a rerun, anyway? I saw him, and I had no will to fight. It was so clear, so much more defined than any memory. My subconscious had stored Edward away in flawless detail, saving him for this final moment. I could see his perfect face as if he were really there; the exact shade of his icy skin, the shape of his lips, the line of his jaw, the gold glinting in his furious eyes. He was angry, naturally, that I was giving up. His teeth were clenched and his nostrils flared with rage. \"No! Bella, no!\" My ears were flooded with the freezing water, but his voice was clearer than ever. I ignored his words and concentrated on the sound of his voice. Why would I fight when I was so happy where I was? Even as my lungs burned for more air and my legs cramped in the icy cold, I was content. I'd forgotten what real happiness felt like. Happiness. It made the whole dying thing pretty bearable. The current won at that moment, shoving me abruptly against something hard, a rock invisible in the gloom. It hit me solidly across the chest, slamming into me like an iron bar, and the breath whooshed out of my lungs, escaping in a thick cloud of silver bubbles. Water flooded down my throat, choking and burning. The iron bar seemed to be dragging me, pulling me away from Edward, deeper into the dark, to the ocean floor. Goodbye, I love you, was my last thought.",
