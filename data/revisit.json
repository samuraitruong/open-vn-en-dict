            "en": "Promises to Keep       By Kris Hamm Rose  I'm a teacher. But there are days, like today, when I wonder why. It's been a tough day. The results of an English quiz taken by my fifth-graders were dismal. Despite my best efforts, the world of pronouns remains a mystery to them. How I wish there is a way to make the study of our language as exciting as a computer game, so the glazed looks would not appear in their eyes at the mention of the word \"grammar.\" I wanted to spend my lunch period thinking of a way to enrich the next day's lesson, but a child became sick and needed me to gather her assignments while she waited for her mother. It took longer than I thought so there wasn't time for lunch. Then an argument broke out at recess. Angry boys needed to be calmed and hurt feelings soothed before we could return to the classroom. We were all emotionally spent and found it hard to return to history books and Revolutionary War battles. Hunger had given me a nagging headache, lingering long after the last child filed out for car pool. Now, as I drive home, rubbing aching temples, I remember my husband's words, delivered like a lecture, after other days like this. \"Why don't you quit? You'd probably make more money doing something else, and you wouldn't have papers to grade every night.\" This late afternoon, I'm considering the wisdom of his words. I have a stack of papers to grade, which I promised my fifth-graders I would return tomorrow. But tonight a friend, whom I haven't seen in a year, is visiting from Belgium, and I told her I would keep this evening free. Frustration builds as traffic slows, and I realize it's rush hour. No matter how hard I try, I can't seem to get out of my classroom at this time. The world of my profession, a world filled with children, requires so much time. After school today, we had a faculty meeting. Events had to be planned, problems solved, new ideas discussed. So many details to remember. Just when I thought my day was over, a student peeked her head into the classroom to remind me I had promised to help her with a difficult assignment. The building was empty when I returned her to her waiting mother and wearily walked to my car. Sitting in traffic threaded behind a distant stoplight, it's hard not to replay the day and <em>revisit</em> the tension. I turn up the air conditioner, hoping the coolness will ease my frustration and aching head. The last notes of a familiar melody are interrupted by news from the real world. Stock prices are down. Crime is up. The sound of gunfire fills the car as a broadcaster reveals the horror of life in a distant country. A strained voice reports the body of a local youngster, missing for weeks, has been identified. Too much real world has invaded my space. This missing child has had a profound effect on my fifth-graders. Every morning since she was first reported missing, my children have discussed news reports about her and prayed for her safe return. Their concern was not only for her and her family but also for themselves. After all, she was one of them. A child believing herself to be safe and secure in her own neighborhood. My students, only one scant year younger than the tragic victim, wondered, \"If it happened to her, could it happen to me?\" Their thoughts and fears mirrored my own as I tried to find the right words to calm anxieties hoisted upon them by a world seemingly gone mad. There were no easy answers to quiet their apprehensions. How could I help them make sense out of senseless things and restore security to the small world of our classroom? My children, ever wise with the innocence of youth, had found the answer themselves. They got out their pencils, markers and Crayolas and made cards. Cards written with words of compassion and love for a mother and father they didn't know. Cards that spoke of faith and the promise of peace. Cards adorned with ruby red hearts, golden crosses, spring flowers and rosy-cheeked angels. No grammar book, no lesson, could ever teach the beauty of the thoughts drawn and expressed by these children. Their cards, intended to comfort others, comforted the children themselves by leading them past the anxiety, back into the world of security that should be theirs. As I sit in my car inching through the fumes of evening rush hour, I reflect on the strength of my students as they sought to right their world in the one way that made sense to them. I find myself smiling in spite of the heat, the traffic and the pile of ungraded tests. The rules of grammar might not have been learned today, but something bigger and better happened in my classroom. I just didn't recognize it at the time. And then I remember. I remember why I'm still teaching. It's the children. They're more important than a lifetime filled with quiet evenings and more valuable than a pocket filled with money. The world of noise, pronouns, recess and homework is my world. My classroom, a child-filled world of discovery, of kindness and of caring is the real world. And I'm so lucky to be in it. The traffic clears and I move past the stoplight, into the shady streets of my neighborhood. I'm glad to be home. It's time to call my friend and tell her I can't meet her tonight. I have promises to keep. She'll understand. After all, she's also a teacher.",

            "en": "5          5. CHEATER \"BELLA, WHY DON'T YOU TAKE OFF,\" MIKE SUGGESTED, his eyes focused off to the side, not really looking at me. I wondered how long that had been going on without me noticing. It was a slow afternoon at Newton's. At the moment there were only two patrons in the store, dedicated backpackers from the sound of their conversation. Mike had spent the last hour going through the pros and cons of two brands of lightweight packs with them. But they'd taken a break from serious pricing to indulge in trying to one - up each other with their latest tales from the trail. Their distraction had given Mike a chance to escape. \"I don't mind staying,\" I said. I still hadn't been able to sink back into my protective shell of numbness, and everything seemed oddly close and loud today, like I'd taken cotton out of my ears. I tried to tune out the laughing hikers without success. \"I'm telling you,\" said the thickset man with the orange beard that didn't match his dark brown hair. \"I've seen grizzlies pretty close up in Yellowstone, but they had nothing on this brute.\" His hair was matted, and his clothes looked like they'd been on his back for more than a few days. Fresh from the mountains. \"Not a chance. Black bears don't get that big. The grizzlies you saw were probably cubs.\" The second man was tall and lean, his face tanned and wind-whipped into an impressive leathery crust. \"Seriously, Bella, as soon as these two give up, I'm closing the place down,\" Mike murmured. \"If you want me to go\u2026\" I shrugged. \u00a0\"On all fours it was taller than you,\" the bearded man insisted while I gathered my things together. \"Big as a house and pitch-black. I'm going to report it to the ranger here. People ought to be warned\u2014this wasn't up on the mountain, mind you\u2014this was only a few miles from the trailhead.\" Leather-face laughed and rolled his eyes. \"Let me guess\u2014you were on your way in? Hadn't eaten real food or slept off the ground in a week, right?\" \"Hey, uh, Mike, right?\" the bearded man called, looking toward us. \"See you Monday,\" I mumbled. \"Yes, sir,\" Mike replied, turning away. \"Say, have there been any warnings around here recently\u2014about black bears?\" \"No, sir. But it's always good to keep your distance and store your food correctly. Have you seen the new bear-safe canisters? They only weigh two pounds\u2026\" The doors slid open to let me out into the rain. I hunched over inside my jacket as I\u00a0 dashed for my truck. The rain hammering against my hood sounded unusually loud, too, but soon the roar of the engine drowned out everything else. I didn't want to go back to Charlie's empty house. Last night had been particularly brutal, and I had no desire to <em>revisit</em> the scene of the suffering. Even after the pain had subsided enough for me to sleep, it wasn't over. Like I'd told Jessica after the movie, there was never any doubt that I would have nightmares. I always had nightmares now, every night. Not nightmares really, not in the plural,\u00a0 because it was always the same nightmare. You'd think I'd get bored after so many months, grow immune to it. But the dream never failed to horrify me, and only ended when I woke myself with screaming. Charlie didn't come in to see what was wrong anymore, to make sure there was no intruder strangling me or something like that\u2014he was used to it now. My nightmare probably wouldn't even frighten someone else. Nothing jumped out and screamed, \"Boo!\" There were no zombies, no ghosts, no psychopaths. There was nothing, really. Only nothing. Just the endless maze of moss-covered trees, so quiet that the silence was an uncomfortable pressure against my eardrums. It was dark, like dusk on a cloudy day, with only enough light to see that there was nothing to see. I hurried through the gloom without a path, always searching, searching, searching, getting more frantic as the time stretched on, trying to move faster, though the speed made me clumsy\u2026 Then there would come the point in my dream\u2014and I could feel it coming now, but could never seem to wake myself up before it hit\u2014when I couldn't remember what it was that I was searching for. When I realized that there was nothing to search for, and nothing to find.  That there never had been anything more than just this empty, dreary wood, and there never would be anything more for me\u2026 nothing but nothing\u2026 That was usually about when the screaming started. I wasn't paying attention to where I was driving\u2014just wandering through empty, wet side roads as I avoided the ways that would take me home\u2014because I didn't have anywhere to go.  I wished I could feel numb again, but I couldn't remember how I'd managed it before. The nightmare was nagging at my mind and making me think about things that would cause me pain. I didn't want to remember the forest. Even as I shuddered away from the images, I felt my eyes fill with tears and the aching begin around the edges of the hole in my chest. I took one hand from the steering wheel and wrapped it around my torso to hold it in one piece. It will be as if I'd never existed. The words ran through my head, lacking the perfect clarity of my hallucination last night. They were just words, soundless, like print on a page. Just words, but they ripped the hole wide open, and I stomped on the brake, knowing I should not drive while this incapacitated. I curled over, pressing my face against the steering wheel and trying to breathe without lungs. S\u1ebd nh\u01b0 th\u1ec3 t\u00f4i ch\u01b0a h\u1ec1 t\u1ed3n t\u1ea1i tr\u00ean \u0111\u1eddi n\u00e0y I wondered how long this could last. Maybe someday, years from now\u2014if the pain would just decrease to the point where I could bear it\u2014I would be able to look back on those few short months that would always be the best of my life. And, if it were possible that the pain would ever soften enough to allow me to do that, I was sure that I would feel grateful for as much time as he'd given me. More than I'd asked for, more than I'd deserved. Maybe someday I'd be able to see it that way. But what if this hole never got any better? If the raw edges never healed? If the damage was permanent and irreversible? I held myself tightly together. As if he'd never existed, I thought in despair. What a stupid and impossible promise to make! He could steal my pictures and reclaim his gifts, but that didn't put things back the way they'd been before I'd met him. The physical evidence was the most insignificant part of the equation. I was changed, my insides altered almost past the point of recognition. Even my outsides looked different\u2014my face sallow, white except for the purple circles the nightmares had left under my eyes. My eyes were dark enough against my pallid skin that\u2014if I were beautiful, and seen from a distance\u2014I might even pass for a vampire now. But I was not beautiful, and I probably looked closer to a zombie. Nh\u01b0 th\u1ec3 anh ch\u01b0a t\u1eebng t\u1ed3n t\u1ea1i tr\u00ean \u0111\u1eddi n\u00e0y As if he'd never existed? That was insanity. It was a promise that he could never keep, a promise that was broken as soon as he'd made it. I thumped my head against the steering wheel, trying to distract myself from the sharper pain. It made me feel silly for ever worrying about keeping my promise. Where was the logic in sticking to an agreement that had already been violated by the other party? Who cared if I was reckless and stupid? There was no reason to avoid recklessness, no reason why I shouldn't get to be stupid. I laughed humorlessly to myself, still gasping for air. Reckless in Forks\u2014now there was a hopeless proposition. The dark humor distracted me, and the distraction eased the pain. My breath came easier, and I was able to lean back against the seat. Though it was cold today, my forehead was damp with sweat. I concentrated on my hopeless proposition to keep from sliding back into the excruciating memories. To be reckless in Forks would take a lot of creativity\u2014maybe more than I had. But I wished I could find some way\u2026 I might feel better if I weren't holding fast, all alone, to a broken pact. If I were an oath-breaker, too. But how could I cheat on my side of the deal, here in this harmless little town? Of course, Forks hadn't always been so harmless, but now it was exactly what it had always appeared to be. It was dull, it was safe. I stared out the windshield for a long moment, my thoughts moving sluggishly\u2014I couldn't seem to make those thoughts go anywhere. I cut the engine, which was groaning in a pitiful way after idling for so long, and stepped out into the drizzle. The cold rain dripped through my hair and then trickled across my cheeks like freshwater tears. It helped to clear my head. I blinked the water from my eyes, staring blankly across the road. After a minute of staring, I recognized where I was. I'd parked in the middle of the north lane of Russell Avenue. I was standing in front of the Cheneys' house\u2014my truck was blocking their driveway\u2014and across the road lived the Markses. I knew I needed to move my truck, and that I ought to go home. It was wrong to wander the way I had, distracted and impaired, a menace on the roads of Forks. Besides, someone would notice me soon enough, and report me to Charlie. As I took a deep breath in preparation to move, a sign in the Markses' yard caught my eye\u2014it was just a big piece of cardboard leaning against their mailbox post, with black letters scrawled in caps across it. Sometimes, kismet happens. Coincidence? Or was it meant to be? I didn't know, but it seemed kind of silly to think that it was somehow fated, that the dilapidated motorcycles rusting in the Markses' front yard beside the hand-printed FOR SALE, AS IS sign were serving some higher purpose by existing there, right where I needed them to be. So maybe it wasn't kismet. Maybe there were just all kinds of ways to be reckless, and I only now had my eyes open to them. Reckless and stupid. Those were Charlie's two very favorite words to apply to motorcycles. Charlie's job didn't get a lot of action compared to cops in bigger towns, but he did get called in on traffic accidents. With the long, wet stretches of freeway twisting and turning through the forest, blind corner after blind corner, there was no shortage of that kind of action. But even with all the huge log-haulers barreling around the turns, mostly people walked away. The exceptions to that rule were often on motorcycles, and Charlie had seen one too many victims, almost always kids, smeared on the highway. He'd made me promise before I was ten that I would never accept a ride on a motorcycle. Even at that age, I didn't have to think twice before promising. Who would want to ride a motorcycle here? It would be like taking a sixty-mile-per-hour bath. So many promises I kept\u2026 It clicked together for me then. I wanted to be stupid and reckless, and I wanted to break promises. Why stop at one? That's as far as I thought it through. I sloshed through the rain to the Markses' front door and rang the bell. One of the Marks boys opened the door, the younger one, the freshman. I couldn't remember his name. His sandy hair only came up to my shoulder. He had no trouble remembering my name. \"Bella Swan?\" he asked in surprise. \"How much do you want for the bike?\" I panted, jerking my thumb over my shoulder toward the sales display. \"Are you serious?\" he demanded. \"Of course I am.\" \"They don't work.\" I sighed impatiently\u2014this was something I'd already inferred from the sign. \"How much?\" \"If you really want one, just take it. My mom made my dad move them down to the road so they'd get picked up with the garbage.\" I glanced at the bikes again and saw that they were resting on a pile of yard clippings and dead branches. \"Are you positive about that?\" \"Sure, you want to ask her?\" It was probably better not to involve adults who might mention this to Charlie. \"No, I believe you.\" \"You want me to help you?\" he offered. \"They're not light.\" \"Okay, thanks. I only need one, though.\" \"Might as well take both,\" the boy said. \"Maybe you could scavenge some parts.\" He followed me out into the downpour and helped me load both of the heavy bikes into the back of my truck. He seemed eager to be rid of them, so I didn't argue. \"What are you going to do with them, anyway?\" he asked. \"They haven't worked in years.\" \"I kind of guessed that,\" I said, shrugging. My spur-of-the-moment whim hadn't come with a plan intact. \"Maybe I'll take them to Dowling's.\" He snorted. \"Dowling would charge more to fix them than they'd be worth running.\" I couldn't argue with that. John Dowling had earned a reputation for his pricing; no one went to him except in an emergency. Most people preferred to make the drive up to Port Angeles, if their car was able. I'd been very lucky on that front\u2014I'd been worried, when Charlie first gifted me my ancient truck, that I wouldn't be able to afford to keep it running. But I'd never had a single problem with it, other than the screaming-loud engine and the fifty-five-mile-per-hour maximum speed limit. Jacob Black had kept it in great shape when it had belonged to his father, Billy\u2026 Inspiration hit like a bolt of lightning\u2014not unreasonable, considering the storm. \"You know what? That's okay. I know someone who builds cars.\" \"Oh. That's good.\" He smiled in relief. He waved as I pulled away, still smiling. Friendly kid. I drove quickly and purposefully now, in a hurry to get home before there was the slightest chance of Charlie appearing, even in the highly unlikely event that he might knock off early. I dashed through the house to the phone, keys still in hand. \"Chief Swan, please,\" I said when the deputy answered. \"It's Bella.\" \"Oh, hey, Bella,\" Deputy Steve said affably. \"I'll go get him.\" I waited. \"What's wrong, Bella?\" Charlie demanded as soon as he picked up the phone. \"Can't I call you at work without there being an emergency?\" He was quiet for a minute. \"You never have before. Is there an emergency?\" \"No. I just wanted directions to the Blacks' place\u2014I'm not sure I can remember the way. I want to visit Jacob. I haven't seen him in months.\" When Charlie spoke again, his voice was much happier. \"That's a great idea, Bells. Do you have a pen?\" The directions he gave me were very simple. I assured him that I would be back for dinner, though he tried to tell me not to hurry. He wanted to join me in La Push, and I wasn't having that. So it was with a deadline that I drove too quickly through the storm-darkened streets out of town. I hoped I could get Jacob alone. Billy would probably tell on me if he knew what I was up to. While I drove, I worried a little bit about Billy's reaction to seeing me. He would be too pleased. In Billy's mind, no doubt, this had all worked out better than he had dared to hope. His pleasure and relief would only remind me of the one I couldn't bear to be reminded of. Not again today, I pleaded silently. I was spent. The Blacks' house was vaguely familiar, a small wooden place with narrow windows, the dull red paint making it resemble a tiny barn. Jacob's head peered out of the window before I could even get out of the truck. No doubt the familiar roar of the engine had tipped him off to my approach. Jacob had been very grateful when Charlie bought Billy's truck for me, saving Jacob from having to drive it when he came of age. I liked my truck very much, but Jacob seemed to consider the speed restrictions a shortcoming. He met me halfway to the house. \"Bella!\" His excited grin stretched wide across his face, the bright teeth standing in vivid contrast to the deep russet color of his skin. I'd never seen his hair out of its usual ponytail before. It fell like black satin curtains on either side of his broad face. Jacob had grown into some of his potential in the last eight months. He'd passed that point where the soft muscles of childhood hardened into the solid, lanky build of a teenager; the tendons and veins had become prominent under the red-brown skin of his arms, his hands. His face was still sweet like I remembered it, though it had hardened, too\u2014the planes of his cheekbones sharper, his jaw squared off, all childish roundness gone. \"Hey, Jacob!\" I felt an unfamiliar surge of enthusiasm at his smile. I realized that I was pleased to see him. This knowledge surprised me. I smiled back, and something clicked silently into place, like two corresponding puzzle pieces. I'd forgotten how much I really liked Jacob Black. He stopped a few feet away from me, and I stared up at him in surprise, leaning my head back though the rain pelted my face. \"You grew again!\" I accused in amazement. He laughed, his smile widening impossibly. \"Six five,\" he announced with self-satisfaction. His voice was deeper, but it had the husky tone I remembered. \"Is it ever going to stop?\" I shook my head in disbelief. \"You're huge.\" \"Still a beanpole, though.\" He grimaced. \"Come inside! You're getting all wet.\" He led the way, twisting his hair in his big hands as he walked. He pulled a rubber band from his hip pocket and wound it around the bundle. \"Hey, Dad,\" he called as he ducked to get through the front door. \"Look who stopped by.\" Billy was in the tiny square living room, a book in his hands. He set the book in his lap and wheeled himself forward when he saw me. \"Well, what do you know! It's good to see you, Bella.\" We shook hands. Mine was lost in his wide grasp. \"What brings you out here? Everything okay with Charlie?\" \"Yes, absolutely. I just wanted to see Jacob\u2014I haven't seen him in forever.\" Jacob's eyes brightened at my words. He was smiling so big it looked like it would hurt his cheeks.  \"Can you stay for dinner?\" Billy was eager, too. \"No, I've got to feed Charlie, you know.\" \"I'll call him now,\" Billy suggested. \"He's always invited.\" I laughed to hide my discomfort. \"It's not like you'll never see me again. I promise I'll be back again soon\u2014so much you'll get sick of me.\" After all, if Jacob could fix the bike, someone had to teach me how to ride it. Billy chuckled in response. \"Okay, maybe next time.\" \"So, Bella, what do you want to do?\" Jacob asked. \"Whatever. What were you doing before I interrupted?\" I was strangely comfortable here. It was familiar, but only distantly. There were no painful reminders of the recent past. Jacob hesitated. \"I was just heading out to work on my car, but we can do something else\u2026\" \"No, that's perfect!\" I interrupted. \"I'd love to see your car.\" \"Okay,\" he said, not convinced. \"It's out back, in the garage.\" Even better, I thought to myself. I waved at Billy. \"See you later.\" A thick stand of trees and shrubbery concealed his garage from the house. The garage\u00a0\u00a0 was no more than a couple of big preformed sheds that had been bolted together with their interior walls knocked out.  Under this shelter, raised on cinder blocks, was what looked to me like a completed automobile. I recognized the symbol on the grille, at least. \"What kind of Volkswagen is that?\" I asked. \"It's an old Rabbit\u20141986, a classic.\" \"How's it going?\" \"Almost finished,\" he said cheerfully. And then his voice dropped into a lower key. \"My dad made good on his promise last spring.\" \"Ah,\" I said. He seemed to understand my reluctance to open the subject. I tried not to remember last May at the prom. Jacob had been bribed by his father with money and car parts to deliver a message there. Billy wanted me to stay a safe distance from the most important person in my life. It turned out that his concern was, in the end, unnecessary. I was all too safe now. But I was going to see what I could do to change that. \"Jacob, what do you know about motorcycles?\" I asked. He shrugged. \"Some. My friend Embry has a dirt bike. We work on it together sometimes. Why?\" \"Well\u2026\" I pursed my lips as I considered. I wasn't sure if he could keep his mouth shut, but I didn't have many other options. \"I recently acquired a couple of bikes, and they're not in the greatest condition. I wonder if you could get them running?\" \"Cool.\" He seemed truly pleased by the challenge. His face glowed. \"I'll give it a try.\" I held up one finger in warning. \"The thing is,\" I explained, \"Charlie doesn't approve of motorcycles. \u00a0Honestly, he'd probably bust a vein in his forehead if he knew about this. So you can't tell Billy.\" \"Sure, sure.\" Jacob smiled. \"I understand.\" \"I'll pay you,\" I continued. This offended him. \"No. I want to help. You can't pay me.\" \"Well\u2026 how about a trade, then?\" I was making this up as I went, but it seemed reasonable enough. \"I only need one bike\u2014and I'll need lessons, too. So how about this? I'll give you the other bike, and then you can teach me.\" \"Swee-eet.\" He made the word into two syllables. \"Wait a sec\u2014are you legal yet? When's your birthday?\" \"You missed it,\" he teased, narrowing his eyes in mock resentment. \"I'm sixteen.\" \"Not that your age ever stopped you before,\" I muttered. \"Sorry about your birthday.\" \"Don't worry about it. I missed yours. What are you, forty?\" I sniffed. \"Close.\" \"We'll have a joint party to make up for it.\" \"Sounds like a date.\" His eyes sparkled at the word. I needed to reign in the enthusiasm before I gave him the wrong idea\u2014it was just that it had been a long time since I'd felt so light and buoyant. The rarity of the feeling made it more difficult to manage. \"Maybe when the bikes are finished\u2014our present to ourselves,\" I added. \"Deal. When will you bring them down?\" I bit my lip, embarrassed. \"They're in my truck now,\" I admitted. \"Great.\" He seemed to mean it. \"Will Billy see if we bring them around?\" He winked at me. \"We'll be sneaky.\" We eased around from the east, sticking to the trees when we were in view of the windows, affecting a casual-looking stroll, just in case. Jacob unloaded the bikes swiftly from the truck bed, wheeling them one by one into the shrubbery where I hid. It looked too easy for him\u2014I'd remembered the bikes being much, much heavier than that. \"These aren't half bad,\" Jacob appraised as we pushed them through the cover of the trees. \"This one here will actually be worth something when I'm done\u2014it's an old Harley Sprint.\" \"That one's yours, then.\" \"Are you sure?\" \"Absolutely.\" \"These are going to take some cash, though,\" he said, frowning down at the blackened metal. \"We'll have to save up for parts first.\" \"We nothing,\" I disagreed. \"If you're doing this for free, I'll pay for the parts.\" \"I don't know\u2026\" he muttered. \"I've got some money saved. College fund, you know.\" College, schmollege, I thought to myself. It wasn't like I'd saved up enough to go anywhere special\u2014and besides, I had no desire to leave Forks anyway. What difference would it make if I skimmed a little bit off the top? Jacob just nodded. This all made perfect sense to him. As we skulked back to the makeshift garage, I contemplated my luck. Only a teenage boy would agree to this: deceiving both our parents while repairing dangerous vehicles using money meant for my college education. He didn't see anything wrong with that picture. Jacob was a gift from the gods.",

            "en": "7 REPETITION         3. The truth I had the sense that i'd been asleep for a very long time\u2014my body was stiff, like i hadn't moved once through all that time, either. My mind was dazed and slow; strange, colorful dreams\u2014dreams and nightmares\u2014swirled dizzily around the inside of my head. They were so vivid. The horrible and the heavenly, all mixed together into a bizarre jumble. There was sharp impatience and fear, both part of that frustrating dream where your feet can't move fast enough\u2026 and there were plenty of monsters, red-eyed fiends that were all the more ghastly for their genteel civility. The dream was still strong\u2014i could even remember the names. But the strongest, clearest part of the dream was not the horror. It was the angel that was most clear. It was hard to let him go and wake up. This dream did not want to be shoved away into the vault of dreams I refused to <em>revisit</em>. I struggled with it as my mind became more alert, focusing on reality. I couldn't remember what day of the week it was, but I was sure Jacob or school or work or something was waiting for me. I inhaled deeply, wondering how to face another day. Something cold touched my forehead with the softest pressure. I squeezed my eyes more tightly shut. I was still dreaming, it seemed, and it felt \u00a0abnormally real. I was so close to waking\u2026 any second now, and it would be gone. But I realized that it felt too real, too real to be good for me. The stone arms I imagined wrapped around me were far too substantial. If I let this go any further, I'd be sorry for it later. With a resigned sigh, I wrenched back my eyelids to dispel the illusion. \"Oh!\" I gasped, and threw my fists over my eyes. Well, clearly, I'd gone too far; it must have been a mistake to let my imagination get so out of hand. Okay, so \"let\" was the wrong word. I'd forced it to get out of hand\u2014pretty much stalked my hallucinations\u2014and now my mind had snapped. It took less than half a second for me to realize that, as long as I was truly insane now, I might as well enjoy the delusions while they were pleasant. I opened my eyes again\u2014and Edward was still there, his perfect face just inches away from mine. \"Did I frighten you?\" His low voice was anxious. This was very good, as delusions went. The face, the voice, the scent, everything\u2014it was so much better than drowning. The beautiful figment of my imagination watched my changing expressions, with alarm. His irises were pitch-black, with bruise-like shadows under them. This surprised me; my hallucinatory Edwards were usually better fed. I blinked twice, desperately trying to remember the last thing that I was sure was real. Alice was part of my dream, and I wondered if she had really come back at all, or if that was just the preamble. I thought she'd returned the day I'd nearly drowned\u2026 \"Oh, crap\" I croaked. My throat was thick with sleeping. \"What's wrong, Bella?\" I frowned at him unhappily. His face was even more anxious than before. \"I'm dead, right?\" I moaned. \"I did drown. Crap, crap, crap! This is gonna kill Charlie.\" Edward frowned, too. \"You're not dead.\" \"Then why am I not waking up?\" I challenged, raising my eyebrows. \"You are awake, Bella.\" I shook my head. \"Sure, sure. That's what you want me to think. And then it will be worse when I do wake up. If I wake up, which I won't, because I'm dead. This is awful. Poor Charlie. And Renee and Jake\u2026\" I trailed off in horror at what I had done. \"I can see where you might confuse me with a nightmare.\" His short-lived smile was grim. \"But I can't imagine what you could have done to wind up in hell. Did you commit many murders while I was away?\" I grimaced. \"Obviously not. If I was in hell, you wouldn't be with me.\" He sighed. My head was getting clearer. My eyes flickered away from his face\u2014unwillingly\u2014for one second, to the dark, open window, and then back to him. I started to remember details\u2026 and I felt a faint, unfamiliar blush warm the skin over my cheekbones as I slowly realized that Edward was really, truly here with me, and I was wasting time being an idiot. \"Did all of that really happen, then?\" It was almost impossible to reassign my dream as reality. I couldn't wrap my head around the concept. \"That depends.\" Edward's smile was still hard. \"If you're referring to us nearly being massacred in Italy, then, yes.\" \"How strange,\" I mused. \"I really went to Italy. Did you know I'd never been farther east than Albuquerque?\" He rolled his eyes. \"Maybe you should go back to sleep. You're not coherent.\" \"I'm not tired anymore.\" It was all coming clear now. \"What time is it? How long have I been sleeping?\" \"It's just after one in the morning. So, about fourteen hours.\" I stretched as he spoke. I was so stiff. \"Charlie?\" I asked. Edward frowned. \"Sleeping. You should probably know that I'm breaking the rules right now. Well, not technically, since he said I was never to walk through his door again, and I came in the window\u2026 But, still, the intent was clear.\" \"Charlie banned you from the house?\" I asked, disbelief quickly melting into fury. His eyes were sad. \"Did you expect anything else?\" My eyes were mad. I was going to have a few words with my father\u2014perhaps it would be a good time to remind him that I was over the legal age of adulthood. It didn't matter so much, of course, except in principle. All too soon there would be no reason for the prohibition. I turned my thoughts to less painful avenues. \"What's the story?\" I asked, genuinely curious, but also trying desperately to keep the conversation casual, to keep a firm grip on myself, so I wouldn't scare him away with the frantic, gnawing craving that was raging inside me. \"What do you mean?\" \"What am I telling Charlie? What's my excuse for disappearing for\u2026 how long was I gone, anyway?\" I tried to count the hours in my head. \"Just three days.\" His eyes tightened, but he smiled more naturally this time. \"Actually, I was hoping you might have a good explanation. I've got nothing.\" I groaned. \"Fabulous.\" \"Well, maybe Alice will come up with something,\" he offered, trying to comfort me. And I was comforted. Who cared what I had to deal with later? Every second that he was here\u2014so close, his flawless face glowing in the dim light from the numbers on my alarm clock\u2014was precious and not to be wasted. \"So,\" I began, picking the least important\u2014though still vitally interesting\u2014question to start with. I was safely delivered home, and he might decide to leave at any moment. I had to keep him talking. Besides, this temporary heaven wasn't entirely complete without the sound of his voice. \"What have you been doing, up until three days ago?\" His face turned wary in an instant. \"Nothing terribly exciting.\" \"Of course not,\" I mumbled. \"Why are you making that face?\" \"Well\u2026\" I pursed my lips, considering. \"If you were, after all, just a dream, that's exactly the kind of thing you would say. My imagination must be used up.\" He sighed. \"If I tell you, will you finally believe that you're not having a nightmare?\" \"Nightmare!\" I repeated scornfully. He waited for my answer. \"Maybe,\" I said after a second of thought. \"If you tell me.\" \"I was\u2026 hunting.\" \"Is that the best you can do?\" I criticized. \"That definitely doesn't prove I'm awake.\" He hesitated, and then spoke slowly, choosing his words with care. \"I wasn't hunting for food\u2026 I was actually trying my hand at\u2026 tracking. I'm not very good at it.\" \"What were you tracking?\" I asked, intrigued. \"Nothing of consequence.\" His words didn't match his expression; he looked upset, uncomfortable. \"I don't understand.\" He hesitated; his face, shining with an odd green cast from the light of the clock, was torn. \"I\u2014\" He took a deep breath. \"I owe you an apology. No, of course I owe you much, \u00a0much more than that. But you have to know,\"\u2014the words began to flow so fast, the way I remembered he spoke sometimes when he was agitated, that I really had to concentrate to catch them all\u2014\"that I had no idea. I didn't realize the mess I was leaving behind. I thought it was safe for you here. So safe. I had no idea that Victoria,\"\u2014his lips curled back when he said the name\u2014\"would come back. I'll admit, when I saw her that one time, I was paying much more attention to James's thoughts. But I just didn't see that she had this kind of response in her. That she even had such a tie to him. I think I realize why now\u2014she was so sure of him, the thought of him failing never occurred to her. It was her overconfidence that clouded her feelings about him\u2014that kept me from seeing the depth of them, the bond there. \"Not that there's any excuse for what I left you to face. When I heard what you told Alice\u2014what she saw herself\u2014when I realized that you had to put your life in the hands of werewolves, immature, volatile, the worst thing out there besides Victoria herself\u2014he shuddered and the gush of words halted for a short second. \"Please know that I had no idea of any of this. I feel sick, sick to my core, even now, when I can see and feel you safe in my arms. I am the most miserable excuse for\u2014\" \"Stop,\" I interrupted him. He stared at me with agonized eyes, and I tried to find the right words\u2014the words that would free him from this imagined obligation that caused him so much pain. They were very hard words to say. I didn't know if I could get them out without breaking down. But I had to try to do it right. I didn't want to be a source of guilt and anguish in his life. He should be happy, no matter what it cost me. I'd really been hoping to put off this part of our last conversation. It was going to bring things to an end so much sooner. Drawing on all my months of practice with trying to be normal for Charlie, I kept my face smooth.  \"Edward,\" I said. His name burned my throat a little on the way out. I could feel the ghost of the hole, waiting to rip itself wide again as soon as he disappeared. I didn't quite see how I was going to survive it this time. \"This has to stop now. You can't think about things that way. You can't let this\u2026 this guilt\u2026 rule your life. You can't take responsibility for the things that happen to me here. None of it is your fault, it's just part of how life is for me. So, if I trip in front of a bus or whatever it is next time, you have to realize that it's not your job to take the blame. You can't just go running off to Italy \u00a0because you feel bad that you didn't save me. Even if I had jumped off that cliff to die, that would have been my choice, and not your fault. I know it's your\u2026 your nature to shoulder the blame for everything, but you really can't let that make you go to such extremes! It's very irresponsible\u2014think of Esme and Carlisle and\u2014\" I was on the edge of losing it. I stopped to take a deep breath, hoping to calm myself. I had to set him free. I had to make sure this never happened again. \"Isabella Marie Swan,\" he whispered, the strangest expression crossing his face. He almost looked mad. \"Do you believe that I asked the Volturi to kill me because I felt guilty?\" I could feel the blank incomprehension on my face. \"Didn't you?\" \"Feel guilty? Intensely so. More than you can comprehend.\" \"Then\u2026 what are you saying? I don't understand.\" \"Bella, I went to the Volturi because I thought you were dead,\" he said, voice soft, eyes fierce. \"Even if I'd had no hand in your death\"\u2014he shuddered as he whispered the last word\u2014\"even if it wasn't my fault, I would have gone to Italy. Obviously, I should have been more careful\u2014I should have spoken to Alice directly, rather than accepting it secondhand from Rosalie. But, really, what was I supposed to think when the boy said Charlie was at the funeral? What are the odds? \"The odds\u2026\" he muttered then, distracted. His voice was so low I wasn't sure I heard it right. \"The odds are always stacked against us. Mistake after mistake. I'll never criticize Romeo again.\" \"But I still don't understand,\" I said. \"That's my whole point. So what?\" \"Excuse me?\" \"So what if I was dead?\" He stared at me dubiously for a long moment before answering. \"Don't you remember anything I told you before?\" \"I remember everything that you told me.\" Including the words that had negated all the rest. He brushed the tip of his cool finger against my lower lip. \"Bella, you seem to be under a misapprehension.\" He closed his eyes, shaking his head back and forth with half a smile on his beautiful face. It wasn't a happy smile. \"I thought I'd explained it clearly before. Bella, I can't live in a world where you don't exist.\" \"I am\u2026\" My head swam as I looked for the appropriate word. \"Confused.\" That worked. I couldn't make sense of what he was saying. He stared deep into my eyes with his sincere, earnest gaze. \"I'm a good liar, Bella, I have to be.\" I froze, my muscles locking down as if for impact. The fault line in my chest rippled; the pain of it took my breath away. He shook my shoulder, trying to loosen my rigid pose. \"Let me finish! I'm a good liar, but still, for you to believe me so quickly.\" He winced. \"That was\u2026 excruciating.\" I waited, still frozen. \"When we were in the forest, when I was telling you goodbye\u2014\" I didn't allow myself to remember. I fought to keep myself in the present second only. \"You weren't going to let go,\" he whispered. \"I could see that. I didn't want to do it\u2014it felt like it would kill me to do it\u2014but I knew that if I couldn't convince you that I didn't love you anymore, it would just take you that much longer to get on with your life. I hoped that, if you thought I'd moved on, so would you.\" \"A clean break,\" I whispered through unmoving lips. \"Exactly. But I never imagined it would be so easy to do! I thought it would be next to impossible\u2014that you would be so sure of the truth that I would have to lie through my teeth for hours to even plant the seed of doubt in your head. I lied, and I'm so sorry\u2014sorry because I hurt you, sorry because it was a worthless effort. Sorry that I couldn't protect you from what I an. I lied to save you, and it didn't work. I'm sorry. \"But how could you believe me? After all the thousand times I've told you I love you, how could you let one word break your faith in me?\" I didn't answer. I was too shocked to form a rational response. \"I could see it in your eyes, that you honestly believed that I didn't want you anymore. The most absurd, ridiculous concept\u2014as if there were any way that I could exist without needing you!\" I was still frozen. His words were incomprehensible, because they were impossible. He shook my shoulder again, not hard, but enough that my teeth rattled a little. \"Bella,\" he sighed. \"Really, what were you thinking!\" And so I started to cry. The tears welled up and then gushed miserably down my cheeks. \"I knew it,\" I sobbed. \"I knew I was dreaming.\" \"You're impossible,\" he said, and he laughed once\u2014a hard laugh, frustrated. \"How can I put this so that you'll believe me? You're not asleep, and you're not dead. I'm here, and I love you. I have always loved you, and I will always love you. I was thinking of you, seeing your face in my mind, every second that I was away. When I told you that I didn't want you, it was the very blackest kind of blasphemy.\" I shook my head while the tears continued to ooze from the corners of my eyes. \"You don't believe me, do you?\" he whispered, his face paler than his usual pale\u2014I could see that even in the dim light. \"Why can you believe the lie, but not the truth?\" \"It never made sense for you to love me,\" I explained, my voice breaking twice. \"I always knew that.\" His eyes narrowed, his jaw tightened. \"I'll prove you're awake,\" he promised. He caught my face securely between his iron hands, ignoring my struggles when I tried to turn my head away. \"Please don't,\" I whispered. He stopped, his lips just half an inch from mine. \"Why not?\" he demanded. His breath blew into my face, making my head whirl. \"When I wake up\"\u2014He opened his mouth to protest, so I revised\u2014\"okay, forget that one\u2014when you leave again, it's going to be hard enough without this, too.\" He pulled back an inch, to stare at my face. \"Yesterday, when I would touch you, you were so\u2026 hesitant, so careful, and yet still the same. I need to know why. Is it because I'm too late? Because I've hurt you too much? Because you have moved on, as I meant for you to? That would be\u2026 quite fair. I won't contest your decision. So don't try to spare my feelings, please\u2014just tell me now whether or not you can still love me, after everything I've done to you.\u00a0 Can you?\" he whispered. \"What kind of an idiotic question is that?\" \"Just answer it. Please.\" I stared at him darkly for a long moment. \"The way I feel about you will never change. Of course I love you\u2014and there's nothing you can do about it!\" \"That's all I needed to hear.\" His mouth was on mine then, and I couldn't fight him. Not because he was so many thousand times stronger than me, but because my will crumbled into dust the second our lips met. This kiss was not quite as careful as others I remembered, which suited me just fine. If I was going to rip myself up further, I might as well get as much in trade as possible. So I kissed him back, my heart pounding out a jagged, disjointed rhythm while my breathing turned to panting and my fingers moved greedily to his face. I could feel his marble body against every line of mine, and I was so glad he hadn't listened to me\u2014there was no pain in the world that would have justified missing this. His hands memorized my face, the same way mine were tracing his, and, in the brief seconds when his lips were free, he whispered my name. When I was starting to get dizzy, he pulled away, only to lay his ear against my heart. I lay there, dazed, waiting for my gasping to slow and quiet. \"By the way,\" he said in a casual tone. \"I'm not leaving you.\" I didn't say anything, and he seemed to hear skepticism in my silence. He lifted his face to lock my gaze in his. \"I'm not going anywhere. Not without you,\" he added more seriously. \"I only left you in the first place because I wanted you to have a chance at a normal, happy, human life. I could see what I was doing to you\u2014keeping you constantly on the edge of danger, taking you away from the world you belonged in, risking your life every moment I was with you. So I had to try. I had to do something, and it seemed like leaving was the only way. If I hadn't thought you would be better off, I could have never made myself leave. I'm much too selfish. Only you could be more important than what I wanted\u2026 what I needed. What I want and need is to be with you, and I know I'll never be strong enough to leave again. I have too many excuses to stay\u2014thank heaven for that! It seems you can't be safe, no matter how many miles I put between us.\" \"Don't promise me anything,\" I whispered. If I let myself hope, and it came to nothing\u2026 that would kill me. Where all those merciless vampires had not been able to finish me off, hope would do the job. Anger glinted metallic in his black eyes. \"You think I'm lying to you now?\" \"No\u2014not lying.\" I shook my head, trying to think it through coherently. To examine the hypothesis that he did love me, while staying objective, clinical, so I wouldn't fall into the trap of hoping. \"You could mean it\u2026 now. But what about tomorrow, when you think about all the reasons you left in the first place? Or next month, when Jasper takes a snap at me?\" He flinched. I thought back over those last days of my life before he left me, tried to see them through the filter of what he was telling me now. From that perspective, imagining that he'd left me while loving me, left me for me, his brooding and cold silences took on a different meaning. \"It isn't as if you hadn't thought the first decision through, is it?\" I guessed. \"You'll end up doing what you think is right.\" \"I'm not as strong as you give me credit for,\" he said. \"Right and wrong have ceased to mean much to me; I was coming back anyway. Before Rosalie told me the news, I was already past trying to live through one week at a time, or even one day. I was fighting to make it through a single hour. It was only a matter of time before I showed up at your window and begged you to take me back. I'd be happy to beg now, if you'd like that.\" I grimaced. \"Be serious, please.\" \"Oh, I am,\" he insisted, glaring now. \"Will you please try to hear what I'm telling you? Will you let me attempt to explain what you mean to me?\" He waited, studying my face as he spoke to make sure I was really listening. \"Before you, Bella, my life was like a moonless night. Very dark, but there were stars\u2014points of light and reason\u2026 And then you shot across my sky like a meteor. Suddenly everything was on fire; there was brilliancy, there was beauty. When you were gone, when the meteor had fallen over the horizon, everything went black. Nothing had changed, but my eyes were blinded by the light. I couldn't see the stars anymore. And there was no more reason for anything.\" I wanted to believe him. But this was my life without him that he was describing, not the other way around. \"Your eyes will adjust,\" I mumbled. \"That's just the problem\u2014they can't.\" \"What about your distractions?\" He laughed without a trace of humor. \"Just part of the lie, love. There was no distraction from the\u2026 the agony. My heart hasn't beat in almost ninety years, but this was different. It was like my heart was gone\u2014like I was hollow. Like I'd left everything that was inside me here with you.\" \"That's funny,\" I muttered. He arched one perfect eyebrow. \"Funny? \" \"I meant strange\u2014I thought it was just me. Lots of pieces of me went missing, too. I haven't been able to really breathe in so long.\" I filled my lungs, luxuriating in the sensation. \"And my heart. That was definitely lost.\" He closed his eyes and laid his ear over my heart again. I let my cheek press against his hair, felt the texture of it on my skin, smelled the delicious scent of him. \"Tracking wasn't a distraction then?\" I asked, curious, and also needing to distract myself. I was very much in danger of hoping. I wouldn't be able to stop myself for long. My heart throbbed, singing in my chest. \"No.\" He sighed. \"That was never a distraction. It was an obligation.\" \"What does that mean?\" \"It means that, even though I never expected any danger from Victoria, I wasn't going to let her get away with\u2026 Well, like I said, I was horrible at it. I traced her as far as Texas, but then I followed a false lead down to Brazil\u2014and really she came here.\" He groaned. \"I wasn't even on the right continent! And all the while, worse than my worst fears\u2014\" \"You were hunting Victoria?\" I half-shrieked as soon as I could find my voice, shooting through two octaves. Charlie's distant snores stuttered, and then picked up a regular rhythm again. \"Not well,\" Edward answered, studying my outraged expression with a confused look. \"But I'll do better this time. She won't be tainting perfectly good air by breathing in and out for much longer.\" \"That is\u2026 out of the question,\" I managed to choke out. Insanity. Even if he had Emmett or Jasper help him. Even if he had Emmett and Jasper help. It was worse than my other imaginings: Jacob Black standing across a small space from Victoria's vicious and feline figure. I couldn't bear to picture Edward there, even though he was so much more durable than my half-human best friend.  \"It's too late for her. I might have let the other time slide, but not now, not after\u2014\" I interrupted him again, trying to sound calm. \"Didn't you just promise that you weren't going to leave?\" I asked, fighting the words as I said them, nor letting them plant themselves in my heart. \"That isn't exactly compatible with an extended tracking expedition, is it?\" He frowned. A snarl began to build low in his chest. \"I will keep my promise, Bella. But Victoria\"\u2014the snarl became more pronounced\u2014\"is going to die. Soon.\" \"Let's not be hasty,\" I said, trying to hide my panic. \"Maybe she's not coming back. Jake's pack probably scared her off. There's really no reason to go looking for her. Besides, I've got bigger problems than Victoria.\" Edward's eyes narrowed, but he nodded. \"It's true. The werewolves are a problem.\" I snorted. \"I wasn't talking about Jacob. My problems are a lot worse that a handful of adolescent wolves getting themselves into trouble.\" Edward looked as if he were about to say something, and then thought better of it. His teeth clicked together, and he spoke through them. \"Really?\" he asked. \"Then what would be your greatest problem? That would make Victoria's returning for you seem like such an inconsequential matter in comparison?\" \"How about the second greatest?\" I hedged. \"All right,\" he agreed, suspicious. I paused. I wasn't sure I could say the name. \"There are others who are coming to look for me,\" I reminded him in a subdued whisper. He sighed, but the reaction was not as strong as I would have imagined after his response to Victoria. \"The Volturi are only the second greatest?\" \"You don't seem that upset about it,\" I noted. \"Well, we have plenty of time to think it through. Time means something very different to them than it does to you, or even me. They count years the way you count days. I wouldn't be surprised if you were thirty before you crossed their minds again,\" he added lightly. Horror washed through me. Thirty. So his promises meant nothing, in the end. If I were going to turn thirty someday, then he couldn't be planning on staying long. The harsh pain of this knowledge made me realize that I'd already begun to hope, without giving myself permission to do so. \"You don't have to be afraid,\" he said, anxious as he watched the tears dew up again on the rims of my eyes. \"I won't let them hurt you.\" \"While you're here.\" Not that I cared what happened to me when he left. He took my face between his two stone hands, holding it tightly while his midnight eyes glared into mine with the gravitational force of a black hole. \"I will never leave you again.\" \"But you said thirty,\" I whispered. The tears leaked over the edge. \"What? You're going to stay, but let me get all old anyway? Right.\" His eyes softened, while his mouth went hard. \"That's exactly what I'm going to do. What choice have I?\u00a0 I cannot be without you, but I will not destroy your soul.\" \"Is this really\u2026\" I tried to keep my voice even, but this question was too hard. I remembered his face when Aro had almost begged him to consider making me immortal. The sick look there. Was this fixation with keeping me human really about my soul, or was it because he wasn't sure that he wanted me around that long? \"Yes?\" he asked, waiting for my question. I asked a different one. Almost\u2014but not quite\u2014as hard. \"But what about when I get so old that people think I'm your mother? Your \u00a0grandmother?\" My voice was pale with revulsion\u2014I could see Gran's face again in the dream mirror. His whole face was soft now. He brushed the tears from my cheek with his lips. \"That doesn't mean anything to me,\" he breathed against my skin. \"You will always be the most beautiful thing in my world.\u00a0 Of course\u2026\" He hesitated, flinching slightly. \"If you outgrew me\u2014if you wanted something more\u2014I would understand that, Bella. I promise I wouldn't stand in your way if you wanted to leave me.\" His eyes were liquid onyx and utterly sincere. He spoke as if he'd put endless amounts of thought into this asinine plan. \"You do realize that I'll die eventually, right?\" I demanded. He'd thought about this part, too. \"I'll follow after as soon as I can.\" \"That is seriously\u2026\"I looked for the right word. \"Sick.\" \"Bella, it's the only right way left\u2014\" \"Let's just back up for a minute,\" I said; feeling angry made it so much easier to be clear, decisive. \"You do remember the Volturi, right? I can't stay human forever. They'll kill me. Even if they don't think of me till I'm thirty\"\u2014I hissed the word\u2014\"do you really think they'll forget?\" \"No,\" he answered slowly, shaking his head. \"They won't forget. But\u2026\" \"But?\" He grinned while I stared at him warily. Maybe I wasn't the only crazy one. \"I have a few plans.\" \"And these plans,\" I said, my voice getting more acidic with each word. \"These plans all center around me staying human.\" My attitude hardened his expression. \"Naturally.\" His tone was brusque, his divine face arrogant. We glowered at each other for a long minute. Then I took a deep breath, squared my shoulders, I pushed his arms away so that I could sit up. \"Do you want me to leave?\" he asked, and it made my heart flutter to see that this idea hurt him, though he tried not to show it. \"No,\" I told him. \"I'm leaving.\" He watched me suspiciously as I climbed out of the bed and fumbled around in the dark room, looking for my shoes. \"May I ask where you are going.'\" he asked. \"I'm going to your house,\" I told him, still feeling around blindly. He got up and came to my side. \"Here are your shoes. How did you plan to get there?\" \"My truck.\" \"That will probably wake Charlie,\" he offered as a deterrent. I sighed. \"I know. But honestly, I'll be grounded for weeks as it is. How much more trouble can I really get in?\" \"None. He'll blame me, not you.\" \"If you have a better idea, I'm all ears.\" \"Stay here,\" he suggested, but his expression wasn't hopeful. \"No dice. But you go ahead and make yourself at home,\" I encouraged, surprised at how natural my teasing sounded, and headed for the door. He was there before me, blocking my way. I frowned, and turned for the window. It wasn't really that far to the ground, and it was mostly grass beneath\u2026 \"Okay,\" he sighed. \"I'll give you a ride.\" I shrugged. \"Either way. But you probably should be there, too.\" \"And why is that?\" \"Because you're extraordinarily opinionated, and I'm sure you'll want a chance to air your views.\" \"My views on which subject?\" He asked through his teeth. \"This isn't just about you anymore. You're not the center of the universe, you know.\" My own personal universe was, of course, a different story. \"If you're going to bring the Volturi down on us over something as stupid as leaving me human, then your family ought to have a say.\" \"A say in what?\" he asked, each word distinct. \"My mortality. I'm putting it to a vote.\"",

            "en": "2      2. EVASION I felt oddly buoyant as I walked from Spanish toward the cafeteria, and it wasn\u2019t just because I was holding hands with the most perfect person on the planet, though that was certainly part of it. Maybe it was the knowledge that my sentence was served and I was a free woman again. Or maybe it wasn\u2019t anything to do with me specifically. Maybe it was the atmosphere of freedom that hung over the entire campus. School was winding down, and, for the senior class especially, there was a perceptible thrill in the air. Freedom was so close it was touchable, taste-able. Signs of it were everywhere. Posters crowded together on the cafeteria walls, and the trashcans wore a colorful skirt of spilled-over fliers: reminders to buy yearbooks, class rings, and announcements; deadlines to order graduation gowns, hats, and tassels; neon-bright sales pitches \u2014 the juniors campaigning for class office; ominous, rose-wreathed advertisements for this year\u2019s prom.  The big dance was this coming weekend, but I had an ironclad promise from Edward that I would not be subjected to that again. After all, I\u2019d already had that human experience. No, it must be my personal freedom that lightened me today. The ending of the school year did not give me the pleasure it seemed to give the other students. Actually, I felt nervous to the point of nausea whenever I thought of it. I tried to not think of it. But it was hard to escape such an omnipresent topic as graduation. \u201cHave you sent your announcements, yet?\u201d Angela asked when Edward and I sat down at our table. She had her light brown hair pulled back into a sloppy ponytail instead of her usual smooth hairdo, and there was a slightly frantic look about her eyes. Alice and Ben were already there, too, on either side of Angela. Ben was intent over a comic book, his glasses sliding down his narrow nose.  Alice was scrutinizing my boring jeans-and-a-t-shirt outfit in a way that made me self-conscious. Probably plotting another makeover. I sighed. My indifferent attitude to fashion was a constant thorn in her side. If I\u2019d allow it, she\u2019d love to dress me every day \u2014 perhaps several times a day \u2014 like some oversized three-dimensional paper doll. \u00a0\u201cNo,\u201d I answered Angela. \u201cThere\u2019s no point, really. Ren\u00e9e knows when I\u2019m graduating. Who else is there?\u201d \u201cHow about you, Alice?\u201d Alice smiled. \u201cAll done.\u201d \u201cLucky you.\u201d Angela sighed. \u201cMy mother has a thousand cousins and she expects me to hand-address one to everybody. I\u2019m going to get carpal tunnel. I can\u2019t put it off any longer and I\u2019m just dreading it.\u201d \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll help you,\u201d I volunteered. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind my awful handwriting.\u201d Charlie would like that. From the corner of my eye, I saw Edward smile. He must like that, too \u2014 me fulfilling Charlie\u2019s conditions without involving werewolves. Angela looked relieved. \u201cThat\u2019s so nice of you. I\u2019ll come over any time you want.\u201d \u201cActually, I\u2019d rather go to your house if that\u2019s okay \u2014 I\u2019m sick of mine. Charlie un-grounded me last night.\u201d I grinned as I announced my good news. \u201cReally?\u201d Angela asked, mild excitement lighting her always-gentle brown eyes. \u201cI thought you said you were in for life.\u201d \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m more surprised than you are. I was sure I would at least have finished high school before he set me free.\u201d \u201cWell, this is great, Bella! We\u2019ll have to go out to celebrate.\u201d \u00a0\u201cYou have no idea how good that sounds.\u201d \u201cWhat should we do?\u201d Alice mused, her face lighting up at the possibilities. Alice\u2019s ideas were usually a little grandiose for me, and I could see it in her eyes now \u2014 the tendency to take things too far kicking into action. \u201cWhatever you\u2019re thinking, Alice, I doubt I\u2019m that free.\u201d \u201cFree is free, right?\u201d she insisted. \u201cI\u2019m sure I still have boundaries \u2014 like the continental U.S., for example.\u201d Angela and Ben laughed, but Alice grimaced in real disappointment. \u201cSo what are we doing tonight?\u201d she persisted. \u201cNothing. Look, let\u2019s give it a couple of days to make sure he wasn\u2019t joking. It\u2019s a school night, anyway.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll celebrate this weekend, then.\u201d Alice\u2019s enthusiasm was impossible to repress. \u00a0\u201cSure,\u201d I said, hoping to placate her. I knew I wasn\u2019t going to do anything too outlandish; it would be safer to take it slow with Charlie. Give him a chance to appreciate how trustworthy and mature I was before I asked for any favors. Angela and Alice started talking about options; Ben joined the conversation, setting his comics aside. My attention drifted. I was surprised to find that the subject of my freedom was suddenly not as gratifying as it had been just a moment ago. While they discussed things to do in Port Angeles or maybe Hoquiam, I began to feel disgruntled. It didn\u2019t take long to determine where my restlessness stemmed from. Ever since I\u2019d said goodbye to Jacob Black in the forest outside my home, I\u2019d been plagued by a persistent, uncomfortable intrusion of a specific mental picture. It popped into my thoughts at regular intervals like some annoying alarm clock set to sound every half hour, filling my head with the image of Jacob\u2019s face crumpled in pain. This was the last memory I had of him. As the disturbing vision struck again, I knew exactly why I was dissatisfied with my liberty. Because it was incomplete. Sure, I was free to go to anywhere I wanted \u2014 except La Push; free to do anything I wanted \u2014 except see Jacob. I frowned at the table. There had to be some kind of middle ground. \u201cAlice? Alice!\u201d  Angela\u2019s voice yanked me from my reverie. She was waving her hand back and forth in front of Alice\u2019s blank, staring face. Alice\u2019s expression was something I recognized \u2014 an expression that sent an automatic shock of panic through my body. The vacant look in her eyes told me that she was seeing something very different from the mundane lunchroom scene that surrounded us, but something that was every bit as real in its own way. Something that was coming, something that would happen soon. I felt the blood slither from my face. Then Edward laughed, a very natural, relaxed sound. Angela and Ben looked toward him, but my eyes were locked on Alice. She jumped suddenly, as if someone had kicked her under the table. \u201cIs it naptime already, Alice?\u201d Edward teased. Alice was herself again. \u201cSorry, I was daydreaming, I guess.\u201d \u201cDaydreaming\u2019s better than facing two more hours of school,\u201d Ben said. Alice threw herself back into the conversation with more animation than before \u2014 just a little bit too much. Once I saw her eyes lock with Edward\u2019s, only for a moment, and then she looked back to Angela before anyone else noticed. Edward was quiet, playing absentmindedly with a strand of my hair. I waited anxiously for a chance to ask Edward what Alice had seen in her vision, but the afternoon passed without one minute of alone time. It felt odd to me, almost deliberate. After lunch, Edward slowed his pace to match Ben\u2019s, talking about some assignment I knew he\u2019d already finished. Then there was always someone else there between classes, though we usually had a few minutes to ourselves. When the final bell rang, Edward struck up a conversation with Mike Newton of all people, falling into step beside him as Mike headed for the parking lot. I trailed behind, letting Edward tow me along. I listened, confused, while Mike answered Edward\u2019s unusually friendly queries. It seemed Mike was having car troubles. \u00a0\u201c. . . but I just replaced the battery,\u201d Mike was saying. His eyes darted ahead and then back to Edward warily. Mystified, just like I was. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s the cables?\u201d Edward offered. \u201cMaybe. I really don\u2019t know anything about cars,\u201d Mike admitted. \u201cI need to have someone look at it, but I can\u2019t afford to take it to Dowling\u2019s.\u201d I opened my mouth to suggest my mechanic, and then snapped it shut again. My mechanic was busy these days \u2014 busy running around as a giant wolf. \u201cI know a few things \u2014 I could take a look, if you like,\u201d Edward offered. \u201cJust let me drop Alice and Bella at home.\u201d Mike and I both stared at Edward with our mouths hanging open. \u201cEr . . . thanks,\u201d Mike mumbled when he recovered. \u201cBut I have to get to work. Maybe some other time.\u201d \u00a0\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d \u201cSee ya.\u201d Mike climbed into his car, shaking his head in disbelief. Edward\u2019s Volvo, with Alice already inside, was just two cars away. \u201cWhat was that about ?\u201d I muttered as Edward held the passenger door for me. \u201cJust being helpful,\u201d Edward answered. And then Alice, waiting in the backseat, was babbling at top speed. \u201cYou\u2019re really not that good a mechanic, Edward. Maybe you should have Rosalie take a look at it tonight, just so you look good if Mike decides to let you help, you know. \u00a0\u00a0Not that it wouldn\u2019t be fun to watch his face if Rosalie showed up to help. But since Rosalie is supposed to be across the country attending college, I guess that\u2019s not the best idea. Too bad. Though I suppose, for Mike\u2019s car, you\u2019ll do. It\u2019s only within the finer tunings of a good Italian sports car that you\u2019re out of your depth. And speaking of Italy and sports cars that I stole there, you still owe me a yellow Porsche. I don\u2019t know that I want to wait for Christmas. . . .\u201d I stopped listening after a minute, letting her quick voice become just a hum in the background as I settled into my patient mode. It looked to me like Edward was trying to avoid my questions. Fine. He would have to be alone with me soon enough. It was only a matter of time. Edward seemed to realize that, too. He dropped Alice at the mouth of the Cullens\u2019 drive as usual, though by this point I half expected him to drive her to the door and walk her in. As she got out, Alice threw a sharp look at his face. Edward seemed completely at ease. \u201cSee you later,\u201d he said. And then, ever so slightly, he nodded. Alice turned to disappear into the trees. He was quiet as he turned the car around and headed back to Forks. I waited, wondering if he would bring it up himself. He didn\u2019t, and this made me tense. What had Alice seen today at lunch? Something he didn\u2019t want to tell me, and I tried to think of a reason why he would keep secrets. Maybe it would be better to prepare myself before I asked. I didn\u2019t want to freak out and have him think I couldn\u2019t handle it, whatever it was. So we were both silent until we got to back to Charlie\u2019s house. \u00a0\u201cLight homework load tonight,\u201d he commented. \u201cMmm,\u201d I assented. \u201cDo you suppose I\u2019m allowed inside again?\u201d \u201cCharlie didn\u2019t throw a fit when you picked me up for school.\u201d But I was sure Charlie was going to turn sulky fast when he got home and found Edward here. Maybe I should make something extra-special for dinner. Inside, I headed up the stairs, and Edward followed. He lounged on my bed and gazed out the window, seeming oblivious to my edginess. I stowed my bag and turned the computer on. There was an unanswered e-mail from my mom to attend to, and she got panicky when I took too long. I drummed my fingers as I waited for my decrepit computer to wheeze awake; they snapped against the desk, staccato and anxious. And then his fingers were on mine, holding them still. \u201cAre we a little impatient today?\u201d he murmured. I looked up, intending to make a sarcastic remark, but his face was closer than I\u2019d expected. His golden eyes were smoldering, just inches away, and his breath was cool against my open lips. I could taste his scent on my tongue. I couldn\u2019t remember the witty response I\u2019d been about to make. I couldn\u2019t remember my name. He didn\u2019t give me a chance to recover. If I had my way, I would spend the majority of my time kissing Edward. There wasn\u2019t anything I\u2019d experienced in my life that compared to the feeling of his cool lips, marble hard but always so gentle, moving with mine. I didn\u2019t often get my way. So it surprised me a little when his fingers braided themselves into my hair, securing my face to his. My arms locked behind his neck, and I wished I was stronger \u2014 strong enough to keep him prisoner here. One hand slid down my back, pressing me tighter against his stone chest. Even through his sweater, his skin was cold enough to make me shiver \u2014 it was a shiver of pleasure, of happiness, but his hands began to loosen in response. I knew I had about three seconds before he would sigh and slide me deftly away, saying something about how we\u2019d risked my life enough for one afternoon. Making the most of my last seconds, I crushed myself closer, molding myself to the shape of him. The tip of my tongue traced the curve of his lower lip; it was as flawlessly smooth as if it had been polished, and the taste \u2014 He pulled my face away from his, breaking my hold with ease \u2014 he probably didn\u2019t even realize that I was using all my strength. He chuckled once, a low, throaty sound. His eyes were bright with the excitement he so rigidly disciplined. \u00a0\u201cAh, Bella.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI\u2019d say I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m not.\u201d \u201cAnd I should feel sorry that you\u2019re not sorry, but I don\u2019t. Maybe I should go sit on the bed.\u201d I exhaled a little dizzily. \u201cIf you think that\u2019s necessary. . . .\u201d  He smiled crookedly and disentangled himself. I shook my head a few times, trying to clear it, and turned back to my computer. It was all warmed up and humming now. Well, not as much humming as groaning. \u201cTell Ren\u00e9e I said hello.\u201d \u201cSure thing.\u201d I scanned through Ren\u00e9e\u2019s e-mail, shaking my head now and then at some of the dippier things she\u2019d done. I was just as entertained and horrified as the first time I\u2019d read this. It was so like my mother to forget exactly how paralyzed she was by heights until she was already strapped to a parachute and a dive instructor. I felt a little frustrated with Phil, her husband of almost two years, for allowing that one. I would have taken better care of her. I knew her so much better. You have to let them go their own way eventually, I reminded myself. You have to let them have their own life. . . . I\u2019d spent most of my life taking care of Ren\u00e9e, patiently guiding her away from her craziest plans, good-naturedly enduring the ones I couldn\u2019t talk her out of. I\u2019d always been indulgent with my mom, amused by her, even a little condescending to her. I saw her cornucopia of mistakes and laughed privately to myself. Scatterbrained Ren\u00e9e. I was a very different person from my mother. Someone thoughtful and cautious. The responsible one, the grown-up. That\u2019s how I saw myself. That was the person I knew. With the blood still pounding in my head from Edward\u2019s kiss, I couldn\u2019t help but think of my mother\u2019s most life-altering mistake. Silly and romantic, getting married fresh out of high school to a man she barely knew, then producing me a year later. She\u2019d always promised me that she had no regrets, that I was the best gift her life had ever given her. And yet she\u2019d drilled it into me over and over \u2014 smart people took marriage seriously. Mature people went to college and started careers before they got deeply involved in a relationship. She knew I would never be as thoughtless and goofy and small-town as she\u2019d been. . . . I gritted my teeth and tried to concentrate as I answered her letter. Then I hit her parting line and remembered why I\u2019d neglected to write sooner. You haven\u2019t said anything about Jacob in a long time, she\u2019d written. What\u2019s he up to these days? Charlie was prompting her, I was sure. I sighed and typed quickly, tucking the answer to her question between two less sensitive paragraphs. Jacob is fine, I guess. I don\u2019t see him much; he spends most of his time with a pack of his friends down at La Push these days. Smiling wryly to myself, I added Edward\u2019s greeting and hit \u201csend.\u201d I didn\u2019t realize that Edward was standing silently behind me again until after I\u2019d turned off the computer and shoved away from the desk. I was about to scold him for reading over my shoulder when I realized that he wasn\u2019t paying any attention to me. He was examining a flat black box with wires curling crookedly away from the main square in a way that didn\u2019t look healthy for whatever it was. After a second, I recognized the car stereo Emmett, Rosalie, and Jasper had given me for my last birthday. I\u2019d forgotten about the birthday presents hiding under a growing pile of dust on the floor of my closet. \u00a0\u201cWhat did you do to this?\u201d he asked in a horrorstruck voice. \u201cIt didn\u2019t want to come out of the dashboard.\u201d \u201cSo you felt the need to torture it?\u201d \u201cYou know how I am with tools. No pain was inflicted intentionally.\u201d He shook his head, his face a mask of faux tragedy. \u201cYou killed it.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cOh, well.\u201d \u201cIt would hurt their feelings if they saw this,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess it\u2019s a good thing that you\u2019ve been on house arrest. I\u2019ll have to get another one in place before they notice.\u201d \u201cThanks, but I don\u2019t need a fancy stereo.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not for your sake that I\u2019m going to replace it.\u201d I sighed. \u201cYou didn\u2019t get much good out of your birthday presents last year,\u201d he said in a disgruntled voice. Suddenly, he was fanning himself with a stiff rectangle of paper. I didn\u2019t answer, for fear my voice would shake. My disastrous eighteenth birthday \u2014 with all its far-reaching consequences \u2014 wasn\u2019t something I cared to remember, and I was surprised that he would bring it up. He was even more sensitive about it than I was. \u201cDo you realize these are about to expire?\u201d he asked, holding the paper out to me. It was another present \u2014 the voucher for airplane tickets that Esme and Carlisle had given me so that I could visit Ren\u00e9e in Florida. I took a deep breath and answered in a flat voice. \u201cNo. I\u2019d forgotten all about them, actually.\u201d His expression was carefully bright and positive; there was no trace of any deep emotion as he continued. \u201cWell, we still have a little time. You\u2019ve been liberated . . . and we have no plans this weekend, as you refuse to go to the prom with me.\u201d He grinned. \u201cWhy not celebrate your freedom this way?\u201d I gasped. \u201cBy going to Florida?\u201d \u201cYou did say something about the continental U.S. being allowable.\u201d I glared at him, suspicious, trying to understand where this had come from. \u201cWell?\u201d he demanded. \u201cAre we going to see Ren\u00e9e or not?\u201d \u201cCharlie will never allow it.\u201d \u201cCharlie can\u2019t keep you from visiting your mother. She still has primary custody.\u201d \u201cNobody has custody of me. I\u2019m an adult.\u201d He flashed a brilliant smile. \u201cExactly.\u201d I thought it over for a short minute before deciding that it wasn\u2019t worth the fight. Charlie would be furious \u2014 not that I was going to see Ren\u00e9e, but that Edward was going with me. Charlie wouldn\u2019t speak to me for months, and I\u2019d probably end up grounded again. It was definitely smarter not to even bring it up. Maybe in a few weeks, as a graduation favor or something. But the idea of seeing my mother now , not weeks from now, was hard to resist. It had been so long since I\u2019d seen Ren\u00e9e. And even longer since I\u2019d seen her under pleasant circumstances. The last time I\u2019d been with her in Phoenix, I\u2019d spent the whole time in a hospital bed. The last time she\u2019d come here, I\u2019d been more or less catatonic. Not exactly the best memories to leave her with. And maybe, if she saw how happy I was with Edward, she would tell Charlie to ease up. Edward scrutinized my face while I deliberated. I sighed. \u201cNot this weekend.\u201d \u201cWhy not?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to fight with Charlie. Not so soon after he\u2019s forgiven me.\u201d His eyebrows pulled together. \u201cI think this weekend is perfect,\u201d he muttered. I shook my head. \u201cAnother time.\u201d \u00a0\u201cYou aren\u2019t the only one who\u2019s been trapped in this house, you know.\u201d He frowned at me. Suspicion returned. This kind of behavior was unlike him. He was always so impossibly selfless; I knew it was making me spoiled. \u201cYou can go anywhere you want,\u201d I pointed out. \u201cThe outside world holds no interest for me without you.\u201d I rolled my eyes at the hyperbole. \u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s take the outside world slowly, all right? For example, we could start with a movie in Port Angeles. . . .\u201d He groaned. \u201cNever mind. We\u2019ll talk about it later.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s nothing left to talk about.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cOkay, then, new subject,\u201d I said. I\u2019d almost forgotten my worries about this afternoon \u2014 had that been his intention? \u201cWhat did Alice see today at lunch?\u201d My eyes were fixed on his face as I spoke, measuring his reaction. His expression was composed; there was only the slightest hardening of his topaz eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s been seeing Jasper in a strange place, somewhere in the southwest, she thinks, near his former . . . family. But he has no conscious intentions to go back.\u201d He sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s got her worried.\u201d \u00a0\u201cOh.\u201d That was nothing close to what I\u2019d been expecting. But of course it made sense that Alice would be watching out for Jasper\u2019s future. He was her soul mate, her true other half, though they weren\u2019t as flamboyant about their relationship as Rosalie and Emmett were. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me before?\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t realize you\u2019d noticed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably nothing important, in any case.\u201d My imagination was sadly out of control. I\u2019d taken a perfectly normal afternoon and twisted it until it looked like Edward was going out of his way to keep things from me. I needed therapy. We went downstairs to work on our homework, just in case Charlie showed up early. Edward finished in minutes; I slogged laboriously through my calculus until I decided it was time to fix Charlie\u2019s dinner. Edward helped, making faces every so often at the raw ingredients \u2014 human food was mildly repulsive to him. I made stroganoff from Grandma Swan\u2019s recipe, because I was sucking up. It wasn\u2019t one of my favorites, but it would please Charlie. Charlie seemed to already be in a good mood when he got home. He didn\u2019t even go out of his way to be rude to Edward. Edward excused himself from eating with us, as usual. The sound of the nightly news drifted from the front room, but I doubted Edward was really watching. After forcing down three helpings, Charlie kicked his feet up on the spare chair and folded his hands contentedly across his distended stomach. \u00a0\u201cThat was great, Bells.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m glad you liked it. How was work?\u201d He\u2019d been eating with too much concentration for me to make conversation before. \u201cSort of slow. Well, dead slow really. Mark and I played cards for a good part of the afternoon,\u201d he admitted with a grin. \u201cI won, nineteen hands to seven. And then I was on the phone with Billy for a while.\u201d I tried to keep my expression the same. \u201cHow is he?\u201d \u201cGood, good. His joints are bothering him a little.\u201d \u00a0\u201cOh. That\u2019s too bad.\u201d \u201cYeah. He invited us down to visit this weekend. He was thinking of having the Clearwaters and the Uleys over too. Sort of a playoff party. . . .\u201d \u201cHuh,\u201d was my genius response. But what could I say? I knew I wouldn\u2019t be allowed to hit a werewolf party, even with parental supervision. I wondered if Edward would have a problem with Charlie hanging out in La Push. Or would he suppose that, since Charlie was mostly spending time with Billy, who was only human, my father wouldn\u2019t be in danger? I got up and piled the dishes together without looking at Charlie. I dumped them into the sink and started the water. Edward appeared silently and grabbed a dishtowel. Charlie sighed and gave up for the moment, though I imagined he would <em>revisit</em> the subject when we were alone again. He heaved himself to his feet and headed for the TV, just like every other night. \u201cCharlie,\u201d Edward said in a conversational tone. Charlie stopped in the middle of his little kitchen. \u201cYeah?\u201d \u201cDid Bella ever tell you that my parents gave her airplane tickets on her last birthday, so that she could visit Ren\u00e9e?\u201d I dropped the plate I was scrubbing. It glanced off the counter and clattered noisily to the floor. It didn\u2019t break, but it spattered the room, and all three of us, with soapy water. Charlie didn\u2019t even seem to notice. \u201cBella?\u201d he asked in a stunned voice.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  I kept my eyes on the plate as I retrieved it. \u201cYeah, they did.\u201d Charlie swallowed loudly, and then his eyes narrowed as he turned back to Edward. \u201cNo, she never mentioned it.\u201d \u201cHmm,\u201d Edward murmured. \u201cWas there a reason you brought it up?\u201d Charlie asked in a hard voice. Edward shrugged. \u201cThey\u2019re about to expire. I think it might hurt Esme\u2019s feelings if Bella doesn\u2019t use her gift. Not that she\u2019d say anything.\u201d I stared at Edward in disbelief. Charlie thought for a minute. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a good idea for you to visit your mom, Bella. She\u2019d love that. I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t say anything about this, though.\u201d \u201cI forgot,\u201d I admitted. He frowned. \u201cYou forgot that someone gave you plane tickets?\u201d \u201cMmm,\u201d I murmured vaguely, and turned back to the sink. \u201cI noticed that you said they\u2019re about to expire, Edward,\u201d Charlie went on. \u201cHow many tickets did your\u00a0 parents give her?\u201d \u201cJust one for her . . . and one for me.\u201d The plate I dropped this time landed in the sink, so it didn\u2019t make as much noise. I could easily hear the sharp huff as my father exhaled. The blood rushed into my face, fueled by irritation and chagrin. Why was Edward doing this? I glared at the bubbles in the sink, panicking. \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s out of the question!\u201d Charlie was abruptly in a rage, shouting the words. \u201cWhy?\u201d Edward asked, his voice saturated with innocent surprise. \u201cYou just said it was a good idea for her to see her mother.\u201d Charlie ignored him. \u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere with him, young lady!\u201d he yelled. I spun around and he was jabbing a finger at me. Anger pulsed through me automatically, an instinctive reaction to his tone.  \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not a child, Dad. And I\u2019m not grounded anymore, remember?\u201d \u201cOh yes, you are. Starting now.\u201d \u201cFor what?!\u201d \u201cBecause I said so.\u201d \u201cDo I need to remind you that I\u2019m a legal adult, Charlie?\u201d \u201cThis is my house \u2014 you follow my rules!\u201d My glare turned icy. \u201cIf that\u2019s how you want it. Do you want me to move out tonight? Or can I have a few days to pack?\u201d Charlie\u2019s face went bright red. I instantly felt horrible for playing the move-out card. I took a deep breath and tried to make my tone more reasonable. \u201cI\u2019ll do my time without complaining when I\u2019ve done something wrong, Dad, but I\u2019m not going to put up with your prejudices.\u201d He sputtered, but managed nothing coherent. \u201cNow, I know that you know that I have every right to see Mom for the weekend. You can\u2019t honestly tell me you\u2019d object to the plan if I was going with Alice or Angela.\u201d \u201cGirls,\u201d he grunted, with a nod. \u201cWould it bother you if I took Jacob?\u201d I\u2019d only picked the name because I knew of my father\u2019s preference for Jacob, but I quickly wished I hadn\u2019t; Edward\u2019s teeth clenched together with an audible snap. My father struggled to compose himself before he answered. \u201cYes,\u201d he said in an unconvincing voice. \u201cThat would bother me.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re a rotten liar, Dad.\u201d \u201cBella \u2014\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m headed off to Vegas to be a showgirl or anything. I\u2019m going to see Mom ,\u201d I reminded him. \u201cShe\u2019s just as much my parental authority as you are.\u201d He threw me a withering look. \u201cAre you implying something about Mom\u2019s ability to look after me?\u201d Charlie flinched at the threat implicit in my question. \u201cYou\u2019d better hope I don\u2019t mention this to her,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019d better not,\u201d he warned. \u201cI\u2019m not happy about this, Bella.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for you to be upset.\u201d He rolled his eyes, but I could tell the storm was over. I turned to pull the plug out of the sink. \u201cSo my homework is done, your dinner is done, the dishes are done, and I\u2019m not grounded. I\u2019m going out. I\u2019ll be back before ten-thirty.\u201d \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d His face, almost back to normal, flushed light red again. \u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d I admitted. \u201cI\u2019ll keep it within a ten-mile radius, though. Okay?\u201d He grunted something that did not sound like approval, and stalked out of the room. Naturally, as soon as I\u2019d won the fight, I began to feel guilty. \u201cWe\u2019re going out?\u201d Edward asked, his voice low but enthusiastic. I turned to glower at him. \u201cYes. I think I\u2019d like to speak to you alone .\u201d He didn\u2019t look as apprehensive as I thought he should. I waited to begin until we were safely in his car. \u201cWhat was that ?\u201d I demanded. \u201cI know you want to see your mother, Bella \u2014 you\u2019ve been talking about her in your sleep. Worrying actually.\u201d \u201cI have?\u201d He nodded. \u201cBut, clearly, you were too much of a coward to deal with Charlie, so I interceded on your behalf.\u201d \u201cInterceded? You threw me to the sharks!\u201d He rolled his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t think you were in any danger.\u201d \u201cI told you I didn\u2019t want to fight with Charlie.\u201d \u201cNobody said that you had to.\u201d I glowered at him. \u201cI can\u2019t help myself when he gets all bossy like that \u2014 my natural teenage instincts overpower me.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cWell, that\u2019s not my fault.\u201d I stared at him, speculating. He didn\u2019t seem to notice. His face was serene as he gazed out the windshield. Something was off, but I couldn\u2019t put my finger on it. Or maybe it was just my imagination again, running wild like it had this afternoon. \u00a0\u201cDoes this sudden urge to see Florida have anything to do with the party at Billy\u2019s place?\u201d His jaw flexed. \u201cNothing at all. It wouldn\u2019t matter if you were here or on the other side of the world, you still wouldn\u2019t be going.\u201d It was just like with Charlie before \u2014 just like being treated as a misbehaving child. I gritted my teeth together so I wouldn\u2019t start shouting. I didn\u2019t want to fight with Edward, too. Edward sighed, and when he spoke his voice was warm and velvet again. \u201cSo what do you want to do tonight?\u201d he asked. \u201cCan we go to your house? I haven\u2019t seen Esme in so long.\u201d He smiled. \u201cShe\u2019ll like that. Especially when she hears what we\u2019re doing this weekend.\u201d I groaned in defeat. We didn\u2019t stay out late, as I\u2019d promised. I was not surprised to see the lights still on when we pulled up in front of the house \u2014 I knew Charlie would be waiting to yell at me some more. \u201cYou\u2019d better not come inside,\u201d I said. \u201cIt will only make things worse.\u201d \u201cHis thoughts are relatively calm,\u201d Edward teased. His expression made me wonder if there was some additional joke I was missing. The corners of his mouth twitched, fighting a smile. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later,\u201d I muttered glumly. He laughed and kissed the top of my head. \u201cI\u2019ll be back when Charlie\u2019s snoring.\u201d The TV was loud when I got inside. I briefly considered trying to sneak past him. \u201cCould you come in here, Bella?\u201d Charlie called, sinking that plan. My feet dragged as I took the five necessary steps. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Dad?\u201d \u201cDid you have a nice time tonight?\u201d he asked. He seemed ill at ease. I looked for hidden meanings in his words before I answered. \u201cYes,\u201d I said hesitantly. \u00a0\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d I shrugged. \u201cHung out with Alice and Jasper. Edward beat Alice at chess, and then I played Jasper. He buried me.\u201d I smiled. Edward and Alice playing chess was one of the funniest things I\u2019d ever seen. They\u2019d sat there nearly motionless, staring at the board, while Alice foresaw the moves he would make and he picked the moves she would make in return out of her head. They played most of the game in their minds; I think they\u2019d each moved two pawns when Alice suddenly flicked her king over and surrendered. It took all of three minutes. Charlie hit the mute button \u2014 an unusual action. \u201cLook, there\u2019s something I need to say.\u201d He frowned, looking very uncomfortable. I sat still, waiting. He met my gaze for a second before shifting his eyes to the floor. He didn\u2019t say anything more. \u201cWhat is it, Dad?\u201d He sighed. \u201cI\u2019m not good at this kind of thing. I don\u2019t know how to start. . . .\u201d I waited again. \u201cOkay, Bella. Here\u2019s the thing.\u201d He got up from the couch and started pacing back and forth across the room, looking as his feet all the time. \u201cYou and Edward seem pretty serious, and there are some things that you need to be careful about. I know you\u2019re an adult now, but you\u2019re still young, Bella, and there are a lot of important things you need to know when you . . . well, when you\u2019re physically involved with \u2014\u201d \u201cOh, please, please no!\u201d I begged, jumping to my feet. \u201cPlease tell me you are not trying to have a sex talk with me, Charlie.\u201d He glared at the floor. \u201cI am your father. I have responsibilities. Remember, I\u2019m just as embarrassed as you are.\u201d \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s humanly possible. Anyway, Mom beat you to the punch about ten years ago.\u00a0 You\u2019re off the hook.\u201d \u201cTen years ago you didn\u2019t have a boyfriend,\u201d he muttered unwillingly. I could tell he was battling with his desire to drop the subject. We were both standing up, looking at the floor, and facing away from each other. \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t think the essentials have changed that much,\u201d I mumbled, and my face had to be as red as his. This was beyond the seventh circle of Hades; even worse was realizing that Edward had known this was coming. No wonder he\u2019d seemed so smug in the car. \u00a0\u201cJust tell me that you two are being responsible,\u201d Charlie pled, obviously wishing a pit would open in the floor so that he could fall in. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Dad, it\u2019s not like that.\u201d \u201cNot that I don\u2019t trust you, Bella, but I know you don\u2019t want to tell me anything about this, and you know I don\u2019t really want to hear it. I will try to be open-minded, though. I know the times have changed.\u201d I laughed awkwardly. \u201cMaybe the times have, but Edward is very old-fashioned. You have nothing to worry about.\u201d Charlie sighed. \u201cSure he is,\u201d he muttered. \u201cUgh!\u201d I groaned. \u201cI really wish you were not forcing me to say this out loud, Dad. Really. But . . . I am a . . . virgin, and I have no immediate plans to change that status.\u201d We both cringed, but then Charlie\u2019s face smoothed out. He seemed to believe me. \u201cCan I go to bed, now? Please. \u201d \u201cIn a minute,\u201d he said. \u201cAw, please, Dad? I\u2019m begging you.\u201d \u201cThe embarrassing part\u2019s over, I promise,\u201d he assured me. I shot a glance at him, and was grateful to see that he looked more relaxed, that his face was back to its regular color. He sank down onto the sofa, sighing with relief that he was past the sex speech. \u201cWhat now?\u201d \u201cI just wanted to know how the balance thing is coming along.\u201d \u201cOh. Good, I guess. I made plans with Angela today. I\u2019m going to help her with her graduation announcements. Just us girls.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s nice. And what about Jake?\u201d I sighed. \u201cI haven\u2019t figured that one out yet, Dad.\u201d \u201cKeep trying, Bella. I know you\u2019ll do the right thing. You\u2019re a good person.\u201d Nice. So if I didn\u2019t figure out some way to make things right with Jacob, then I was a bad person? That was below the belt. \u00a0\u201cSure, sure,\u201d I agreed. The automatic response almost made me smile \u2014 it was something I\u2019d picked up from Jacob. I even said it in the same patronizing tone he used with his own father. Charlie grinned and turned the sound back on. He slumped lower into the cushions, pleased with his night\u2019s work. I could tell he would be up with the game for a while. \u201c\u2019Night, Bells.\u201d \u201cSee you in the morning!\u201d I sprinted for the stairs. Edward was long gone and he wouldn\u2019t be back until Charlie was asleep \u2014 he was probably out hunting or something to pass the time \u2014 so I was in no hurry to undress for bed. I wasn\u2019t in the mood to be alone, but I certainly wasn\u2019t going to go back downstairs to hang out with my Dad, just in case he thought of some topic of sex education that he hadn\u2019t touched on before; I shuddered. So, thanks to Charlie, I was wound up and anxious.  My homework was done and I didn\u2019t feel mellow enough for reading or just listening to music. I considered calling Ren\u00e9e with the news of my visit, but then I realized that it was three hours later in Florida, and she would be asleep.  I could call Angela, I supposed. But suddenly I knew that it wasn\u2019t Angela that I wanted to talk to. That I needed to talk to. I stared at the blank black window, biting my lip. I don\u2019t know how long I stood there weighing the pros against the cons \u2014 doing the right thing by Jacob, seeing my closest friend again, being a good person, versus making Edward furious with me. Ten minutes maybe. Long enough to decide that the pros were valid while the cons were not. Edward was only concerned about my safety, and I knew that there was really no problem on that count. The phone wasn\u2019t any help; Jacob had refused to answer my phone calls since Edward\u2019s return. Besides, I needed to see him \u2014 see him smiling again the way he used to. I needed to replace that awful last memory of his face warped and twisted by pain if I was ever going to have any peace of mind. I had an hour probably. I could make a quick run down to La Push and be back before Edward realized I had gone. It was past my curfew, but would Charlie really care about that when Edward wasn\u2019t involved? One way to find out. I grabbed my jacket and shoved my arms through the sleeves as I ran down the stairs. Charlie looked up from the game, instantly suspicious. \u201cYou care if I go see Jake tonight?\u201d I asked breathlessly. \u201cI won\u2019t stay long.\u201d As soon as I said Jake\u2019s name, Charlie\u2019s expression relaxed into a smug smile. He didn\u2019t seem surprised at all that his lecture had taken effect so quickly. \u201cSure, kid. No problem. Stay as long as you like.\u201d \u201cThanks, Dad,\u201d I said as I darted out the door. Like any fugitive, I couldn\u2019t help looking over my shoulder a few times while I jogged to my truck, but the night was so black that there really was no point. I had to feel my way along the side of the truck to the handle. My eyes were just beginning to adjust as I shoved my keys in the ignition. I twisted them hard to the left, but instead of roaring deafeningly to life, the engine just clicked. I tried it again with the same results. And then a small motion in my peripheral vision made me jump. \u201cGah!\u201d I gasped in shock when I saw that I was not alone in the cab. Edward sat very still, a faint bright spot in the darkness, only his hands moving as he turned a mysterious black object around and around. He stared at the object as he spoke. \u201cAlice called,\u201d he murmured. Alice! Damn. I\u2019d forgotten to account for her in my plans. He must have her watching me. \u201cShe got nervous when your future rather abruptly disappeared five minutes ago.\u201d My eyes, already wide with surprise, popped wider. \u201cBecause she can\u2019t see the wolves, you know,\u201d he explained in the same low murmur. \u201cHad you forgotten that? When you decide to mingle your fate with theirs, you disappear, too. You couldn\u2019t know that part, I realize that. But can you understand why that might make me a little . . . anxious? Alice saw you disappear, and she couldn\u2019t even tell if you\u2019d come home or not. Your future got lost, just like theirs. \u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re not sure why this is. Some natural defense they\u2019re born with?\u201d He spoke as if he were talking to himself now, still looking at the piece of my truck\u2019s engine as he twirled it in his hands. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t seem entirely likely, since I haven\u2019t had any trouble reading their thoughts. The Blacks\u2019 at least. Carlisle theorizes that it\u2019s because their lives are so ruled by their transformations. It\u2019s more an involuntary reaction than a decision. Utterly unpredictable, and it changes everything about them. In that instant when they shift from one form to the other, they don\u2019t really even exist. The future can\u2019t hold them. . . .\u201d I listened to his musing in stony silence. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll put your car back together in time for school, in case you\u2019d like to drive yourself,\u201d he assured me after a minute. With my lips mashed together, I retrieved my keys and stiffly climbed out of the truck. \u201cShut your window if you want me to stay away tonight. I\u2019ll understand,\u201d he whispered just before I slammed the door. I stomped into the house, slamming that door, too. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Charlie demanded from the couch. \u201cTruck won\u2019t start,\u201d I growled. \u00a0\u201cWant me to look at it?\u201d \u201cNo. I\u2019ll try it in the morning.\u201d \u00a0\u201cWant to use my car?\u201d I wasn\u2019t supposed to drive his police cruiser. Charlie must be really desperate to get me to La Push. Nearly as desperate as I was. \u201cNo. I\u2019m tired,\u201d I grumbled. \u201c\u2019Night.\u201d I stamped my way up the stairs, and went straight to my window. I shoved the metal frame roughly \u2014 it crashed shut and the glass trembled. I stared at the shivering black glass for a long moment, until it was still. Then I sighed, and opened the window as wide as it would go.",
