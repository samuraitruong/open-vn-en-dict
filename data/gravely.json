            "en": "19         19. GOODBYES Charlie was waiting up for me. All the house lights were on. My mind was blank as I tried to think of a way to make him let me go. This wasn't going to be pleasant. Edward pulled up slowly, staying well back from my truck. All three of them were acutely alert, ramrod straight in their seats, listening to every sound of the wood, looking through every shadow, catching every scent, searching for something out of place. The engine cut off, and I sat, motionless, as they continued to listen. \"He's not here,\" Edward said tensely. \"Let's go.\" Emmett reached over to help me get out of the harness. \"Don't worry, Bella,\" he said in a low but cheerful voice, \"we'll take care of things here quickly.\" I felt moisture filling up my eyes as I looked at Emmett. I barely knew him, and yet, \u00a0somehow, not knowing when I would see him again after tonight was anguishing. I knew this was just a faint taste of the goodbyes I would have to survive in the next hour, and the thought made the tears begin to spill. \"Alice, Emmett.\" Edward's voice was a command. They slithered soundlessly into the darkness, instantly disappearing. Edward opened my door and took my hand, then drew me into the protecting enclosure of his arm. He walked me swiftly toward the house, eyes always roving through the night. \"Fifteen minutes,\" he warned under his breath. \"I can do this.\" I sniffled. My tears had given me an inspiration. I stopped on the porch and took hold of his face in my hands. I looked fiercely into his eyes. \"I love you,\" I said in a low, intense voice. \"I will always love you, no matter what happens now.\" \"Nothing is going to happen to you, Bella,\" he said just as fiercely. \"Just follow the plan, okay? Keep Charlie safe for me. He's not going to like me very much after this, and I want to have the chance to apologize later.\" \"Get inside, Bella. We have to hurry.\" His voice was urgent. \"One more thing,\" I whispered passionately. \"Don't listen to another word I say tonight!\" He was leaning in, and so all I had to do was stretch up on my toes to kiss his surprised, frozen lips with as much force as I was capable of. Then I turned and kicked the door open. \"Go away, Edward!\" I yelled at him, running inside and slamming the door shut in his still-shocked face. \"Bella?\" Charlie had been hovering in the living room, and he was already on his feet. \"Leave me alone!\" I screamed at him through my tears, which were flowing relentlessly now. I ran up the stairs to my room, throwing the door shut and locking it. I ran to my bed, flinging myself on the floor to retrieve my duffel bag. I reached swiftly between the mattress and box spring to grab the knotted old sock that contained my secret cash hoard. Charlie was pounding on my door. \"Bella, are you okay? What's going on?\" His voice was frightened. \"I'm going borne,\" I shouted, my voice breaking in the perfect spot. \"Did he hurt you?\" His tone edged toward anger. \"No!\" I shrieked a few octaves higher. I turned to my dresser, and Edward was already there, silently yanking out armfuls of random clothes, which he proceeded to throw to me. \"Did he break up with you?\" Charlie was perplexed. \"No!\" I yelled, slightly more breathless as I shoved everything into the bag. Edward threw another drawer's contents at me. The bag was pretty much full now. \"What happened, Bella?\" Charlie shouted through the door, pounding again. \"I broke up with him!\" I shouted back, jerking on the zipper of my bag. Edward's capable hands pushed mine away and zipped it smoothly. He put the strap carefully over my arm. \"I'll be in the truck \u2014 go!\" he whispered, and pushed me toward the door.  He vanished out the window. I unlocked the door and pushed past Charlie roughly, struggling with my heavy bag as I ran down the stairs. \"What happened?\" he yelled. He was right behind me. \"I thought you liked him.\" He caught my elbow in the kitchen. Though he was still bewildered, his grip was firm. He spun me around to look at him, and I could see in his face that he had no intention of letting me leave. I could think of only one way to escape, and it involved hurting him so much that I hated myself for even considering it. But I had no time, and I had to keep him safe. I glared up at my father, fresh tears in my eyes for what I was about to do. \"I do like him \u2014 that's the problem. I can't do this anymore! I can't put down any more roots here! I don't want to end up trapped in this stupid, boring town like Mom! I'm not going to make the same dumb mistake she did. I hate it \u2014 I can't stay here another minute!\" His hand dropped from my arm like I'd electrocuted him. I turned away from his shocked, wounded face and headed for the door. \"Bells, you can't leave now. It's nighttime,\" he whispered behind me. I didn't turn around. \"I'll sleep in the truck if I get tired.\" \"Just wait another week,\" he pled, still shell-shocked. \"Ren\u00e9e will be back by then.\" This completely derailed me. \"What?\" Charlie continued eagerly, almost babbling with relief as I hesitated. \"She called while you were out. Things aren't going so well in Florida, and if Phil doesn't get signed by the end of the week, they're going back to Arizona. The assistant coach of the Sidewinders said they might have a spot for another shortstop.\" I shook my head, trying to reassemble my now-confused thoughts. Every passing second put Charlie in more danger. \"I have a key,\" I muttered, turning the knob. He was too close, one hand extended toward me, his face dazed. I couldn't lose any more time arguing with him. I was going to have to hurt him further. \"Just let me go, Charlie.\" I repeated my mother's last words as she'd walked out this same door so many years ago. I said them as angrily as I could manage, and I threw the door open. \"It didn't work out, okay? I really, really hate Forks!\" My cruel words did their job \u2014 Charlie stayed frozen on the doorstep, stunned, while I ran into the night. I was hideously frightened of the empty yard. I ran wildly for the truck, visualizing a dark shadow behind me. I threw my bag in the bed and wrenched the door open. The key was waiting in the ignition. \"I'll call you tomorrow!\" I yelled, wishing more than anything that I could explain everything to him right then, knowing I would never be able to. I gunned the engine and peeled out. Edward reached for my hand. \"Pull over,\" he said as the house, and Charlie, disappeared behind us. \"I can drive,\" I said through the tears pouring down my cheeks. His long hands unexpectedly gripped my waist, and his foot pushed mine off the gas pedal. He pulled me across his lap, wrenching my hands free of the wheel, and suddenly he was in the driver's seat. The truck didn't swerve an inch. \"You wouldn't be able to find the house,\" he explained. Lights flared suddenly behind us. I stared out the back window, eyes wide with horror. \"It's just Alice,\" he reassured me. He took my hand again. My mind was filled with the image of Charlie in the doorway. \"The tracker?\" \"He heard the end of your performance,\" Edward said grimly. \"Charlie?\" I asked in dread. \"The tracker followed us. He's running behind us now.\" My body went cold. \"Can we outrun him?\" \"No.\" But he sped up as he spoke. The truck's engine whined in protest. My plan suddenly didn't feel so brilliant anymore. I was staring back at Alice's headlights when the truck shuddered and a dark shadow sprung up outside the window. My bloodcurdling scream lasted a fraction of a second before Edward's hand clamped down on my mouth. \"It's Emmett!\" He released my mouth, and wound his arm around my waist. \"It's okay, Bella,\" he promised. \"You're going to be safe.\" We raced through the quiet town toward the north highway. \"I didn't realize you were still so bored with small-town life,\" he said conversationally, and I knew he was trying to distract me. \"It seemed like you were adjusting fairly well \u2014 especially recently. Maybe I was just flattering myself that I was making life more interesting for you.\" \"I wasn't being nice,\" I confessed, ignoring his attempt at diversion, looking down at my knees. \"That was the same thing my mom said when she left him. You could say I was hitting below the belt.\" \"Don't worry. He'll forgive you.\" He smiled a little, though it didn't touch his eyes. I stared at him desperately, and he saw the naked panic in my eyes. \"Bella, it's going to be all right.\" \"But it won't be all right when I'm not with you,\" I whispered. \"We'll be together again in a few days,\" he said, tightening his arm around me. \"Don't forget that this was your idea.\" \"It was the best idea \u2014 of course it was mine.\" His answering smile was bleak and disappeared immediately. \"Why did this happen?\" I asked, my voice catching. \"Why me?\" He stared blackly at the road ahead. \"It's my fault \u2014 I was a fool to expose you like that.\" The rage in his voice was directed internally. \"That's not what I meant,\" I insisted. \"I was there, big deal. It didn't bother the other two. Why did this James decide to kill me? There're people all over the place, why me?\" He hesitated, thinking before he answered. \"I got a good look at his mind tonight,\" he began in a low voice. \"I'm not sure if there's anything I could have done to avoid this, once he saw you. It is partially your fault.\" His voice was wry. \"If you didn't smell so appallingly luscious, he might not have bothered. But when I defended you\u2026 well, that made it a lot worse. He's not used to being thwarted, no matter how insignificant the object. He thinks of himself as a hunter and nothing else. His existence is consumed with tracking, and a challenge is all he asks of life. Suddenly we've presented him with a beautiful challenge \u2014 a large clan of strong fighters all bent on protecting the one vulnerable element. You wouldn't believe how euphoric he is now. It's his favorite game, and we've just made it his most exciting game ever.\" His tone was full of disgust. He paused a moment. \"But if I had stood by, he would have killed you right then,\" he said with hopeless frustration. \"I thought\u2026 I didn't smell the same to the others\u2026 as I do to you,\" I said hesitantly. \"You don't. But that doesn't mean that you aren't still a temptation to every one of them. If you had appealed to the tracker \u2014 or any of them \u2014 the same way you appeal to me, it would have meant a fight right there.\" I shuddered. \"I don't think I have any choice but to kill him now,\" he muttered. \"Carlisle won't like it.\" I could hear the tires cross the bridge, though I couldn't see the river in the dark. I knew we were getting close. I had to ask him now.  \"How can you kill a vampire?\" He glanced at me with unreadable eyes and his voice was suddenly harsh. \"The only way to be sure is to tear him to shreds, and then burn the pieces.\" \"And the other two will fight with him?\" \"The woman will. I'm not sure about Laurent. They don't have a very strong bond \u2014 he's only with them for convenience. He was embarrassed by James in the meadow\u2026\" \"But James and the woman \u2014 they'll try to kill you?\" I asked, my voice raw. \"Bella, don't you dare waste time worrying about me. Your only concern is keeping yourself safe and \u2014 please, please \u2014 trying not to be reckless.\" \"Is he still following?\" \"Yes. He won't attack the house, though. Not tonight.\" He turned off onto the invisible drive, with Alice following behind. We drove right up to the house. The lights inside were bright, but they did little to alleviate the blackness of the encroaching forest. Emmett had my door open before the truck was stopped; he pulled me out of the seat, tucked me like a football into his vast chest, and ran me through the door. We burst into the large white room, Edward and Alice at our sides. All of them were there; they were already on their feet at the sound of our approach. Laurent stood in their midst. I could hear low growls rumble deep in Emmett's throat as he set me down next to Edward. \"He's tracking us,\" Edward announced, glaring balefully at Laurent. Laurent's face was unhappy. \"I was afraid of that.\" Alice danced to Jasper's side and whispered in his ear; her lips quivered with the speed of her silent speech. They flew up the stairs together. Rosalie watched them, and then moved quickly to Emmett's side. Her beautiful eyes were intense and \u2014 when they flickered unwillingly to my face \u2014 furious. \"What will he do?\" Carlisle asked Laurent in chilling tones. \"I'm sorry,\" he answered. \"I was afraid, when your boy there defended her, that it would set him off.\" \"Can you stop him?\" Laurent shook his head. \"Nothing stops James when he gets started.\" \"We'll stop him,\" Emmett promised. There was no doubt what he meant. \"You can't bring him down. I've never seen anything like him in my three hundred years. He's absolutely lethal. That's why I joined his coven.\" His coven, I thought, of course. The show of leadership in the clearing was merely that, a show. Laurent was shaking his head. He glanced at me, perplexed, and back to Carlisle. \"Are you sure it's worth it?\" Edward's enraged roar filled the room; Laurent cringed back. Carlisle looked <em>gravely</em> at Laurent. \"I'm afraid you're going to have to make a choice.\" Laurent understood. He deliberated for a moment. His eyes took in every face, and finally swept the bright room. \"I'm intrigued by the life you've created here. But I won't get in the middle of this. I bear none of you any enmity, but I won't go up against James. I think I will head north \u2014 to that clan in Denali.\" He hesitated. \"Don't underestimate James. He's got a brilliant mind and unparalleled senses. He's every bit as comfortable in the human world as you seem to be, and he won't come at you head on\u2026 I'm sorry for what's been unleashed here. Truly sorry.\" He bowed his head, but I saw him flicker another puzzled look at me. \"Go in peace,\" was Carlisle's formal answer. Laurent took another long look around himself, and then he hurried out the door. The silence lasted less than a second. \"How close?\" Carlisle looked to Edward. Esme was already moving; her hand touched an inconspicuous keypad on the wall, and with a groan, huge metal shutters began sealing up the glass wall. I gaped. \"About three miles out past the river; he's circling around to meet up with the female.\" \"What's the plan?\" \"We'll lead him off, and then Jasper and Alice will run her south.\" \"And then?\" Edward's tone was deadly. \"As soon as Bella is clear, we hunt him.\" \"I guess there's no other choice,\" Carlisle agreed, his face grim. Edward turned to Rosalie. \"Get her upstairs and trade clothes,\" Edward commanded. She stared back at him with livid disbelief. \"Why should I?\" she hissed. \"What is she to me? Except a menace \u2014 a danger you've chosen to inflict on all of us.\" I flinched back from the venom in her voice. \"Rose\u2026\" Emmett murmured, putting one hand on her shoulder. She shook it off. But I was watching Edward carefully, knowing his temper, worried about his reaction. He surprised me. He looked away from Rosalie as if she hadn't spoken, as if she didn't exist. \"Esme?\" he asked calmly. \"Of course,\" Esme murmured. Esme was at my side in half a heartbeat, swinging me up easily into her arms, and dashing up the stairs before I could gasp in shock. \"What are we doing?\" I asked breathlessly as she set me down in a dark room somewhere off the second-story hall. \"Trying to confuse the smell. It won't work for long, but it might help get you out.\" I could hear her clothes falling to the floor. \"I don't think I'll fit\u2026\" I hesitated, but her hands were abruptly pulling my shirt over my head. I quickly stripped my jeans off myself. She handed me something, it felt like a shirt. I struggled to get my arms through the right holes. As soon as I was done she handed me her slacks. I yanked them on, but I couldn't get my feet out; they were too long. She deftly rolled the hems a few times so I could stand. Somehow she was already in my clothes. She pulled me back to the stairs, where Alice stood, a small leather bag in one hand. They each grabbed one of my elbows and half-carried me as they flew down the stairs. It appeared that everything had been settled downstairs in our absence. Edward and Emmett were ready to leave, Emmett carrying a heavy-looking backpack over his shoulder. Carlisle was handing something small to Esme. He turned and handed Alice the same thing \u2014 it was a tiny silver cell phone. \"Esme and Rosalie will be taking your truck, Bella,\" he told me as he passed. I nodded, glancing warily at Rosalie. She was glowering at Carlisle with a resentful expression. \"Alice, Jasper \u2014 take the Mercedes. You'll need the dark tint in the south.\" They nodded as well. \"We're taking the Jeep.\" I was surprised to see that Carlisle intended to go with Edward. I realized suddenly, with a stab of fear, that they made up the hunting party. \"Alice,\" Carlisle asked, \"will they take the bait?\" Everyone watched Alice as she closed her eyes and became incredibly still. Finally her eyes opened. \"He'll track you. The woman will follow the truck. We should be able to leave after that.\" Her voice was certain. \"Let's go.\" Carlisle began to walk toward the kitchen. But Edward was at my side at once. He caught me up in his iron grip, crushing me to him. He seemed unaware of his watching family as he pulled my face to his, lifting my feet off the floor. For the shortest second, his lips were icy and hard against mine. Then it was over. He set me down, still holding my face, his glorious eyes burning into mine. His eyes went blank, curiously dead, as he turned away. And they were gone. We stood there, the others looking away from me as the tears streaked noiselessly down my face.  The silent moment dragged on, and then Esme's phone vibrated in her hand. It flashed to her ear. \"Now,\" she said. Rosalie stalked out the front door without another glance in my direction, but Esme touched my cheek as she passed.  \"Be safe.\" Her whisper lingered behind them as they slipped out the door. I heard my truck start thunderously, and then fade away. Jasper and Alice waited. Alice's phone seemed to be at her ear before it buzzed. \"Edward says the woman is on Esme's trail. I'll get the car.\" She vanished into the shadows the way Edward had gone. Jasper and I looked at each other. He stood across the length of the entryway from me\u2026 being careful. \"You're wrong, you know,\" he said quietly. \"What?\" I gasped. \"I can feel what you're feeling now \u2014 and you are worth it.\" \"I'm not,\" I mumbled. \"If anything happens to them, it will be for nothing.\" \"You're wrong,\" he repeated, smiling kindly at me. I heard nothing, but then Alice stepped through the front door and came toward me with her arms held out. \"May I?\" she asked. \"You're the first one to ask permission.\" I smiled wryly. She lifted me in her slender arms as easily as Emmett had, shielding me protectively, and then we flew out the door, leaving the lights bright behind us.",

            "en": "Father was in the army all through the war\u2014the first war, I mean-so, up to the age of five, I never saw much of him, and what I saw did not worry me. Sometimes I woke and there was a big figure in khaki peering down at me in the candlelight. Sometimes in the early morning I heard the slamming of the front door and the clatter of nailed boots down the cobbles of the lane. These were Father\u2019s exits and entrances. Like Santa Claus he came and went mysteriously. In fact, I rather liked his visits, though it was an uncomfortable squeeze between Mother and him when I got into the big bed in the early morning. He smoked, which gave him a pleasant musty smell, and shaved, an operation of astounding interest. Each time he left a trail of souvenirs\u2014model tanks and Gurkha knives with handles made of bullet cases, and German helmets and cap badges and buttonsticks, and all sorts of military equipment\u2014carefully stored away in a long box on top of the wardrobe, in case they ever came in handy. There was a bit of the magpie about Father; he expected everything to come in handy. When his back was turned, Mother let me get a chair and rummage through his treasures. She didn\u2019t seem to think so highly of them as he did. The war was the most peaceful period of my life. The window of my attic faced southeast. My mother had curtained it, but that had small effect. I always woke with the first light and, with all the responsibilities of the previous day melted, feeling myself rather like the sun, ready to illuminate and rejoice. Life never seemed so simple and clear and full of possibilities as then. I put my feet out from under the clothes\u2014I called them Mrs. Left and Mrs. Right\u2014and invented dramatic situations for them in which they discussed the problems of the day. At least Mrs. Right did; she was very demonstrative, but I had not the same control of Mrs. Left, so she mostly contented herself with nodding agreement. They discussed what Mother and I should do during the day, what Santa Claus should give a fellow for Christmas, and what steps should be taken to brighten the home. There was that little matter of the baby, for instance. Mother and I could never agree about that. Ours was the only house in the terrace without a new baby, and Mother said we couldn\u2019t afford one till Father came back from the war because they cost seventeen and six. That showed how simple she was. The Geneys up the road had a baby, and everyone knew they couldn\u2019t afford seventeen and six. It was probably a cheap baby, and Mother wanted something really good, but I felt she was too exclusive. The Geneys\u2019 baby would have done us fine. Having settled my plans for the day, I got up, put a chair under the attic window, and lifted the frame high enough to stick out my head. The window overlooked the front gardens of the terrace behind ours, and beyond these it looked over a deep valley to the tall, red-brick houses terraced up the opposite hillside, which were all still in shadow, while those at our side of the valley were all lit up, though with long strange shadows that made them seem unfamiliar; rigid and painted. After that I went into Mother\u2019s room and climbed into the big bed. She woke and I began to tell her of my schemes. By this time, though I never seem to have noticed it, I was petrified in my nightshirt, and I thawed as I talked until, the last frost melted, I fell asleep beside her and woke again only when I heard her below in the kitchen, making the breakfast. After breakfast we went into town; heard Mass at St. Augustine\u2019s and said a prayer for Father, and did the shopping. If the afternoon is fine we either went for a walk in the country or a visit to Mother\u2019s great friend in the convent, Mother St. Dominic. Mother had them all praying for father, and every night, going to bed, I asked God to send him back safe from the war to us. Little, indeed, did I know what I was praying for! One morning, I got into the big bed, and there, sure enough, was Father in his usual Santa Claus manner, but later, instead of uniform, he put on his best blue suit, and Mother was as pleased as anything. I saw nothing to be pleased about, because, out of uniform, Father was altogether less interesting, but she only beamed, and explained that our prayers had been answered, and off we went to Mass to thank God for having brought Father safely home. The irony of it! That very day when he came in to dinner he took off his boots and put on his slippers, donned the dirty old cap he wore about the house to save him from colds, crossed his legs, and began to talk <em>gravely</em> to Mother, who looked anxious. Naturally, I disliked her looking anxious, because it destroyed her good looks, so I interrupted him. \u00a0\u201cJust a moment, Larry!\u201d she said gently. This was only what she said when we had boring visitors, so I attached no importance to it and went on talking. \u00a0\u201cDo be quiet, Larry!\u201d she said impatiently. \u201cDon\u2019t you hear me talking to Daddy?\u201d This was the first time I had heard those ominous words, \u201ctalking to Daddy,\u201d and I couldn\u2019t help feeling that if this was how God answers prayers, he couldn\u2019t listen to them very attentively. \u00a0\u201cWhy are you talking to Daddy?\u201d I asked with as great show of indifference as I could muster. \u00a0\u201cBecause Daddy and I have business to discuss. Now, don\u2019t interrupt again!\u201d In the afternoon, at Mother\u2019s request, Father took me for a walk. This time we went into town instead of out the country, and I thought at first, in my usual optimistic way, that it might be an improvement. It was nothing of the sort. Father and I had quite different notions of a walk in town. He had no proper interest in trams, ships, and horses, and the only thing that seemed to divert him was talking to fellows as old as himself. When I wanted to stop he simply went on, dragging me behind him by the hand; when he wanted to stop I had no alternative but to do the same. I noticed that it seemed to be a sign that he wanted to stop for a long time whenever he leaned against a wall. The second time I saw him do it I got wild. He seemed to be settling himself forever. I pulled him by the coat and trousers, but, unlike Mother who, if you were too persistent, got into a wax and said: \u201cLarry if you don\u2019t behave yourself, I\u2019ll give you a good slap,\u201d Father had an extraordinary capacity for amiable inattention. I sized him up and wondered would I cry, but he seemed to be too remote to be annoyed even by that. Really, it was like going for a walk with a mountain! He either ignored the wrenching and pummeling entirely, or else glanced down with a grin of amusement from his peak. I had never met anyone so absorbed in himself as he seemed. At teatime, \u201ctalking to Daddy\u201d began again, complicated this time by the fact that he had an evening paper, and every few minutes he put it down and told Mother something new out of it. I felt this was foul play. Man for man, I was prepared to compete with him any time for Mother\u2019s attention, but when he had it all made up for him by other people it left me no chance. Several times I tried to change the subject without success. \u00a0\u201cYou must be quiet while Daddy is reading, Larry,\u201d Mother said impatiently. It was clear that she either genuinely liked talking to Father better than talking to me, or else he had some terrible hold on her which made her afraid to admit the truth. \u201cMummy,\u201d I said that night when she was tucking me up, \u201cdo you think that if I prayed hard God would send Daddy back to war?\u201d She seemed to think about that for a moment. \u201cNo, dear,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cI don\u2019t think he would. \u201c \u00a0\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t he, Mummy?\u201d \u201cBecause there isn\u2019t a war any longer, dear. \u201c \u00a0\u201cBut, Mummy, couldn\u2019t God make another war, if He liked?\u201d \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t like to, dear. It\u2019s not God who makes wars, but bad people. \u201c \u00a0\u201cOh!\u201d I said. I was disappointed about that. I began to think that God wasn\u2019t quite what he was cracked up to be. Next morning I woke at my usual hour, feeling like a bottle of champagne. I put out my feet and invented a long conversation in which Mrs. Right talked of the trouble she had with her own father till she put him in the Home. I didn\u2019t quite know what the Home was but it sounded the right place for Father. Then I got my chair and stuck my head out of the attic window. Dawn was just breaking, with a guilty air that made me feel I had caught it in the act. My head bursting with stories and schemes, I stumbled in next door, and in the half-darkness scrambled into the big bed. There was no room at Mother\u2019s side so I had to get between her and Father. For the time being I had forgotten about him, and for several minutes I sat bolt upright, racking my brains to know what I could do with him. He was taking up more than his fair share of the bed, and I couldn\u2019t get comfortable, so I gave him several kicks that made him grunt and stretch. He made room all right, though. Mother waked and felt for me. I settled back comfortably in the warmth of the bed with my thumb in my mouth. \u201cMummy!\u201d I hummed, loudly and contentedly. \u201cSssh! dear,\u201d she whispered. \u201cDon\u2019t wake Daddy!\u201d This was a new development, which threatened to be more serious than \u201ctalking to Daddy. \u201d Life without my early-morning conferences was unthinkable. \u201cWhy?\u201d I asked severely. \u00a0\u201cBecause poor Daddy is tired. \u201c This seemed to me a quite inadequate reason, and I was sickened by the sentimentality of her \u201cpoor Daddy. \u201d I never liked that sort of gush; it always struck me as insincere. \u201cOh!\u201d I said lightly. Then in my most winning tone: \u201cDo you know where I want to go with you today, Mummy?\u201d \u00a0\u201cNo, dear,\u201d she sighed. \u201cI want to go down the Glen and fish for thornybacks with my new net, and then I want to go out to the Fox and Hounds, and\u2014\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t-wake-Daddy!\u201d she hissed angrily, clapping her hand across my mouth. But it was too late. He was awake, or nearly so. He grunted and reached for the matches. Then he stared incredulously at his watch. \u201cLike a cup of tea, dear?\u201d asked Mother in a meek, hushed voice I had never heard her use before. It sounded almost as though she were afraid. \u201cTea?\u201d he exclaimed indignantly. \u201cDo you know what the time is?\u201d \u00a0\u201cAnd after that I want to go up the Rathcooney Road,\u201d I said loudly, afraid I\u2019d forget something in all those interruptions. \u201cGo to sleep at once, Larry!\u201d she said sharply. I began to snivel. I couldn\u2019t concentrate, the way that pair went on, and smothering my early-morning schemes was like burying a family from the cradle. Father said nothing, but lit his pipe and sucked it, looking out into the shadows without minding Mother or me. I knew he was mad. Every time I made a remark Mother hushed me irritably. I was mortified. I felt it wasn\u2019t fair; there was even something sinister in it. Every time I had pointed out to her the waste of making up two beds when we could both sleep in one, she had told me it was healthier like that, and now here was this man, this stranger, sleeping with her without the least regard for her health! He got up early and made tea, but though he brought Mother a cup he brought none for me. \u00a0\u201cMummy,\u201d I shouted, \u201cI want a cup of tea, too. \u201c \u201cYes, dear,\u201d she said patiently. \u201cYou can drink from Mummy\u2019s saucer. \u201c That settled it. Either Father or I would have to leave the house. I didn\u2019t want to drink from Mother\u2019s saucer; I wanted to be treated as an equal in my own home, so, just to spite her, I drank it all and left none for her. She took that quietly, too. But that night while she was putting me to bed she said gently: \u00a0\u201cLarry, I want you to promise me something. \u201c \u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked. \u201cNot to come in and disturb poor Daddy in the morning. Promise?\u201d \u00a0\u201cPoor Daddy\u201d again! I was becoming suspicious of everything involving that quite impossible man. \u201cWhy?\u201d I asked. \u201cBecause poor Daddy is worried and tired and he doesn\u2019t sleep well. \u201c \u00a0\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he, Mummy?\u201d \u201cWell, you know, don\u2019t you, that while he was at the war Mummy got the pennies from the Post Office?\u201d \u201cFrom Miss MacCarthy?\u201d \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s right. But now, you see, Miss MacCarthy hasn\u2019t anymore pennies, so Daddy must go out and find us some. You know what would happen if he couldn\u2019t?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I said, \u201ctell us. \u201c \u201cWell, I think we might have to go out and beg for them like the poor old woman on Fridays. We wouldn\u2019t like that, would we?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I agreed. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t. \u201c \u00a0\u201cSo you\u2019ll promise not to come in and wake him?\u201d \u201cPromise. \u201c Mind you, I meant that. I knew pennies were a serious matter, and I was all against having to go out and beg like the old woman on Fridays. Mother laid out all my toys in a complete ring round the bed so that, whatever way I got out, I was bound to fall over one of them. When I woke I remembered my promise all right. I got up and sat on the floor and played\u2014for hours, it seemed to me. Then I got my chair and looked out the attic window for more hours. I wished it was time for Father to wake; I wished someone would make me a cup of tea. I didn\u2019t feel in the least like the sun; instead, I was bored and so very, very cold! I simply longed for the warmth and depth of the big featherbed. At last I could stand it no longer. I went into the next room. As there was still no room at Mother\u2019s side I climbed over her and she woke with a start. \u201cLarry,\u201d she whispered, gripping my arms very tightly, \u201cwhat did you promise?\u201d \u201cBut I did, Mummy,\u201d I wailed, caught in the very act. \u201cI was quiet for ever so long. \u201c \u00a0\u201cOh, dear, and you\u2019re perished!\u201d she said sadly, feeling me all over. \u201cNow if I let you stay will you promise not to talk?\u201d \u201cBut I want to talk, Mummy,\u201d I wailed. \u201cThat has nothing to do with it,\u201d she said with a firmness that was new to me. \u201cDaddy wants to sleep. Now, do you understand that?\u201d I understood it only too well. I wanted to talk, he wanted to sleep\u2014whose house was it, anyway? \u201cMummy,\u201d I said with equal firmness, \u201cI think it would be healthier for Daddy to sleep in his own bed. \u201c That seemed to stagger her, because she said nothing for a while. \u00a0\u201cNow, once for all,\u201d she went on, \u201cyou\u2019re to be perfectly quiet or go back to your own bed. Which is it to be?\u201d The injustice of it got me down. I had convicted her out of her own mouth of inconsistency and unreasonableness, and she hadn\u2019t even attempted to reply. Full of spite, I gave Father a kick, which she didn\u2019t notice but which made him grunt and open his eyes in alarm. \u00a0\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d he asked in a panic-stricken voice, not looking at Mother but at the door, as if he saw someone there. \u201cIt\u2019s early yet,\u201d she replied soothingly. \u201cIt\u2019s only the child. Go to sleep again. Now, Larry,\u201d she added, getting out of bed, \u201cyou\u2019ve wakened Daddy and you must go back. \u201c This time, for all her quiet air, I knew she meant it, and knew that my principal rights and privileges were as good as lost unless I asserted them at once. As she lifted me, I gave a screech, enough to wake the dead, not to mind Father. He groaned. \u201cThat damn child! Doesn\u2019t he ever sleep?\u201d \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s only a habit, dear,\u201d she said quietly, though I could see she was vexed. \u201cWell, it\u2019s time he got out of it,\u201d shouted Father, beginning to heave in the bed. He suddenly gathered all the bedclothes about him, turned to the wall, and then looked back over his shoulder with nothing showing only two small, spiteful, dark eyes. The man looked very wicked. To open the bedroom door, Mother had to let me down, and I broke free and dashed for the farthest corner, screeching. Father sat bolt upright in bed. \u201cShut up, you little puppy!\u201d he said in a choking voice. I was so astonished that I stopped screeching. Never, never had anyone spoken to me in that tone before. I looked at him incredulously and saw his face convulsed with rage. It was only then that I fully realized how God had codded me, listening to my prayers for the safe return of this monster. \u00a0\u201cShut up, you!\u201d I bawled, beside myself. \u201cWhat\u2019s that you said?\u201d shouted Father, making a wild leap out of the bed. \u201cMick, Mick!\u201d cried Mother. \u201cDon\u2019t you see the child isn\u2019t used to you?\u201d \u00a0\u201cI see he\u2019s better fed than taught,\u201d snarled Father, waving his arms wildly. \u201cHe wants his bottom smacked. \u201c All his previous shouting was as nothing to these obscene words referring to my person. They really made my blood boil. \u201cSmack your own!\u201d I screamed hysterically. \u201cSmack your own! Shut up! Shut up!\u201d At this he lost his patience and let fly at me. He did it with the lack of conviction you\u2019d expect of a man under Mother\u2019s horrified eyes, and it ended up as a mere tap, but the sheer indignity of being struck at all by a stranger, a total stranger who had cajoled his way back from the war into our big bed as a result of my innocent intercession, made me completely dotty. I shrieked and shrieked, and danced in my bare feet, and Father, looking awkward and hairy in nothing but a short gray army shirt, glared down at me like a mountain out for murder. I think it must have been then that I realized he was jealous too. And there stood Mother in her nightdress, looking as if her heart was broken between us. I hoped she felt as she looked. It seemed to me that she deserved it all. From that morning out my life was a hell. Father and I were enemies, open and avowed. We conducted a series of skirmishes against one another, he trying to steal my time with Mother and I his. When she was sitting on my bed, telling me a story, he took to looking for some pair of old boots which he alleged he had left behind him at the beginning of the war. While he talked to Mother I played loudly with my toys to show my total lack of concern. He created a terrible scene one evening when he came in from work and found me at his box, playing with his regimental badges, Gurkha knives and button-sticks. Mother got up and took the box from me. \u00a0\u201cYou mustn\u2019t play with Daddy\u2019s toys unless he lets you, Larry,\u201d she said severely. \u201cDaddy doesn\u2019t play with yours. \u201c For some reason Father looked at her as if she had struck him and then turned away with a scowl. \u201cThose are not toys,\u201d he growled, taking down the box again to see had I lifted anything. \u201cSome of those curios are very rare and valuable. \u201c But as time went on I saw more and more how he managed to alienate Mother and me. What made it worse was that I couldn\u2019t grasp his method or see what attraction he had for Mother. In every possible way he was less winning than I. He had a common accent and made noises at his tea. I thought for a while that it might be the newspapers she was interested in, so I made up bits of news of my own to read to her. Then I thought it might be the smoking, which I personally thought attractive, and took his pipes and went round the house dribbling into them till he caught me. I even made noises at my tea, but Mother only told me I was disgusting. It all seemed to hinge round that unhealthy habit of sleeping together, so I made a point of dropping into their bedroom and nosing around, talking to myself, so that they wouldn\u2019t know I was watching them, but they were never up to anything that I could see. In the end it beat me. It seemed to depend on being grown-up and giving people rings, and I realized I\u2019d have to wait. But at the same time I wanted him to see that I was only waiting, not giving up the fight. One evening when he was being particularly obnoxious, chattering away well above my head, I let him have it. \u201cMummy,\u201d I said, \u201cdo you know what I\u2019m going to do when I grow up?\u201d \u201cNo, dear,\u201d she replied. \u201cWhat?\u201d \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m going to marry you,\u201d I said quietly. Father gave a great guffaw out of him, but he didn\u2019t take me in. I knew it must be only pretense. And Mother, in spite of everything, was pleased. I felt she was probably relieved to know that one day Father\u2019s hold on her would be broken. \u00a0\u201cWon\u2019t that be nice?\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cIt\u2019ll be very nice,\u201d I said confidently. \u201cBecause we\u2019re going to have lots and lots of babies. \u201c \u201cThat\u2019s right, dear,\u201d she said placidly. \u201cI think we\u2019ll have one soon, and then you\u2019ll have plenty of company. \u201c I was no end pleased about that because it showed that in spite of the way she gave in to Father she still considered my wishes. Besides, it would put the Geneys in their place. It didn\u2019t turn out like that, though. To begin with, she was very preoccupied\u2014I supposed about where she would get the seventeen and six\u2014and though Father took to staying out late in the evenings it did me no particular good. She stopped taking me for walks, became as touchy as blazes, and smacked me for nothing at all. Sometimes I wished I\u2019d never mentioned the confounded baby\u2014I seemed to have a genius for bringing calamity on myself. And calamity it was! Sonny arrived in the most appalling hullabaloo\u2014even that much he couldn\u2019t do without a fuss\u2014and from the first moment I disliked him. He was a difficult child\u2014so far as I was concerned he was always difficult\u2014and demanded far too much attention. Mother was simply silly about him, and couldn\u2019t see when he was only showing off. As company he was worse than useless. He slept all day, and I had to go round the house on tiptoe to avoid waking him. It wasn\u2019t any longer a question of not waking Father. The slogan now was \u201cDon\u2019t-wake-Sonny! I couldn\u2019t understand why the child wouldn\u2019t sleep at the proper time, so whenever Mother\u2019s back was turned I woke him. Sometimes to keep him awake I pinched him as well. Mother caught me at it one day and gave me a most unmerciful flaking. One evening, when Father was coming in from work, I was playing trains in the front garden. I let on not to notice him; instead I pretended to be talking to myself, and said in a loud voice: \u201cIf another bloody baby comes into this house, I\u2019m going out. \u201c Father stopped dead and looked at me over his shoulder. \u201cWhat\u2019s that you said?\u201d he asked sternly. I was only talking to myself,\u201d I replied, trying to conceal my panic. \u201cIt\u2019s private. \u201c He turned and went in without a word. Mind you, I intended it as a solemn warning, but its effect was quite different. Father started being quite nice to me. I could understand that, of course. Mother was quite sickening about Sonny. Even at mealtimes she\u2019d get up and gawk at him in the cradle with an idiotic smile, and tell Father to do the same. He was always polite about it, but he looked so puzzled you could see he didn\u2019t know what she was talking about. He complained of the way Sonny cried at night, but she only got cross and said that Sonny never cried except when there was something up with him\u2014which was a flaming lie, because Sonny never had anything up with him, and only cried for attention. It was really painful to see how simple-minded she was. Father wasn\u2019t attractive, but he had a fine intelligence. He saw through Sonny, and now he knew that I saw through him as well. One night I woke with a start. There was someone beside me in bed. For one wild moment I felt sure it must be Mother, having come to her senses and left Father for good, but then I heard Sonny in convulsions in the next room, and Mother saying: \u201cThere! There! There!\u201d and I knew it wasn\u2019t she. It was Father. He was lying beside me, wide awake, breathing hard and apparently as mad as hell. After a while it came to me what he was mad about. It was his turn now. After turning me out of the big bed, he had been turned out himself. Mother had no consideration now for anyone but that poisonous pup, Sonny. I couldn\u2019t help feeling sorry for Father. I had been through it all myself, and even at that age I was magnanimous. I began to stroke him down and say: \u201cThere! There!\u201d He wasn\u2019t exactly responsive. \u00a0\u201cAren\u2019t you asleep either?\u201d he snarled. \u201cAh, come on and put your arm around us, can\u2019t you?\u201d I said, and he did, in a sort of way. Gingerly, I suppose, is how you\u2019d describe it. He was very bony but better than nothing. At Christmas he went out of his way to buy me a really nice model railway.",

            "en": "5         6. FRIENDS THE MOTORCYCLES DIDN'T NEED TO BE HIDDEN ANY further than simply placing them in Jacob's shed. Billy's wheelchair couldn't maneuver the uneven ground separating it from the house. Jacob started pulling the first bike\u2014the red one, which was destined for me\u2014to pieces immediately. He opened up the passenger door of the Rabbit so I could sit on the seat instead of the ground. While he worked, Jacob chattered happily, needing only the lightest of nudges from me to keep the conversation rolling. He updated me on the progress of his sophomore year of school, running on about his classes and his two best friends. \"Quil and Embry?\u201dI interrupted. \"Those are unusual names.\" Jacob chuckled. \"Quil's is a hand-me-down, and I think Embry got named after a soap opera star. I can't say anything, though. They fight dirty if you start on their names\u2014they'll tag team you.\" \"Good friends.\u201dI raised one eyebrow. \"No, they are. Just don't mess with their names.\" Just then a call echoed in the distance. \"Jacob?\u201dsomeone shouted. \"Is that Billy?\u201dI asked. \"No.\u201dJacob ducked his head, and it looked like he was blushing under his brown skin. \"Speak of the devil,\u201dhe mumbled, \"and the devil shall appear.\" \"Jake? Are you out here?\u201dThe shouting voice was closer now. \"Yeah!\u201dJacob shouted back, and sighed. We waited through the short silence until two tall, dark-skinned boys strolled around the corner into the shed. One was slender, and almost as tall as Jacob. His black hair was chin-length and parted down the middle, one side tucked behind his left ear while the right side swung free. The shorter boy was more burly. His white T-shirt strained over his well-developed chest, and he seemed gleefully conscious of that fact. His hair was so short it was almost a buzz. Both boys stopped short when they saw me. The thin boy glanced swiftly back and forth between Jacob and me, while the brawny boy kept his eyes on me, a slow smile spreading across his face. \"Hey, guys,\u201dJacob greeted them halfheartedly. \"Hey, Jake,\u201dthe short one said without looking away from me. I had to smile in response, his grin was so impish. When I did, he winked at me. \"Hi, there.\" \"Quil, Embry\u2014this is my friend, Bella.\" Quil and Embry, I still didn't know which was which, exchanged a loaded look. \"Charlie's kid, right?\u201dthe brawny boy asked me, holding out his hand. \"That's right,\u201dI confirmed, shaking hands with him. His grasp was firm; it looked like he was flexing his bicep. \"I'm Quil Ateara,\u201dhe announced grandly before releasing my hand. \"Nice to meet you, Quil.\" \"Hey, Bella. I'm Embry, Embry Call\u2014you probably already figured that out, though.\u201dEmbry smiled a shy smile and waved with one hand, which he then shoved in the pocket of his jeans. I nodded. \"Nice to meet you, too.\" \"So what are you guys doing?\u201dQuil asked, still looking at me. \"Bella and I are going to fix up these bikes,\u201dJacob explained inaccurately. But bikes seemed to be the magic word. Both boys went to examine Jacob's project, drilling him with educated questions. Many of the words they used were unfamiliar to me, and I figured I'd have to have a Y chromosome to really understand the excitement. They were still immersed in talk of parts and pieces when I decided that I needed to head back home before Charlie showed up here. With a sigh, I slid out of the Rabbit. Jacob looked up, apologetic. \"We're boring you, aren't we?\" \"Naw.\u201dAnd it wasn't a lie. I was enjoying myself\u2014how strange. \"I just have to go cook dinner for Charlie.\" \"Oh\u2026 well, I'll finish taking these apart tonight and figure out what more we'll need to get started rebuilding them. When do you want to work on them again?\" \"Could I come back tomorrow?\u201d\u00a0 Sundays were the bane of my existence. There was never enough homework to keep me busy. Quil nudged Embry's arm and they exchanged grins. Jacob smiled in delight. \"That would be great!\" \"If you make a list, we can go shop for parts,\u201dI suggested. Jacob's face fell a little. \"I'm still not sure I should let you pay for everything.\" I shook my head. \"No way. I'm bankrolling this party. You just have to supply the labor and expertise.\" Embry rolled his eyes at Quil. \"That doesn't seem right,\u201dJacob shook his head. \"Jake, if I took these to a mechanic, how much would he charge me?\u201dI pointed out. He smiled. \"Okay, you're getting a deal.\" \"Not to mention the riding lessons,\u201dI added. Quil grinned widely at Embry and whispered something I didn't catch. Jacob's hand flashed out to smack the back of Quil's head. \"That's it, get out,\u201dhe muttered. \"No, really, I have to go,\u201dI protested, heading for the door. \"I'll see you tomorrow, Jacob.\" As soon as I was out of sight, I heard Quil and Embry chorus, \"Wooooo!\" The sound of a brief scuffle followed, interspersed with an \"ouch\u201dand a \"hey!\" \"If either of you set so much as one toe on my land tomorrow\u2026\u201dI heard Jacob threaten. His voice was lost as I walked through the trees. I giggled quietly. The sound made my eyes widen in wonder. I was laughing, actually laughing, and there wasn't even anyone watching. I felt so weightless that I laughed again, just make the feeling last longer. I beat Charlie home. When he walked in I was just taking the fried chicken out of the pan and laying it on a pile of paper towels. \"Hey, Dad.\u201dI flashed him a grin. Shock flitted across his face before he pulled his expression together. \"Hey, honey,\u201dhe said, his voice uncertain. \"Did you have fun with Jacob?\" I started moving the food to the table. \"Yeah, I did.\" \"Well, that's good.\u201dHe was still cautious. \"What did you two do?\" Now it was my turn to be cautious. \"I hung out in his garage and watched him work. Did you know he's rebuilding a Volkswagen?\" \"Yeah, I think Billy mentioned that.\" The interrogation had to stop when Charlie began chewing, but he continued to study my face as he ate.  After dinner, I dithered around, cleaning the kitchen twice, and then did my homework slowly in the front room while Charlie watched a hockey game. I waited as long as I could, but finally Charlie mentioned the late hour. When I didn't respond, he got up, stretched, and then left, turning out the light behind him. Reluctantly, I followed. As I climbed the stairs, I felt the last of the afternoon's abnormal sense of well-being drain from my system, replaced by a dull fear at the thought of what I was going to have to live through now. I wasn't numb anymore. Tonight would, no doubt, be as horrific as last night. I lay down on my bed and curled into a ball in preparation for the onslaught. I squeezed my eyes shut and\u2026 the next thing I knew, it was morning. I stared at the pale silver light coming through my window, stunned. For the first time in more than four months, I'd slept without dreaming. Dreaming or screaming. I couldn't tell which emotion was stronger\u2014the relief or the shock. I lay still in my bed for a few minutes, waiting for it to come back. Because something must be coming. If not the pain, then the numbness. I waited, but nothing happened. I felt more rested than I had in a long time. I didn't trust this to last. It was a slippery, precarious edge that I balanced on, and it wouldn't take much to knock me back down. Just glancing around my room with these suddenly clear eyes\u2014noticing how strange it looked, too tidy, like I didn't live here at all\u2014was dangerous. I pushed that thought from my mind, and concentrated, as I got dressed, on the fact that I was going to see Jacob again today. The thought made me feel almost\u2026 hopeful. Maybe it would be the same as yesterday. Maybe I wouldn't have to remind myself to look interested and to nod or smile at appropriate intervals, the way I had to with everyone else. Maybe\u2026 but I wouldn't trust this to last, either. Wouldn't trust it to be the same\u2014so easy\u2014as yesterday. I wasn't going to set myself up for disappointment like that. At breakfast, Charlie was being careful, too. He tried to hide his scrutiny, keeping his eyes on his eggs until he thought I wasn't looking. \"What are you up to today?\u201dhe asked, eyeing a loose thread on the edge of his cuff like he wasn't paying much attention to my answer. \"I'm going to hang out with Jacob again.\" He nodded without looking up. \"Oh,\u201dhe said. \"Do you mind?\u201dI pretended to worry. \"I could stay\u2026\" He glanced up quickly, a hint of panic in his eyes. \"No, no! You go ahead. Harry was going to come up to watch the game with me anyway.\" \"Maybe Harry could give Billy a ride up,\u201dI suggested. The fewer witnesses the better. \"That's a great idea.\" I wasn't sure if the game was just an excuse for kicking me out, but he looked excited enough now. He headed to the phone while I donned my rain jacket. I felt self-conscious with the checkbook shoved in my jacket pocket. It was something I never used. Outside, the rain came down like water slopped from a bucket. I had to drive more slowly than I wanted to; I could hardly see a car length in front of the truck. But I finally made it through the muddy lanes to Jacob's house. Before I'd killed the engine, the front door opened and Jacob came running out with a huge black umbrella. He held it over my door while I opened it. \"Charlie called\u2014said you were on your way,\u201dJacob explained with a grin. Effortlessly, without a conscious command to the muscles around my lips, my answering smile spread across my face. A strange feeling of warmth bubbled up in my throat, despite the icy rain splattering on my cheeks. \"Hi, Jacob.\" \"Good call on inviting Billy up.\u201dHe held up his hand for a high five. \u00a0I had to reach so high to slap his hand that he laughed. Harry showed up to get Billy just a few minutes later. Jacob took me on a brief tour of his tiny room while we waited to be unsupervised. \"So where to, Mr. Goodwrench?\u201dI asked as soon as the door closed behind Billy. Jacob pulled a folded paper out of his pocket and smoothed it out. \"We'll start at the dump first, see if we can get lucky. This could get a little expensive,\u201dhe warned me. \"Those bikes are going to need a lot of help before they'll run again.\u201dMy face didn't look worried enough, so he continued. \"I'm talking about maybe more than a hundred dollars here.\" I pulled my checkbook out, fanned myself with it, and rolled my eyes at his worries. \"We're covered.\" It was a very strange kind of day. I enjoyed myself. Even at the dump, in the slopping rain and ankle-deep mud. I wondered at first if it was just the aftershock of losing the numbness, but I didn't think that was enough of an explanation. I was beginning to think it was mostly Jacob. It wasn't just that he was always so happy to see me, or that he didn't watch me out of the corner of his eye, waiting for me to do something that would mark me as crazy or depressed. It was nothing that related to me at all. It was Jacob himself. Jacob was simply a perpetually happy person, and he carried that happiness with him like an aura, sharing it with whoever was near him. Like an earthbound sun, whenever someone was within his gravitational pull, Jacob warmed them. It was natural, a part of who he was. No wonder I was so eager to see him. Even when he commented on the gaping hole in my dashboard, it didn't send me into a panic like it should have. \"Did the stereo break?\u201dhe wondered. \"Yeah,\u201dI lied. He poked around in the cavity. \"Who took it out? There's a lot of damage\u2026\" \"I did,\u201dI admitted. He laughed. \"Maybe you shouldn't touch the motorcycles too much.\" \"No problem.\" According to Jacob, we did get lucky at the dump. He was very excited about several grease-blackened pieces of twisted metal that he found; I was just impressed that he could tell what they were supposed to be. From there we went to the Checker Auto Parts down in Hoquiam. In my truck, it was more than a two hour drive south on the winding freeway, but the time passed easily with Jacob. He chattered about his friends and his school, and I found myself asking questions, not even pretending, truly curious to hear what he had to say. \"I'm doing all the talking,\u201dhe complained after a long story about Quil and the trouble he'd stirred up by asking out a senior's steady girlfriend. \"Why don't you take a turn? What's going on in Forks? It has to be more exciting than La Push.\" \"Wrong,\u201dI sighed. \"There's really nothing. Your friends are a lot more interesting than mine. I like your friends. Quil's funny.\" He frowned. \"I think Quil likes you, too.\" I laughed. \"He's a little young for me.\" Jacob's frown deepened. \"He's not that much younger than you. It's just a year and a few months.\" I had a feeling we weren't talking about Quil anymore. I kept my voice light, teasing. \"Sure, but, considering the difference in maturity between guys and girls, don't you have to count that in dog years? What does that make me, about twelve years older?\" He laughed, rolling his eyes. \"Okay, but if you're going to get picky like that, you have to average in size, too. You're so small, I'll have to knock ten years off your total.\" \"Five foot four is perfectly average.\u201dI sniffed. \"It's not my fault you're a freak.\" We bantered like that till Hoquiam, still arguing over the correct formula to determine age\u2014I lost two more years because I didn't know how to change a tire, but gained one back for being in charge of the bookkeeping at my house\u2014until we were in Checker, and Jacob had to concentrate again. We found everything left on his list, and Jacob felt confident that he could make a lot of progress with our haul. By the time we got back to La Push, I was twenty-three and he was thirty\u2014he was definitely weighting skills in his favor. I hadn't forgotten the reason for what I was doing. And, even though I was enjoying myself more than I'd thought possible, there was no lessening of my original desire. I still wanted to cheat. It was senseless, and I really didn't care. I was going to be as reckless as I could possibly manage in Forks. I would not be the only keeper of an empty contract. Getting to spend time with Jacob was just a much bigger perk than I'd expected. Billy wasn't back yet, so we didn't have to be sneaky about unloading our day's spoils. As soon as we had everything laid out on the plastic floor next to Jacob's toolbox, he went right to work, still talking and laughing while his fingers combed expertly through the metal pieces in front of him. Jacob's skill with his hands was fascinating. They looked too big for the delicate tasks they performed with ease and precision. While he worked, he seemed almost graceful. Unlike when he was on his feet; there, his height and big feet made him nearly as dangerous as I was. Quil and Embry did not show up, so maybe his threat yesterday had been taken seriously. The day passed too quickly. It got dark outside the mouth of the garage before I was expecting it, and then we heard Billy calling for us. I jumped up to help Jacob put things away, hesitating because I wasn't sure what I should touch. \"Just leave it,\u201dhe said. \"I'll work on it later tonight.\" \"Don't forget your schoolwork or anything,\u201dI said, feeling a little guilty. I didn't want him to get in trouble. That plan was just for me. \"Bella?\" Both our heads snapped up as Charlie's familiar voice wafted through the trees, sounding closer than the house. \"Shoot,\u201dI muttered. \"Coming!\u201dI yelled toward the house. \"Let's go.\u201dJacob smiled, enjoying the cloak-and-dagger. He snapped the light off, and for a moment I was blind. Jacob grabbed my hand and towed me out of the garage and through the trees, his feet finding the familiar path easily. His hand was rough, and very warm. Despite the path, we were both tripping over our feet in the darkness. So we were also both laughing when the house came into view. The laughter did not go deep; it was light and superficial, but still nice. I was sure he wouldn't notice the faint hint of hysteria. I wasn't used to laughing, and it felt right and also very wrong at the same time. Charlie was standing under the little back porch, and Billy was sitting in the doorway behind them. \"Hey, Dad,\u201dwe both said at the same time, and that started us laughing again. Charlie stared at me with wide eyes that flashed down to note Jacob's hand around mine. \"Billy invited us for dinner,\u201dCharlie said to us in an absentminded tone. \"My super secret recipe for spaghetti. Handed down for generations,\u201dBilly said <em>gravely</em>. Jacob snorted. \"I don't think Ragu's actually been around that long.\" The house was crowded. Harry Clearwater was there, too, with his family\u2014his wife, Sue, whom I knew vaguely from my childhood summers in Forks, and his two children. Leah was a senior like me, but a year older. She was beautiful in an exotic way\u2014perfect copper skin, glistening black hair, eyelashes like feather dusters\u2014and preoccupied. She was on Billy's phone when we got in, and she never let it go. Seth was fourteen; he hung on Jacob's every word with idolizing eyes. There were too many of us for the kitchen table, so Charlie and Harry brought chairs out to the yard, and we ate spaghetti off plates on our laps in the dim light from Billy's open door. The men talked about the game, and Harry and Charlie made fishing plans. Sue teased her husband about his cholesterol and tried, unsuccessfully, to shame him into eating something green and leafy. Jacob talked mostly to me and Seth, who interrupted eagerly whenever Jacob seemed in danger of forgetting him. Charlie watched me, trying to be inconspicuous about it, with pleased but cautious eyes.  It was loud and sometimes confusing as everyone talked over everyone else, and the laughter from one joke interrupted the telling of another. I didn't have to speak often, but I smiled a lot, and only because I felt like it. I didn't want to leave. This was Washington, though, and the inevitable rain eventually broke up the party; Billy's living room was much too small to provide an option for continuing the get-together. Harry had driven Charlie down, so we rode together in my truck on the way back home. He asked about my day, and I told mostly the truth\u2014that I'd gone with Jacob to look at parts and then watched him work in his garage. \"You think you'll visit again anytime soon?\u201dhe wondered, trying to be casual about it. \"Tomorrow after school,\u201dI admitted. \"I'll take homework, don't worry.\" \"You be sure to do that,\u201dhe ordered, trying to disguise his satisfaction. I was nervous when we got to the house. I didn't want to go upstairs. The warmth of Jacob's presence was fading and, in its absence, the anxiety grew stronger. I was sure I wouldn't get away with two peaceful nights of sleep in a row. To put bedtime off, I checked my e-mail; there was a new message from Renee. She wrote about her day, a new book club that rilled the time slot of the meditation classes she'd just quit, her week subbing in the second grade, missing her kindergarteners. She wrote that Phil was enjoying his new coaching job, and that they were planning a second honeymoon trip to Disney World. And I noticed that the whole thing read like a journal entry, rather than a letter to someone else. Remorse flooded through me, leaving an uncomfortable sting behind. Some daughter I was. I wrote back to her quickly, commenting on each part of her letter, volunteering information of my own\u2014describing the spaghetti party at Billy's and how I felt watching Jacob build useful things out of small pieces of metal\u2014awed and slightly envious. I made no reference to the change this letter would be from the ones she'd received in the last several months. I could barely remember what I'd written to her even as recently as last week, but I was sure it wasn't very responsive. The more I thought about it, the guiltier I felt; I really must have worried her. I stayed up extra late after that, finishing more homework than strictly necessary. But neither sleep deprivation nor the time spent with Jacob\u2014being almost happy in a shallow kind of way\u2014could keep the dream away for two nights in a row. I woke shuddering, my scream muffled by the pillow. As the dim morning light filtered through the fog outside my window, I lay still in bed and tried to shake off the dream. There had been a small difference last night, and I concentrated on that. Last night I had not been alone in the woods. Sam Uley\u2014the man who had pulled me from the forest floor that night I couldn't bear to think of consciously\u2014was there. It was an odd, unexpected alteration. The man's dark eyes had been surprisingly unfriendly, filled with some secret he didn't seem inclined to share. I'd stared at him as often as my frantic searching had allowed; it made me uncomfortable, under all the usual panic, to have him there. Maybe that was because, when I didn't look directly at him, his shape seemed to shiver and change in my peripheral vision. Yet he did nothing but stand and watch. Unlike the time when we had met in reality, he did not offer me his help. Charlie stared at me during breakfast, and I tried to ignore him. I supposed I deserved it. I couldn't expect him not to worry. It would probably be weeks before he stopped watching for the return of the zombie, and I would just have to try to not let it bother me. After all, I would be watching for the return of the zombie, too. Two days was hardly long enough to call me cured. School was the opposite. Now that I was paying attention, it was clear that no one was watching here. I remembered the first day I'd come to Forks High School\u2014how desperately I'd wished that I could turn gray, fade into the wet concrete of the sidewalk like an oversized chameleon. It seemed I was getting that wish answered, a year late. It was like I wasn't there. Even my teachers' eyes slid past my seat as if it were empty. I listened all through the morning, hearing once again the voices of the people around me. I tried to catch up on what was going on, but the conversations were so disjointed that I gave up. Jessica didn't look up when I sat down next to her in Calculus. \"Hey, Jess,\u201dI said with put-on nonchalance. \"How was the rest of your weekend?\" She looked at me with suspicious eyes. Could she still be angry? Or was she just too impatient to deal with a crazy person? \"Super,\u201dshe said, turning back to her book. \"That's good,\u201dI mumbled. The figure of speech cold shoulder seemed to have some literal truth to it. I could feel the warm air blowing from the floor vents, but I was still too cold. I took the jacket off the back of my chair and put it on again. My fourth hour class got out late, and the lunch table I always sat at was full by the time I arrived. Mike was there, Jessica and Angela, Conner, Tyler, Eric and Lauren. Katie Marshall, the redheaded junior who lived around the corner from me, was sitting with Eric, and Austin Marks\u2014older brother to the boy with the motorcycles\u2014was next to her. I wondered how long they'd been sitting here, unable to remember if this was the first day or something that was a regular habit. I was beginning to get annoyed with myself. I might as well have been packed in Styrofoam peanuts through the last semester. No one looked up when I sat down next to Mike, even though the chair squealed stridently against the linoleum as I dragged it back. I tried to catch up with the conversation. Mike and Conner were talking sports, so I gave up on that one at once. \"Where's Ben today?\u201dLauren was asking Angela. I perked up, interested. I wondered if that meant Angela and Ben were still together. I barely recognized Lauren. She'd cut off all her blond, corn-silk hair\u2014now she had a pixie cut so short that the back was shaved like a boy. What an odd thing for her to do. I wished I knew the reason behind it. Did she get gum stuck in it? Did she sell it? Had all the people she was habitually nasty to caught her behind the gym and scalped her? I decided it wasn't fair for me to judge her now by my former opinion. For all I knew, she'd turned into a nice person. \"Ben's got the stomach flu,\u201dAngela said in her quiet, calm voice. \"Hopefully it's just some twenty-four hour thing. He was really sick last night.\" Angela had changed her hair, too. She'd grown out her layers. \"What did you two do this weekend?\u201dJessica asked, not sounding as if she cared about the answer. I'd bet that this was just an opener so she could tell her own stories. I wondered if she would talk about Port Angeles with me sitting two seats away? Was I that invisible, that no one would feel uncomfortable discussing me while I was here? \"We were going to have a picnic Saturday, actually, but\u2026 we changed our minds,\u201dAngela said. There was an edge to her voice that caught my interest. Jess, not so much. \"That's too bad,\u201dshe said, about to launch into her story. But I wasn't the only one who was paying attention. \"What happened?\u201dLauren asked curiously. \"Well,\u201dAngela said, seeming more hesitant than usual, though she was always reserved, \"we drove up north, almost to the hot springs\u2014there's a good spot just about a mile up the trail. But, when we were halfway there\u2026 we saw something.\" \"Saw something? What?\u201dLauren's pale eyebrows pulled together. Even Jess seemed to be listening now. \"I don't know,\u201dAngela said. \"We think it was a bear. It was black, anyway, but it seemed\u2026 too big.\" Lauren snorted. \"Oh, not you, too!\u201dHer eyes turned mocking, and I decided I didn't need to give her the benefit of the doubt. Obviously her personality had not changed as much as her hair. \"Tyler tried to sell me that one last week.\" \"You're not going to see any bears that close to the resort,\u201dJessica said, siding with Lauren.  \"Really,\u201dAngela protested in a low voice, looking down at the table. \"We did see it.\" Lauren snickered. Mike was still talking to Conner, not paying attention to the girls. \"No, she's right,\u201dI threw in impatiently. \"We had a hiker in just Saturday who saw the bear, too, Angela.\u00a0 He said it was huge and black and just outside of town, didn't he, Mike?\" There was a moment of silence. Every pair of eyes at the table turned to stare at me in shock. The new girl, Katie, had her mouth hanging open like she'd just witnessed an explosion. Nobody moved. \"Mike?\u201dI muttered, mortified. \"Remember the guy with the bear story?\" \"S-sure,\u201dMike stuttered after a second. I didn't know why he was looking at me so strangely. I talked to him at work, didn't I? Did I? I thought so\u2026 Mike recovered. \"Yeah, there was a guy who said he saw a huge black bear right at the trailhead\u2014bigger than a grizzly,\u201dhe confirmed. \"Hmph.\u201dLauren turned to Jessica, her shoulders stiff, and changed the subject. \"Did you hear back from USC?\u201dshe asked. Everyone else looked away, too, except for Mike and Angela. Angela smiled at me tentatively, and I hurried to return the smile. \"So, what did you do this weekend, Bella?\u201dMike asked, curious, but oddly wary. Everyone but Lauren looked back, waiting for my response. \"Friday night, Jessica and I went to a movie in Port Angeles. And then I spent Saturday afternoon and most of Sunday down at La Push.\" The eyes flickered to Jessica and back to me. Jess looked irritated. I wondered if she didn't want anyone to know she'd gone out with me, or whether she just wanted to be the one to tell the story. \"What movie did you see?\u201dMike asked, starting to smile. \"Dead End\u2014the one with the zombies.\u201dI grinned in encouragement. Maybe some of the damage I'd done in these past zombie months was reparable. \"I heard that was scary. Did you think so?\u201dMike was eager to continue the conversation. \"Bella had to leave at the end, she was so freaked,\u201dJessica inserted with a sly smile. I nodded, trying to look embarrassed. \"It was pretty scary.\" Mike didn't stop asking me questions till lunch was over. Gradually, the others were able to start up their own conversations again, though they still looked at me a lot. Angela talked mostly to Mike and me, and, when I got up to dump my tray, she followed. \"Thanks,\u201dshe said in a low voice when we were away from the table. \"For what?\" \"Speaking up, sticking up for me.\" \"No problem.\" She looked at me with concern, but not the offensive, maybe-she's-lost-it kind. \"Are you okay?\" This is why I'd picked Jessica over Angela\u2014though I'd always liked Angela more\u2014for the girls' night movie. Angela was too perceptive. \"Not completely,\u201dI admitted. \"But I'm a little bit better.\" \"I'm glad,\u201dshe said. \"I've missed you.\" Lauren and Jessica strolled by us then, and I heard Lauren whisper loudly, \"Oh, joy Bella's back.\" Angela rolled her eyes at them, and smiled at me in encouragement. I sighed It was like I was starting all over again. \"What's today's date?\u201dI wondered suddenly. \"It's January nineteenth.\" \"Hmm.\" \"What is it?\u201dAngela asked. \"It was a year ago yesterday that I had my first day here,\u201dI mused. \"Nothing's changed much,\u201dAngela muttered, looking after Lauren and Jessica. \"I know,\u201d I agreed.\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI was just thinking the same thing.\"",
