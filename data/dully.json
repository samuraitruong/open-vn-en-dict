            "en": "7 REPETITION        11. CULT EACH TIME THAT I OPENED MY EYES TO THE MORNING light and realized I'd lived through another night was a surprise to me. After the surprise wore off, my heart would start to race and my palms would sweat; I couldn't really breathe again until I'd gotten up and ascertained that Charlie had survived as well. I could tell he was worried\u2014watching me jump at any loud sound, or my face suddenly go white for no reason that he could see. From the questions he asked now and then, he seemed to blame the change on Jacob's continued absence. The terror that was always foremost in my thoughts usually distracted me from the fact that another week had passed, and Jacob still hadn't called me. But when I was able to concentrate on my normal life\u2014if my life was really ever normal\u2014this upset me. I missed him horribly. It had been bad enough to be alone before I was scared silly. Now, more than ever, I yearned for his carefree laugh and his infectious grin. I needed the safe sanity of his homemade garage and his warm hand around my cold fingers. I'd half expected him to call on Monday. If there had been some progress with Embry, wouldn't he want to report it? I wanted to believe that it was worry for his friend that was occupying all his time, not that he was just giving up on me. I called him Tuesday, but no one answered. Were the phone lines still having problems? Or had Billy invested in caller I.D.?  On Wednesday I called every half hour until after eleven at night, desperate to hear the warmth of Jacob's voice. Thursday I sat in my truck in front of my house\u2014with the locks pushed down\u2014keys in hand, for a solid hour. I was arguing with myself, trying to justify a quick trip to La Push, but I couldn't do it. I knew that Laurent had gone back to Victoria by now. If I went to La Push, I took the chance of leading one of them there. What if they caught up to me when Jake was nearby? As much as it hurt me, I knew it was better for Jacob that he was avoiding me. Safer for him. It was bad enough that I couldn't figure out a way to keep Charlie safe. Nighttime was the most likely time that they would come looking for me, and what could I say to get Charlie out of the house? If I told him the truth, he'd have me locked up in a rubber room somewhere. I would have endured that\u2014welcomed it, even\u2014if it could have kept him safe. But Victoria would still come to his house first, looking for me. Maybe, if she found me here, that would be enough for her. Maybe she would just leave when she was done with me. So I couldn't run away. Even if I could, where would I go? To Renee? I shuddered at the thought of dragging my lethal shadows into my mother's safe, sunny world. I would never endanger her that way. The worry was eating a hole in my stomach. Soon I would have matching punctures. That night, Charlie did me another favor and called Harry again to see if the Blacks were out of town. Harry reported that Billy had attended the council meeting Wednesday night, and never mentioned anything about leaving. Charlie warned me not to make a nuisance of myself\u2014Jacob would call when he got around to it. Friday afternoon, as I drove home from school, it hit me out of the blue. I wasn't paying attention to the familiar road, letting the sound of the engine deaden my brain and silence the worries, when my subconscious delivered a verdict it must have been working on for some time without my knowledge. As soon as I thought of it, I felt really stupid for not seeing it sooner. Sure. I'd had a lot on my mind\u2014revenge-obsessed vampires, giant mutant wolves, a ragged hole in the center of my chest\u2014but when I laid the evidence out, it was embarrassingly obvious. Jacob avoiding me. Charlie saying he looked strange, upset. . . . Billy's vague, unhelpful answers. Holy crow, I knew exactly what was going on with Jacob. It was Sam Uley. Even my nightmares had been trying to tell me that. Sam had gotten to Jacob. Whatever was happening to the other boys on the reservation had reached out and stolen my friend. He'd been sucked into Sam's cult. He hadn't given up on me at all, I realized with a rush of feeling. I let my truck idle in front of my house. What should I do? I weighed the dangers against each other. If I went looking for Jacob, I risked the chance of Victoria or Laurent finding me with him. If I didn't go after him, Sam would pull him deeper into his frightening, compulsory gang. Maybe it would be too late if I didn't act soon. It had been a week, and no vampires had come for me yet. A week was more than enough time for them to have returned, so I must not be a priority. Most likely, as I'd decided before, they would come for me at night. The chances of them following me to La Push were much lower than the chance of losing Jacob to Sam. It was worth the danger of the secluded forest road. This was no idle visit to see what was going on. I knew what was going on. This was a rescue mission. I was going to talk to Jacob\u2014kidnap him if I had to. I'd once seen a PBS show on deprogramming the brainwashed. There had to be some kind of cure. I decided I'd better call Charlie first. Maybe whatever was going on down in La Push was something the police should be involved in. I dashed inside, in a hurry to be on my way. Charlie answered the phone at the station himself. \"Chief Swan.\" \"Dad, it's Bella.\" \"What's wrong? '\" I couldn't argue with his doomsday assumption this time. My voice was shaking. \"I'm worried about Jacob.\" \"Why? \" he asked, surprised by the unexpected topic. \"I think\u2026 I think something weird is going on down at the reservation. Jacob told me about some strange stuff happening with the other boys his age. Now he's acting the same way and I'm scared.\" \"What kind of stuff? \" He used his professional, police business voice. That was good; he was taking me seriously. \"First he was scared, and then he was avoiding me, and now\u2026 I'm afraid he's part of that bizarre gang down there, Sam's gang. Sam Uley's gang.\" \"Sam Uley? \" Charlie repeated, surprised again. \"Yes.\" Charlie's voice was more relaxed when he answered. \"I think you've got it wrong, Bells. Sam Uley is a great kid. Well, he's a man now. A good son. You should hear Billy talk about him. He's really doing wonders with the youth on the reservation. He's the one who\u2014\" Charlie broke off mid-sentence, and I guessed that he had been about to make a reference to the night I'd gotten lost in the woods. I moved on quickly. \"Dad, it's not like that. Jacob was scared of him.\" \"Did you talk to Billy about this? \" He was trying to soothe me now. I'd lost him as soon as I'd mentioned Sam. \"Billy's not concerned.\" \"Well, Bella, then I'm sure it's okay. Jacob's a kid; he was probably just messing around. I'm sure he's fine. He can't spend every waking minute with you, after all.\" \"This isn't about me,\" I insisted, but the battle was lost. \"I don't think you need to worry about this. Let Billy take care of Jacob.\" \"Charlie\u2026\" My voice was starting to sound whiney. \"Bells, I got a lot on my plate right now. Two tourists have gone missing off a trail outside crescent lake.\" There was an anxious edge to his voice. \"This wolf problem is getting out of hand.\" I was momentarily distracted\u2014stunned, really\u2014by his news. There was no way the wolves could have survived a match-up with Laurent\u2026 \"Are you sure that's what happened to them? \" I asked. \"Afraid so, honey. There was\u2014\" He hesitated. \"There were tracks again, and\u2026 some blood this time.\" \"Oh!\" It must not have come to a confrontation, then. Laurent must have simply outrun the wolves, but why? What I'd seen in the meadow just got stranger and stranger\u2014more impossible to understand. \"Look, I really have to go. Don't worry about Jake, Bella. I'm sure it's nothing.\" \"Fine,\" I said curtly, frustrated as his words reminded me of the more urgent crisis at hand. \"Bye.\" I hang up. I stared at the phone for a long minute. What the hell, I decided. Billy answered after two rings. \"Hello? \" \"Hey, Billy,\" I almost growled. I tried to sound more friendly as I continued. \"Can I talk to Jacob, please? \" \"Jake's not here.\" What a shock. \"Do you know where he is? \" \"He's out with his friends.\" Billy's voice was careful. \"Oh yeah? Anyone I know? Quil? \" I could tell the words didn't come across as casually as I'd meant them to. \"No,\" Billy said slowly. \"I don't think he's with Quil today.\" I knew better than to mention Sam's name. \"Embry? \" I asked. Billy seemed happier to answer this one. \"Yeah, he's with Embry.\" That was enough for me. Embry was one of them. \"Well, have him call me when he gets in, all right? \" \"Sure, sure. No problem.\" Click. \"See you soon, Billy,\" I muttered into the dead phone. I drove to La Push determined to wait. I'd sit out front of his house all night if I had to. I'd miss school. The boy was going to have to come home sometime, and when he did, he was going to have to talk to me. My mind was so preoccupied that the trip I'd been terrified of making seemed to take only a few seconds. Before I was expecting it, the forest began to thin, and I knew I would soon be able to see the first little houses of the reservation. Walking away, along the left side of the road, was a tall boy with a baseball cap. My breath caught for just a moment in my throat, hopeful that luck was with me for once, and I'd stumbled across Jacob without hardly trying. But this boy was too wide, and the hair was short under the hat. Even from behind, I was sure it was Quil, though he looked bigger than the last time I'd seen him. What was with these Quileute boys? Were they feeding them experimental growth hormones?  I crossed over to the wrong side of the road to stop next to him. He looked up when the roar of my truck approached. Quil's expression frightened me more than it surprised me. His face was bleak, brooding, his forehead creased with worry. \"Oh, hey, Bella,\" he greeted me <em>dully</em>. \"Hi, Quil\u2026 Are you okay? \" He stared at me morosely. \"Fine.\" \"Can I give you a ride somewhere? \" I offered. \"Sure, I guess,\" he mumbled. He shuffled around the front of the truck and opened the passenger door to climb in. \"Where to? \" \"My house is on the north side, back behind the store,\" he told me. \"Have you seen Jacob today.\" The question burst from me almost before he'd finished speaking. I looked at Quil eagerly, waiting for his answer. He stared out the windshield for a second before he spoke. \"From a distance,\" he finally said. \"A distance? \" I echoed. \"I tried to follow them\u2014he was with Embry.\" His voice was low, hard to hear over the engine. I leaned closer. \"I know they saw me. But they turned and just disappeared into the trees. I don't think they were alone\u2014I think Sam and his crew might have been with them.\u00a0 \u00a0\"I've been stumbling around in the forest for an hour, yelling for them. I just barely found the road again when you drove up.\" \"So Sam did get to him.\" The words were a little distorted\u2014my teeth were gritted together. Quil stared at me. \"You know about that.? \" I nodded. \"Jake told me\u2026 before.\" \"Before,\" Quil repeated, and sighed. \"Jacob's just as bad as the others now? \" \"Never leaves Sam's side.\" Quil turned his head and spit out the open window. \"And before that\u2014did he avoid everyone? Was he acting upset? \" His voice was low and rough. \"Not for as long as the others. Maybe one day. Then Sam caught up with him.\" \"What do you think it is? Drugs or something? \" \"I can't see Jacob or Embry getting into anything like that\u2026 but what do I know? What else could it be?  And why aren't the old people worried? \" He shook his head, and the fear showed in his eyes now. \"Jacob didn't want to be a part of this\u2026 cult. I don't understand what could change him.\" He stared at me, his face frightened. \"I don't want to be next.\" My eyes mirrored his fear. That was the second time I'd heard it described as a cult. I shivered. \"Are your parents any help? \" He grimaced. \"Right. My grandfather's on the council with Jacob's dad. Sam Uley is the best thing that ever happened to this place, as far as he's concerned.\" We stared at each other for a prolonged moment. We were in La Push now, and my truck was barely crawling along the empty road. I could see the village's only store not too far ahead. \"I'll get out now,\" Quil said. \"My house is right over there.\" He gestured toward the small wooden rectangle behind the store. I pulled over to the shoulder, and he jumped out. \"I'm going to go wait for Jacob,\" I told him in a hard voice. \"Good luck.\" He slammed the door and shuffled forward along the road, his head bent forward, his shoulders slumped. Quil's face haunted me as I made a wide U-turn and headed back toward the Blacks'. He was terrified of being next. What was happening here?  I stopped in front of Jacob's house, killing the motor and rolling down the windows. It was stuffy today, no breeze. I put my feet up on the dashboard and settled in to wait. A movement flashed in my peripheral vision\u2014I turned and spotted Billy looking at me through the front window with a confused expression. I waved once and smiled a tight smile, but stayed where I was.  His eyes narrowed; he let the curtain fall across the glass. I was prepared to stay as long as it took, but I wished I had something to do. I dug up a pen out of the bottom of my backpack, and an old test. I started to doodle on the back of the scrap. I'd only had time to scrawl one row of diamonds when there was a sharp tap against my door. I jumped, looking up, expecting Billy. \"What are you doing here, Bella.'\" Jacob growled. I stared at him in blank astonishment. Jacob had changed radically in the last weeks since I'd seen him. The first thing I noticed was his hair\u2014his beautiful hair was all gone, cropped quite short, covering his head with an inky gloss like black satin. The planes of his face seemed to have hardened subtly, tightened\u2026 aged. His neck and his shoulders were different, too, thicker somehow. His hands, where they gripped the window frame, looked enormous, with the tendons and veins more prominent under the russet skin. But the physical changes were insignificant. It was his expression that made him almost completely unrecognizable. The open,\u00a0 friendly smile was gone like the hair, the warmth in his dark eyes altered to a brooding resentment that was instantly disturbing. There was a darkness in Jacob now. Like my sun had imploded. \"Jacob? \" I whispered. He just stared at me, his eyes tense and angry. I realized we weren't alone. Behind him stood four others; all tall and russet-skinned, black hair chopped short just like Jacob's. They could have been brothers\u2014I couldn't even pick Embry out of the group. The resemblance was only intensified by the strikingly similar hostility in every pair of eyes. Every pair but one. The oldest by several years, Sam stood in the very back, his face serene and sure. I had to swallow back the bile that rose in my throat. I wanted to take a swing at him. No, I wanted to do more than that. More than anything, I wanted to be fierce and deadly, someone no one would dare mess with. Someone who would scare Sam Uley silly. I wanted to be a vampire. The violent desire caught me off guard and knocked the wind out of me. It was the most forbidden of all wishes\u2014even when I only wished it for a malicious reason like this, to gain an advantage over an enemy\u2014because it was the most painful. That future was lost to me forever, had never really been within my grasp. I scrambled to gain control of myself while the hole in my chest ached hollowly. \"What do you want? \" Jacob demanded, his expression growing more resentful as he watched the play of emotion across my face. \"I want to talk to you,\" I said in a weak voice. I tried to focus, but I was still reeling against the escape of my taboo dream. \"Go ahead,\" he hissed through his teeth. His glare was vicious. I'd never seen him look at anyone like that, least of all me. It hurt with a surprising intensity\u2014a physical pain, a stabbing in my head. \"Alone!\" I hissed, and my voice was stronger. He looked behind him, and I knew where his eyes would go. Every one of them was turned for Sam's reaction. Sam nodded once, his face unperturbed. He made a brief comment in an unfamiliar, liquid language\u2014I could only be positive that it wasn't French or Spanish, but I guessed that it was Quileute. He turned and walked into Jacob's house. The others, Paul, Jared, and Embry, I assumed, followed him in. \"Okay.\" Jacob seemed a bit less furious when the others were gone. His face was a little calmer, but also more hopeless. His mouth seemed permanently pulled down at the corners. I took a deep breath. \"You know what I want to know.\" He didn't answer. He just stared at me bitterly. I stared back and the silence stretched on. The pain in his face unnerved me. I felt a lump beginning to build in my throat. \"Can we walk? \" I asked while I could still speak. He didn't respond in any way; his face didn't change. I got out of the car, feeling unseen eyes behind the windows on me, and started walking toward the trees to the north. My feet squished in the damp grass and mud beside the road, and, as that was the only sound, at first I thought he wasn't following me. But when I glanced around, he was right beside me, his feet having somehow found a less noisy path than mine. I felt better in the fringe of trees, where Sam couldn't possibly be watching. As we walked, I struggled for the right thing to say, but nothing came. I just got more and more angry that Jacob had gotten sucked in\u2026 that Billy had allowed this\u2026 that Sam was able to stand there so assured and calm\u2026  Jacob suddenly picked up the pace, striding ahead of me easily with his long legs, and then swinging around to face me, planting himself in my path so I would have to stop too. I was distracted by the overt grace of his movement. Jacob had been nearly as klutzy as me with his never-ending growth spurt. When did that changed?  But Jacob didn't give me time to think about it. \"Let's get this over with,\" he said in a hard, husky voice. I waited. He knew what I wanted. \"It's not what you think.\" His voice was abruptly weary. \"It's not what I thought\u2014I was way off.\" \"So what is it, then? \" He studied my face for a long moment, speculating. The anger never completely left his eyes. \"I can't tell you,\" he finally said. My jaw tightened, and I spoke through my teeth. \"I thought we were friends.\" \"We were.\" There was a slight emphasis on the past tense. \"But you don't need friends anymore,\" I said sourly. \"You have Sam. Isn't that nice\u2014you've always looked up to him so much.\" \"I didn't understand him before.\" \"And now you've seen the light. Hallelujah.\" \"It wasn't like I thought it was. This isn't Sam's fault. He's helping me as much as he can.\" His voice turned brittle and he looked over my head, past me, rage burning out from his eyes. \"He's helping you,\" I repeated dubiously. \"Naturally.\" But Jacob didn't seem to be listening. He was taking deep, deliberate breaths, trying to calm himself. He was so mad that his hands were shaking. \"Jacob, please,\" I whispered \"Won't you tell me what happened? Maybe I can help.\" \"No one can help me now.\" The words were a low moan; his voice broke. \"What did he do to you? \" I demanded, tears collecting in my eyes. I reached out to him, as I had once before, stepping forward with my arms wide. This time he cringed away, holding his hands up defensively. \"Don't touch me,\" he whispered. \"Is Sam catching? \" I mumbled. The stupid tears had escaped the corners of my eyes. I wiped them away with the back of my hand, and folded my arms across my chest. \"Stop blaming Sam.\" The words came out fast, like a reflex. His hands reached up to twist around the hair that was no longer there, and then fell limply at his sides. \"Then who should I blame? \" I retorted. He halfway smiled; it was a bleak, twisted thing. \"You don't want to hear that.\" \"The hell I don't!\" I snapped. \"I want to know, and I want to know now.\" \"You're wrong,\" he snapped back. \"Don't you dare tell me I'm wrong\u2014I'm not the one who got brainwashed! Tell me now whose fault this all is, if it's not your precious Sam!\" \"You asked for it,\" he growled at me, eyes glinting hard. \"If you want to blame someone, why don't you point your finger at those filthy, reeking bloodsuckers that you love so much? \" My mouth fell open and my breath came out with a whooshing sound. I was frozen in place, stabbed through with his double-edged words. The pain twisted in familiar patterns through my body, the jagged hole ripping me open from the inside out, but it was second place, background music to the chaos of my thoughts. I couldn't believe that I'd heard him correctly. There was no trace of indecision in his face. Only fury. My mouth still hung wide. \"I told you that you didn't want to hear it,\" he said. \"I don't understand who you mean,\" I whispered. He raised one eyebrow in disbelief. \"I think you understand exactly who I mean. You're not going to make me say it, are you? I don't like hurting you.\" \"I don't understand who you mean,\" I repeated mechanically. \"The Cullens,\" he said slowly, drawing out the word, scrutinizing my face as he spoke it. \"I saw that\u2014I can see in your eyes what it does to you when I say their name.\" I shook my head back and forth in denial, trying to clear it at the same time. How did he know this? And how did it have anything to do with Sam's cult? Was it a gang of vampire-haters? What was the point of forming such a society when no vampires lived in Forks anymore? Why would Jacob start believing the stories about the Cullens now, when the evidence of them was long gone, never to return?  It took me too long to come up with the correct response. \"Don't tell me you're listening to Billy's superstitious nonsense now,\" I said with a feeble attempt at mockery. \"He knows more than I gave him credit for.\" \"Be serious, Jacob.\" He glared at me, his eyes critical. \"Superstitions aside,\" I said quickly. \"I still don't see what you're accusing the... Cullens\"\u2014wince\u2014\"of. \u00a0They left more than half a year ago. How can you blame them for what Sam is doing now? \" \"Sam isn't doing anything, Bella. And I know they're gone. But sometimes\u2026 things are set in motion, and then it's too late.\" \"What's set in motion? What's too late? What are you blaming them for? \" He was suddenly right in my face, his fury glowing in his eyes. \"For existing,\" he hissed. I was surprised and distracted as the warning words came in Edward's voice again, when I wasn't even scared. \"Quiet now, Bella. Don't push him,\" Edward cautioned in my ear. Ever since Edward's name had broken through the careful walls I'd buried it behind, I'd been unable to lock it up again. It didn't hurt now\u2014not during the precious seconds when I could hear his voice. Jacob was fuming in front of me, quivering with anger. I didn't understand why the Edward delusion was unexpectedly in my mind. Jacob was livid, but he was Jacob. There was no adrenaline, no danger. \"Give him a chance to calm down,\" Edward's voice insisted. I shook my head in confusion. \"You're being ridiculous,\" I told them both. \"Fine,\" Jacob answered, breathing deeply again. \"I won't argue it with you. It doesn't matter anyway, the damage is done.\" \"What damage? \" He didn't flinch as I shouted the words in his face. \"Let's head back. There's nothing more to say.\" I gaped. \"There's everything more to say! You haven't said anything yet!\" He walked past me, striding back toward the house. \"I ran into Quil today,\" I yelled after him. He paused midstep, but didn't turn. \"You remember your friend, Quil? Yeah, he's terrified.\" Jacob whirled to face me. His expression was pained. \"Quil\" was all he said. \"He's worried about you, too. He's freaked out.\" Jacob stared past me with desperate eyes. I goaded him further. \"He's frightened that he's next.\" Jacob clutched at a tree for support, his face turning a strange shade of green under the red-brown surface. \"He won't be next,\" Jacob muttered to himself. \"He can't be. It's over now. This shouldn't still be happening. Why? Why? \" His fist slammed against the tree. It wasn't a big tree, slender and only a few feet taller than Jacob. But it still surprised me when the trunk gave way and snapped off loudly under his blows. Jacob stared at the sharp, broken point with shock that quickly turned to horror. \"I have to get back.\" He whirled and stalked away so swiftly that I had to jog to keep up. \"Back to Sam!\" \"That's one way of looking at it,\" it sounded like he said. He was mumbling and facing away. I chased him back to the truck. \"Wait!\" I called as he turned toward the house. He spun around to face me, and I saw that his hands were shaking again. \"Go home, Bella. I can't hang out with you anymore.\" The silly, inconsequential hurt was incredibly potent. The tears welled up again. \"Are you\u2026 breaking up with me? \" The words were all wrong, but they were the best way I could think to phrase what I was asking. After all, what Jake and I had was more than any schoolyard romance. Stronger. He barked out a bitter laugh. \"Hardly. If that were the case, I'd say 'Let's stay friends.' I can't even say that.\" \"Jacob\u2026 why? Sam won't let you have other friends? Please, Jake. You promised. I need you!\" The blank emptiness of my life before\u2014before Jacob brought some semblance of reason back into it\u2014reared up and confronted me. Loneliness choked in my throat. \"I'm sorry, Bella,\" Jacob said each word distinctly in a cold voice that didn't seem to belong to him. I didn't believe that this was really what Jacob wanted to say. It seemed like there was something else trying to be said through his angry eyes, but I couldn't understand the message. Maybe this wasn't about Sam at all. Maybe this had nothing to do with the Cullens. Maybe he was just trying to pull himself out of a hopeless situation. Maybe I should let him do that, if that's what was best for him. I should do that. It would be right. But I heard my voice escaping in a whisper. \"I'm sorry that I couldn't\u2026 before\u2026 I wish I could change how I feel about you, Jacob.\" I was desperate, reaching, stretching the truth so far that it curved nearly into the shape of a lie. \"Maybe\u2026 maybe I would change,\" I whispered. \"Maybe, if you gave me some time\u2026 just don't quit on me now, Jake. I can't take it.\" His face went from anger to agony in a second. One shaking hand reached out toward me. \"No. Don't think like that, Bella, please. Don't blame yourself, don't think this is your fault. This one is all me. I swear, it's not about you.\" \"It's not you, it's me,\" I whispered. \"There's a new one.\" \"I mean it, Bella. I'm not\u2026\" he struggled, his voice going even huskier as he fought to control his emotion. His eyes were tortured. \"I'm not good enough to be your friend anymore, or anything else. I'm not what I was before. I'm not good.\" \"What? \" I stared at him, confused and appalled. \"What are you saying? You're much better than I am, Jake. You are good! Who told you that you aren't? Sam? It's a vicious lie, Jacob! Don't let him tell you that!\" I was suddenly yelling again. Jacob's face went hard and flat. \"No one had to tell me anything. I know what I am.\" \"You're my friend, that's what you are! Jake\u2014don't!\" He was backing away from me. \"I'm sorry, Bella,\" he said again; this time it was a broken mumble. He turned and almost ran into the house. I was unable to move from where I stood. I stared at the little house; it looked too small to hold four large boys and two larger men. There was no reaction inside. No flutter at the edge of the curtain, no sound of voices or movement. It faced me vacantly. The rain started to drizzle, stinging here and there against my skin. I couldn't take my eyes off the house. Jacob would come back. He had to. The rain picked up, and so did the wind. The drops were no longer falling from above; they slanted at an angle from the west. I could smell the brine from the ocean. My hair whipped in my face, sticking to the wet places and tangling in my lashes. I waited. Finally the door opened, and I took a step forward in relief. Billy rolled his chair into the door frame. I could see no one behind him. \"Charlie just called, Bella. I told him you were on your way home.\" His eyes were full of pity. The pity made it final somehow. I didn't comment. I just turned robotically and climbed in my truck. I'd left the windows open and the seats were slick and wet. It didn't matter. I was already soaked. Not as bad! Not as bad! my mind tried to comfort me. It was true. This wasn't as bad. This wasn't the end of the world, not again. This was just the end of what little peace there was left behind. That was all. Not as bad, I agreed, then added, but bad enough. I'd thought Jake had been healing the hole in me\u2014or at least plugging it up, keeping it from hurting me so much. I'd been wrong. He'd just been carving out his own hole, so that I was now riddled through like Swiss cheese. I wondered why I didn't crumble into pieces. Charlie was waiting on the porch. As I rolled to a stop, he walked out to meet me. \"Billy called. He said you got in fight with Jake\u2014said you were pretty upset,\" he explained as he opened my door for me. Then he looked at my face. A kind of horrified recognition registered in his expression. I tried to feel my face from the inside out, to know what he was seeing. My face felt empty and cold, and I realized what it would remind him of. \"That's not exactly how it happened,\" I muttered. Charlie put his arm around me and helped me out of the car. He didn't comment on my sodden clothes. \"Then what did happen'\" he asked when we were inside. He pulled the afghan off the back of the sofa as he spoke and wrapped it around my shoulders. I realized I was shivering still. My voice was lifeless. \"Sam Uley says Jacob can't be my friend anymore.\" Charlie shot me a strange look. \"Who told you that? \" \"Jacob,\" I stated, though that wasn't exactly what he'd said. It was still true. Charlie's eyebrows pulled together. \"You really think there's something wrong with the Uley kid? \" \"I know there is. Jacob wouldn't tell me what, though.\" I could hear the water from my clothes dripping to the floor and splashing on the linoleum. \"I'm going to go change.\" Charlie was lost in thought. \"Okay,\" he said absently. I decided to take a shower because I was so cold, but the hot water didn't seem to affect the temperature of my skin. I was still freezing when I gave up and shut the water off. In the sudden quiet, I could hear Charlie talking to someone downstairs. I wrapped a towel around me, and cracked the bathroom door. Charlie's voice was angry. \"I'm not buying that. It doesn't make any sense.\" It was quiet then, and I realized he was on the phone. A minute passed. \"Don't you put this on Bella!\" Charlie suddenly shouted. I jumped. When he spoke again, his voice was careful and lower. \"Bella's made it very clear all along that she and Jacob were just friends\u2026 Well, if that was it, then why didn't you say so at first? No, Billy, I think she's right about this\u2026 Because I know my daughter, and if she says Jacob was scared before\u2014\" He was cut off mid-sentence, and when he answered he was almost shouting again. \"What do you mean I don't know my daughter as well as I think I do!\" He listened for a brief second, and his response was almost too low for me to hear. \"If you think I'm going to remind her about that, then you had better think again. She's only just starting to get over it, and mostly because of Jacob, I think. If whatever Jacob has going on with this Sam character sends her back into that depression, then Jacob is going to have to answer to me. You're my friend, Billy, but this is hurting my family.\" There was another break for Billy to respond. \"You got that right\u2014those boys set one toe out of line and I'm going to know about it. We'll be keeping an eye on the situation, you can be sure of that.\" He was no longer Charlie; he was Chief Swan now. \"Fine. Yeah. Goodbye.\" The phone slammed into the cradle. I tiptoed quickly across the hall into my room. Charlie was muttering angrily in the kitchen.  So Billy was going to blame me. I was leading Jacob on and he'd finally had enough. It was strange, for I'd feared that myself, but after the last thing Jacob had said this afternoon, I didn't believe it anymore. There was much more to this than an unrequited crush, and it surprised me that Billy would stoop to claiming that. It made me think that whatever secret they were keeping was bigger than I'd been imagining. At least Charlie was on my side now. I put my pajamas on and crawled into bed. Life seemed dark enough at the moment that I let myself cheat. The hole\u2014holes now\u2014were already aching, so why not? I pulled out the memory\u2014nor a real memory that would hurt too much, but the false memory of Edward's voice in my mind this afternoon\u2014and played it over and over in my head until I fell asleep with the tears still streaming calmly down my empty face. It was a new dream tonight. Rain was falling and Jacob was walking soundlessly beside me, though beneath my feet the ground crunched like dry gravel. But he wasn't my Jacob; he was the new, bitter, graceful Jacob. The smooth suppleness of his walk reminded me of someone else, and, as I watched, his features started to change. The russet color of his skin leached away, leaving his face pale white like bone. His eyes turned gold, and then crimson, and then back to gold again. His short hair twisted in the breeze, turning bronze where the wind touched it. And his face became so beautiful that it shattered my heart. I reached for him, but he took a step away, raising his hands like a shield. And then Edward vanished. I wasn't sure, when I woke in the dark, if I'd just begun crying, or if my tears had run while I slept and simply continued now. I stared at my dark ceiling. I could feel that it was the middle of the night\u2014I was still half-asleep, maybe more than half. I closed my eyes wearily and prayed for a dreamless sleep. That's when I heard the noise that must have wakened me in the first place. Something sharp scraped along the length of my window with a high-pitched squeal, like fingernails against the glass.",

            "en": "7 REPETITION        9. THIRD WHEEL TIME BEGAN TO TRIP ALONG MUCH MORE QUICKLY than before. School, work, and Jacob\u2014though not necessarily in that order\u2014created a neat and effortless pattern to follow. And Charlie got his wish: I wasn't miserable anymore. Of course, I couldn't fool myself completely. When I stopped to take stock of my life, which I tried not to do too often, I couldn't ignore the implications of my behavior. I was like a lost moon\u2014my planet destroyed in some cataclysmic, disaster-movie scenario of desolation\u2014that continued, nevertheless, to circle in a tight little orbit around the empty space left behind, ignoring the laws of gravity. I was getting better with my bike, which meant fewer bandages to worry Charlie. But it also meant that the voice in my head began to fade, until I heard it no more. Quietly, I panicked. I threw myself into the search for the meadow with slightly frenzied intensity. I racked my brain for other adrenaline-producing activities. I didn't keep track of the days that passed\u2014there was no reason, as I tried to live as much in the present as possible, no past fading, no future impending. So I was surprised by the date when Jacob brought it up on one of our homework days. He was waiting when I pulled up in front of his house. \"Happy Valentine's Day,\" Jacob said, smiling, but ducking his head as he greeted me. He held out a small, pink box, balancing it on his palm. Conversation hearts. \"Well, I feel like a schmuck,\" I mumbled. \"Is today Valentine's Day?\" Jacob shook his head with mock sadness. \"You can be so out of it sometimes. Yes, it is the fourteenth day of February. So are you going to be my Valentine? Since you didn't get me a fifty-cent box of candy, it's the least you can do.\" I started to feel uncomfortable. The words were teasing, but only on the surface. \"What exactly does that entail?\" I hedged. \"The usual\u2014slave for life, that kind of thing.\" \"Oh, well, if that's all\u2026\" I took the candy. But I was trying to think of some way to make the boundaries clear. Again. They seemed to get blurred a lot with Jacob. \"So, what are we doing tomorrow? Hiking, or the ER?\" \"Hiking,\" I decided. \"You're not the only one who can be obsessive. I'm starting to think I imagined that place\u2026\" I frowned into space. \"We'll find it,\" he assured me. \"Bikes Friday?\" he offered. I saw a chance and took it without taking time to think it through. \"I'm going to a movie Friday. I've been promising my cafeteria crowd that I would go out forever.\" Mike would be pleased. But Jacob's face fell. I caught the expression in his dark eyes before he dropped them to look at the ground. \"You'll come too, right?\" I added quickly. \"Or will it be too much of a drag with a bunch of boring seniors?\" So much for my chance to put some distance between us. I couldn't stand hurting Jacob; we seemed to be connected in an odd way, and his pain set off little stabs of my own. Also, the idea of having his company for the ordeal\u2014I had promised Mike, but really didn't feel any enthusiasm at the thought of following through\u2014was just too tempting. \"You'd like me to come, with your friends there?\" \"Yes,\" I admitted honestly, knowing as I continued that I was probably shooting myself in the foot with my words. \"I'll have a lot more fun if you're there. Bring Quil, and we'll make it a party.\" \"Quil's gonna freak. Senior girls.\" He chortled and rolled his eyes. I didn't mention Embry, and neither did he. I laughed, too. \"I'll try to get him a good selection.\" I broached the subject with Mike in English. \"Hey, Mike,\" I said when class was over. \"Are you free Friday night?\" He looked up, his blue eyes instantly hopeful. \"Yeah, I am. You want to go out?\" I worded my reply carefully. \"I was thinking about getting a group\"\u2014I emphasized the word\u2014\"together to go see Crosshairs.\" I'd done my homework this time\u2014even reading the movie spoilers to be sure I wouldn't be caught off guard. This movie was supposed to be a bloodbath from start to finish. I wasn't so recovered that I could stand to sit through a romance. \"Does that sound like fun?\" \"Sure,\" he agreed, visibly less eager. \"Cool.\" After a second, he perked back up to near his former excitement level. \"How about we get Angela and Ben? Or Eric and Katie?\" He was determined to make this some kind of double date, apparently. \"How about both?\" I suggested \"And Jessica, too, of course. And Tyler and Conner, and maybe Lauren,\" I tacked on grudgingly. I had promised Quil variety. \"Okay,\" Mike muttered, foiled. \"And,\" I continued, \"I've got a couple of friends from La Push I'm inviting. So it sounds like we'll need your Suburban if everyone comes.\" Mike's eyes narrowed in suspicion. \"These are the friends you spend all your time studying with now?\" \"Yep, the very ones,\" I answered cheerfully. \"Though you could look at it as tutoring\u2014they're only sophomores.\" \"Oh,\" Mike said, surprised. After a second of thought, he smiled. In the end, though, the Suburban wasn't necessary. Jessica and Lauren claimed to be busy as soon as Mike let it slip that I was involved in the planning. Eric and Katie already had plans\u2014it was their three-week anniversary or something. Lauren got to Tyler and Conner before Mike could, so those two were also busy. Even Quil was out\u2014grounded for fighting at school. In the end, only Angela and Ben, and, of course Jacob, were able to go. The diminished numbers didn't dampen Mike's anticipation, though. It was all he could talk about Friday. \"Are you sure you don't want to see Tomorrow and Forever instead?\" he asked at lunch, naming the current romantic comedy that was ruling the box office. \"Rotten Tomatoes gave it a better review.\" \"I want to see Crosshairs\" I insisted. \"I'm in the mood for action. Bring on the blood and guts! \" \"Okay.\" Mike turned away, but not before I saw his maybe-she's-crazy-after-all expression. When I got home from school, a very familiar car was parked in front of my house. Jacob was leaning against the hood, a huge grin lighting up his face. \"No way! \" I shouted as I jumped out of the truck. \"You're done! \u00a0I can't believe it! \u00a0You finished the Rabbit! \" He beamed. \"Just last night. This is the maiden voyage.\" \"Incredible.\" I held my hand up for a high five. He smacked his hand against mine, but left it there, twisting his fingers through mine. \"So do I get to drive tonight?\" \"Definitely,\" I said, and then I sighed. \"What's wrong?\" \"I'm giving up\u2014I can't top this one. So you win. You're oldest.\" He shrugged, unsurprised by my capitulation. \"Of course I am.\" Mike's Suburban chugged around the corner. I pulled my hand out of Jacob's, and he nude a face that I wasn't meant to see. \"I remember this guy,\" he said in a low voice as Mike parked across the street. \"The one who thought you were his girlfriend. Is he still confused?\" I raised one eyebrow. \"Some people are hard to discourage.\" \"Then again,\" Jacob said thoughtfully, \"sometimes persistence pays off.\" \"Most of the time it's just annoying, though.\" Mike got out of his car and crossed the road. \"Hey, Bella,\" he greeted me, and then his eyes turned wary as he looked up at Jacob. I glanced briefly at Jacob, too, trying to be objective. He really didn't look like a sophomore at all. He was just so big\u2014Mike's head barely cleared Jacob's shoulder; I didn't even want to think where I measured next to him\u2014and then his face was older-looking than it used to be, even a month ago. \"Hey, Mike! \u00a0Do you remember Jacob Black?\" \"Not really.\" Mike held out his hand. \"Old family friend,\" Jacob introduced himself, shaking hands. They locked hands with more force than necessary. When their grip broke, Mike flexed his fingers. I heard the phone ringing from the kitchen. \"I'd better get that\u2014it might be Charlie,\" I told them, and dashed inside. It was Ben. Angela was sick with the stomach flu, and he didn't feel like coming without her. He apologized for bailing on us. I walked slowly back to the waiting boys, shaking my head. I really hoped Angela would feel better soon, but I had to admit that I was selfishly upset by this development. Just the three of us, Mike and Jacob and me, together for the evening\u2014this had worked out brilliantly, I thought with grim sarcasm. It didn't seem like Jake and Mike had made any progress towards friendship in my absence. They were several yards apart, facing away from each other as they waited for me; Mike's expression was sullen, though Jacob's was cheerful as always. \"Ang is sick,\" I told them glumly. \"She and Ben aren't coming.\" \"I guess the flu is making another round. Austin and Conner were out today, too. Maybe we should do this another time,\" Mike suggested. Before I could agree, Jacob spoke. \"I'm still up for it. But if you'd rather to stay behind, Mike\u2014\" \"No, I'm coming,\" Mike interrupted. \"I was just thinking of Angela and Ben. Let's go.\" He started toward his Suburban. \"Hey, do you mind if Jacob drives?\" I asked. \"I told him he could\u2014he just finished his car. He built it from scratch, all by himself,\" I bragged, proud as a PTA mom with a student on the principal's list. \"Fine,\" Mike snapped. \"All right, then,\" Jacob said, as if that settled everything. He seemed more comfortable than anyone else. Mike climbed in the backseat of the Rabbit with a disgusted expression. Jacob was his normal sunny self, chattering away until I'd all but forgotten Mike sulking silently in the back. And then Mike changed his strategy. He leaned forward, resting his chin on the shoulder of my seat; his cheek almost touched mine. I shifted away, turning my back toward the window. \"Doesn't the radio work in this thing?\" Mike asked with a hint of petulance, interrupting Jacob mid-sentence. \"Yes,\" Jacob answered. \"But Bella doesn't like music.\" I stared at Jacob, surprised. I'd never told him that. \"Bella?\" Mike asked, annoyed. \"He's right,\" I mumbled, still looking at Jacob's serene profile. \"How can you not like music?\" Mike demanded. I shrugged. \"I don't know. It just irritates me.\" \"Hmph.\" Mike leaned away. When we got to the theater, Jacob handed me a ten-dollar bill. \"What's this?\" I objected. \"I'm not old enough to get into this one,\" he reminded me. I laughed out loud. \"So much for relative ages. Is Billy going to kill me if I sneak you in?\" \"No. I told him you were planning to corrupt my youthful innocence.\" I snickered, and Mike quickened his pace to keep up with us. I almost wished that Mike had decided to bow out. He was still sullen\u2014not much of an addition to the party. But I didn't want to end up on a date alone with Jacob, either. That wouldn't help anything. The movie was exactly what it professed to be. In just the opening credits, four people got blown up and one got beheaded. The girl in front of me put her hands over her eyes and turned her face into her date's chest. He patted her shoulder, and winced occasionally, too. Mike didn't look like he was watching. His face was stiff as he glared toward the fringe of curtain above the screen. I settled in to endure the two hours, watching the colors and the movement on the screen rather than seeing the shapes of people and cars and houses. But then Jacob started sniggering. \"What?\" I whispered. \"Oh, c'mon! \" he hissed back. \"The blood squirted twenty feet out of that guy. How fake can you get?\" He chuckled again, as a flagpole speared another man into a concrete wall. After that, I really watched the show, laughing with him as the mayhem got more and more ridiculous. How was I ever going to fight the blurring lines in our relationship when I enjoyed being with him so much? Both Jacob and Mike had claimed the armrests on either side of me. Both of their hands rested lightly, palms up, in an unnatural looking position. Like steel bear traps, open and ready. Jacob was in the habit of taking my hand whenever the opportunity presented itself, but here in the darkened movie theater, with Mike watching, it would have a different significance\u2014and I was sure he knew that. I couldn't believe that Mike was thinking the same thing, but his hand was placed exactly like Jacob's. I folded my arms tightly across my chest and hoped that both their hands fell asleep. Mike gave up first. About halfway through the movie, he pulled his arm back, and leaned forward to put his head in his hands. At first I thought he was reacting to something on the screen, but then he moaned. \"Mike, are you okay?\" I whispered. The couple in front of us turned to look at him as he groaned again. I could see the sheen of sweat across his face in the light from the screen. Mike groaned again, and bolted for the door. I got up to follow him, and Jacob copied me immediately. \"No, stay,\" I whispered. \"I'll make sure he's okay.\" Jacob came with me anyway. \"You don't have to come. Get your eight bucks worth of carnage,\" I insisted as we walked up the aisle. \"That's okay. You sure can pick them, Bella. This movie really sucks.\" His voice rose from a whisper to its normal pitch as we walked out of the theater. There was no sign of Mike in the hallway, and I was glad then that Jacob had come with me\u2014he ducked into the men's bathroom to check for him there. Jacob was back in a few seconds. \"Oh, he's in there, all right,\" he said, rolling his eyes. \"What a marshmallow. You should hold out for someone with a stronger stomach. Someone who laughs at the gore that makes weaker men vomit.\" \"I'll keep my eyes open for someone like that.\" We were all alone in the hallway. Both theaters were halfway through the movie, and it was deserted\u2014quiet enough for us to hear the popcorn popping at the concession counter in the lobby. Jacob went to sit on the velveteen-upholstered bench against the wall, patting the space beside him. \"He sounded like he was going to be in there for a while,\" he said, stretching his long legs out in front of him as he settled in to wait. I joined him with a sigh. He looked like he was thinking about blurring more lines. Sure enough, as soon as I sat down, he shifted over to put his arm around my shoulders. \"Jake,\" I protested, leaning away. He dropped his arm, not looking bothered at all by the minor rejection. He reached out and took my hand firmly, wrapping his other hand around my wrist when I tried to pull away again. Where did he get the confidence from? \"Now, just hold on a minute, Bella,\" he said in a calm voice. \"Tell me something.\" I grimaced. I didn't want to do this. Not just not now, but not ever. There was nothing left in my life at this point that was more important than Jacob Black. But he seemed determined to ruin everything. \"What?\" I muttered sourly. \"You like me, right?\" \"You know I do.\" \"Better than that joker puking his guts out in there?\" He gestured toward the bathroom door. \"Yes,\" I sighed. \"Better than any of the other guys you know?\" He was calm, serene\u2014as if my answer didn't matter, or he already knew what it was. \"Better than the girls, too,\" I pointed out. \"But that's all,\" he said, and it wasn't a question. It was hard to answer, to say the word. Would he get hurt and avoid me? How would I stand that?  \"Yes,\" I whispered. He grinned down at me. \"That's okay, you know. As long as you like me the best. And you think I'm good-looking\u2014sort of. I'm prepared to be annoyingly persistent.\" \"I'm not going to change,\" I said, and though I tried to keep my voice normal, I could hear the sadness in it. His face was thoughtful, no longer teasing. \"It's still the other one, isn't it?\" I cringed. Funny how he seemed to know not to say the name\u2014just like before in the car with the music. He picked up on so much about me that I never said. \"You don't have to talk about it,\" he told me. I nodded, grateful. \"But don't get mad at me for hanging around, okay?\" Jacob patted the back of my hand. \"Because I'm not giving up. I've got loads of time.\" I sighed. \"You shouldn't waste it on me,\" I said, though I wanted him to. Especially if he was willing to accept me the way I was\u2014damaged goods, as is. \"It's what I want to do, as long as you still like to be with me.\" \"I can't imagine how I could not like being with you,\" I told him honestly. Jacob beamed. \"I can live with that.\" \"Just don't expect more,\" I warned him, trying to pull my hand away. He held onto it obstinately. \"This doesn't really bother you, does it?\" he demanded, squeezing my fingers. \"No,\" I sighed. Truthfully, it felt nice. His hand was so much warmer than mine; I always felt too cold these days. \"And you don't care what he thinks.\" Jacob jerked his thumb toward the bathroom. \"I guess not.\" \"So what's the problem?\" \"The problem,\" I said, \"is, that it means something different to me than it does to you.\" \"Well.\" He tightened his hand around mine \"That's my problem, isn't it?\" \"Fine,\" I grumbled. \"Don't forget it, though.\" \"I won't. The pin's out of the grenade for me, now, eh?\" He poked me in the ribs. I rolled my eyes. I guess if he felt like making a joke out of it, he was entitled. He chuckled quietly for a minute while his pinky finger absently traced designs against the side of my hand. \"That's a funny scar you've got there,\" he suddenly said, twisting my hand to examine it. \"How did that happen?\" The index finger of his free hand followed the line of the long silvery crescent that was barely visible against my pale skin. I scowled. \"Do you honestly expect me to remember where all my scars come from?\" I waited for the memory to hit\u2014to open the gaping hole. But, as it so often did, Jacob's presence kept me whole. \"It's cold,\" he murmured, pressing lightly against the place where James had cut me with his teeth. And then Mike stumbled out of the bathroom, his face ashen and covered in sweat. He looked horrible. \"Oh, Mike,\" I gasped. \"Do you mind leaving early?\" he whispered. \"No, of course not.\" I pulled my hand free and went to help Mike walk. He looked unsteady. \"Movie too much for you?\" Jacob asked heartlessly. Mike's glare was malevolent. \"I didn't actually see any of it,\" he mumbled. \"I was nauseated before the lights went down.\" \"Why didn't you say something?\" I scolded as we staggered toward the exit. \"I was hoping it would pass,\" he said. \"Just a sec,\" Jacob said as we reached the door. He walked quickly back to the concession stand. \"Could I have an empty popcorn bucket?\" he asked the salesgirl. She looked at Mike once, and then thrust a bucket at Jacob. \"Get him outside, please,\" she begged. She was obviously the one who would have to clean the floor. I towed Mike out into the cool, wet air. He inhaled deeply. Jacob was right behind us. He helped me get Mike into the back of the car, and handed him the bucket with a serious gaze. \"Please,\" was all Jacob said. We rolled down the windows, letting the icy night air blow through the car, hoping it would help Mike. I curled my arms around my legs to keep warm. \"Cold, again?\" Jacob asked, putting his arm around me before I could answer. \"You're not?\" He shook his head. \"You must have a fever or something,\" I grumbled. It was freezing. I touched my fingers to his forehead, and his head was hot. \"Whoa, Jake\u2014you're burning up! \" \"I feel fine.\" He shrugged. \"Fit as a fiddle.\" I frowned and touched his head again. His skin blazed under my fingers. \"Your hands are like ice,\" he complained. \"Maybe it's me,\" I allowed. Mike groaned in the backseat, and threw up in the bucket. I grimaced, hoping my own stomach could stand the sound and smell. Jacob checked anxiously over his shoulder to make sure his car wasn't defiled. The road felt longer on the way back. Jacob was quiet, thoughtful. He left his arm around me, and it was so warm that the cold wind felt good. I stared out the windshield, consumed with guilt. It was so wrong to encourage Jacob. Pure selfishness. It didn't matter that I'd tried to make my position clear. If he felt any hope at all that this could turn into something other than friendship, then I hadn't been clear enough. How could I explain so that he would understand? I was an empty shell. Like a vacant house\u2014condemned\u2014for months I'd been utterly uninhabitable. Now I was a little improved. The front room was in better repair. But that was all\u2014just the one small piece. He deserved better than that\u2014better than a one-room, falling-down fixer-upper. No amount of investment on his part could put me back in working order. Yet I knew that I wouldn't send him away, regardless. I needed him too much, and I was selfish. Maybe I could make my side more clear, so that he would know to leave me. The thought made me shudder, and Jacob tightened his arm around me. I drove Mike home in his Suburban, while Jacob followed behind us to take me home. Jacob was quiet all the way back to my house, and I wondered if he were thinking the same things that I was. Maybe he was changing his mind. \"I would invite myself in, since we're early,\" he said as we pulled up next to my truck. \"But I think you might be right about the fever. I'm starting to feel a little\u2026 strange.\" \"Oh no, not you, too! \u00a0Do you want me to drive you home?\" \"No.\" He shook his head, his eyebrows pulling together. \"I don't feel sick yet. Just\u2026 wrong. If I have to, I'll pull over.\" \"Will you call me as soon as you get in?\" I asked anxiously. \"Sure, sure.\" He frowned, staring ahead into the darkness and biting his lip. I opened my door to get out, but he grabbed my wrist lightly and held me there. I noticed again how hot his skin felt on mine. \"What is it, Jake?\" I asked. \"There's something I want to tell you, Bella\u2026 but I think it's going to sound kind of corny.\" I sighed. This would be more of the same from the theater. \"Go ahead.\" \"It's just that, I know how you're unhappy a lot. And, maybe it doesn't help anything, but I wanted you to know that I'm always here. I won't ever let you down\u2014I promise that you can always count on me.\u00a0 Wow, that does sound corny. But you know that, right? That I would never, ever hurt you?\" \"Yeah, Jake. I know that. And I already do count on you, probably more than you know.\" The smile broke across his face the way the sunrise set the clouds on fire, and I wanted to cut my tongue out. I hadn't said one word that was a lie, but I should have lied. The truth was wrong, it would hurt him. I would let him down. A strange look crossed his face. \"I really think I'd better go home now,\" he said. I got out quickly. \"Call me! \" I yelled as he pulled away. I watched him go, and he seemed to be in control of the car, at least. I stared at the empty street when he was gone, feeling a little sick myself, but not for any physical reason. How much I wished that Jacob Black had been born my brother, my flesh-and -blood brother, so that I would have some legitimate claim on him that still left me free of any blame now. Heaven knows I had never wanted to use Jacob, but I couldn't help but interpret the guilt I felt now to mean that I had. Even more, I had never meant to love him. One thing I truly knew\u2014knew it in the pit of my stomach, in the center of my bones, knew it from the crown of my head to the soles of my feet, knew it deep in my empty chest\u2014was how love gave someone the power to break you. I'd been broken beyond repair. But I needed Jacob now, needed him like a drug. I'd used him as a crutch for too long, and I was in deeper than I'd planned to go with anyone again. Now I couldn't bear for him to be hurt, and I couldn't keep from hurting him, either. He thought time and patience would change me, and, though I knew he was dead wrong, I also knew that I would let him try. He was my best friend. I would always love him, and it would never, ever be enough. I went inside to sit by the phone and bite my nails. \"Movie over already?\" Charlie asked in surprise when I came in. He was on the floor, just a foot from the TV. Must be an exciting game. \"Mike got sick,\" I explained. \"Some kind of stomach flu.\" \"You okay?\" \"I feel fine now,\" I said doubtfully. Clearly, I'd been exposed. I leaned against the kitchen counter, my hand inches from the phone, and tried to wait patiently. I thought of the strange look on Jacob's face before he drove away, and my fingers started drumming against the counter. I should have insisted on driving him home. I watched the clock as the minutes ticked by Ten. Fifteen. Even when I was driving, it took only fifteen minutes, and Jacob drove faster than I did. Eighteen minutes. I picked up the phone and dialed. It rang and rang. Maybe Billy was asleep. Maybe I'd dialed wrong. I tried again. On the eighth ring, just as I was about to hang up, Billy answered. \"Hello?\" he asked. His voice was wary, like he was expecting bad news. \"Billy, it's me, Bella\u2014did Jake make it home yet? He left here about twenty minutes ago.\" \"He's here,\" Billy said tonelessly. \"He was supposed to call me.\" I was a little irritated. \"He was getting sick when he left, and I was worried.\" \"He was\u2026 too sick to call. He's not feeling well right now.\" Billy sounded distant. I realized he must want to be with Jacob. \"Let me know if you need any help,\" I offered. \"I could come down.\" I thought of Billy, stuck in his chair, and Jake fending for himself\u2026 \"No, no,\" Billy said quickly. \"We're fine. Stay at your place.\" The way he said it was almost rude. \"Okay,\" I agreed. \"Bye, Bella.\" The line disconnected. \"Bye,\" I muttered. Well, at least he'd made it home. Oddly, I didn't feel less worried. I trudged up the stairs, fretting. Maybe I would go down before work tomorrow to check on him. I could take soup\u2014we had to have a can of Campbell's around here somewhere. I realized all such plans were canceled when I woke up early\u2014my clock said four thirty\u2014and sprinted to the bathroom. Charlie found me there a half hour later, lying on the floor, my cheek pressed against the cold edge of the bathtub. He looked at me for a long moment. \"Stomach flu,\" he finally said. \"Yes,\" I moaned. \"You need something?\" he asked. \"Call the Newtons for me, please,\" I instructed hoarsely. \"Tell them I have what Mike has, and that I can't make it in today. Tell them I'm sorry.\" \"Sure, no problem,\" Charlie assured me. I spent the rest of the day on the bathroom floor, sleeping for a few hours with my head on a crumpled up towel. Charlie claimed that he had to work, but I suspected that he just wanted access to a bathroom. He left a glass of water on the floor beside me to keep me hydrated. It woke me up when he came back home. I could see that it was dark in my room\u2014after nightfall. He clumped up the stairs to check on me. \"Still alive?\" \"Sort of,\" I said. \"Do you want anything?\" \"No, thanks.\" He hesitated, clearly out of his element. \"Okay, then,\" he said, and then he went back down to the kitchen. I heard the phone ring a few minutes later. Charlie spoke to someone in a low voice for a moment, and then hung up. \"Mike feels better,\" he called up to me. Well, that was encouraging. He'd only gotten sick eight hours or so before me. Eight more hours. The thought made my stomach turn, and I pulled myself up to lean over the toilet. I fell asleep on the towel again, but when I woke up I was in my bed and it was light outside my window. I didn't remember moving; Charlie must have carried me to my room\u2014he'd also put the glass of water on my bedside table. I felt parched. I chugged it down, though it tasted funny from sitting stagnant all night. I got up slowly, trying not to trigger the nausea again. I was weak, and my mouth tasted horrible, but my stomach felt fine. I looked at my clock. My twenty-four hours were up. I didn't push it, eating nothing but saltine crackers for breakfast. Charlie looked relieved to see me recovered. As soon as I was sure that I wasn't going to have to spend the day on the bathroom floor again, I called Jacob. Jacob was the one who answered, but when I heard his greeting I knew he wasn't over it. \"Hello?\" His voice was broken, cracking. \"Oh, Jake,\" I groaned sympathetically. \"You sound horrible.\" \"I feel horrible,\" he whispered. \"I'm so sorry I made you go out with me. This sucks.\" \"I'm glad I went.\" His voice was still a whisper. \"Don't blame yourself. This isn't your fault.\" \"You'll get better soon,\" I promised. \"I woke up this morning, and I was fine.\" \"You were sick?\" he asked <em>dully</em>. \"Yes, I got it, too. But I'm fine now.\" \"That's good.\" His voice was dead. \"So you'll probably be better in a few hours,\" I encouraged. I could barely hear his answer. \"I don't think I have the same thing you did.\" \"Don't you have the stomach flu?\" I asked, confused. \"No. This is something else.\" \"What's wrong with you?\" \"Everything,\" he whispered. \"Every part of me hurts.\" The pain in his voice was nearly tangible. \"What can I do, Jake? What can I bring you?\" \"Nothing. You can't come here.\" He was abrupt. It reminded me of Billy the other night. \"I've already been exposed to whatever you have,\" I pointed out. He ignored me. \"I'll call you when I can. I'll let you know when you can come down again.\" \"Jacob\u2014\" \"I've got to go,\" he said with sudden urgency. \"Call me when you feel better.\" \"Right,\" he agreed, and his voice had a strange, bitter edge. He was silent for a moment. I was waiting for him to say goodbye, but he waited too. \"I'll see you soon,\" I finally said.  \"Wait for me to call,\" he said again.  \"Okay\u2026 Bye, Jacob.\" \"Bella,\" he whispered my name, and then hung up the phone.",

            "en": "12        12. BALANCING \"Billy!\" Charlie called as soon as he got out of the car. I turned toward the house, beckoning to Jacob as I ducked under the porch. I heard Charlie greeting them loudly behind me. \"I'm going to pretend I didn't see you behind the wheel, Jake,\" he said disapprovingly. \"We get permits early on the rez,\" Jacob said while I unlocked the door and flicked on the porch light. \"Sure you do,\" Charlie laughed. \"I have to get around somehow.\" I recognized Billy's resonant voice easily, despite the years. The sound of it made me feel suddenly younger, a child. I went inside, leaving the door open behind me and turning on lights before I hung up my jacket. Then I stood in the door, watching anxiously as Charlie and Jacob helped Billy out of the car and into his wheelchair. I backed out of the way as the three of them hurried in, shaking off the rain. \"This is a surprise,\" Charlie was saying. \"It's been too long,\" Billy answered. \"I hope it's not a bad time.\" His dark eyes flashed up to me again, their expression unreadable. \"No, it's great. I hope you can stay for the game.\" Jacob grinned. \"I think that's the plan \u2014 our TV broke last week.\" Billy made a face at his son. \"And, of course, Jacob was anxious to see Bella again,\" he added. Jacob scowled and ducked his head while I fought back a surge of remorse. Maybe I'd been too convincing on the beach. \"Are you hungry?\" I asked, turning toward the kitchen. I was eager to escape Billy's searching gaze. \"Naw, we ate just before we came,\" Jacob answered. \"How about you, Charlie?\" I called over my shoulder as I fled around the corner. \"Sure,\" he replied, his voice moving in the direction of the front room and the TV. I could hear Billy's chair follow. The grilled cheese sandwiches were in the frying pan and I was slicing up a tomato when I sensed someone behind me. \"So, how are things?\" Jacob asked. \"Pretty good.\" I smiled. His enthusiasm was hard to resist. \"How about you? Did you finish your car?\" \"No.\" He frowned. \"I still need parts. We borrowed that one.\" He pointed with his thumb in the direction of the front yard. \"Sorry. I haven't seen any\u2026 what was it you were looking for?\" \"Master cylinder.\" He grinned. \"Is something wrong with the truck?\" he added suddenly. \"No.\" \"Oh. I just wondered because you weren't driving it.\" I stared down at the pan, pulling up the edge of a sandwich to check the bottom side. \"I got a ride with a friend.\" \"Nice ride.\" Jacob's voice was admiring. \"I didn't recognize the driver, though. I thought I knew most of the kids around here.\" I nodded noncommittally, keeping my eyes down as I flipped sandwiches. \"My dad seemed to know him from somewhere.\" \"Jacob, could you hand me some plates? They're in the cupboard over the sink.\" \"Sure.\" He got the plates in silence. I hoped he would let it drop now. \"So who was it?\" he asked, setting two plates on the counter next to me. I sighed in defeat. \"Edward Cullen.\" To my surprise, he laughed. I glanced up at him. He looked a little embarrassed. \"Guess that explains it, then,\" he said. \"I wondered why my dad was acting so strange.\" \"That's right.\" I faked an innocent expression. \"He doesn't like the Cullens.\" \"Superstitious old man,\" Jacob muttered under his breath. \"You don't think he'd say anything to Charlie?\" I couldn't help asking, the words coming out in a low rush.  Jacob stared at me for a moment, and I couldn't read the expression in his dark eyes. \"I doubt it,\" he finally answered. \"I think Charlie chewed him out pretty good last time. They haven't spoken much since \u2014 tonight is sort of a reunion, I think. I don't think he'd bring it up again.\" \"Oh,\" I said, trying to sound indifferent. I stayed in the front room after I carried the food out to Charlie, pretending to watch the game while Jacob chattered at me. I was really listening to the men's conversation, watching for any sign that Billy was about to rat me out, trying to think of ways to stop him if he began. It was a long night. I had a lot of homework that was going undone, but I was afraid to leave Billy alone with Charlie. Finally, the game ended. \"Are you and your friends coming back to the beach soon?\" Jacob asked as he pushed his father over the lip of the threshold. \"I'm not sure,\" I hedged. \"That was fun, Charlie,\" Billy said. \"Come up for the next game,\" Charlie encouraged. \"Sure, sure,\" Billy said. \"We'll be here. Have a good night.\" His eyes shifted to mine, and his smile disappeared. \"You take care, Bella,\" he added seriously. \"Thanks,\" I muttered, looking away. I headed for the stairs while Charlie waved from the doorway. \"Wait, Bella,\" he said. I cringed. Had Billy gotten something in before I'd joined them in the living room? But Charlie was relaxed, still grinning from the unexpected visit. \"I didn't get a chance to talk to you tonight. How was your day?\" \"Good.\" I hesitated with one foot on the first stair, searching for details I could safely share. \"My badminton team won all four games.\" \"Wow, I didn't know you could play badminton.\" \"Well, actually I can't, but my partner is really good,\" I admitted . \"Who is it?\" he asked with token interest. \"Um\u2026 Mike Newton,\" I told him reluctantly. \"Oh yeah \u2014 you said you were friends with the Newton kid.\" He perked up. \"Nice family.\" He mused for a minute. \"Why didn't you ask him to the dance this weekend?\" \"Dad!\" I groaned. \"He's kind of dating my friend Jessica. Besides, you know I can't dance.\" \"Oh yeah,\" he muttered. Then he smiled at me apologetically. \"So I guess it's good you'll be gone Saturday\u2026 I've made plans to go fishing with the guys from the station. The weather's supposed to be real warm. But if you wanted to put your trip off till someone could go with you, I'd stay home. I know I leave you here alone too much.\" \"Dad, you're doing a great job.\" I smiled, hoping my relief didn't show. \"I've never minded being alone \u2014 I'm too much like you.\" I winked at him, and he smiled his crinkly-eyed smile. I slept better that night, too tired to dream again. When I woke to the pearl gray morning, my mood was blissful. The tense evening with Billy and Jacob seemed harmless enough now; I decided to forget it completely.  I caught myself whistling while I was pulling the front part of my hair back into a barrette, and later again as I skipped down the stairs. Charlie noticed. \"You're cheerful this morning,\" he commented over breakfast. I shrugged. \"It's Friday.\" I hurried so I would be ready to go the second Charlie left. I had my bag ready, shoes on, teeth brushed, but even though I rushed to the door as soon as I was sure Charlie would be out of sight, Edward was faster. He was waiting in his shiny car, windows down, engine off. I didn't hesitate this time, climbing in the passenger side quickly, the sooner to see his face. He grinned his crooked smile at me, stopping my breath and my heart. I couldn't imagine how an angel could be any more glorious. There was nothing about him that could be improved upon. \"How did you sleep?\" he asked. I wondered if he had any idea how appealing his voice was. \"Fine. How was your night?\" \"Pleasant.\" His smile was amused; I felt like I was missing an inside joke. \"Can I ask what you did?\" I asked. \"No.\" He grinned. \"Today is still mine.\" He wanted to know about people today: more about Ren\u00e9e, her hobbies, what we'd done in our free time together. And then the one grandmother I'd known, my few school friends \u2014 embarrassing me when he asked about boys I'd dated. I was relieved that I'd never really dated anyone, so that particular conversation couldn't last long. He seemed as surprised as Jessica and Angela by my lack of romantic history. \"So you never met anyone you wanted?\" he asked in a serious tone that made me wonder what he was thinking about. I was grudgingly honest. \"Not in Phoenix.\" His lips pressed together into a hard line. We were in the cafeteria at this point. The day had sped by in the blur that was rapidly becoming routine. I took advantage of his brief pause to take a bite of my bagel. \"I should have let you drive yourself today,\" he announced, apropos of nothing, while I chewed. \"Why?\" I demanded. \"I'm leaving with Alice after lunch.\" \"Oh.\" I blinked, bewildered and disappointed. \"That's okay, it's not that far of a walk.\" He frowned at me impatiently. \"I'm not going to make you walk home. We'll go get your truck and leave it here for you.\" \"I don't have my key with me,\" I sighed. \"I really don't mind walking.\" What I minded was losing my time with him. He shook his head. \"Your truck will be here, and the key will be in the ignition \u2014 unless you're afraid someone might steal it.\" He laughed at the thought. \"All right,\" I agreed, pursing my lips. I was pretty sure my key was in the pocket of a pair of jeans I wore Wednesday, under a pile of clothes in the laundry room. Even if he broke into my house, or whatever he was planning, he'd never find it. He seemed to feel the challenge in my consent. He smirked, overconfident. \"So where are you going?\" I asked as casually as I could manage. \"Hunting,\" he answered grimly. \"If I'm going to be alone with you tomorrow, I'm going to take whatever precautions I can.\" His face grew morose\u2026 and pleading. \"You can always cancel, you know.\" I looked down, afraid of the persuasive power of his eyes. I refused to be convinced to fear him, no matter how real the danger might be. It doesn't matter, I repeated in my head.  \"No,\" I whispered, glancing back at his face. \"I can't.\" \"Perhaps you're right,\" he murmured bleakly. His eyes seemed to darken in color as I watched. I changed the subject. \"What time will I see you tomorrow?\" I asked, already depressed by the thought of him leaving now. \"That depends\u2026 it's a Saturday, don't you want to sleep in?\" he offered. \"No,\" I answered too fast. He restrained a smile.  \"The same time as usual, then,\" he decided. \"Will Charlie be there?\" \"No, he's fishing tomorrow.\" I beamed at the memory of how conveniently things had worked out. His voice turned sharp. \"And if you don't come home, what will he think?\" \"I have no idea,\" I answered coolly. \"He knows I've been meaning to do the laundry. Maybe he'll think I fell in the washer.\" He scowled at me and I scowled back. His anger was much more impressive than mine. \"What are you hunting tonight?\" I asked when I was sure I had lost the glowering contest. \"Whatever we find in the park. We aren't going far.\" He seemed bemused by my casual reference to his secret realities. \"Why are you going with Alice?\" I wondered. \"Alice is the most\u2026 supportive.\" He frowned as he spoke. \"And the others?\" I asked timidly. \"What are they?\" His brow puckered for a brief moment. \"Incredulous, for the most part.\" I peeked quickly behind me at his family. They sat staring off in different directions, exactly the same as the first time I'd seen them. Only now they were four; their beautiful, bronze-haired brother sat across from me, his golden eyes troubled. \"They don't like me,\" I guessed. \"That's not it,\" he disagreed, but his eyes were too innocent. \"They don't understand why I can't leave you alone.\" I grimaced. \"Neither do I, for that matter.\" Edward shook his head slowly, rolling his eyes toward the ceiling before he met my gaze again. \"I told you \u2014 you don't see yourself clearly at all. You're not like anyone I've ever known. You fascinate me.\" I glared at him, sure he was teasing now. He smiled as he deciphered my expression. \"Having the advantages I do,\" he murmured, touching his forehead discreetly, \"I have a better than average grasp of human nature. People are predictable. But you\u2026 you never do what I expect. You always take me by surprise.\" I looked away, my eyes wandering back to his family, embarrassed and dissatisfied. His words made me feel like a science experiment. I wanted to laugh at myself for expecting anything else. \"That part is easy enough to explain,\" he continued. I felt his eyes on my face but I couldn't look at him yet, afraid he might read the chagrin in my eyes. \"But there's more\u2026 and it's not so easy to put into words \u2014\" I was still staring at the Cullens while he spoke. Suddenly Rosalie, his blond and breathtaking sister, turned to look at me. No, not to look \u2014 to glare, with dark, cold eyes. I wanted to look away, but her gaze held me until Edward broke off mid-sentence and made an angry noise under his breath. It was almost a hiss. Rosalie turned her head, and I was relieved to be free. I looked back at Edward \u2014 and I knew he could see the confusion and fear that widened my eyes. His face was tight as he explained. \"I'm sorry about that. She's just worried. You see\u2026 it's dangerous for more than just me if, after spending so much time with you so publicly\u2026\" He looked down. \"If?\" \"If this ends\u2026 badly.\" He dropped his head into his hands, as he had that night in Port Angeles. His anguish was plain; I yearned to comfort him, but I was at a loss to know how.  My hand reached toward him involuntarily; quickly, though, I dropped it to the table, fearing that my touch would only make things worse. I realized slowly that his words should frighten me. I waited for that fear to come, but all I could seem to feel was an ache for his pain. And frustration \u2014 frustration that Rosalie had interrupted whatever he was about to say. I didn't know how to bring it up again. He still had his head in his hands. I tried to speak in a normal voice. \"And you have to leave now?\" \"Yes.\" He raised his face; it was serious for a moment, and then his mood shifted and he smiled. \"It's probably for the best. We still have fifteen minutes of that wretched movie left to endure in Biology \u2014 I don't think I could take any more.\" I started. Alice \u2014 her short, inky hair in a halo of spiky disarray around her exquisite, elfin face \u2014 was suddenly standing behind his shoulder. Her slight frame was willowy, graceful even in absolute stillness. He greeted her without looking away from me. \"Alice.\" \"Edward,\" she answered, her high soprano voice almost as attractive as his. \"Alice, Bella \u2014 Bella, Alice,\" he introduced us, gesturing casually with his hand, a wry smile on his face. \"Hello, Bella.\" Her brilliant obsidian eyes were unreadable, but her smile was friendly. \"It's nice to finally meet you.\" Edward flashed a dark look at her. \"Hi, Alice,\" I murmured shyly. \"Are you ready?\" she asked him. His voice was aloof. \"Nearly. I'll meet you at the car.\" She left without another word; her walk was so fluid, so sinuous that I felt a sharp pang of jealousy. \"Should I say 'have fun,' or is that the wrong sentiment?\" I asked, turning back to him. \"No, 'have fun' works as well as anything.\" He grinned. \"Have fun, then.\" I worked to sound wholehearted. Of course I didn't fool him. \"I'll try.\" He still grinned. \"And you try to be safe, please.\" \"Safe in Forks \u2014 what a challenge.\" \"For you it is a challenge.\" His jaw hardened. \"Promise.\" \"I promise to try to be safe,\" I recited. \"I'll do the laundry tonight \u2014 that ought to be fraught with peril.\" \"Don't fall in,\" he mocked. \"I'll do my best.\" He stood then, and I rose, too. \"I'll see you tomorrow,\" I sighed. \"It seems like a long time to you, doesn't it?\" he mused. I nodded glumly.  \"I'll be there in the morning,\" he promised, smiling his crooked smile. He reached across the table to touch my face, lightly brushing along my cheekbone again. Then he turned and walked away. I stared after him until he was gone. I was sorely tempted to ditch the rest of the day, at the very least Gym, but a warning instinct stopped me. I knew that if I disappeared now, Mike and others would assume I was with Edward. And Edward was worried about the time we'd spent together publicly\u2026 if things went wrong. I refused to dwell on the last thought, concentrating instead on making things safer for him. I intuitively knew \u2014 and sensed he did, too \u2014 that tomorrow would be pivotal. Our relationship couldn't continue to balance, as it did, on the point of a knife. We would fall off one edge or the other, depending entirely upon his decision, or his instincts. My decision was made, made before I'd ever consciously chosen, and I was committed to seeing it through. Because there was nothing more terrifying to me, more excruciating, than the thought of turning away from him. It was an impossibility. I went to class, feeling dutiful. I couldn't honestly say what happened in Biology; my mind was too preoccupied with thoughts of tomorrow. In Gym, Mike was speaking to me again; he wished me a good time in Seattle. I carefully explained that I'd canceled my trip, worried about my truck.  \"Are you going to the dance with Cullen?\" he asked, suddenly sulky. \"No, I'm not going to the dance at all.\" \"What are you doing, then?\" he asked, too interested. My natural urge was to tell him to butt out. Instead, I lied brightly. \"Laundry, and then I have to study for the Trig test or I'm going to fail.\" \"Is Cullen helping you study?\" \"Edward,\" I emphasized, \"is not going to help me study. He's gone away somewhere for the weekend.\" The lies came more naturally than usual, I noted with surprise. \"Oh.\" He perked up. \"You know, you could come to the dance with our group anyway \u2014 that would be cool. We'd all dance with you,\" he promised. The mental image of Jessica's face made my tone sharper than necessary. \"I'm not going to the dance, Mike, okay?\" \"Fine.\" He sulked again. \"I was just offering.\" When the school day had finally ended, I walked to the parking lot without enthusiasm. I did not especially want to walk home, but I couldn't see how he would have retrieved my truck.  Then again, I was starting to believe that nothing was impossible for him. The latter instinct proved correct \u2014 my truck sat in the same space he'd parked his Volvo in this morning. I shook my head, incredulous, as I opened the unlocked door and saw the key in the ignition. There was a piece of white paper folded on my seat. I got in and closed the door before I unfolded it. Two words were written in his elegant script. Be safe. The sound of the truck roaring to life frightened me. I laughed at myself. When I got home, the handle of the door was locked, the dead bolt unlocked, just as I'd left it this morning. Inside, I went straight to the laundry room. It looked just the same as I'd left it, too. I dug for my jeans and, after finding them, checked the pockets. Empty. Maybe I'd hung my key up after all, I thought, shaking my head. Following the same instinct that had prompted me to lie to Mike, I called Jessica on the pretense of wishing her luck at the dance. When she offered the same wish for my day with Edward, I told her about the cancellation. She was more disappointed than really necessary for a third-party observer to be. I said goodbye quickly after that. Charlie was absentminded at dinner, worried over something at work, I guessed, or maybe a basketball game, or maybe he was just really enjoying the lasagna \u2014 it was hard to tell with Charlie. \"You know, Dad\u2026\" I began, breaking into his reverie. \"What's that, Bell?\" \"I think you're right about Seattle. I think I'll wait until Jessica or someone else can go with me.\" \"Oh,\" he said, surprised. \"Oh, okay. So, do you want me to stay home?\" \"No, Dad, don't change your plans. I've got a million things to do\u2026 homework, laundry\u2026 I need to go to the library and the grocery store. I'll be in and out all day\u2026 you go and have fun.\" \"Are you sure?\" \"Absolutely, Dad. Besides, the freezer is getting dangerously low on fish \u2014 we're down to a two, maybe three years' supply.\" \"You're sure easy to live with, Bella.\" He smiled. \"I could say the same thing about you,\" I said, laughing. The sound of my laughter was off, but he didn't seem to notice. I felt so guilty for deceiving him that I almost took Edward's advice and told him where I would be. Almost. After dinner, I folded clothes and moved another load through the dryer. Unfortunately it was the kind of job that only keeps hands busy. My mind definitely had too much free time, and it was getting out of control. I fluctuated between anticipation so intense that it was very nearly pain, and an insidious fear that picked at my resolve. I had to keep reminding myself that I'd made my choice, and I wasn't going back on it. I pulled his note out of my pocket much more often than necessary to absorb the two small words he'd written. He wants me to be safe, I told myself again and again. I would just hold on to the faith that, in the end, that desire would win out over the others. And what was my other choice \u2014 to cut him out of my life? Intolerable. Besides, since I'd come to Forks, it really seemed like my life was about him. But a tiny voice in the back of my mind worried, wondering if it would hurt very much\u2026 if it ended badly. I was relieved when it was late enough to be acceptable for bedtime. I knew I was far too stressed to sleep, so I did something I'd never done before. I deliberately took unnecessary cold medicine \u2014 the kind that knocked me out for a good eight hours. I normally wouldn't condone that type of behavior in myself, but tomorrow would be complicated enough without me being loopy from sleep deprivation on top of everything else. While I waited for the drugs to kick in, I dried my clean hair till it was impeccably straight, and fussed over what I would wear tomorrow. With everything ready for the morning, I finally lay in my bed. I felt hyper; I couldn't stop twitching. I got up and rifled through my shoebox of CDs until I found a collection of Chopin's nocturnes. I put that on very quietly and then lay down again, concentrating on relaxing individual parts of my body. Somewhere in the middle of that exercise, the cold pills took effect, and I gladly sank into unconsciousness.  I woke early, having slept soundly and dreamlessly thanks to my gratuitous drug use. Though I was well rested, I slipped right back into the same hectic frenzy from the night before. I dressed in a rush, smoothing my collar against my neck, fidgeting with the tan sweater till it hung right over my jeans. I sneaked a swift look out the window to see that Charlie was already gone. A thin, cottony layer of clouds veiled the sky. They didn't look very lasting. I ate breakfast without tasting the food, hurrying to clean up when I was done. I peeked out the window again, but nothing had changed. I had just finished brushing my teeth and was heading back downstairs when a quiet knock sent my heart thudding against my rib cage. I flew to the door; I had a little trouble with the simple dead bolt, but I yanked the door open at last, and there he was. All the agitation dissolved as soon as I looked at his face, calm taking its place. I breathed a sigh of relief \u2014 yesterday's fears seemed very foolish with him here. He wasn't smiling at first \u2014 his face was somber. But then his expression lightened as he looked me over, and he laughed.  \"Good morning,\" he chuckled. \"What's wrong?\" I glanced down to make sure I hadn't forgotten anything important, like shoes, or pants. \"We match.\" He laughed again. I realized he had a long, light tan sweater on, with a white collar showing underneath, and blue jeans. I laughed with him, hiding a secret twinge of regret \u2014 why did he have to look like a runway model when I couldn't? I locked the door behind me while he walked to the truck. He waited by the passenger door with a martyred expression that was easy to understand. \"We made a deal,\" I reminded him smugly, climbing into the driver's seat, and reaching over to unlock his door. \"Where to?\" I asked. \"Put your seat belt on \u2014 I'm nervous already.\" I gave him a dirty look as I complied. \"Where to?\" I repeated with a sigh. \"Take the one-on-one north,\" he ordered. It was surprisingly difficult to concentrate on the road while feeling his gaze on my face. I compensated by driving more carefully than usual through the still-sleeping town. \"Were you planning to make it out of Forks before nightfall?\" \"This truck is old enough to be your car's grandfather \u2014 have some respect,\" I retorted. We were soon out of the town limits, despite his negativity. Thick underbrush and green-swathed trunks replaced the lawns and houses. \"Turn right on the one-ten,\" he instructed just as I was about to ask. I obeyed silently. \"Now we drive until the pavement ends.\" I could hear a smile in his voice, but I was too afraid of driving off the road and proving him right to look over and be sure. \"And what's there, at the pavement's end?\" I wondered. \"A trail.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \"We're hiking?\" Thank goodness I'd worn tennis shoes. \"Is that a problem?\" He sounded as if he'd expected as much. \"No.\" I tried to make the lie sound confident. But if he thought my truck was slow\u2026 \"Don't worry, it's only five miles or so, and we're in no hurry.\" Five miles. I didn't answer, so that he wouldn't hear my voice crack in panic. Five miles of treacherous roots and loose stones, trying to twist my ankles or otherwise incapacitate me. This was going to be humiliating. We drove in silence for a while as I contemplated the coming horror. \"What are you thinking?\" he asked impatiently after a few moments. I lied again. \"Just wondering where we're going.\" \"It's a place I like to go when the weather is nice.\" We both glanced out the windows at the thinning clouds after he spoke. \"Charlie said it would be warm today.\" \"And did you tell Charlie what you were up to?\" he asked. \"Nope.\" \"But Jessica thinks we're going to Seattle together?\" He seemed cheered by the idea. \"No, I told her you canceled on me \u2014 which is true.\" \"No one knows you're with me?\" Angrily, now. \"That depends\u2026 I assume you told Alice?\" \"That's very helpful, Bella,\" he snapped. I pretended I didn't hear that. \"Are you so depressed by Forks that it's made you suicidal?\" he demanded when I ignored him. \"You said it might cause trouble for you\u2026 us being together publicly,\" I reminded him. \"So you're worried about the trouble it might cause me\u2014 if you don't come home?\" His voice was still angry, and bitingly sarcastic. I nodded, keeping my eyes on the road. He muttered something under his breath, speaking so quickly that I couldn't understand. We were silent for the rest of the drive. I could feel the waves of infuriated disapproval rolling off of him, and I could think of nothing to say. And then the road ended, constricting to a thin foot trail with a small wooden marker. I parked on the narrow shoulder and stepped out, afraid because he was angry with me and I didn't have driving as an excuse not to look at him. It was warm now, warmer than it had been in Forks since the day I'd arrived, almost muggy under the clouds. I pulled off my sweater and knotted it around my waist, glad that I'd worn the light, sleeveless shirt \u2014 especially if I had five miles of hiking ahead of me. I heard his door slam, and looked over to see that he'd removed his sweater, too. He was facing away from me, into the unbroken forest beside my truck. \"This way,\" he said, glancing over his shoulder at me, eyes still annoyed. He started into the dark forest. \"The trail?\" Panic was clear in my voice as I hurried around the truck to catch up to him. \"I said there was a trail at the end of the road, not that we were taking it.\" \"No trail?\" I asked desperately. \"I won't let you get lost.\" He turned then, with a mocking smile, and I stifled a gasp. His white shirt was sleeveless, and he wore it unbuttoned, so that the smooth white skin of his throat flowed uninterrupted over the marble contours of his chest, his perfect musculature no longer merely hinted at behind concealing clothes. He was too perfect, I realized with a piercing stab of despair. There was no way this godlike creature could be meant for me. He stared at me, bewildered by my tortured expression. \"Do you want to go home?\" he said quietly, a different pain than mine saturating his voice. \"No.\" I walked forward till I was close beside him, anxious not to waste one second of whatever time I might have with him. \"What's wrong?\" he asked, his voice gentle. \"I'm not a good hiker,\" I answered <em>dully</em>. \"You'll have to be very patient.\" \"I can be patient \u2014 if I make a great effort.\" He smiled, holding my glance, trying to lift me out of my sudden, unexplained dejection. I tried to smile back, but the smile was unconvincing. He scrutinized my face. \"I'll take you home,\" he promised. I couldn't tell if the promise was unconditional, or restricted to an immediate departure. I knew he thought it was fear that upset me, and I was grateful again that I was the one person whose mind he couldn't hear. \"If you want me to hack five miles through the jungle before sundown, you'd better start leading the way,\" I said acidly. He frowned at me, struggling to understand my tone and expression. He gave up after a moment and led the way into the forest. It wasn't as hard as I had feared. The way was mostly flat, and he held the damp ferns and webs of moss aside for me. When his straight path took us over fallen trees or boulders, he would help me, lifting me by the elbow, and then releasing me instantly when I was clear. His cold touch on my skin never failed to make my heart thud erratically. Twice, when that happened, I caught a look on his face that made me sure he could somehow hear it. I tried to keep my eyes away from his perfection as much as possible, but I slipped often. Each time, his beauty pierced me through with sadness. For the most part, we walked in silence. Occasionally he would ask a random question that he hadn't gotten to in the past two days of interrogation. He asked about my birthdays, my grade school teachers, my childhood pets \u2014 and I had to admit that after killing three fish in a row, I'd given up on the whole institution. He laughed at that, louder than I was used to \u2014 bell-like echoes bouncing back to us from the empty woods. The hike took me most of the morning, but he never showed any sign of impatience. The forest spread out around us in a boundless labyrinth of ancient trees, and I began to be nervous that we would never find our way out again. He was perfectly at ease, comfortable in the green maze, never seeming to feel any doubt about our direction. After several hours, the light that filtered through the canopy transformed, the murky olive tone shifting to a brighter jade. The day had turned sunny, just as he'd foretold. For the first time since we'd entered the woods, I felt a thrill of excitement \u2014 which quickly turned to impatience. \"Are we there yet?\" I teased, pretending to scowl. \"Nearly.\" He smiled at the change in my mood. \"Do you see the brightness ahead?\" I peered into the thick forest. \"Um, should I?\" He smirked. \"Maybe it's a bit soon for your eyes.\" \"Time to visit the optometrist,\" I muttered. His smirk grew more pronounced. But then, after another hundred yards, I could definitely see a lightening in the trees ahead, a glow that was yellow instead of green. I picked up the pace, my eagerness growing with every step. He let me lead now, following noiselessly. I reached the edge of the pool of light and stepped through the last fringe of ferns into the loveliest place I had ever seen. The meadow was small, perfectly round, and filled with wildflowers \u2014 violet, yellow, and soft white. Somewhere nearby, I could hear the bubbling music of a stream. The sun was directly overhead, filling the circle with a haze of buttery sunshine. I walked slowly, awestruck, through the soft grass, swaying flowers, and warm, gilded air. I halfway turned, wanting to share this with him, but he wasn't behind me where I thought he'd be. I spun around, searching for him with sudden alarm. Finally I spotted him, still under the dense shade of the canopy at the edge of the hollow, watching me with cautious eyes. Only then did I remember what the beauty of the meadow had driven from my mind \u2014 the enigma of Edward and the sun, which he'd promised to illustrate for me today. I took a step back toward him, my eyes alight with curiosity. His eyes were wary, reluctant. I smiled encouragingly and beckoned to him with my hand, taking another step back to him. He held up a hand in warning, and I hesitated, rocking back onto my heels. Edward seemed to take a deep breath, and then he stepped out into the bright glow of the midday sun.",

            "en": "3          3. THE END I FELT ABSOLUTELY HIDEOUS IN THE MORNING. I HADN'T slept well; my arm burned and my head ached. It didn't help my outlook that Edward's face was smooth and remote as he kissed my forehead quickly and ducked out my window. I was afraid of the time I'd spent unconscious, afraid that he might have been thinking about right and wrong again while he watched me sleep. The anxiety seemed to ratchet up the intensity of the pounding in my head. Edward was waiting for me at school, as usual, but his face was still wrong. There was something buried in his eyes that I couldn't be sure of\u2014and it scared me. I didn't want to bring up last night, but I wasn't sure if avoiding the subject would be worse. He opened my door for me. \"How do you feel?\u00a0 \" \"Perfect,\" I lied, cringing as the sound of the slamming door echoed in my head. We walked in silence, he shortening his stride to match mine. There were so many questions I wanted to ask, but most of those questions would have to wait, because they were for Alice: How was Jasper this morning?\u00a0 \u00a0What had they said when I was gone?\u00a0 \u00a0What had Rosalie said?\u00a0 \u00a0And most importantly, what could she see happening now in her strange, imperfect visions of the future?\u00a0 \u00a0Could she guess what Edward was thinking, why he was so gloomy?\u00a0 \u00a0Was there a foundation for the tenuous, instinctive fears that I couldn't seem to shake?\u00a0  The morning passed slowly. I was impatient to see Alice, though I wouldn't be able to really talk to her with Edward there. Edward remained aloof. Occasionally he would ask about my arm, and I would lie. Alice usually beat us to lunch; she didn't have to keep pace with a sloth like me. But she wasn't at the table, waiting with a tray of food she wouldn't eat. Edward didn't say anything about her absence. I wondered to myself if her class was running late\u2014until I saw Conner and Ben, who were in her fourth hour French class. \"Where's Alice?\u00a0 \" I asked Edward anxiously. He looked at the granola bar he was slowly pulverizing between his fingertips while he answered. \"She's with Jasper.\" \"Is he okay?\u00a0 \" \"He's gone away for a while.\" \"What?\u00a0 \u00a0Where?\u00a0 \" Edward shrugged. \"Nowhere in particular.\" \"And Alice, too,\" I said with quiet desperation. Of course, if Jasper needed her, she would go.  \"Yes. She'll be gone for a while. She was trying to convince him to go to Denali.\" Denali was where the one other band of unique vampires\u2014good ones like the Cullens\u2014lived. Tanya and her family. I'd heard of them now and again. Edward had run to them last winter when my arrival had made Forks difficult for him. Laurent, the most civilized member of James's little coven, had gone there rather than siding with James against the Cullens. It made sense for Alice to encourage Jasper to go there. I swallowed, trying to dislodge the sudden lump in my throat. The guilt made my head bow and my shoulders slump. I'd run them out of their home, just like Rosalie and Emmett. I was a plague. \"Is your arm bothering you?\u00a0 \" he asked solicitously. \"Who cares about my stupid arm?\u00a0 \" I muttered in disgust. He didn't answer, and I put my head down on the table. By the end of the day, the silence was becoming ridiculous. I didn't want to be the one to break it, but apparently that was my only choice if I ever wanted him to talk to me again. \"You'll come over later tonight?\u00a0 \" I asked as he walked me\u2014silently\u2014to my truck. He always came over. \"Later?\u00a0 \" It pleased me that he seemed surprised. \"I have to work. I had to trade with Mrs. Newton to get yesterday off.\" \"Oh,\" he murmured. \"So you'll come over when I'm home, though, right?\u00a0 \" I hated that I felt suddenly unsure about this. \"If you want me to.\" \"I always want you,\" I reminded him, with perhaps a little more intensity than the conversation required. I expected he would laugh, or smile, or react somehow to my words. \"All right, then,\" he said indifferently. He kissed my forehead again before he shut the door on me. Then he turned his back and loped gracefully toward his car. I was able to drive out of the parking lot before the panic really hit, but I was hyperventilating by the time I got to Newton's. He just needed time, I told myself. He would get over this. Maybe he was sad because his family was disappearing. But Alice and Jasper would come back soon, and Rosalie and Emmett, too. If it would help, I would stay away from the big white house on the river\u2014I'd never set foot there again. That didn't matter. I'd still see Alice at school. She would have to come back for school, right?\u00a0 \u00a0And she was at my place all the time anyway. She wouldn't want to hurt Charlie's feelings by staying away. No doubt I would also run into Carlisle with regularity\u2014in the emergency room. After all, what had happened last night was nothing. Nothing had happened. So I fell down\u2014that was the story of my life. Compared to last spring, it seemed especially unimportant. James had left me broken and nearly dead from loss of blood\u2014and yet Edward had handled the interminable weeks in the hospital much better than this. Was it because, this time, it wasn't an enemy he'd had to protect me from?\u00a0  Because it was his brother?\u00a0  Maybe it would be better if he took me away, rather than his family being scattered. I grew slightly less depressed as I considered all the uninterrupted alone time. If he could just last through the school year, Charlie wouldn't be able to object. We could go away to college, or pretend that's what we were doing, like Rosalie and Emmett this year. Surely Edward could wait a year. What was a year to an immortal?\u00a0 \u00a0It didn't even seem like that much to me. I was able to talk myself into enough composure to handle getting out of the truck and walking to the store. Mike Newton had beaten me here today, and he smiled and waved when I came in. I grabbed my vest, nodding vaguely in his direction. I was still imagining pleasant scenarios that consisted of me running away with Edward to various exotic locales. Mike interrupted my fantasy. \"How was your birthday?\u00a0 \" \"Ugh,\" I mumbled. \"I'm glad it's over.\" Mike looked at me from the corners of his eyes like I was crazy. Work dragged. I wanted to see Edward again, praying that he would be past the worst of this, whatever it was exactly, by the time I saw him again. It's nothing, I told myself over and over again. Everything will go back to normal. The relief I felt when I turned onto my street and saw Edward's silver car parked in front of my house was an overwhelming, heady thing. And it bothered me deeply that it should be that way. I hurried through the front door, calling out before I was completely inside. \"Dad?\u00a0 \u00a0Edward?\u00a0 \" As I spoke, I could hear the distinctive theme music from ESPN's Sports Center coming from the living room. \"In here,\" Charlie called. I hung my raincoat on its peg and hurried around the corner. Edward was in the armchair, my father on the sofa. Both had their eyes trained on the TV. The focus was normal for my father. Not so much for Edward. \"Hi,\" I said weakly. \"Hey, Bella,\" my father answered, eyes never moving. \"We just had cold pizza. I think it's still on the table.\" \"Okay.\" I waited in the doorway. Finally, Edward looked over at me with a polite smile. \"I'll be right behind you,\" he promised. His eyes strayed back to the TV. I stared for another minute, shocked. Neither one seemed to notice. I could feel something, panic maybe, building up in my chest. I escaped to the kitchen. The pizza held no interest for me. I sat in my chair, pulled my knees up, and wrapped my arms around them. Something was very wrong, maybe more wrong than I'd realized. The sounds of male bonding and banter continued from the TV set. I tried to get control of myself, to reason with myself. What's the worst that can happen?\u00a0 \u00a0I flinched. That was definitely the wrong question to ask. I was having a hard time breathing right. Okay, I thought again, what's the worst I can live through?\u00a0 \u00a0I didn't like that question so much, either. But I thought through the possibilities I'd considered today. Staying away from Edward's family. Of course, he wouldn't expect Alice to be part of that. But if Jasper was off limits, that would lessen the time I could have with her. I nodded to myself\u2014I could live with that. Or going away. Maybe he wouldn't want to wait till the end of the school year, maybe it would have to be now. In front of me, on the table, my presents from Charlie and Renee were where I had left them, the camera I hadn't had the chance to use at the Cullens' sitting beside the album. I touched the pretty cover of the scrapbook my mother had given me, and sighed, thinking of Renee. Somehow, living without her for as long as I had did not make the idea of a more permanent separation easier. And Charlie would be left all alone here, abandoned. They would both be so hurt\u2026 But we'd come back, right?\u00a0 \u00a0We'd visit, of course, wouldn't we?\u00a0  I couldn't be certain about the answer to that. I leaned my cheek against my knee, staring at the physical tokens of my parents' love. I'd known this path I'd chosen was going to be hard. And, after all, I was thinking about the worst-case scenario\u2014the very worst I could live through. I touched the scrapbook again, flipping the front cover over. Little metal corners were already in place to hold the first picture. It wasn't a half-bad idea, to make some record of my life here. I felt a strange urge to get started. Maybe I didn't have that long left in Forks. I toyed with the wrist strap on the camera, wondering about the first picture on the roll. Could it possibly turn out anything close to the original?\u00a0 \u00a0I doubted it. But he didn't seem worried that it would be blank. I chuckled to myself, thinking of his carefree laughter last night. The chuckle died away. So much had changed, and so abruptly. It made me feel a little bit dizzy, like I was standing on an edge, a precipice somewhere much too high. I didn't want to think about that anymore. I grabbed the camera and headed up the stairs. My room hadn't really changed all that much in the seventeen years since my mother had been here. The walls were still light blue, the same yellowed lace curtains hung in front of the window. There was a bed, rather than a crib, but she would recognize the quilt draped untidily over the top\u2014it had been a gift from Gran. Regardless, I snapped a picture of my room. There wasn't much else I could do tonight\u2014it was too dark outside\u2014and the feeling was growing stronger, it was almost a\u00a0 compulsion now. I would record everything about Forks before I had to leave it. Change was coming. I could feel it. It wasn't a pleasant prospect, not when life was perfect the way it was. I took my time coming back down the stairs, camera in hand, trying to ignore the butterflies in my stomach as I thought of the strange distance I didn't want to see in Edward's eyes. He would get over this. Probably he was worried that I would be upset when he asked me to leave. I would let him work through it without meddling. And I would be prepared when he asked. I had the camera ready as I leaned around the corner, being sneaky. I was sure there was no chance that I had caught Edward by surprise, but he didn't look up. I felt a brief shiver as something icy twisted in my stomach; I ignored that and took the picture. They both looked at me then. Charlie frowned. Edward's face was empty, expressionless. \"What are you doing, Bella?\u00a0 \" Charlie complained. \"Oh, come on.\" I pretended to smile as I went to sit on the floor in front of the sofa where Charlie lounged. \"You know Mom will be calling soon to ask if I'm using my presents. I have to get to work before she can get her feelings hurt.\" \"Why are you taking pictures of me, though?\u00a0 \" he grumbled. \"Because you're so handsome,\" I replied, keeping it light. \"And because, since you\u00a0 bought the camera, you're obligated to be one of my subjects.\" He mumbled something unintelligible. \"Hey, Edward,\" I said with admirable indifference. \"Take one of me and my dad together.\"  I threw the camera toward him, carefully avoiding his eyes, and knelt beside the arm of the sofa where Charlie's face was. Charlie sighed. \"You need to smile, Bella,\" Edward murmured. I did my best, and the camera flashed. \"Let me take one of you kids,\" Charlie suggested. I knew he was just trying to shift the camera's focus from himself. Edward stood and lightly tossed him the camera. I went to stand beside Edward, and the arrangement felt formal and strange to me. He put one hand lightly on my shoulder, and I wrapped my arm more securely around his waist. I wanted to look at his face, but I was afraid to. \"Smile, Bella,\" Charlie reminded me again. I took a deep breath and smiled. The flash blinded me. \"Enough pictures for tonight,\" Charlie said then, shoving the camera into a crevice of the sofa cushions and rolling over it. \"You don't have to use the whole roll now.\" Edward dropped his hand from my shoulder and twisted casually out of my arm. He sat back down in the armchair. I hesitated, and then went to sit against the sofa again. I was suddenly so frightened that my hands were shaking. I pressed them into my stomach to hide them, put my chin on my knees and stared at the TV screen in front of me, seeing nothing. When the show ended, I hadn't moved an inch. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Edward stand. \"I'd better get home,\" he said. Charlie didn't look up from the commercial. \"See ya.\" I got awkwardly to my feet\u2014I was stiff from sitting so still\u2014and followed Edward out the front door. He went straight to his car. \"Will you stay?\u00a0 \" I asked, no hope in my voice. I expected his answer, so it didn't hurt as much. \"Not tonight.\" I didn't ask for a reason. He got in his car and drove away while I stood there, unmoving. I barely noticed that it was raining. I waited, without knowing what I waited for, until the door opened behind me. \"Bella, what are you doing?\u00a0 \" Charlie asked, surprised to see me standing there alone and dripping. \"Nothing.\" I turned and trudged back to the house. It was a long night, with little in the way of rest. I got up as soon as there was a faint light outside my window. I dressed for school mechanically, waiting for the clouds to brighten. When I had eaten a bowl of cereal, I decided that it was light enough for pictures. I took one of my truck, and then the front of the house. I turned and snapped a few of the forest by Charlie's house. Funny how it didn't seem sinister like it used to. I realized I would miss this\u2014the green, the timelessness, the mystery of the woods. All of it. I put the camera in my school bag before I left. I tried to concentrate on my new project rather than the fact that Edward apparently hadn't gotten over things during the night. Along with the fear, I was beginning to feel impatience. How long could this last?\u00a0  It lasted through the morning. He walked silently beside me, never seeming to actually look at me. I tried to concentrate on my classes, but not even English could hold my attention. Mr. Berty had to repeat his question about Lady Capulet twice before I realized he was talking to me. Edward whispered the correct answer under his breath and then went back to ignoring me. At lunch, the silence continued. I felt like I was going to start screaming at any moment, so, to distract myself, I leaned across the table's invisible line and spoke to Jessica. \"Hey, Jess?\u00a0 \" \"What's up, Bella?\u00a0 \" \"Could you do me a favor?\u00a0 \" I asked, reaching into my bag. \"My mom wants me to get some pictures of my friends for a scrapbook. So, take some pictures of everybody, okay?\u00a0 \" I handed her the camera. \"Sure,\" she said, grinning, and turned to snap a candid shot of Mike with his mouth full. A predictable picture war ensued. I watched them hand the camera around the table, giggling and flirting and complaining about being on film. It seemed strangely childish. Maybe I just wasn't in the mood for normal human behavior today. \"Uh-oh,\" Jessica said apologetically as she returned the camera. \"I think we used all your film.\" \"That's okay. I think I already got pictures of everything else I needed.\" After school, Edward walked me back to the parking lot in silence. I had to work again, and for once, I was glad. Time with me obviously wasn't helping things. Maybe time alone would be better. I dropped my film off at the Thriftway on my way to Newton's, and then picked up the developed pictures after work. At home, I said a brief hi to Charlie, grabbed a granola bar from the kitchen, and hurried up to my room with the envelope of photographs tucked under my arm. I sat in the middle of my bed and opened the envelope with wary curiosity. Ridiculously, I still half expected the first print to be a blank. When I pulled it out, I gasped aloud. Edward looked just as beautiful as he did in real life, staring at me out of the picture with the warm eyes I'd missed for the past few days. It was almost uncanny that anyone could look so\u2026 so\u2026 beyond description. No thousand words could equal this picture. I flipped through the rest of the stack quickly once, and then laid three of them out on the bed side by side. The first was the picture of Edward in the kitchen, his warm eyes touched with tolerant amusement. The second was Edward and Charlie, watching ESPN. The difference in Edward's expression was severe. His eyes were careful here, reserved. Still breathtakingly beautiful, but his face was colder, more like a sculpture, less alive. The last was the picture of Edward and me standing awkwardly side by side. Edward's face was the same as the last, cold and statue-like. But that wasn't the most troubling part of this photograph. The contrast between the two of us was painful. He looked like a god. I looked very average, even for a human, almost shamefully plain. I flipped the picture over with a feeling of disgust. Instead of doing my homework, I stayed up to put my pictures into the album. With a ballpoint pen I scrawled captions under all the pictures, the names and the dates. I got to the picture of Edward and me, and, without looking at it too long, I folded it in half and stuck it under the metal tab, Edward-side up. When I was done, I stuffed the second set of prints in a fresh envelope and penned a long thank-you letter to Renee. Edward still hadn't come over. I didn't want to admit that he was the reason I'd stayed up so late, but of course he was. I tried to remember the last time he'd stayed away like this, without an excuse, a phone call\u2026 He never had. Again, I didn't sleep well. School followed the silent, frustrating, terrifying pattern of the last two days. I felt relief when I saw Edward waiting for me in the parking lot, but it faded quickly. He was no different, unless maybe more remote. It was hard to even remember the reason for all this mess. My birthday already felt like the distant past. If only Alice would come back. Soon. Before this got any more out of hand.  But I couldn't count on that. I decided that, if I couldn't talk to him today, really talk, then I was going to see Carlisle tomorrow. I had to do something. After school, Edward and I were going to talk it out, I promised myself. I wasn't accepting any excuses. He walked me to my truck, and I steeled myself to make my demands. \"Do you mind if I come over today?\u00a0 \" he asked before we got to the truck, beating me to the punch. \"Of course not.\" \"Now?\u00a0 \" he asked again, opening my door for me. \"Sure,\" I kept my voice even, though I didn't like the urgency in his tone. \"I was just going to drop a letter for Renee in the mailbox on the way. I'll meet you there.\" He looked at the fat envelope on the passenger seat. Suddenly, he reached over me and snagged it. \"I'll do it,\" he said quietly. \"And I'll still beat you there.\" He smiled my favorite crooked smile, but it was wrong. It didn't reach his eyes. \"Okay,\" I agreed, unable to smile back. He shut the door, and headed toward his car. He did beat me home. He was parked in Charlie's spot when I pulled up in front of the house. That was a bad sign. He didn't plan to stay, then. I shook my head and took a deep breath, trying to locate some courage. He got out of his car when I stepped out of the truck, and came to meet me. He reached to take my book bag from me. That was normal. But he shoved it back onto the seat. That was not normal. \"Come for a walk with me,\" he suggested in an unemotional voice, taking my hand. I didn't answer. I couldn't think of a way to protest, but I instantly knew that I wanted to. I didn't like this. This is bad, this is very bad, the voice in my head repeated again and again. But he didn't wait for an answer. He pulled me along toward the east side of the yard, where the forest encroached. I followed unwillingly, trying to think through the panic. It was what I wanted, I reminded myself. The chance to talk it all through. So why was the panic choking me?\u00a0  We'd gone only a few steps into the trees when he stopped. We were barely on the trail\u2014I could still see the house. Some walk. Edward leaned against a tree and stared at me, his expression unreadable. \"Okay, let's talk,\" I said. It sounded braver than it felt. He took a deep breath. \"Bella, we're leaving.\" I took a deep breath, too. This was an acceptable option. I thought I was prepared. But I still had to ask. \"Why now?\u00a0 \u00a0Another year\u2014\" \"Bella, it's time. How much longer could we stay in Forks, after all?\u00a0 \u00a0Carlisle can barely pass for thirty, and he's claiming thirty-three now. We'd have to start over soon regardless.\" His answer confused me. I thought the point of leaving was to let his family live in peace. Why did we have to leave if they were going?\u00a0 \u00a0I stared at him, trying to understand what he meant. He stared back coldly. With a roll of nausea, I realized I'd misunderstood. \"When you say we\u2014,\" I whispered. \"I mean my family and myself.\" Each word separate and distinct. I shook my head back and forth mechanically, trying to clear it. He waited without any sign of impatience. It took a few minutes before I could speak. \"Okay,\" I said. \"I'll come with you.\" \"You can't, Bella. Where we're going\u2026 It's not the right place for you.\" \"Where you are is the right place for me.\" \"I'm no good for you, Bella.\" \"Don't be ridiculous.\" I wanted to sound angry, but it just sounded like I was begging. \"You're the very best part of my life.\" \"My world is not for you,\" he said grimly. \"What happened with Jasper\u2014that was nothing, Edward! Nothing!\" \"You're right,\" he agreed. \"It was exactly what was to be expected.\" \"You promised! In Phoenix, you promised that you would stay\u2014\" \"As long as that was best for you,\" he interrupted to correct me. \"No! This is about my soul, isn't it?\u00a0 \" I shouted, furious, the words exploding out of me\u2014somehow it still sounded like a plea. \"Carlisle told me about that, and I don't care,\u00a0 Edward. I don't care! You can have my soul. I don't want it without you\u2014it's yours already!\" He took a deep breath and stared, unseeingly, at the ground for a long moment. His mouth twisted the tiniest bit. When he finally looked up, his eyes were different, harder\u2014like the liquid gold had frozen solid. \"Bella, I don't want you to come with me.\" He spoke the words slowly and precisely, his cold eyes on my face, watching as I absorbed what he was really saying. There was a pause as I repeated the words in my head a few times, sifting through them for their real intent. \"You\u2026 don't\u2026 want me?\u00a0 \" I tried out the words, confused by the way they sounded, placed in that order. \"No.\" I stared, uncomprehending, into his eyes. He stared back without apology. His eyes were like topaz\u2014hard and clear and very deep. I felt like I could see into them for miles and miles, yet nowhere in their bottomless depths could I see a contradiction to the word he'd spoken. \"Well, that changes things.\" I was surprised by how calm and reasonable my voice sounded. It must be because I was so numb. I couldn't realize what he was telling me. It still didn't make any sense. He looked away into the trees as he spoke again. \"Of course, I'll always love you\u2026 in a way. But what happened the other night made me realize that it's time for a change. Because I'm\u2026 tired of pretending to be something I'm not, Bella. I am not human.\" He looked back, and the icy planes of his perfect face were not human. \"I've let this go on much too long, and I'm sorry for that.\" \"Don't.\" My voice was just a whisper now; awareness was beginning to seep through me, trickling like acid through my veins. \"Don't do this.\" He just stared at me, and I could see from his eyes that my words were far too late. He already had.  \"You're not good for me, Bella.\" He turned his earlier words around, and so I had no argument. How well I knew that I wasn't good enough for him. I opened my mouth to say something, and then closed it again. He waited patiently, his face wiped clean of all emotion. I tried again. \"If\u2026 that's what you want.\" He nodded once. My whole body went numb. I couldn't feel anything below the neck. \"I would like to ask one favor, though, if that's not too much,\" he said. I wonder what he saw on my face, because something flickered across his own face in response. But, before I could identify it, he'd composed his features into the same serene mask. \"Anything,\" I vowed, my voice faintly stronger. As I watched, his frozen eyes melted. The gold became liquid again, molten, burning down into mine with an intensity that was overwhelming. \"Don't do anything reckless or stupid,\" he ordered, no longer detached. \"Do you understand what I'm saying?\u00a0 \" I nodded helplessly. His eyes cooled, the distance returned. \"I'm thinking of Charlie, of course. He needs you. Take care of yourself\u2014for him.\" I nodded again. \"I will,\" I whispered. He seemed to relax just a little. \"And I'll make you a promise in return,\" he said. \"I promise that this will be the last time you'll see me. I won't come back. I won't put you through anything like this again. You can go on with your life without any more interference from me. It will be as if I'd never existed.\" My knees must have started to shake, because the trees were suddenly wobbling. I could hear the blood pounding faster than normal behind my ears. His voice sounded farther away. He smiled gently. \"Don't worry. You're human\u2014your memory is no more than a sieve. Time heals all wounds for your kind.\" \"And your memories?\u00a0 \" I asked. It sounded like there was something stuck in my throat, like I was choking. \"Well\"\u2014he hesitated for a short second\u2014\"I won't forget. But my kind\u2026 we're very easily distracted.\" He smiled; the smile was tranquil and it did not touch his eyes. He took a step away from me. \"That's everything, I suppose. We won't bother you again.\" The plural caught my attention. That surprised me; I would have thought I was beyond noticing anything. \"Alice isn't coming back,\" I realized. I don't know how he heard me\u2014the words made no sound\u2014but he seemed to understand. He shook his head slowly, always watching my face. \"No. They're all gone. I stayed behind to tell you goodbye.\" \"Alice is gone?\u00a0 \" My voice was blank with disbelief. \"She wanted to say goodbye, but I convinced her that a clean break would be better for you.\" I was dizzy; it was hard to concentrate. His words swirled around in my head, and I heard the doctor at the hospital in Phoenix, last spring, as he showed me the X-rays. You can see it's a clean break, his finger traced along the picture of my severed bone. That's good. It will heal more easily, more quickly. I tried to breathe normally. I needed to concentrate, to find a way out of this nightmare. \"Goodbye, Bella,\" he said in the same quiet, peaceful voice. \"Wait!\" I choked out the word, reaching for him, willing my deadened legs to carry me forward. I thought he was reaching for me, too. But his cold hands locked around my wrists and pinned them to my sides. He leaned down, and pressed his lips very lightly to my forehead for the briefest instant. My eyes closed. \"Take care of yourself,\" he breathed, cool against my skin. There was a light, unnatural breeze. My eyes flashed open. The leaves on a small vine maple shuddered with the gentle wind of his passage. He was gone. With shaky legs, ignoring the fact that my action was useless, I followed him into the forest. The evidence of his path had disappeared instantly. There were no footprints, the leaves were still again, but I walked forward without thinking. I could not do anything else. I had to keep moving. If I stopped looking for him, it was over. Love, life, meaning\u2026 over. I walked and walked. Time made no sense as I pushed slowly through the thick undergrowth. It was hours passing, but also only seconds. Maybe it felt like time had frozen because the forest looked the same no matter how far I went. I started to worry that I was traveling in a circle, a very small circle at that, but I kept going. I stumbled often, and, as it grew darker and darker, I fell often, too. Finally, I tripped over something\u2014it was black now, I had no idea what caught my foot\u2014and I stayed down. I rolled onto my side, so that I could breathe, and curled up on the wet bracken. As I lay there, I had a feeling that more time was passing than I realized. I couldn't remember how long it had been since nightfall. Was it always so dark here at night?\u00a0 \u00a0Surely, as a rule, some little bit of moonlight would filter down through the clouds, through the chinks in the canopy of trees, and find the ground. Not tonight. Tonight the sky was utterly black. Perhaps there was no moon tonight\u2014a lunar eclipse, a new moon. A new moon. I shivered, though I wasn't cold. It was black for a long time before I heard them calling. Someone was shouting my name. It was muted, muffled by the wet growth that surrounded me, but it was definitely my name. I didn't recognize the voice. I thought about answering, but I was dazed, and it took a long time to come to the conclusion that I should answer. By then, the calling had stopped. Sometime later, the rain woke me up. I don't think I'd really fallen asleep; I was just lost in an unthinking stupor, holding with all my strength to the numbness that kept me from realizing what I didn't want to know. The rain bothered me a little. It was cold. I unwrapped my arms from around my legs to cover my face.  It was then that I heard the calling again. It was farther away this time, and sometimes it sounded like several voices were calling at once. I tried to breathe deeply. I remembered that I should answer, but I didn't think they would be able to hear me. Would I be able to shout loud enough?\u00a0  Suddenly, there was another sound, startlingly close. A kind of snuffling, an animal sound. It sounded big. I wondered if I should feel afraid. I didn't\u2014just numb. It didn't matter. The snuffling went away. The rain continued, and I could feel the water pooling up against my cheek. I was trying to gather the strength to turn my head when I saw the light. At first it was just a dim glow reflecting off the bushes in the distance. It grew brighter and brighter, illuminating a large space unlike the focused beam of a flashlight. The light broke through the closest brush, and I could see that it was a propane lantern, but that was all I could see\u2014the brightness blinded me for a moment. \"Bella.\" The voice was deep and unfamiliar, but full of recognition. He wasn't calling my name to search, he was acknowledging that I was found. I stared up\u2014impossibly high it seemed\u2014at the dark face that I could now see above me. I was vaguely aware that the stranger probably only looked so tall because my head was still on the ground. \"Have you been hurt?\u00a0 \" I knew the words meant something, but I could only stare, bewildered. How could the meaning matter at this point?\u00a0  \"Bella, my name is Sam Uley.\" There was nothing familiar about his name. \"Charlie sent me to look for you.\" Charlie?\u00a0 \u00a0That struck a chord, and I tried to pay more attention to what he was saying. Charlie mattered, if nothing else did. The tall man held out a hand. I gazed at it, not sure what I was supposed to do. His black eyes appraised me for a second, and then he shrugged. In a quick and supple notion, he pulled me up from the ground and into his arms. I hung there, limp, as he loped swiftly through the wet forest. Some part of me knew this should upset me\u2014being carried away by a stranger. But there was nothing left in me to upset. It didn't seem like too much time passed before there were lights and the deep babble of many male voices. Sam Uley slowed as he approached the commotion. \"I've got her!\" he called in a booming voice. The babble ceased, and then picked up again with more intensity. A confusing swirl of faces moved over me. Sam's voice was the only one that made sense in the chaos, perhaps because my ear was against his chest. \"No, I don't think she's hurt,\" he told someone. \"She just keeps saying 'He's gone.' \" \u00a0Was I saying that out loud?\u00a0 \u00a0I bit down on my lip. \"Bella, honey, are you all right?\u00a0 \" That was one voice I would know anywhere\u2014even distorted, as it was now, with worry. \"Charlie?\u00a0 \" My voice sounded strange and small. \"I'm right here, baby.\" There was a shifting under me, followed by the leathery smell of my dad's sheriff jacket. Charlie staggered under my weight. \"Maybe I should hold on to her,\" Sam Uley suggested. \"I've got her,\" Charlie said, a little breathless. He walked slowly, struggling. I wished I could tell him to put me down and let me walk, but I couldn't find my voice. There were lights everywhere, held by the crowd walking with him. It felt like a parade. Or a funeral procession. I closed my eyes. \"We're almost home now, honey,\" Charlie mumbled now and then. I opened my eyes again when I heard the door unlock. We were on the porch of our house, and the tall dark man named Sam was holding the door for Charlie, one arm extended toward us, as if he was preparing to catch me when Charlie's arms failed. But Charlie managed to get me through the door and to the couch in the living room. \"Dad, I'm all wet,\" I objected feebly. \"That doesn't matter.\" His voice was gruff. And then he was talking to someone else. \"Blankets are in the cupboard at the top of the stairs.\" \"Bella?\u00a0 \" a new voice asked. I looked at the gray-haired man leaning over me, and recognition came after a few slow seconds. \"Dr. Gerandy?\u00a0 \" I mumbled. \"That's right, dear,\" he said. \"Are you hurt, Bella?\u00a0 \" It took me a minute to think that through. I was confused by the memory of Sam Uley's similar question in the woods. Only Sam had asked something else: Have you been hurt?\u00a0 \u00a0he'd said. The difference seemed significant somehow. Dr. Gerandy was waiting. One grizzled eyebrow rose, and the wrinkles on his forehead deepened.  \"I'm not hurt,\" I lied. The words, were true enough for what he'd asked. His warm hand touched my forehead, and his fingers pressed against the inside of my wrist. I watched his lips as he counted to himself, his eyes on his watch. \"What happened to you?\u00a0 \" he asked casually. I froze under his hand, tasting panic in the back of my throat. \"Did you get lost in the woods?\u00a0 \" he prodded. I was aware of several other people listening. Three tall men with dark faces\u2014from La Push, the Quileute Indian reservation down on the coastline, I guessed\u2014Sam Uley among them, were standing very close together and staring at me. Mr. Newton was there with Mike and Mr. Weber, Angela's father; they all were watching me more surreptitiously than the strangers. Other deep voices rumbled from the kitchen and outside the front door. Half the town must have been looking for me. Charlie was the closest. He leaned in to hear my answer. \"Yes,\" I whispered. \"I got lost.\" The doctor nodded, thoughtful, his fingers probing gently against the glands under my jaw. Charlie's face hardened. \"Do you feel tired?\u00a0 \" Dr. Gerandy asked. I nodded and closed my eyes obediently. \"I don't think there's anything wrong with her,\" I heard the doctor mutter to Charlie after a moment. \"Just exhaustion. Let her sleep it off, and I'll come check on her tomorrow,\" he paused. He must have looked at his watch, because he added, \"Well, later today actually.\" There was a creaking sound as they both pushed off from the couch to get to their feet. \"Is it true?\u00a0 \" Charlie whispered. Their voices were farther away now. I strained to hear. \"Did they leave?\u00a0 \" \"Dr. Cullen asked us not to say anything,\" Dr. Gerandy answered. \"The offer was very sudden; they had to choose immediately. Carlisle didn't want to make a big production out of leaving.\" \"A little warning might have been nice,\" Charlie grumbled. Dr. Gerandy sounded uncomfortable when he replied. \"Yes, well, in this situation, some warning might have been called for.\" I didn't want to listen anymore. I felt around for the edge of the quilt someone had laid on top of me, and pulled it over my ear. I drifted in and out of alertness. I heard Charlie whisper thanks to the volunteers as, one by one, they left. I felt his fingers on my forehead, and then the weight of another blanket. The phone rang a few times, and he hurried to catch it before it could wake me. He muttered reassurances in a low voice to the callers. \"Yeah, we found her. She's okay. She got lost. She's fine now,\" he said again and again. I heard the springs in the armchair groan when he settled himself in for the night. A few minutes later, the phone rang again. Charlie moaned as he struggled to his feet, and then he rushed, stumbling, to the kitchen I pulled my head deeper under the blankets, not wanting to listen to the same conversation again. \"Yeah,\" Charlie said, and yawned. His voice changed, it was much more alert when he spoke again. \"Where?\u00a0 '\" There was a pause. \"You're sure it's outside the reservation?\u00a0 \" Another short pause. \"But what could be burning out there?\u00a0 \" He sounded both worried and mystified. \"Look, I'll call down there and check it out.\" I listened with more interest as he punched in a number. \"Hey, Billy, it's Charlie\u2014sorry I'm calling so early\u2026 no, she's fine. She's sleeping\u2026 Thanks, but that's not why I called. I just got a call from Mrs. Stanley, and she says that from her second-story window she can see fires out on the sea cliffs, but I didn't really\u2026 Oh!\" Suddenly there was an edge in his voice\u2014irritation\u2026 or anger. \"And why are they doing that?\u00a0 \u00a0Uh huh. Really?\u00a0 \" He said it sarcastically. \"Well, don't apologize to me. Yeah, yeah. Just make sure the flames don't spread\u2026 I know, I know, I'm surprised they got them lit at all in this weather.\" Charlie hesitated, and then added grudgingly. \"Thanks for sending Sam and the other boys up. You were right\u2014they do know the forest better than we do. It was Sam who found her, so I owe you one\u2026 Yeah, I'll talk to you later,\" he agreed, still sour, before hanging up. Charlie muttered something incoherent as he shuffled back to the living room. \"What's wrong?\u00a0 \" I asked. He hurried to my side. \"I'm sorry I woke you, honey.\" \"Is something burning?\u00a0 \" \"It's nothing,\" he assured me. \"Just some bonfires out on the cliffs.\" \"Bonfires?\u00a0 \" I asked. My voice didn't sound curious. It sounded dead. Charlie frowned. \"Some of the kids from the reservation being rowdy,\" he explained. \"Why?\u00a0 \" I wondered <em>dully</em>. I could tell he didn't want to answer. He looked at the floor under his knees. \"They're celebrating the news.\" His tone was bitter. There was only one piece of news I could think of, try as I might not to. And then the pieces snapped together. \"Because the Cullens left,\" I whispered. \"They don't like the Cullens in La Push\u2014I'd forgotten about that.\" The Quileutes had their superstitions about the \"cold ones,\" the blood-drinkers that were enemies to their tribe, just like they had their legends of the great flood and wolf-men ancestors. Just stories, folklore, to most of them. Then there were the few that believed. Charlie's good friend Billy Black believed, though even Jacob, his own son, thought he was full of stupid superstitions. Billy had warned me to stay away from the Cullens\u2026 The name stirred something inside me, something that began to claw its way toward the surface, something I knew I didn't want to face. \"It's ridiculous,\" Charlie spluttered. We sat in silence for a moment. The sky was no longer black outside the window. Somewhere behind the rain, the sun was beginning to rise. \"Bella?\u00a0 \" Charlie asked. I looked at him uneasily. \"He left you alone in the woods?\u00a0 \" Charlie guessed. I deflected his question. \"How did you know where to find me?\u00a0 \" My mind shied away from the inevitable awareness that was coming, coming quickly now. \"Your note,\" Charlie answered, surprised. He reached into the back pocket of his jeans and pulled out a much-abused piece of paper. It was dirty and damp, with multiple creases from being opened and refolded many times. He unfolded it again, and held it up as evidence. The messy handwriting was remarkably close to my own. Going for a walk with Edward, up the path, it said. Back soon, B. \"When you didn't come back, I called the Cullens, and no one answered,\" Charlie said in a low voice. \"Then I called the hospital, and Dr. Gerandy told me that Carlisle was gone.\" \"Where did they go?\u00a0 \" I mumbled. He stared at me. \"Didn't Edward tell you?\u00a0 \" I shook my head, recoiling. The sound of his name unleashed the thing that was clawing inside of me\u2014a pain that knocked me breathless, astonished me with its force. Charlie eyed me doubtfully as he answered. \"Carlisle took a job with a big hospital in Los Angeles. I guess they threw a lot of money at him.\" Sunny L.A. The last place they would really go. I remembered my nightmare with the mirror\u2026 the bright sunlight shimmering off of his skin\u2014 Agony ripped through me with the memory of his face. \"I want to know if Edward left you alone out there in the middle of the woods,\" Charlie insisted. His name sent another wave of torture through me. I shook my head, frantic, desperate to escape the pain. \"It was my fault. He left me right here on the trail, in sight of the house\u2026 but I tried to follow him.\" Charlie started to say something; childishly, I covered my ears. \"I can't talk about this anymore, Dad. I want to go to my room.\" Before he could answer, I scrambled up from the couch and lurched my way up the stairs. Someone had been in the house to leave a note for Charlie, a note that would lead him to find me. From the minute that I'd realized this, a horrible suspicion began to grow in my head. I rushed to my room, shutting and locking the door behind me before I ran to the CD player by my bed. Everything looked exactly the same as I'd left it. I pressed down on the top of the CD player. The latch unhooked, and the lid slowly swung open. It was empty. The album Renee had given me sat on the floor beside the bed, just where I'd put it last. I lifted the cover with a shaking hand. I didn't have to flip any farther than the first page. The little metal corners no longer held a picture in place. The page was blank except for my own handwriting scrawled across the bottom: Edward Cullen, Charlie's kitchen, Sept. 13th. I stopped there. I was sure that he would have been very thorough. It will be as if I'd never existed, he'd promised me. I felt the smooth wooden floor beneath my knees, and then the palms of my hands, and then it was pressed against the skin of my cheek. I hoped that I was fainting, but, to my disappointment, I didn't lose consciousness. The waves of pain that had only lapped at me before now reared high up and washed over my head, pulling me under. I did not resurface.  OCTOBER NOVEMBER DECEMBER JANUARY",
