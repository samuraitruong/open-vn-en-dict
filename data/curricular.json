Stokes Public Charter School in Washington, D.C. An elementary school in Washington, D.C., has launched an innovative program to provide a more healthful food culture for its students. In a third grade mathematics class at E.W. Stokes Public Charter School, 8- and 9-year-old students are learning a basic math concept; how to create combinations, which in this case includes items like spinach and eggplant.  \"We just incorporated food into different types of combinations,\" says their teacher, Hannah Chen. \"Like with the pizza, they had two types of toppings that the kids can provide and figuring out the different combinations using those toppings.\"  This year the school started a special program to weave food topics into its third-grade math and English curricula. Designed in partnership with Seedling Projects, a non-profit environmental group based in San Francisco, California, the program is called Farm to Desk.  \"We are actually doing this in part to address the issue of childhood obesity,\" says Peter Nalli, a Farm to Desk curriculum director. \"One of the main components of our program is our belief that if kids are exposed to positive and healthy messaging about food throughout the instructional day, that has the most potential to impact long-term change.\" According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the rate of childhood obesity in the United States has tripled during the past 30 years. One in five children between the ages of six and 19 are now considered overweight. A recent study at the University of California, Berkeley found that the more kids are exposed to discussion of food topics and food vocabularies, the more likely they are to make better nutritional choices. The Farm to Desk program has three parts: a <em>curricular</em> component where teachers use food content in classes, a garden where the kids participate in planting and harvesting and a cafeteria which prepares and serves wholesome, nutritious meals. Students at E.W. Stokes Public Charter School in Washington, D.C., plant their own garden with Peter Nalli, a Farm to Desk curriculum director. \"Everything we do here is from scratch,\" says Makeisha Daye, a school chef. \"They are getting food like they are at home. And for those that do not get it at home, we make sure they receive it here.\"   Daye says the school purchases most of its food ingredients from local sustainable farms, but also gets some of its fresh produce from the school garden, which is tended by students. \"They are replanting everything now so that we will be using fresh herbs, fresh vegetables straight from our garden. The children, they love it.\" The healthful approach extends to the cafeteria at E.W. Stokes Public Charter School, where students can help themselves to the salad bar.  Back in the classroom, Asia Simms selects chicken and tomatoes as the topics for her combination exercise. She says those are her favorite burrito ingredients, wrapped inside corn-flour tortillas.   \"I think it is fun,\" says Asia. \"I like it because I get to learn what is good to eat.\"  Her teacher sees that the effort is making a difference.  \"It is a great, positive impact,\" says Chen. \"Like when they go to lunch they always pick healthy options. We have a salad bar at school. Now the kids love the salad bar. They love the fruits and vegetables. So I think it is making a big difference in their life.\"  The children are now looking at the nutrition labels on food packages to read how much sugar or fat each contains. Farm to Desk has been such a success with the third-graders, that the school is planning to expand the program to other grades next year.",

            "en": "School Gardening Boosts Children's Wellbeing And Development, Study       A new study suggests that incorporating gardening into the education children receive at school boosts their wellbeing, learning and development and helps equip them for many of the challenges of adult life.  The qualitative study, published on Monday and commissioned by the UK's Royal Horticultural Society whose headquarters are in London, was conducted by the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER), the largest independent educational research center in the UK.  The RHS said gardening should be seen as an important teaching aid, as it makes children feel happy and boosts their development. The study found that children attending schools that encouraged gardening lived more healthily and became more resilient and confident.  Dr Simon Thornton Wood, Director of Science and Learning at the RHS, told the press that:  \"As the new coalition government considers a new approach to the primary curriculum, we hope they acknowledge the striking conclusions of our research and that gardens enable a creative, flexible approach to teaching that has significant benefits.\"     He said children that go to schools where gardening is on the curriculum, as opposed to being an extra-<em>curricular</em> activity, are better equipped to deal with the challenges of adulthood. The report, which sports a colourful photo of a \"minibeast hotel\" on the cover, highlights that schools that actively use a garden produce happy, healthy, well-balanced, rounded children because they use it as a teaching tool so children learn the \"3Rs\" of Resilience\", Readiness (to learn) and Responsibility.  For the study, researchers surveyed 1,300 school teachers and investigated 10 schools taking part in the RHS Campaign for School Gardening, ranging from a large urban primary school in London to a small village school in rural Yorkshire.     They found that involving children in school gardening boosted their learning and development in many areas, such as increasing:   \nScientific knowledge and understanding, from botany to food production.\n\n  Literacy and numeracy, including widening vocabulary.\n\n  Listening and spoken interaction (\"oracy\" skills).\n\n  Awareness of the seasons.\n\n  Physical skills, including fine motor skills.\n\n  Confidence, resilience, self-esteem, emotional wellbeing, positive behaviour and sense of responsibility.\n\n  Positive attitude to healthy food choices.\n\n  The report also found that children involved in school gardening developed the ability to work, communicate with people from all ages and backgrounds, and had a responsible approach to life so they could achieve goals and play a positive role in society.     Children also learned to care for the environment, said the report, explaining that:   \" ... creating wildlife habitats such as 'minibeast hotels' and ponds, and growing types of flowers and plants that encouraged butterflies and birds, have helped pupils to understand how they can contribute to a diversity of wildlife in their area.\" Growing their own produce also helped children grasp the idea of sustainability and the concept of food miles, while the \"use of bins to produce compost for the garden has given them an opportunity to understand how recycling works in practice\". School gardening also presented opportunities for children to learn about commerce and handling money, as one teacher interviewed for the study explained:  \"They [the children] talk about how much seeds [and] seedlings cost, how many will survive, what they can sell them for, how much profit they make and how long that process takes.\"  In some cases the children managed budgets for their school gardens, and researched sources of supplies to get the best deal.  This concept was taken a step further in one particular school where they decided to keep chickens to produce eggs to make cakes to sell in the town.   Some schools used the idea of the garden to help children develop communication and negotiation skills. For example, in one school the children had to put together project funding proposals to the head, in another they had to design and present schemes for the garden.  Embedding gardening in the school curriculum works when the idea has the active support of the head teacher, a key member of staff drives it, the garden has a high profile in the school, and the amount of work involved is manageable, said the report authors. The RHS launched its Campaign for School Gardening in 2007, the aim being to encourage schools to create their own gardens. Over 12,000 schools covering 2.5 million schoolchildren have signed up.  The next phase is to train 4,500 teachers in how to use a garden as a teaching tool. Research on School Gardening, RHS.  Written by: Catharine Paddock, PhD  Copyright: Medical News Today",
