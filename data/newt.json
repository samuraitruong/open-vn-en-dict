The news will hit Mr Gingrich's hopes of being the Republican nominee to challenge President Barack Obama. But he said his \"solutions-orientated\" campaign was still moving forward. Question of commitment  His campaign got off to a halting start when he criticised a plan popular among Republicans to slash and privatise a healthcare programme for the elderly. Staff were also reportedly concerned after he took a recent holiday cruise. Mr Gingrich's campaign manager Rob Johnson and his entire senior staff, including strategists in early primary election states, were among those to quit on Thursday. Scott Rials, a longtime aide who joined the departure, told the Associated Press that he doubted Mr Gingrich's ability to win the nomination. \"I think the world of him. But at the end of the day we just could not see a clear path to win, and there was a question of commitment,\" he said. On his Facebook page on Thursday, Mr Gingrich indicated he would stay in the race. \"I am committed to running the substantive, solutions-oriented campaign I set out to run earlier this spring,\" he wrote. \"The campaign begins anew Sunday in Los Angeles.\" With the Republican primary campaign beginning to take shape, the lack of a core team could seriously hinder Mr Gingrich's chances at winning the Republican nomination, analysts say. Mr Gingrich remained widely respected in the party for leading congressional Republicans out of 40 years in opposition in 1994, although he lost the speaker's gavel in 1998 after the party took significant losses. After launching his White House bid in May, he quickly drew heavy criticism from virtually the entire national Republican establishment for criticising a Republican congressman's proposal to overhaul the popular Medicare healthcare programme.",

In South Carolina on Thursday, five men were expected to debate the US economy, the budget and healthcare, and to take shots at President Barack Obama. But only ex-Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty is seen as a credible candidate for the Republicans in 2012. While Mr Obama is seen as vulnerable, the field is slow to take shape. The debate - hosted by the South Carolina Republican Party and broadcast on Fox News - includes Mr Pawlenty, former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson, former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum, Congressman Ron Paul and former pizza restaurant magnate Herman Cain. Tea Party role A string of well-known potential contenders are sitting out the debate. They include former Alaska Governor and 2008 vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney. <em>Newt</em> Gingrich, the former speaker of the House of Representatives, is also not attending, and none of Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels, Congresswoman Michele Bachmann, real estate magnate and reality television star Donald Trump and former Ambassador to China Jon Huntsman will take to the stage. Mr Obama's poll numbers indicate he is vulnerable, due in large part to the poor state of the US economy. But a host of factors have left leading Republicans shy of jumping into the campaign, analysts say.  They include the uncertain role of the populist Tea Party, the consolidation of power among hard-right conservative Republicans and the perceived weakness of would-be front-runner Mr Romney. Mr Obama's fund-raising prowess is also seen as a factor dissuading potential opponents. By contrast, in May 2007 - when both Republican and Democratic nominations were open - a South Carolina Republican debate included two sitting senators, four former governors, three US congressmen, and a former New York City mayor. The first balloting of the 2012 primary campaign will be the Iowa caucus on 6 February 2012. Meanwhile, the Associated Press, America's most wide-reaching news agency, has said it is boycotting Thursday's debate to protest against the Fox News channel's restrictions on coverage by its photographers",
