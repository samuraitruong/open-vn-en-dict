            "en": "A question of attitude             The link between chronic stress and a marker of old age is being disentangled  TELOMERES are to chromosomes what plastic caps are to shoelaces\u2014they stop them <em>fraying</em> at the ends. Unlike shoelaces, though, chromosomes replicate themselves from time to time as the cells they are in divide. This shortens the telomere and, after 50-70 such divisions (a number known as the Hayflick limit, after its discoverer), a chromosome can grow no shorter and the cell it is in can divide no more. That provides a backstop against cancer. The rapidly dividing cells in a tumour soon hit the Hayflick limit and the process is brought to a screeching halt. Which is a good thing. The bad thing is that reaching the limit is one of the markers of old age. You do not want it to happen too quickly, particularly in tissues that have to do a lot of dividing in order to work properly, such as those in the immune system. It has been known for some time that chronic stress (caring for a child with a protracted illness, for example) causes premature shortening of the telomeres. What has not been clear is whether this is a one-way trip, with each stressful period turning the telomeric ratchet irreversibly. This week, though, at a meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research in Orlando, Florida, a group of researchers led by Edward Nelson of the University of California, Irvine, showed that it isn\u2019t. Their research suggests that stress management not only stops telomeres from shortening, it actually promotes their repair. Dr Nelson drew this welcome conclusion from a previous study that measured the impact of telephone counselling on women who had been treated for cervical cancer. The study found that such counselling worked, both mentally and physically. Women who had been counselled reported that the quality of their lives had improved, compared with those of a control group who had not been counselled. They also showed improvements in the strength of their immune systems. Given those benefits, Dr Nelson wondered if he could find others, and he re-examined the participants\u2019 samples to look at the lengths of the telomeres in their white blood cells (red cells have no nuclei, and therefore no chromosomes). What he found surprised him. Not only did counselling stop telomere shrinkage, it actually promoted telomere growth. Those women for whom counselling had worked (ie, those who reported a decrease in emotional stress) had longer telomeres at the end than they did at the beginning. Their Hayflick countdowns were being reset. A single such result must, of course, be treated with caution. But another study reported at the meeting, by Elizabeth Blackburn of the University of California, San Francisco (who shared the Nobel prize for the discovery of the enzyme that repairs telomeres), gave some support. This showed that exercise has a similar effect to counselling on the telomeres of the stressed.  If Dr Nelson\u2019s work is successfully replicated, it will shine more light on the ill-understood relationship between the health of the mind and the health of the body. For, as he points out, nothing actually changed in the lives of the women in question. They still had cancer, albeit under treatment, and they were still under stress. Nothing, that is, except their attitude.",

Co-funded by the British Heart Foundation (BHF) and the Medical Research Council (MRC), and led by University College London (UCL), the study used 450 volunteers from the ongoing \"Whitehall II\" study, which started in 1985 to investigate links between social class and health. BHF's Associate Medical Director, Professor Jeremy Pearson, said the study reinforces the need to tackle social inequalities to combat ill health: \"It's not acceptable that where you live or how much you earn -- or lesser academic attainment -- should put you at greater risk of ill health,\" he said in a statement. Andrew Steptoe, BHF Professor of Psychology at UCL, and colleagues, wrote about their findings in a paper published recently in the journal Brain, Behavior, and Immunity. They were concerned that while there is evidence that low socioeconomic status is linked to faster biological aging, attempts to tie it telomere length have yielded inconsistent results. Telomeres are short repetitive sequences of DNA that \"cap\" the ends of chromosomes and stop them degrading and fusing with their neighbours: imagine the tips on the ends of shoelaces that stop them <em>fraying</em>. Telomeres get consumed in cell division, and are replenished by an enzyme called telomerase, but there is a limit to how many times this can happen, and they gradually get shorter, limiting the number of times cells can divide, and in turn, lifespan. The researchers set out to test the hypothesis that \"shorter telomere length and telomerase activity would be related more robustly to education, an early life indicator of socioeconomic position, than to current indicators of socioeconomic circumstances\".    For the study, they split the 450 volunteers, healthy men and women aged between 53 and 76 years, into four groups according to how long they had spent in education. They also measured their current socioeconomic status in terms of household income and grade of employment. From blood samples, they were able to assess telomere length in 448 of the participants and telomerase activity in 416. After adjusting for possible confounding factors, such as age, gender, various health indicators such as smoking and cholesterol, and lifestyle indicators such as exercise, they found that lower educational attainment was linked to shorter telomere length, while household income was not, and neither was employment grade.    In fact, the link between \"telomere length and education remained significant after adjusting for current socioeconomic circumstances,\" they wrote. They also found that in men, the highest telomerase activity (the enzyme that repairs the telomeres) was in the lowest education group. The researchers concluded that low socioeconomic status defined in terms of education but not current socioeconomic circumstances is linked to shorter telomeres. This supports the idea that faster aging is not just a result of current economic circumstances or social status in a person's life, but of long-term effects that start early in life, such as education.     The researchers also suggest that people with higher levels of education are probably better equipped with life skills like problem-solving that help them deal with the stresses of life, and this reduces the biological stress on their bodies, the so-called \u201callostatic load\u201d.  \"Educational attainment but not measures of current socioeconomic circumstances are associated with leukocyte telomere length in healthy older men and women.\" Andrew Steptoe, Mark Hamer, Lee Butcher, Jue Lin, Lena Brydon, Mika Kivim\u00e4ki, Michael Marmot, Elizabeth Blackburn, Jorge D.

            "en": "Obama backs Google in dispute with China          The Obama administration has leapt to the defence of Google after the internet search giant threatened to pull the plug on its Chinese operations.  Hillary Clinton, the US Secretary of State, demanded \"an explanation\" for Beijing of Google's allegation that its Gmail email system was infiltrated. \"The ability to operate with confidence in cyberspace is critical in a modern society and economy,\" she said. Robert Gibbs, Mr Obama's press secretary, emphasised that the President backed internet freedom and said that Google had co-ordinated with the Obama administration before it had acted. The alleged cyber attacks have further strained Sino-US relations that are already <em>fraying</em> over issues of trade, currency, climate change and arms sales to Taiwan. \"We have been briefed by Google on these allegations, which raise very serious concerns and questions,\" Mrs Clinton said. Mrs Clinton had also met executives from Google and Microsoft, as well as with Cisco Systems, which provides much of China's internet infrastructure, to discuss how to stop countries from \"stifling\" access to information, the state department added. Next week the US is to launch a new technology policy to help citizens in other countries to gain access to an uncensored internet. The Chinese authorities said they were seeking clarification over Google's demand it be allowed to operate its Google.cn search engine free from the increasingly draconian censorship of the Great Firewall of China. China has spent millions trying to project it's 'soft power', however analysts said its rulers now faced a choice between protecting its power at home and suffering the embarrassment of being rejected by one of the free world's biggest brands with negative consequences for the investment climate. \"It is setting us up for a clash, and it's interesting to see who backs down. It's the US versus China, but the companies will be lobbying,\" said Chris McNally, a China analyst at the East-West Center in Hawaii.  A spokesman for Google said the company was 'in talks' with the authorities, while outside Google's offices in Beijing a handful of citizens braved the cold to lay flowers 'in mourning' at the prospect of Google's departure from China.  Despite hopes that China would start to relax freedom of speech restrictions after the 2008 Olympics, China has in fact tightened of internet controls, blocking popular as social networkings sites such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube.  The issue of censorship was raised by the US President Barack Obama on his maiden visit to China last November when he told an online town hall that he was \"a big supporter of non-censorship.\" \"I can tell you that in the United States, the fact that we have free internet \u2013 or unrestricted internet access \u2013 is a source of strength, and I think should be encouraged,\" he said.  The decision by Google to break ranks from other big corporations doing business in China and openly criticise the country's autocratic leadership comes after four rocky years during which Google was forced to compromise its core belief in the free-flow of information. Announcing its sudden change of heart on the company's blogsite, David Drummond, Google's chief legal officer, said: \"These attacks and the surveillance they have uncovered \u2013 combined with the attempts over the past year to further limit free speech on the Web \u2013 have led us to conclude that we should review the feasibility of our business operations in China. \"We are no longer willing to continue censoring our results on Google.cn, and so over the next few weeks we will be discussing with the Chinese government the basis on which we could operate an unfiltered search engine within the law, if at all,\" he said. Human rights groups, which have criticised Google's decision to submit Chinese censorship after setting up in China in 2006, applauded the company's stand. The New York-based Human Rights Watch described it as \"an important step\" to protect human rights online. \"Through international pressure, finally a big business in the West has come to realise its own conscience,\" said the prominent Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng who lives in exile in the United States after 18 years in prison in China.  \"Some Western businesses thought that by making compromises with the Chinese communists' regime, they could do business as they wished.  However, this is impossible because the Chinese government would not be satisfied.\"",
