This will dry quickly so that you can then add subsequent layers of paint and color without having to wait too long for it to dry. Burnt sienna is useful to lay out values and composition, whether you work on a white canvas or tone it with a neutral gray first.",

            "en": "8. Understand Paint Order   Paint thick over thin, fat over lean, and slow-drying over fast-drying. That means using thinner paint and less oil in the first layers, saving thicker paint and higher oil content for later layers. This will help ensure that earlier layers dry first and will help to keep your painting from cracking.  Start with an <em>underpainting</em> of paint and turpentine, then move to a painting medium of a combination of turpentine and linseed oil in a ratio of 2:1. Linseed oil can yellow with age (which is more apparent on light colors) but dries faster than other oils.",

The fine painting of flowers demands considerable discipline, because the passing of time is an important challenge. A flower is always changing. To capture the moment, Pieter bypasses the use of <em>underpainting</em> and paints each flower in turn, \"alla prima\" until the painting is finished. Sometimes he needs a whole day for each flower, other times only a few hours. Often the flower compositions never existed in reality because the flowers were painted one by one over several weeks. Take a look at these stunning flower paintings! Read more at:",
