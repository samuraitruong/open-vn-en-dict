            "en": "Although a review of existing literature provides insight into how to teach writing to adolescents, research is needed to understand how best to identify, prevent, and <em>remediate</em> writing difficulties. Research is needed to explore the role of the key literacy components (phonemic awareness, phonics, vocabulary, fluency, and comprehension) in the development of adolescents' writing ability. Finally, additional research is needed to investigate how adolescents' beliefs about their writing ability impact the development of their reading ability. This type of research is important to promote a better understanding of the relationship between reading and writing development in adolescents and to design more effective instructional approaches to support overall literacy development in adolescents.",
