            "en": "7 REPETITION        21 VERDICT WE WERE IN A BRIGHTLY LIT, UNREMARKABLE HALLWAY. The walls were off-white, the floor carpeted in industrial gray. Common rectangular fluorescent lights were spaced evenly along the ceiling. It was warmer here, for which I was grateful. This hall seemed very benign after the gloom of the ghoulish stone sewers. Edward didn't seem to agree with my assessment. He glowered darkly down the long hallway, toward the slight, black shrouded figure at the end, standing by an elevator. He pulled me along, and Alice walked on my other side. The heavy door creaked shut behind us, and then there was the thud of a bolt sliding home.\u00a0 Jane waited by the elevator, one hand holding the doors open for us. Her expression was apathetic. Once inside the elevator, the three vampires that belonged to the Volturi relaxed further. They threw back their cloaks, letting the hoods fall back on their shoulders. Felix and Demetri were both of a slightly olive complexion\u2014it looked odd combined with their chalky pallor. Felix's black hair was cropped short, but Demetri's waved to his shoulders. Their irises were deep crimson around the edges, darkening until they were black around the pupil. Under the shrouds, their clothes were modern, pale, and nondescript. I cowered in the corner, cringing against Edward. His hand still rubbed against my arm. He never took his eyes off Jane. The elevator ride was short; we stepped out into what looked like a posh office reception area. The walls were paneled in wood, the floors carpeted in thick, deep green. There were no windows, but large, brightly lit paintings of the Tuscan countryside hung everywhere as replacements. Pale leather couches were arranged in cozy groupings, and the glossy tables held crystal vases full of vibrantly colored bouquets. The flowers' smell reminded me of a funeral home.  In the middle of the room was a high, polished mahogany counter. I gawked in astonishment at the woman behind it. She was tall, with dark skin and green eyes. She would have been very pretty in any other company\u2014but not here. Because she was every bit as human as I was. I couldn't comprehend what this human woman was doing here, totally at ease, surrounded by vampires.  She smiled politely in welcome. \"Good afternoon, Jane,\" she said. There was no surprise in her face as she glanced at Jane's company. Not Edward, his bare chest glinting dimly in the white lights, or even me, disheveled and comparatively hideous. Jane nodded. \"Gianna.\" She continued toward a set of double doors in the back of the room, and we followed. As Felix passed the desk, he winked at Gianna, and she giggled. On the other side of the wooden doors was a different kind of reception. The pale boy in the pearl gray suit could have been Jane's twin. His hair was darker, and his lips were not as full, but he was just as lovely. He came forward to meet us. He smiled, reaching for her. \"Jane.\" \"Alec,\" she responded, embracing the boy. They kissed each other's cheeks on both sides. Then he looked at us. \"They send you out for one and you come back with two\u2026 and a half,\" he noted, looking at me. \"Nice work.\" She laughed\u2014the sound sparkled with delight like a baby's cooing. \"Welcome back, Edward,\" Alec greeted him. \"You seem in a better mood.\" \"Marginally,\" Edward agreed in a flat voice. I glanced at Edward's hard face, and wondered how his mood could have been darker before. Alec chuckled, and examined me as I clung to Edward's side. \"And this is the cause of all the trouble?\" he asked, skeptical. Edward only smiled, his expression contemptuous. Then he froze. \"Dibs,\" Felix called casually from behind. Edward turned, a low snarl building deep in his chest. Felix smiled\u2014his hand was raised, palm up; he curled his fingers twice, inviting Edward forward. Alice touched Edward's arm. \"Patience,\" she cautioned him. They exchanged a long glance, and I wished I could hear what she was telling him. I figured that it was something to do with not attacking Felix, because Edward took a deep breath and turned back to Alec. \"Aro will be so pleased to see you again,\" Alec said, as if nothing had passed. \"Let's not keep him waiting,\" Jane suggested. Edward nodded once. Alec and Jane, holding hands, led the way down yet another wide, ornate hall\u2014would there ever be an end? They ignored the doors at the end of the hall\u2014doors entirely sheathed in gold\u2014stopping halfway down the hall and sliding aside a piece of the paneling to expose a plain wooden door. It wasn't locked. Alec held it open for Jane. I wanted to groan when Edward pulled me through to the other side of the door. It was the same ancient stone as the square, the alley, and the sewers. And it was dark and cold again. The stone antechamber was not large. It opened quickly into a brighter, cavernous room, perfectly round like a huge castle turret\u2026 which was probably exactly what it was. Two stories up, long window slits threw thin rectangles of bright sunlight onto the stone floor below. There were no artificial lights. The only furniture in the room were several massive wooden chairs, like thrones, that were spaced unevenly, flush with the curving stone walls. In the very center of the circle, in a slight depression, was another drain. I wondered if they used it as an exit, like the hole in the street. The room was not empty. A handful of people were convened in seemingly relaxed conversation. The murmur of low, smooth voices was a gentle hum in the air. As I watched, a pair of pale women in summer dresses paused in a patch of light, and, like prisms, their skin threw the light in rainbow sparkles against the sienna walls. The exquisite faces all turned toward our party as we entered the room. Most of the immortals were dressed in inconspicuous pants and shirts\u2014things that wouldn't stick out at all on the streets below. But the man who spoke first wore one of the long robes. It was pitch-black, and brushed against the floor. For a moment, I thought his long, jet-black hair was the hood of his cloak. \"Jane, dear one, you've returned!\" he cried in evident delight. His voice was just a soft sighing. He drifted forward, and the movement flowed with such surreal grace that I gawked, my mouth hanging open. Even Alice, whose every motion looked like dancing, could not compare. I was only more astonished as he floated closer and I could see his face. It was not like the unnaturally attractive faces that surrounded him (for he did not approach us alone; the entire group converged around him, some following, and some walking ahead of him with the alert manner of bodyguards). I couldn't decide if his face was beautiful or not. I suppose the features were perfect.  But he was as different from the vampires beside him as they were from me. His skin was translucently white, like onionskin, and it looked just as delicate\u2014it stood in shocking contrast to the long black hair that framed his face. I felt a strange, horrifying urge to touch his cheek, to see if it was softer than Edward's or Alice's, or if it was powdery, like chalk. His eyes were red, the same as the others around him, but the color was clouded, milky; I wondered if his vision was affected by the haze. He glided to Jane, took her face in his papery hands, kissed her lightly on her full lips, and then floated back a step. \"Yes, Master.\" Jane smiled; the expression made her look like an angelic child. \"I brought him back alive, just as you wished.\" \"Ah, Jane.\" He smiled, too. \"You are such a comfort to me.\" He turned his misty eyes toward us, and the smile brightened\u2014became ecstatic. \"And Alice and Bella, too!\" he rejoiced, clapping his thin hands together. \"This is a happy surprise!  Wonderful!\" I stared in shock as he called our names informally, as if we were old friends dropping in for an unexpected visit. He turned to our hulking escort. \"Felix, be a dear and tell my brothers about our company. I'm sure they wouldn't want to miss this.\" \"Yes, Master.\" Felix nodded and disappeared back the way we had come. \"You see, Edward?\" The strange vampire turned and smiled at Edward like a fond but scolding grandfather. \"What did I tell you? Aren't you glad that I didn't give you what you wanted yesterday?\" \"Yes, Aro, I am,\" he agreed, tightening his arm around my waist. \"I love a happy ending.\" Aro sighed. \"They are so rare. But I want the whole story. How did this happen? Alice?\" He turned to gaze at Alice with curious, misty eyes. \"Your brother seemed to think you infallible, but apparently there was some mistake.\" \"Oh, I'm far from infallible.\" She flashed a dazzling smile. She looked perfectly at ease, except that her hands were balled into tight little fists. \"As you can see today, I cause problems as often as I cure them.\" \"You're too modest,\" Aro chided. \"I've seen some of your more amazing exploits, and I must admit I've never observed anything like your talent. Wonderful!\" Alice flickered a glance at Edward. Aro did not miss it. \"I'm sorry, we haven't been introduced properly at all, have we? It's just that I feel like I know you already, and I tend get ahead of myself. Your brother introduced us yesterday, in a peculiar way. You see, I share some of your brother's talent, only I am limited in a way that he is not.\" Aro shook his head; his tone was envious. \"And also exponentially more powerful,\" Edward added dryly. He looked at Alice as he swiftly explained. \"Aro needs physical contact to hear your thoughts, but he hears much more than I do. You know I can only hear what's passing through your head in the moment. Aro hears every thought your mind has ever had.\" Alice raised her delicate eyebrows, and Edward inclined his head. Aro didn't miss that either. \"But to be able to hear from a distance\u2026\" Aro sighed, gesturing toward the two of them, and the exchange that had just taken place. \"That would be so convenient.\" Aro looked over our shoulders. All the other heads turned in the same direction, including Jane, Alec, and Demetri, who stood silently beside us. I was the slowest to turn. Felix was back, and behind him floated two more black-robed men. Both looked very much like Aro, one even had the same flowing black hair. The other had a shock of snow-white hair\u2014the same shade as his face\u2014that brushed against his shoulders. Their faces had identical, paper-thin skin. The trio from Carlisle's painting was complete, unchanged by the last three hundred years since it was painted. \"Marcus, Caius, look!\" Aro crooned. \"Bella is alive after all, and Alice is here with her! Isn't that wonderful?\" Neither of the other two looked as if wonderful would be their first choice of words. The dark-haired man seemed utterly bored, like he'd seen too many millennia of Aro's enthusiasm. The other's face was sour under the snowy hair. Their lack of interest did not curb Aro's enjoyment. \"Let us have the story,\" Aro almost sang in his feathery voice. The white-haired ancient vampire drifted away, gliding toward one of the wooden thrones. The other paused beside Aro, and he reached his hand out, at first I thought to take Aro's hand. But he just touched Aro's palm briefly and then dropped his hand to his side. Aro raised one black brow. I wondered how his papery skin did not crumple in the effort. Edward snorted very quietly, and Alice looked at him, curious. \"Thank you, Marcus,\" Aro said. \"That's quite interesting.\" I realized, a second late, that Marcus was letting Aro know his thoughts. Marcus didn't look interested. He glided away from Aro to join the one who must be Caius, seated against the wall. Two of the attending vampires followed silently behind him\u2014bodyguards, like I'd thought before. I could see that the two women in the sundresses had gone to stand beside Caius in the same manner. The idea of any vampire needing a guard was faintly ridiculous to me, but maybe the ancient ones were as frail as their skin suggested. Aro was shaking his head. \"Amazing,\"' he said. \"Absolutely amazing.\" Alice's expression was frustrated. Edward turned to her and explained again in a swift, low voice.  \"Marcus sees relationships. He's surprised by the intensity of ours.\" Aro smiled. \"So convenient,\" he repeated to himself. Then he spoke to us. \"It takes quite a bit to surprise Marcus, I can assure you.\" I looked at Marcus's dead face, and I believed that. \"It's just so difficult to understand, even now,\" Aro mused, staring at Edward's arm wrapped around me. It was hard for me to follow Aro's chaotic train of thought. I struggled to keep up. \"How can you stand so close to her like that?\" \"It's not without effort,\" Edward answered calmly. \"But still\u2014la tua cantante! What a waste!\" Edward chuckled once without humor. \"I look at it more as a price.\" Aro was skeptical. \"A very high price.\" \"Opportunity cost.\" Aro laughed. \"If I hadn't smelled her through your memories, I wouldn't have believed the call of anyone's blood could be so strong. I've never felt anything like it myself. Most of us would trade much for such a gift, and yet you\u2026\" \"Waste it,\" Edward finished, his voice sarcastic now. Aro laughed again. \"Ah, how I miss my friend Carlisle! You remind me of him\u2014only he was not so angry.\" \"Carlisle outshines me in many other ways as well.\" \"I certainly never thought to see Carlisle bested for self-control of all things, but you put him to shame.\" \"Hardly.\" Edward sounded impatient. As if he were tired of the preliminaries. It made me more afraid; I couldn't help but try to imagine what he expected would follow. \"I am gratified by his success,\" Aro mused. \"Your memories of him are quite a gift for me, though they astonish me exceedingly. I am surprised by how it\u2026 pleases me, his success in this unorthodox path he's chosen. I expected that he would waste, weaken with time. I'd scoffed at his plan to find others who would share his peculiar vision. Yet, somehow, I'm happy to be wrong.\" Edward didn't reply. \"But your restraint!\" Aro sighed. \"I did not know such strength was possible. To inure yourself against such a siren call, not just once but again and again\u2014if I had not felt it myself, I would not have believed.\" Edward gazed back at Aro's admiration with no expression. I knew his face well enough\u2014time had not changed that\u2014to guess at something seething beneath the surface. I fought to keep my breathing even. \"Just remembering how she appeals to you\u2026\" Aro chuckled. \"It makes me thirsty.\" Edward tensed. \"Don't be disturbed,\" Aro reassured him. \"I mean her no harm. But I am so curious, about one thing in particular.\" He eyed me with bright interest. \"May I?\" he asked eagerly, lifting one hand. \"Ask her,\" Edward suggested in a flat voice. \"Of course, how rude of me!\" Aro exclaimed. \"Bella,\" he addressed me directly now. \"I'm fascinated that you are the one exception to Edward's impressive talent\u2014so very interesting that such a thing should occur! And I was wondering, since our talents are similar in many ways, if you would be so kind as to allow me to try\u2014to see if you are an exception for me, as well?\" My eyes flashed up to Edward's face in terror. Despite Aro's overt politeness, I didn't believe I really had a choice. I was horrified at the thought of allowing him to touch me, and yet also perversely intrigued by the chance to feel his strange skin. Edward nodded in encouragement\u2014whether because he was sure Aro would not hurt me, or because there was no choice, I couldn't tell. I turned back to Aro and raised my hand slowly in front of me. It was trembling. He glided closer, and I believe he meant his expression to be reassuring. But his papery features were too strange, too alien and frightening, to reassure. The look on his face was more confident than his words had been. Aro reached out, as if to shake my hand, and pressed his insubstantial-looking skin against mine. It was hard, but felt brittle\u2014shale rather than granite\u2014and even colder than I expected. His filmy eyes smiled down at mine, and it was impossible to look away. They were mesmerizing in an odd, unpleasant way. Aro's face altered as I watched. The confidence wavered and became first doubt, then incredulity before he calmed it into a friendly mask. \"So very interesting,\" he said as he released my hand and drifted back. My eyes flickered to Edward, and, though his face was composed, I thought he seemed a little smug. Aro continued to drift with a thoughtful expression. He was quiet for a moment, his eyes flickering between the three of us. Then, abruptly, he shook his head. \"A first,\" he said to himself \"I wonder if she is immune to our other talents\u2026 Jane, dear?\" \"No!\" Edward snarled the word. Alice grabbed his arm with a restraining hand. He shook her off. Little Jane smiled up happily at Aro. \"Yes, Master?\" Edward was truly snarling now, the sound ripping and tearing from him, glaring at Aro with baleful eyes. The room had gone still, everyone watching him with amazed disbelief, as if he were committing some embarrassing social faux pas. I saw Felix grin hopefully and move a step forward. Aro glanced at him once, and he froze in place, his grin turning to a sulky expression. Then he spoke to Jane. \"I was wondering, my dear one, if Bella is immune to you.\" I could barely hear Aro over Edward's furious growls. He let go of me, moving to hide me from their view. Caius ghosted in our direction, with his entourage, to watch. Jane turned toward us with a beatific smile. \"Don't!\" Alice cried as Edward launched himself at the little girl. Before I could react, before anyone could jump between them, before Aro's bodyguards could tense, Edward was on the ground. No one had touched him, but he was on the stone floor writhing in obvious agony, while I stared in horror. Jane was smiling only at him now, and it all clicked together. What Alice had said about formidable gifts , why everyone treated Jane with such deference, and why Edward had thrown himself in her path before she could do that to me. \"Stop!\" I shrieked, my voice echoing in the silence, jumping forward to put myself between them. But Alice threw her arms around me in an unbreakable grasp and ignored my struggles. No sound escaped Edward's lips as he cringed against the stones. It felt like my head would explode from the pain of watching this. \"Jane,\" Aro recalled her in a tranquil voice. She looked up quickly, still smiling with pleasure, her eyes questioning. As soon as Jane looked away, Edward was still. Aro inclined his head toward me. Jane turned her smile in my direction. I didn't even meet her gaze. I watched Edward from the prison of Alice's arms, still struggling pointlessly. \"He's fine,\" Alice whispered in a tight voice. As she spoke, he sat up, and then sprang lightly to his feet. His eyes met mine, and they were horror-struck. At first I thought the horror was for what he had just suffered. But then he looked quickly at Jane, and back to me\u2014and his face relaxed into relief. I looked at Jane, too, and she no longer smiled. She glared at me, her jaw clenched with the intensity of her focus. I shrank back, waiting for the pain. Nothing happened. Edward was by my side again. He touched Alice's arm, and she surrendered me to him. Aro started to laugh. \"Ha, ha. ha,\" he chuckled. \"This is wonderful!\" Jane hissed in frustration, leaning forward like she was preparing to spring. \"Don't be put out, dear one,\" Aro said in a comforting tone, placing a powder-light hand on her shoulder. \"She confounds us all.\" Jane's upper lip curled back ever her teeth as she continued to glare at me. \"Ha, ha, ha,\" Aro chortled again. \"You're very brave, Edward, to endure in silence. I asked Jane to do that to me once\u2014just out of curiosity.\" He shook his head in admiration. Edward glared, disgusted. \"So what do we do with you now?\" Aro sighed. Edward and Alice stiffened. This was the part they'd been waiting for. I began to tremble. \"I don't suppose there's any chance that you've changed your mind?\" Aro asked Edward hopefully. \"Your talent would be an excellent addition to our little company.\" Edward hesitated. From the corner of my eye, I saw both Felix and Jane grimace. Edward seemed to weigh each word before he spoke it. \"I'd\u2026 rather\u2026 not.\" \"Alice?\" Aro asked, still hopeful. \"Would you perhaps be interested in joining with us?\" \"No, thank you,\" Alice said. \"And you, Bella?\" Aro raised his eyebrows. Edward hissed, low in my ears. I stared at Aro blankly. Was he joking? Or was he really asking me if I wanted to stay for dinner? It was the white-haired Caius who broke the silence. \"What?\" he demanded of Aro; his voice, though no more than a whisper, was flat. \"Caius, surely you see the potential,\" Aro chided him affectionately. \"I haven't seen a prospective talent so promising since we found Jane and Alec. Can you imagine the possibilities when she is one of us?\" Caius looked away with a caustic expression. Jane's eyes sparked with indignation at the comparison. Edward fumed beside me. I could hear a rumble in his chest, building toward a growl. I couldn't let his temper get him hurt. \"No, thank you,\" I spoke up in barely more than a whisper, my voice breaking in fright. Aro sighed. \"That's unfortunate. Such a waste.\" Edward hissed. \"Join or die, is that it? I suspected as much when we were brought to this room. So much for your laws.\" The tone of his voice surprised me. He sounded <em>irate</em>, but there was something deliberate about his delivery\u2014as if he'd chosen his words with great care. \"Of course not.\" Aro blinked, astonished. \"We were already convened here, Edward, awaiting Heidi's return. Not for you.\" \"Aro,\" Caius hissed. \"The law claims them.\" Edward glared at Caius. \"How so?\" he demanded. He must have known what Caius was thinking, but he seemed determined to make him speak it aloud. Caius pointed a skeletal finger at me. \"She knows too much. You have exposed our secrets.\" His voice was papery thin, just like his skin. \"There are a few humans in on your charade here, as well,\" Edward reminded him, and I thought of the pretty receptionist below. Caius's face twisted into a new expression. Was it supposed to be a smiled. \"Yes,\" he agreed. \"But when they are no longer useful to us, they will serve to sustain us. That is not your plan for this one. If she betrays our secrets, are you prepared to destroy her? I think not,\" he scoffed. \"I wouldn't\u2014,\" I began, still whispering. Caius silenced me with an icy look. \"Nor do you intend to make her one of us,\" Caius continued. \"Therefore, she is a vulnerability. Though it is true, for this, only her life is forfeit. You may leave if you wish.\" Edward bared his teeth. \"That's what I thought,\" Caius said, with something akin to pleasure. Felix leaned forward, eager. \"Unless\u2026\" Aro interrupted. He looked unhappy with the way the conversation had gone. \"Unless you do intend to give her immortality?\" Edward pursed his lips, hesitating for a moment before he answered. \"And if I do?\" Aro smiled, happy again. \"Why, then you would be free to go home and give my regards to my friend Carlisle.\" His expression turned more hesitant. \"But I'm afraid you would have to mean it.\" Aro raised his hand in front of him. Caius, who had begun to scowl furiously, relaxed. Edward's lips tightened into a fierce line. He stared into my eyes, and I stared back. \"Mean it,\" I whispered. \"Please.\" Was it really such a loathsome idea? Would he rather die than change me? I felt like I'd been kicked in the stomach. Edward stared down at me with a tortured expression. And then Alice stepped away from us, forward toward Aro. We turned to watch her. Her hand was raised like his. She didn't say anything, and Aro waved off his anxious guard as they moved to block her approach. Aro met her halfway, and took her hand with an eager, acquisitive glint in his eyes. He bent his head over their touching hands, his eyes closing as he concentrated. Alice was motionless, her face blank. I heard Edward's teeth snap together. No one moved. Aro seemed frozen over Alice's hand. The seconds passed and I grew more and more stressed, wondering how much time would pass before it was too much time. Before it meant something was wrong\u2014more wrong than it already was. Another agonizing moment passed, and then Aro's voice broke the silence. \"Ha, ha, ha,\" he laughed, his head still bent forward. He looked up slowly, his eyes bright with excitement. \"That was fascinating!\" Alice smiled dryly. \"I'm glad you enjoyed it.\" \"To see the things you've seen\u2014especially the ones that haven't happened yet!\" He shook his head in wonder. \"But that will,\" she reminded him, voice calm. \"Yes, yes, it's quite determined. Certainly there's no problem.\" Caius looked bitterly disappointed\u2014a feeling he seemed to share with Felix and Jane. \"Aro,\" Caius complained. \"Dear Caius,\" Aro smiled. \"Do not fret. Think of the possibilities! They do not join us today, but we can always hope for the future. Imagine the joy young Alice alone would bring to our little household\u2026 Besides, I'm so terribly curious to see how Bella turns out!\" Aro seemed convinced. Did he not realize how subjective Alice's visions were.' That she could make up her mind to transform me today, and then change it tomorrow? A million tiny decisions, her decisions and so many others', too\u2014Edward's\u2014could alter her path, and with that, the future. And would it really matter that Alice was willing, would it make any difference if I did become a vampire, when the idea was so repulsive to Edward? If death was, to him, a better alternative than having me around forever, an immortal annoyance? Terrified as I was, I felt myself sinking down into depression, drowning in it\u2026 \"Then we are free to go now?\" Edward asked in an even voice. \"Yes, yes,\" Aro said pleasantly. \"But please visit again. It's been absolutely enthralling!\" \"And we will visit you as well,\" Caius promised, his eyes suddenly half-closed like the heavy-lidded gaze of a lizard. \"To be sure that you follow through on your side. Were I you, I would not delay too long. We do not offer second chances.\" Edward's jaw clenched tight, but he nodded once. Caius smirked and drifted back to where Marcus still sat, unmoving and uninterested. Felix groaned. \"Ah, Felix.\" Aro smiled, amused. \"Heidi will be here at any moment. Patience.\" \"Hmm.\" Edward's voice had a new edge to it. \"In that case, perhaps we'd better leave sooner rather than later.\" \"Yes,\" Aro agreed. \"That's a good idea. Accidents do happen. Please wait below until after dark, though, if you don't mind.\" \"Of course,\" Edward agreed, while I cringed at the thought of waiting out the day before we could escape. \"And here,\" Aro added, motioning to Felix with one finger. Felix came forward at once, and Aro unfastened the gray cloak the huge vampire wore, pulling from his shoulders. He tossed it to Edward. \"Take this. You're a little conspicuous.\" Edward put the long cloak on, leaving the hood down. Aro sighed. \"It suits you.\" Edward chuckled, but broke off suddenly, glancing over his shoulder. \"Thank you, Aro. We'll wait below.\" \"Goodbye, young friends,\" Aro said, his eyes bright as he stared in the same direction. \"Let's go,\" Edward said, urgent now. Demetri gestured that we should follow, and then set off the way we'd come in, the only exit by the look of things. Edward pulled me swiftly along beside him. Alice was close by my other side, her face hard. \"Not fast enough,\" she muttered. I stared up at her, frightened, but she only seemed chagrined. It was then that I first heard the babble of voices\u2014loud, rough voices\u2014coming from the antechamber. \"Well this is unusual,\" a man's coarse voice boomed. \"So medieval,\" an unpleasantly shrill, female voice gushed back. A large crowd was coming through the little door, filling the smaller stone chamber. Demetri motioned for us to make room. We pressed back against the cold wall to let them pass. The couple in front, Americans from the sound of them, glanced around themselves with appraising eyes. \"Welcome, guests! Welcome to Volterra!\" I could hear Aro sing from the big turret room. The rest of them, maybe forty or more, filed in after the couple. Some studied the setting like tourists. A few even snapped pictures. Others looked confused, as if the story that had led them to this room was not making sense anymore. I noticed one small, dark woman in particular. Around her neck was a rosary, and she gripped the cross tightly in one hand. She walked more slowly than the others, touching someone now and then and asking a question in an unfamiliar language. No one seemed to understand her, and her voice grew more panicked. Edward pulled my face against his chest, but it was too late. I already understood. As soon as the smallest break appeared, Edward pushed me quickly toward the door. I could feel the horrified expression on my face, and the tears beginning to pool in my eyes. The ornate golden hallway was quiet, empty except for one gorgeous, statuesque woman. She stared at us curiously, me in particular. \"Welcome home, Heidi,\" Demetri greeted her from behind us. Heidi smiled absently. She reminded me of Rosalie, though they looked nothing alike\u2014it was just that her beauty, too, was exceptional, unforgettable. I couldn't seem to look away. She was dressed to emphasize that beauty. Her amazingly long legs, darkened with tights, were exposed by the shortest of miniskirts. Her top was long-sleeved and high-necked, but extremely close-fitting, and constructed of red vinyl. Her long mahogany hair was lustrous, and her eyes were the strangest shade of violet\u2014a color that might result from blue-tinted contacts over red irises. \"Demetri,\" she responded in a silky voice, her eyes flickering between my face and Edward's gray cloak. \"Nice fishing,\" Demetri complimented her, and I suddenly understood the attention-grabbing outfit she wore\u2026 she was not only the fisherman, but also the bait. \"Thanks.\" She flashed a stunning smile. \"Aren't you coming?\" \"In a minute. Save a few for me.\" Heidi nodded and ducked through the door with one last curious look at me. Edward set a pace that had me running to keep up. But we still couldn't get through the ornate door at the end of the hallway before the screaming started.",

            "en": "4         4. WAKING UP TIME PASSES. EVEN WHEN IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE. EVEN when each tick of the second hand aches like the pulse of blood behind a bruise. It passes unevenly, in strange lurches and dragging lulls, but pass it does. Even for me. CHARLIE'S FIST CAME DOWN ON THE TABLE. \"THAT'S IT, Bella! I'm sending you home.\" I looked up from my cereal, which I was pondering rather than eating, and stared at Charlie in shock. I hadn't been following the conversation\u2014actually, I hadn't been aware that we were having a conversation\u2014and I wasn't sure what he meant. \"I am home,\" I mumbled, confused. \"I'm sending you to Renee, to Jacksonville,\" he clarified. Charlie watched with exasperation as I slowly grasped the meaning of his words. \"What did I do?\" I felt my face crumple. It was so unfair. My behavior had been above reproach for the past four months. After that first week, which neither of us ever mentioned, I hadn't missed a day of school or work. My grades were perfect. I never broke curfew\u2014I never went anywhere from which to break curfew in the first place. I only very rarely served leftovers. Charlie was scowling. \"You didn't do anything. That's the problem. You never do anything.\" \"You want me to get into trouble?\" I wondered, my eyebrows pulling together in mystification. I made an effort to pay attention. It wasn't easy. I was so used to tuning everything out, my ears felt stopped up. \"Trouble would be better than this\u2026 this moping around all the time!\" That stung a bit. I'd been careful to avoid all forms of moroseness, moping included. \"I am not moping around.\" \"Wrong word,\" he grudgingly conceded. \"Moping would be better\u2014that would be doing something. You're just\u2026 lifeless, Bella. I think that's the word I want.\" This accusation struck home. I sighed and tried to put some animation into my response. \"I'm sorry, Dad.\" My apology sounded a little flat, even to me. I'd thought I'd been fooling him. Keeping Charlie from suffering was the whole point of all this effort. How depressing to think that the effort had been wasted. \"I don't want you to apologize.\" I sighed. \"Then tell me what you do want me to do.\" \"Bella,\" he hesitated, scrutinizing my reaction to his next words. \"Honey, you're not the first person to go through this kind of thing, you know.\" \"I know that.\" My accompanying grimace was limp and unimpressive. .  \"Listen, honey. I think that\u2014that maybe you need some help.\" \"Help?\" He paused, searching for the words again. \"When your mother left,\" he began, frowning, \"and took you with her.\" He inhaled deeply. \"Well, that was a really bad time for me.\" \"I know, Dad,\" I mumbled. \"But I handled it,\" he pointed out. \"Honey, you're not handling it. I waited, I hoped it would get better.\" He stared at me and I looked down quickly. \"I think we both know it's not getting better.\" \"I'm fine.\" He ignored me. \"Maybe, well, maybe if you talked to someone about it. A professional.\" \"You want me to see a shrink?\" My voice was a shade sharper as I realized what he was getting at. \"Maybe it would help.\" \"And maybe it wouldn't help one little bit.\" I didn't know much about psychoanalysis, but I was pretty sure that it didn't work unless the subject was relatively honest. Sure, I could tell the truth\u2014if I wanted to spend the rest of my life in a padded cell. He examined my obstinate expression, and switched to another line of attack. \"It's beyond me, Bella. Maybe your mother\" \"Look,\" I said in a flat voice. \"I'll go out tonight, if you want. I'll call Jess or Angela.\" \"That's not what I want,\" he argued, frustrated. \"I don't think I can live through seeing you try harder. I've never seen anyone trying so hard. It hurts to watch.\" I pretended to be dense, looking down at the table. \"I don't understand, Dad. First you're mad because I'm not doing anything, and then you say you don't want me to go out.\" \"I want you to be happy\u2014no, not even that much. I just want you not to be miserable. I think you'll have a better chance if you get out of Forks.\" My eyes flashed up with the first small spark of feeling I'd had in too long to contemplate. \"I'm not leaving,\" I said. \"Why not?\" he demanded. \"I'm in my last semester of school\u2014it would screw everything up.\" \"You're a good student\u2014you'll figure it out.\" \"I don't want to crowd Mom and Phil.\" \"Your mother's been dying to have you back.\" \"Florida is too hot.\" His fist came down on the table again. \"We both know what's really going on here, Bella, and it's not good for you.\" He took a deep breath. \"It's been months. No calls, no letters, no contact. You can't keep waiting for him.\" I glowered at him. The heat almost, but not quite, reached my face. It had been a long time since I'd blushed with any emotion. This whole subject was utterly forbidden, as he was well aware. \"I'm not waiting for anything. I don't expect anything,\" I said in a low monotone. \"Bella\u2014,\" Charlie began, his voice thick. \"I have to get to school,\" I interrupted, standing up and yanking my untouched breakfast from the table. I dumped my bowl in the sink without pausing to wash it out. I couldn't deal with any more conversation. \"I'll make plans with Jessica,\" I called over my shoulder as I strapped on my school bag, not meeting his eyes. \"Maybe I won't be home for dinner. We'll go to Port Angeles and watch a movie.\" I was out the front door before he could react. In my haste to get away from Charlie, I ended up being one of the first ones to school. The plus side was that I got a really good parking spot. The downside was that I had free time on my hands, and I tried to avoid free time at all costs. Quickly, before I could start thinking about Charlie's accusations, I pulled out my Calculus book. I flipped it open to the section we should be starting today, and tried to make sense of it. Reading math was even worse than listening to it, but I was getting better at it. In the last several months, I'd spent ten times the amount of time on Calculus than I'd ever spent on math before. As a result, I was managing to keep in the range of a low A. I knew Mr. Varner felt my improvement was all due to his superior teaching methods. And if that made him happy, I wasn't going to burst his bubble. I forced myself to keep at it until the parking lot was full, and I ended up rushing to English. We were working on Animal Farm, an easy subject matter. I didn't mind communism; it was a welcome change from the exhausting romances that made up most of the curriculum. I settled into my seat, pleased by the distraction of Mr. Berty's lecture. Time moved easily while I was in school. The bell rang all too soon. I started repacking my bag. \"Bella?\" I recognized Mike's voice, and I knew what his next words would be before he said them. \"Are you working tomorrow?\" I looked up. He was leaning across the aisle with an anxious expression. Every Friday he asked me the same question. Never mind that I hadn't taken so much as a sick day. Well, with one exception, months ago. But he had no reason to look at me with such concern. I was a model employee. \"Tomorrow is Saturday, isn't it?\" I said. Having just had it pointed out to me by Charlie, I realized how lifeless my voice really sounded. \"Yeah, it is,\" he agreed. \"See you in Spanish.\" He waved once before turning his back. He didn't bother walking me to class anymore. I trudged off to Calculus with a grim expression. This was the class where I sat next to Jessica. It had been weeks, maybe months, since Jess had even greeted me when I passed her in the hall. I knew I had offended her with my antisocial behavior, and she was sulking. It wasn't going to be easy to talk to her now\u2014especially to ask her to do me a favor. I weighed my options carefully as I loitered outside the classroom, procrastinating. I wasn't about to face Charlie again without some kind of social interaction to report. I knew I couldn't lie, though the thought of driving to Port Angeles and back alone\u2014being sure my odometer reflected the correct mileage, just in case he checked\u2014was very tempting. Jessica's mom was the biggest gossip in town, and Charlie was bound to run into Mrs. Stanley sooner rather than later. When he did, he would no doubt mention the trip. Lying was out. With a sigh, I shoved the door open. Mr. Varner gave me a dark look\u2014he'd already started the lecture. I hurried to my seat. Jessica didn't look up as I sat next to her. I was glad that I had fifty minutes to mentally prepare myself. This class flew by even faster than English. A small part of that speed was due to my goody-goody preparation this morning in the truck\u2014but mostly it stemmed from the fact that time always sped up when I was looking forward to something unpleasant. I grimaced when Mr. Varner dismissed the class five minutes early. He smiled like he was being nice.  \"Jess?\" My nose wrinkled as I cringed, waiting for her to turn on me. She twisted in her seat to face me, eyeing me incredulously. \"Are you talking to me, Bella?\" \"Of course.\" I widened my eyes to suggest innocence. \"What? Do you need help with Calculus?\" Her tone was a tad sour. \"No.\" I shook my head. \"Actually, I wanted to know if you would\u2026 go to the movies with me tonight? I really need a girls' night out.\" The words sounded stiff, like badly delivered lines, and she looked suspicious. \"Why are you asking me?\" she asked, still unfriendly. \"You're the first person I think of when I want girl time.\" I smiled, and I hoped the smile looked genuine. It was probably true. She was at least the first person I thought of when I wanted to avoid Charlie. It amounted to the same thing. She seemed a little mollified. \"Well, I don't know.\" \"Do you have plans?\" \"No\u2026 I guess I can go with you. What do you want to see?\" \"I'm not sure what's playing,\" I hedged. This was the tricky part. I racked my brain for a clue\u2014hadn't I heard someone talk about a movie recently? Seen a poster? \"How about that one with the female president?\" She looked at me oddly. \"Bella, that one's been out of the theater forever.\" \"Oh.\" I frowned. \"Is there anything you'd like to see?\" Jessica's natural bubbliness started to leak out in spite of herself as she thought out loud. \"Well, there's that new romantic comedy that's getting great reviews. I want to see that one. And my dad just saw Dead End and he really liked it.\" I grasped at the promising title. \"What's that one about?\" \"Zombies or something. He said it was the scariest thing he'd seen in years.\" \"That sounds perfect.\" I'd rather deal with real zombies than watch a romance. \"Okay.\" She seemed surprised by my response. I tried to remember if I liked scary movies, but I wasn't sure. \"Do you want me to pick you up after school?\" she offered. \"Sure.\" Jessica smiled at me with tentative friendliness before she left. My answering smile was just a little late, but I thought that she saw it. The rest of the day passed quickly, my thoughts focused on planning for tonight. I knew from experience that once I got Jessica talking, I would be able to get away with a few mumbled responses at the appropriate moments. Only minimal interaction would be required. The thick haze that blurred my days now was sometimes confusing. I was surprised when I found myself in my room, not clearly remembering the drive home from school or even opening the front door. But that didn't matter. Losing track of time was the most I asked from life. I didn't fight the haze as I turned to my closet. The numbness was more essential in some places than in others. I barely registered what I was looking at as I slid the door aside to reveal the pile of rubbish on the left side of my closet, under the clothes I never wore. My eyes did not stray toward the black garbage bag that held my present from that last birthday, did not see the shape of the stereo where it strained against the black plastic; I didn't think of the bloody mess my nails had been when I'd finished clawing it out of the dashboard. I yanked the old purse I rarely used off the nail it hung from, and shoved the door shut. Just then I heard a horn honking. I swiftly traded my wallet from my schoolbag into the purse. I was in a hurry, as if rushing would somehow make the night pass more quickly. I glanced at myself in the hall mirror before I opened the door, arranging my features carefully into a smile and trying to hold them there. \"Thanks for coming with me tonight,\" I told Jess as I climbed into the passenger seat, trying to infuse my tone with gratitude. It had been a while since I'd really thought about what I was saying to anyone besides Charlie. Jess was harder. I wasn't sure which were the right emotions to fake. \"Sure. So, what brought this on?\" Jess wondered as she drove down my street. \"Brought what on?\" \"Why did you suddenly decide\u2026 to go out?\" It sounded like she changed her question halfway through. I shrugged. \"Just needed a change.\" I recognized the song on the radio then, and quickly reached for the dial. \"Do you mind?\" I asked. \"No, go ahead.\" I scanned through the stations until I found one that was harmless. I peeked at Jess's expression as the new music filled the car. Her eyes squinted. \"Since when do you listen to rap?\" \"I don't know,\" I said. \"A while.\" \"You like this?\" she asked doubtfully. \"Sure.\" It would be much too hard to interact with Jessica normally if I had to work to tune out the music, too. I nodded my head, hoping I was in time with the beat. \"Okay\u2026\" She stared out the windshield with wide eyes. \"So what's up with you and Mike these days?\" I asked quickly. \"You see him more than I do.\" The question hadn't started her talking like I'd hoped it would. \"It's hard to talk at work,\" I mumbled, and then I tried again. \"Have you been out with anyone lately?\" \"Not really. I go out with Conner sometimes. I went out with Eric two weeks ago.\" She rolled her eyes, and I sensed a long story. I clutched at the opportunity. \"Eric Yorkie? Who asked who?\" She groaned, getting more animated. \"He did, of course! I couldn't think of a nice way to say no.\" \"Where did he take you?\" I demanded, knowing she would interpret my eagerness as interest. \"Tell me all about it.\" She launched into her tale, and I settled into my seat, more comfortable now. I paid strict attention, murmuring in sympathy and gasping in horror as called for. When she was finished with her Eric story, she continued into a Conner comparison without any prodding. The movie was playing early, so Jess thought we should hit the twilight showing and eat later. I was happy to go along with whatever she wanted; after all, I was getting what I wanted\u2014Charlie off my back. I kept Jess talking through the previews, so I could ignore them more easily. But I got nervous when the movie started. A young couple was walking along a beach, swinging hands and discussing their mutual affection with gooey falseness. I resisted the urge to cover my ears and start humming. I had not bargained for a romance. \"I thought we picked the zombie movie,\" I hissed to Jessica. \"This is the zombie movie.\" \"Then why isn't anyone getting eaten?\" I asked desperately. She looked at me with wide eyes that were almost alarmed. \"I'm sure that part's coming,\" she whispered. \"I'm getting popcorn. Do you want any?\" \"No, thanks.\" Someone shushed us from behind. I took my time at the concession counter, watching the clock and debating what percentage of a ninety-minute movie could be spent on romantic exposition. I decided ten minutes was more than enough, but I paused just inside the theater doors to be sure. I could hear horrified screams blaring from the speakers, so I knew I'd waited long enough. \"You missed everything,\" Jess murmured when I slid back into my seat. \"Almost everyone is a zombie now.\" \"Long line.\" I offered her some popcorn. She took a handful. The rest of the movie was comprised of gruesome zombie attacks and endless screaming from the handful of people left alive, their numbers dwindling quickly. I would have thought there was nothing in that to disturb me. But I felt uneasy, and I wasn't sure why at first. It wasn't until almost the very end, as I watched a haggard zombie shambling after the last shrieking survivor, that I realized what the problem was. The scene kept cutting between the horrified face of the heroine, and the dead, emotionless face of her pursuer, back and forth as it closed the distance. And I realized which one resembled me the most. I stood up. \"Where are you going? There's, like, two minutes left,\" Jess hissed. \"I need a drink,\" I muttered as I raced for the exit. I sat down on the bench outside the theater door and tried very hard not to think of the irony. But it was ironic, all things considered, that, in the end, I would wind up as a zombie. I hadn't seen that one coming. Not that I hadn't dreamed of becoming a mythical monster once\u2014just never a grotesque, animated corpse. I shook my head to dislodge that train of thought, feeling panicky. I couldn't afford to think about what I'd once dreamed of. It was depressing to realize that I wasn't the heroine anymore, that my story was over. Jessica came out of the theater doors and hesitated, probably wondering where the best place was to search for me. When she saw me, she looked relieved, but only for a moment. Then she looked irritated. \"Was the movie too scary for you?\" she wondered. \"Yeah,\" I agreed. \"I guess I'm just a coward.\" \"That's funny.\" She frowned. \"I didn't think you were scared\u2014I was screaming all the time, but I didn't hear you scream once. So I didn't know why you left.\" I shrugged. \"Just scared.\" She relaxed a little. \"That was the scariest movie I think I've ever seen. I'll bet we're going to have nightmares tonight.\" \"No doubt about that,\" I said, trying to keep my voice normal. It was inevitable that I would have nightmares, but they wouldn't be about zombies. Her eyes flashed to my face and away. Maybe I hadn't succeeded with the normal voice. \"Where do you want to eat?\" Jess asked. \"I don't care.\" \"Okay.\" Jess started talking about the male lead in the movie as we walked. I nodded as she gushed over his hotness, unable to remember seeing a non-zombie man at all. I didn't watch where Jessica was leading me. I was only vaguely aware that it was dark and quieter now. It took me longer than it should have to realize why it was quiet. Jessica had stopped babbling. I looked at her apologetically, hoping I hadn't hurt her feelings. Jessica wasn't looking at me. Her face was tense; she stared straight ahead and walked fast. As I watched, her eyes darted quickly to the right, across the road, and back again. I glanced around myself for the first time. We were on a short stretch of unlit sidewalk. The little shops lining the street were all locked up for the night, windows black. Half a block ahead, the streetlights started up again, and I could see, farther down, the bright golden arches of the McDonald's she was heading for. Across the street there was one open business. The windows were covered from inside and there were neon signs, advertisements for different brands of beer, glowing in front of them. The biggest sign, in brilliant green, was the name of the bar\u2014One-Eyed Pete's. I wondered if there was some pirate theme not visible from outside. The metal door was propped open; it was dimly lit inside, and the low murmur of many voices and the sound of ice clinking in glasses floated across the street. Lounging against the wall beside the door were four men. I glanced back at Jessica. Her eyes were fixed on the path ahead and she moved briskly. She didn't look frightened\u2014just wary, trying to not attract attention to herself. I paused without thinking, looking back at the four men with a strong sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. This was a different road, a different night, but the scene was so much the same. One of them was even short and dark. As I stopped and turned toward them, that one looked up in interest.  I stared back at him, frozen on the sidewalk. \"Bella?\" Jess whispered. \"What are you doing?\" I shook my head, not sure myself. \"I think I know them\u2026\" I muttered. What was I doing? I should be running from this memory as fast as I could, blocking the image of the four lounging men from my mind, protecting myself with the numbness I couldn't function without. Why was I stepping, dazed, into the street? It seemed too coincidental that I should be in Port Angeles with Jessica, on a dark street even. My eyes focused on the short one, trying to match the features to my memory of the man who had threatened me that night almost a year ago. I wondered if there was any way I would recognize the man, if it was really him. That particular part of that particular evening was just a blur. My body remembered it better than my mind did; the tension in my legs as I tried to decide whether to run or to stand my ground, the dryness in my throat as I struggled to build a decent scream, the tight stretch of skin across my knuckles as I clenched my hands into fists, the chills on the back of my neck when the dark-haired man called me \"sugar.\"\u2026 There was an indefinite, implied kind of menace to these men that had nothing to do with that other night. It sprung from the fact that they were strangers, and it was dark here, and they outnumbered us\u2014nothing more specific than that. But it was enough that Jessica's voice cracked in panic as she called after me. \"Bella, come on!\" I ignored her, walking slowly forward without ever making the conscious decision to move my feet. I didn't understand why, but the nebulous threat the men presented drew me toward them. It was a senseless impulse, but I hadn't felt any kind of impulse in so long\u2026 I followed it. Something unfamiliar beat through my veins. Adrenaline, I realized, long absent from my system, drumming my pulse faster and fighting against the lack of sensation. It was strange\u2014why the adrenaline when there was no fear? It was almost as if it were an echo of the last time I'd stood like this, on a dark street in Port Angeles with strangers. I saw no reason for fear. I couldn't imagine anything in the world that there was left to be afraid of, not physically at least. One of the few advantages of losing everything. I was halfway across the street when Jess caught up to me and grabbed my arm. \"Bella! You can't go in a bar!\" she hissed. \"I'm not going in,\" I said absently, shaking her hand off. \"I just want to see something\u2026\" \"Are you crazy?\" she whispered. \"Are you suicidal?\" That question caught my attention, and my eyes focused on her. \"No, I'm not.\" My voice sounded defensive, but it was true. I wasn't suicidal. Even in the beginning, when death unquestionably would have been a relief, I didn't consider it. I owed too much to Charlie. I felt too responsible for Renee. I had to think of them. And I'd made a promise not to do anything stupid or reckless. For all those reasons, I was still breathing. Remembering that promise. I felt a twinge of guilt.\u00a0 But what I was doing fight now didn't really count. It wasn't like I was taking a blade to my wrists. Jess's eyes were round, her mouth hung open. Her question about suicide had been rhetorical, I realized too late. \"Go eat,\" I encouraged her, waving toward the fast food. I didn't like the way she looked at me. \"I'll catch up in a minute.\" I turned away from her, back to the men who were watching us with amused, curious eyes. \"Bella, stop this right now!\" My muscles locked into place, froze me where I stood. Because it wasn't Jessica's voice that rebuked me now. It was a furious voice, a familiar voice, a beautiful voice\u2014soft like velvet even though it was <em>irate</em>. It was his voice\u2014I was exceptionally careful not to think his name\u2014and I was surprised that the sound of it did not knock me to my knees, did not curl me onto the pavement in a torture of loss. But there was no pain, none at all. In the instant that I heard his voice, everything was very clear. Like my head had\u00a0 suddenly surfaced out of some dark pool. I was more aware of everything\u2014sight, sound, the feel of the cold air that I hadn't noticed was blowing sharply against my face, the smells coming from the open bar door. I looked around myself in shock. \"Go back to Jessica,\" the lovely voice ordered, still angry. \"You promised\u2014nothing stupid.\" I was alone. Jessica stood a few feet from me, staring at me with frightened eyes. Against the wall, the strangers watched, confused, wondering what I was doing, standing there motionless in the middle of the street. I shook my head, trying to understand. I knew he wasn't there, and yet, he felt improbably close, close for the first time since\u2026 since the end. The anger in his voice was concern, the same anger that was once very familiar\u2014something I hadn't heard in what felt like a lifetime. \"Keep your promise.\" The voice was slipping away, as if the volume was being turned down on a radio. I began to suspect that I was having some kind of hallucination. Triggered, no doubt, by the memory\u2014the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, the strange familiarity of the situation. I ran through the possibilities quickly in my head. Option one: I was crazy. That was the layman's term for people who heard voices in their heads. Possible. Option two: My subconscious mind was giving me what it thought I wanted. This was wish fulfillment\u2014a momentary relief from pain by embracing the incorrect idea that he cared whether I lived or died. Projecting what he would have said if A) he were here, and B) he would be in any way bothered by something bad happening to me. Probable. I could see no option three, so I hoped it was the second option and this was just my subconscious running amuck, rather than something I would need to be hospitalized for. My reaction was hardly sane, though\u2014I was grateful. The sound of his voice was something that I'd feared I was losing, and so, more than anything else, I felt overwhelming gratitude that my unconscious mind had held onto that sound better than my conscious one had. I was not allowed to think of him. That was something I tried to be very strict about. Of course I slipped; I was only human. But I was getting better, and so the pain was something I could avoid for days at a time now. The tradeoff was the never-ending numbness. Between pain and nothing, I'd chosen nothing. I waited for the pain now. I was not numb\u2014my senses felt unusually intense after so many months of the haze\u2014but the normal pain held off. The only ache was the disappointment that his voice was fading. There was a second of choice. The wise thing would be to run away from this potentially destructive\u2014and certainly mentally unstable\u2014development. It would be stupid to encourage hallucinations. But his voice was fading. I took another step forward, testing. \"Bella, turn around,\" he growled. I sighed in relief. The anger was what I wanted to hear\u2014false, fabricated evidence that he cared, a dubious gift from my subconscious. Very few seconds had passed while I sorted this all out. My little audience watched, curious. It probably looked like I was just dithering over whether or not I was going to approach them. How could they guess that I was standing there enjoying an unexpected moment of insanity? \"Hi,\" one of the men called, his tone both confident and a bit sarcastic. He was fair-skinned and fair-haired, and he stood with the assurance of someone who thought of himself as quite good-looking. I couldn't tell whether he was or not. I was prejudiced. The voice in my head answered with an exquisite snarl. I smiled, and the confident man seemed to take that as encouragement. \"Can I help you with something? You look lost.\" He grinned and winked. I stepped carefully over the gutter, running with water that was black in the darkness. \"No. I'm not lost.\" Now that I was closer\u2014and my eyes felt oddly in focus\u2014I analyzed the short, dark man's face. It was not familiar in any way. I suffered a curious sensation of disappointment that this was not the terrible man who had tried to hurt me almost a year ago. The voice in my head was quiet now. The short man noticed my stare. \"Can I buy you a drink?\" he offered, nervous, seeming flattered that I'd singled him out to stare at. \"I'm too young,\" I answered automatically. He was baffled\u00a0 \u2014wondering why I had approached them. I felt compelled to explain. \"From across the street, you looked like someone I knew. Sorry, my mistake.\" The threat that had pulled me across the street had evaporated. These were not the dangerous men I remembered. They were probably nice guys. Safe. I lost interest. \"That's okay,\" the confident blonde said. \"Stay and hang out with us.\" \"Thanks, but I can't.\" Jessica was hesitating in the middle of the street, her eyes wide with outrage and betrayal. \"Oh, just a few minutes.\" I shook my head, and turned to rejoin Jessica. \"Let's go eat,\" I suggested, barely glancing at her. Though I appeared to be, for the moment, freed of the zombie abstraction, I was just as distant. My mind was preoccupied. The safe, numb deadness did not come back, and I got more anxious with every minute that passed without its return. \"What were you thinking?\" Jessica snapped. \"You don't know them\u2014they could have been psychopaths!\" I shrugged, wishing she would let it go. \"I just thought I knew the one guy.\" \"You are so odd, Bella Swan. I feel like I don't know who you are.\" \"Sorry.\" I didn't know what else to say to that. We walked to McDonald's in silence. I'd bet that she was wishing we'd taken her car instead of walking the short distance from the theater, so that she could use the drive-through. She was just as anxious now for this evening to be over as I had been from the beginning. I tried to start a conversation a few times while we ate, but Jessica was not cooperative. I must have really offended her. When we go back in the car, she tuned the stereo back to her favorite station and turned the volume too loud to allow easy conversation. I didn't have to struggle as hard as usual to ignore the music. Even though my mind, for once, was not carefully numb and empty, I had too much to think about to hear the lyrics. I waited for the numbness to return, or the pain. Because the pain must be coming. I'd broken my personal rules. Instead of shying away from the memories, I'd walked forward and greeted them. I'd heard his voice, so clearly, in my head. That was going to cost me, I was sure of it. Especially if I couldn't reclaim the haze to protect myself. I felt too alert, and that frightened me. But relief was still the strongest emotion in my body\u2014relief that came from the very core of my being. As much as I struggled not to think of him, I did not struggle to forget. I worried\u2014late in the night, when the exhaustion of sleep deprivation broke down my defenses\u2014that it was all slipping away. That my mind was a sieve, and I would someday not be able to remember the precise color of his eyes, the feel of his cool skin, or the texture of his voice. I could not think of them, but I must remember them. Because there was just one thing that I had to believe to be able to live\u2014I had to know that he existed. That was all. Everything else I could endure. So long as he existed. That's why I was more trapped in Forks than I ever had been before, why I'd fought with Charlie when he suggested a change. Honestly, it shouldn't matter; no one was ever coming back here. But if I were to go to Jacksonville, or anywhere else bright and unfamiliar, how could I be sure he was real? In a place where I could never imagine him, the conviction might fade\u2026 and that I could not live through. Forbidden to remember, terrified to forget; it was a hard line to walk. I was surprised when Jessica stopped the car in front of my house. The ride had not taken long, but, short as it seemed, I wouldn't have thought that Jessica could go that long without speaking. \"Thanks for going out with me, Jess,\" I said as I opened my door. \"That was\u2026fun.\" I hoped that fun was the appropriate word. \"Sure,\" she muttered. \"I'm sorry about\u2026 after the movie.\" \"Whatever, Bella.\" She glared out the windshield instead of looking at me. She seemed to be growing angrier rather than getting over it. \"See you Monday?\" \"Yeah. Bye.\" I gave up and shut the door. She drove away, still without looking at me. I'd forgotten her by the time I was inside. Charlie was waiting for me in the middle of the hall, his arms folded tight over his chest with his hands balled into fists. \"Hey, Dad,\" I said absentmindedly as I ducked around Charlie, heading for the stairs. I'd been thinking about him for too long, and I wanted to be upstairs before it caught up with me. \"Where have you been?\" Charlie demanded. I looked at my dad, surprised. \"I went to a movie in Port Angeles with Jessica. Like I told you this morning.\" \"Humph,\" he grunted. \"Is that okay?\u201d He studied my face, his eyes widening as if he saw something unexpected. \"Yeah, that's fine. Did you have fun?\" \"Sure,\" I said. \"We watched zombies eat people. It was great.\" His eyes narrowed. \"'Night, Dad.\" He let me pass. I hurried to my room. I lay in my bed a few minutes later, resigned as the pain finally made its appearance. It was a crippling thing, this sensation that a huge hole had been punched through my chest, excising my most vital organs and leaving ragged, unhealed gashes around the edges that continued to throb and bleed despite the passage of time. Rationally, I knew my lungs must still be intact, yet I gasped for air and my head spun like my efforts yielded me nothing. My heart must have been beating, too, but I couldn't hear the sound of my pulse in my ears; my hands felt blue with cold. I curled inward, hugging my ribs to hold myself together. I scrambled for my numbness, my denial, but it evaded me. And yet, I found I could survive. I was alert, I felt the pain\u2014the aching loss that radiated out from my chest, sending wracking waves of hurt through my limbs and head\u2014but it was manageable. I could live through it. It didn't feel like the pain had weakened over time, rather that I'd grown strong enough to bear it. Whatever it was that had happened tonight\u2014and whether it was the zombies, the\u00a0 adrenaline, or the hallucinations that were responsible\u2014it had woken me up. For the first time in a long time, I didn't know what to expect in the morning.",
