            "en": "Suicide    Ethan felt like there was no point going on with life. Things had been tough since his mom died. His dad was working two jobs and seemed frazzled and angry most of the time. Whenever he and Ethan talked, it usually ended in yelling.  Ethan had just found out he'd failed a math test, and he was afraid of how mad and disappointed his dad would be. In the past, he always talked things over with his girlfriend \u2014 the only person who seemed to understand. But they'd broken up the week before, and now Ethan felt he had nowhere to turn. Ethan knew where his dad kept his guns. But as he was unlocking the cabinet, he heard his kid sister arriving home from school. He didn't want Grace to be the person to find him, so he put the gun back and went to watch TV with her instead. Later, when he realized how close he'd come to ending his life, Ethan was terrified. He summoned the courage to talk to his dad. After a long conversation, he realized how much his dad cared. All he could think of was how he'd almost thrown it all away. Why do teens try to kill themselves? Most teens interviewed after making a suicide attempt say that they did it because they were trying to escape from a situation that seemed impossible to deal with or to get relief from really bad thoughts or feelings. Like Ethan, they didn't want to die but they wanted to escape from what was going on. And at that particular moment dying seemed like the only way out. Some people who end their lives or attempt suicide might be trying to escape feelings of rejection, hurt, or loss. Others might be angry, ashamed, or guilty about something. Some people may be worried about disappointing friends or family members. And some may feel unwanted, unloved, victimized, or like they're a burden to others. We all feel overwhelmed by difficult emotions or situations sometimes. But most people get through it or can put their problems in perspective and find a way to carry on with determination and hope. So why does one person try suicide when another person in the same tough situation does not? What makes some people more resilient (better able to deal with life's setbacks and difficulties) than others? What makes a person unable to see another way out of a bad situation besides ending his or her life? The answer to those questions lies in the fact that most people who commit suicide have depression. Depression Depression leads people to focus mostly on failures and disappointments, to emphasize the negative side of their situations, and to <em>downplay</em> their own capabilities or worth. Someone with severe depression is unable to see the possibility of a good outcome and may believe they will never be happy or things will never go right for them again. Depression affects a person's thoughts in such a way that the person doesn't see when a problem can be overcome. It's as if the depression puts a filter on the person's thinking that distorts things. That's why depressed people don't realize that suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem in the same way that other people do. A teen with depression may feel like there's no other way out of problems, no other escape from emotional pain, or no other way to communicate their desperate unhappiness. Sometimes people who feel suicidal may not even realize they are depressed. They are unaware that it is the depression \u2014 not the situation \u2014 that's influencing them to see things in a \"there's no way out,\" \"it will never get better,\" \"there's nothing I can do\" kind of way. When depression lifts because a person gets the proper therapy or treatment, the distorted thinking is cleared. The person can find pleasure, energy, and hope again. But while someone is seriously depressed, suicidal thinking is a real concern. People with a condition called bipolar disorder are also more at risk for suicide because their condition can cause them to go through times when they are extremely depressed as well as times when they have abnormally high or frantic energy (called mania or manic). Both of these extreme phases of bipolar disorder affect and distort a person's mood, outlook, and judgment. For people with this condition, it can be a challenge to keep problems in perspective and act with good judgment. Substance abuse Teens with alcohol and drug problems are also more at risk for suicidal thinking and behavior. Alcohol and some drugs have depressive effects on the brain. Misuse of these substances can bring on serious depression. That's especially true for some teens who already have a tendency to depression because of their biology, family history, or other life stressors. The problem can be made worse because many people who are depressed turn to alcohol or drugs as an escape. But they may not realize that the depressive effects alcohol and drugs have on the brain can actually intensify depression in the long run. In addition to their depressive effects, alcohol and drugs alter a person's judgment. They interfere with the ability to assess risk, make good choices, and think of solutions to problems. Many suicide attempts occur when a person is under the influence of alcohol or drugs. This doesn't mean that everyone who is depressed or who has an alcohol or drug problem will try to kill themselves, of course. But these conditions \u2014 especially both together \u2014 increase a person's risk for suicide. Suicide is not always planned Sometimes a depressed person plans a suicide in advance. Many times, though, suicide attempts happen impulsively, in a moment of feeling desperately upset. A situation like a breakup, a big fight with a parent, an unintended pregnancy, being outed by someone else, or being victimized in any way can cause someone to feel desperately upset. Often, a situation like this, on top of an existing depression, acts like the final straw. Some people who attempt suicide mean to die and some aren't completely sure they want to die. For some, a suicide attempt is a way to express deep emotional pain. They can't say how they feel, so, for them, attempting suicide feels like the only way to get their message across. Sadly, many people who really didn't mean to kill themselves end up dead or critically ill. Warning signs There are often signs that someone may be thinking about or planning a suicide attempt. Here are some of them: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * talking about suicide or death in general \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * talking about \"going away\" \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * referring to things they \"won't be needing,\" and giving away possessions \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * talking about feeling hopeless or feeling guilty \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * pulling away from friends or family and losing the desire to go out \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * having no desire to take part in favorite things or activities \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * having trouble concentrating or thinking clearly \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * experiencing changes in eating or sleeping habits  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * engaging in self-destructive behavior (drinking alcohol, taking drugs, or cutting, for example) What if this is you? If you have been thinking about suicide, get help now. Depression is powerful. You can't wait and hope that your mood might improve. When a person has been feeling down for a long time, it's hard to step back. Talk to someone you trust as soon as you can. If you can't talk to a parent, talk to a coach, a relative, a school counselor, a religious leader, or a teacher. Call a suicide crisis line (such as 1-800-SUICIDE or 1-800-999-9999) or your local emergency number (911). These toll-free lines are staffed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by trained professionals who can help you without ever knowing your name or seeing your face. All calls are confidential \u2014 no one you know will find out that you've called. They are there to help you figure out how to work through tough situations. What if it's someone you know? It is always a good thing to start a conversation with someone you think may be considering suicide. It allows you to get help for the person, and just talking about it may help the person to feel less alone and more cared about and understood. Talking things through may also give the person an opportunity to consider other solutions to problems. Most of the time, people who are considering suicide are willing to talk if someone asks them out of concern and care. Because people who are depressed are not as able to see answers as well as others, it can help to have someone work with them in coming up with at least one other way out of a bad situation. Even if a friend or classmate swears you to secrecy, you must get help as soon as possible \u2014 your friend's life could depend on it. Someone who is seriously thinking about suicide may have sunk so deeply into an emotional hole that the person could be unable to recognize that he or she needs help. Tell an adult you trust as soon as possible.  If necessary, you can also call the toll-free number for a suicide crisis line or a local emergency number (911). You can find local suicide crisis or hotline numbers listed in your phone book. These are confidential resources and the people at any of these places are happy to talk to you to help you figure out what is best to do. Sometimes, teens who make a suicide attempt \u2014 or who die as a result of suicide \u2014 seem to give no clue beforehand. This can leave loved ones feeling not only grief stricken but guilty and wondering if they missed something. It is important for family members and friends of those who die by suicide to know that sometimes there is no warning and they should not blame themselves.\u00a0\u00a0  When someone dies by suicide the people left behind can wrestle with a terrible emotional pain. Teens who have had a recent loss or crisis or who had a family member or classmate who committed suicide may be especially vulnerable to suicidal thinking and behavior themselves. If you've been close to someone who has attempted or committed suicide, it can help to talk with a therapist or counselor \u2014 someone who is trained in dealing with this complex issue. Or, you could join a group for survivors where you can share your feelings and get the support of people who have been in the same situation as you. Coping with problems Being a teen is not easy. There are many social, academic, and personal pressures. And for teens who have additional problems to deal with, such as living in violent or abusive environments, life can feel even more difficult. Some teens worry about sexuality and relationships, wondering if their feelings and attractions are normal, or if they will be loved and accepted. Others struggle with body image and eating problems; trying to reach an impossible ideal leaves them feeling bad about themselves. Some teens have learning problems or attention problems that make it hard for them to succeed in school. They may feel disappointed in themselves or feel they are a disappointment to others. These problems can be difficult and draining \u2014 and can lead to depression if they go on too long without relief or support. We all struggle with painful problems and events at times. How do people get through it without becoming depressed? Part of it is staying connected to family, friends, school, faith, and other support networks. People are better able to deal with tough circumstances when they have at least one person who believes in them, wants the best for them, and in whom they can confide. People also cope better when they keep in mind that most problems are temporary and can be overcome. When struggling with problems, it helps to: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Tell someone you trust what's going on with you. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Be around people who are caring and positive. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Ask someone to help you figure out what to do about a problem you're facing. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Work with a therapist or counselor if problems are getting you down and depressed \u2014 or if you don't have a strong support network, or feel you can't cope. Counselors and therapists can provide emotional support and can help teens build their own coping skills for dealing with problems. It can also help to join a support network for people who are going through the same problems \u2014 for example, anorexia and body image issues, living with an alcoholic family member, or sexuality and sexual health concerns. These groups can help provide a caring environment where you can talk through problems with people who share your concerns. Check out your phone book to find local support groups, or ask a school counselor or a youth group leader to help you find what you need.",

            "en": "3. MOTIVES THE SUN WAS SO DEEPLY BURIED BEHIND THE CLOUDS that there was no way to tell if it had set or not. After the long flight \u2014 chasing the sun westward so that it seemed unmoving in the sky \u2014 it was especially disorienting; time seemed oddly variable. It took me by surprise when the forest gave way to the first buildings, signaling that we were nearly home. \u201cYou\u2019ve been very quiet,\u201d Edward observed. \u201cDid the plane make you sick?\u201d \u201cNo, I\u2019m okay.\u201d \u201cAre you sad to leave?\u201d \u201cMore relieved than sad, I think.\u201d He raised one eyebrow at me. I knew it was useless and \u2014 much as I hated to admit it \u2014 unnecessary to ask him to keep his eyes on the road. \u201cRen\u00e9e is so much more . . .perceptive than Charlie in some ways. It was making me jumpy.\u201d Edward laughed. \u201cYour mother has a very interesting mind. Almost childlike, but very insightful. She sees things differently than other people.\u201d Insightful. It was a good description of my mother \u2014 when she was paying attention. Most of the time Ren\u00e9e was so bewildered by her own life that she didn\u2019t notice much else. But this weekend she\u2019d been paying plenty of attention to me. Phil was busy \u2014 the high school baseball team he coached was in the playoffs \u2014 and being alone with Edward and me had only sharpened Ren\u00e9e\u2019s focus. As soon as the hugs and squeals of delight were out of the way, Ren\u00e9e began to watch. And as she\u2019d watched, her wide blue eyes had become first confused and then concerned. This morning we\u2019d gone for a walk along the beach. She wanted to show off all the beauties of her new home, still hoping, I think, that the sun might lure me away from Forks. She\u2019d also wanted to talk with me alone, and that was easily arranged. Edward had fabricated a term paper to give himself an excuse to stay indoors during the day. In my head, I went through the conversation again. . . . Ren\u00e9e and I ambled along the sidewalk, trying to stay in the range of the infrequent palm tree shadows. Though it was early, the heat was smothering. The air was so heavy with moisture that just breathing in and out was giving my lungs a workout. \u201cBella?\u201d my mother asked, looking out past the sand to the lightly crashing waves as she spoke. \u201cWhat is it, Mom?\u201d She sighed, not meeting my gaze. \u201cI\u2019m worried. . . .\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked, anxious at once. \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not me.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m worried about you . . . and Edward.\u201d Ren\u00e9e finally looked at me when she said his name, her face apologetic. \u201cOh,\u201d I mumbled, fixing my eyes on a pair of joggers as they passed us, drenched with sweat. \u201cYou two are more serious than I\u2019d been thinking,\u201d she went on. I frowned, quickly reviewing the last two days in my head. Edward and I had barely touched \u2014 in front of her, at least. I wondered if Ren\u00e9e was about to give me a lecture on responsibility, too. I didn\u2019t mind that the way I had with Charlie. It wasn\u2019t embarrassing with my mom. After all, I\u2019d been the one giving her that lecture time and time again in the last ten years. \u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s something . . . strange about the way you two are together,\u201d she murmured, her forehead creasing over her troubled eyes. \u201cThe way he watches you \u2014 it\u2019s so . . . protective. Like he\u2019s about to throw himself in front of a bullet to save you or something.\u201d I laughed, though I was still not able to meet her gaze. \u201cThat\u2019s a bad thing?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d She frowned as she struggled for the words. \u201cIt\u2019s just different . He\u2019s very intense about you . . . and very careful. I feel like I don\u2019t really understand your relationship. Like there\u2019s some secret I\u2019m missing. . . .\u201d \u201cI think you\u2019re imagining things, Mom,\u201d I said quickly, struggling to keep my voice light. There was a flutter in my stomach. I\u2019d forgotten how much my mother saw . Something about her simple view of the world cut through all the distractions and pierced right to the truth of things. This had never been a problem before. Until now, there had never been a secret I couldn\u2019t tell her. \u201cIt\u2019s not just him.\u201d She set her lips defensively. \u201cI wish you could see how you move around him.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u00a0\u201cThe way you move \u2014 you orient yourself around him without even thinking about it. When he moves, even a little bit, you adjust your position at the same time. Like magnets . . . or gravity. You\u2019re like a . . . satellite, or something. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d She pursed her lips and stared down. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me,\u201d I teased, forcing a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re reading mysteries again, aren\u2019t you? Or is it sci-fi this time?\u201d Ren\u00e9e flushed a delicate pink. \u201cThat\u2019s beside the point.\u201d \u201cFound anything good?\u201d \u201cWell, there was one \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t matter. We\u2019re talking about you right now.\u201d \u201cYou should stick to romance, Mom. You know how you freak yourself out.\u201d Her lips turned up at the corners. \u201cI\u2019m being silly, aren\u2019t I?\u201d For half a second I couldn\u2019t answer. Ren\u00e9e was so easily swayed. Sometimes it was a good thing, because not all of her ideas were practical. But it pained me to see how quickly she caved in to my trivializing, especially since she was dead right this time. She looked up, and I controlled my expression. \u201cNot silly \u2014 just being a mom.\u201d She laughed and then gestured grandly toward the white sands stretching to the blue water. \u201cAnd all this isn\u2019t enough to get you to move back in with your silly mom?\u201d I wiped my hand dramatically across my forehead, and then pretended to wring my hair out. \u201cYou get used to the humidity,\u201d she promised. \u201cYou can get used to rain, too,\u201d I countered. She elbowed me playfully and then took my hand as we walked back to her car. Other than her worries about me, she seemed happy enough. Content. She still looked at Phil with goo-goo eyes, and that was comforting. Surely her life was full and satisfying. Surely she didn\u2019t miss me that much, even now. . . . Edward\u2019s icy fingers brushed my cheek. I looked up, blinking, coming back to the present. He leaned down and kissed my forehead. \u201cWe\u2019re home, Sleeping Beauty. Time to awake.\u201d We were stopped in front of Charlie\u2019s house. The porch light was on and the cruiser was parked in the driveway. As I examined the house, I saw the curtain twitch in the living room window, flashing a line of yellow light across the dark lawn. I sighed. Of course Charlie was waiting to pounce. Edward must have been thinking the same thing, because his expression was stiff and his eyes remote as he came to get my door for me. \u201cHow bad?\u201d I asked. \u201cCharlie\u2019s not going to be difficult,\u201d Edward promised, his voice level with no hint of humor. \u201cHe missed you.\u201d My eyes narrowed in doubt. If that was the case, then why was Edward tensed as if for a battle? My bag was small, but he insisted on carrying it into the house. Charlie held the door open for us. \u201cWelcome home, kid!\u201d Charlie shouted like he really meant it. \u201cHow was Jacksonville?\u201d \u201cMoist. And buggy.\u201d \u201cSo Ren\u00e9e didn\u2019t sell you on the University of Florida?\u201d \u201cShe tried. But I\u2019d rather drink water than inhale it.\u201d Charlie\u2019s eyes flickered unwillingly to Edward. \u201cDid you have a nice time?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d Edward answered in a serene voice. \u201cRen\u00e9e was very hospitable.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s . . . um, good. Glad you had fun.\u201d Charlie turned away from Edward and pulled me in for an unexpected hug. \u201cImpressive,\u201d I whispered in his ear. He rumbled a laugh. \u201cI really missed you, Bells. The food around here sucks when you\u2019re gone.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll get on it,\u201d I said as he let me go. \u201cWould you call Jacob first? He\u2019s been bugging me every five minutes since six o\u2019clock this morning. I promised I\u2019d have you call him before you even unpacked.\u201d I didn\u2019t have to look at Edward to feel that he was too still, too cold beside me. So this was the cause of his tension. \u201cJacob wants to talk to me?\u201d \u201cPretty bad, I\u2019d say. He wouldn\u2019t tell me what it was about \u2014 just said it was important.\u201d The phone rang then, shrill and demanding. \u201cThat\u2019s him again, I\u2019d bet my next paycheck,\u201d Charlie muttered. \u201cI got it.\u201d I hurried to the kitchen. Edward followed after me while Charlie disappeared into the living room. I grabbed the phone mid-ring, and twisted around so that I was facing the wall. \u201cHello?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re back,\u201d Jacob said. His familiar husky voice sent a wave of wistfulness through me. A thousand memories spun in my head, tangling together \u2014 a rocky beach strewn with driftwood trees, a garage made of plastic sheds, warm sodas in a paper bag, a tiny room with one too-small shabby loveseat. The laughter in his deep-set black eyes, the feverish heat of his big hand around mine, the flash of his white teeth against his dark skin, his face stretching into the wide smile that had always been like a key to a secret door where only kindred spirits could enter. It felt sort of like homesickness, this longing for the place and person who had sheltered me through my darkest night. I cleared the lump from my throat. \u201cYes,\u201d I answered. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call me?\u201d Jacob demanded. His angry tone instantly got my back up. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve been in the house for exactly four seconds and your call interrupted Charlie telling me that you\u2019d called.\u201d \u201cOh. Sorry.\u201d \u201cSure. Now, why are you harassing Charlie?\u201d \u201cI need to talk to you.\u201d \u201cYeah, I figured out that part all by myself. Go ahead.\u201d There was a short pause. \u201cYou going to school tomorrow?\u201d I frowned to myself, unable to make sense of this question. \u201cOf course I am. Why wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d \u201cI dunno. Just curious.\u201d Another pause. \u201cSo what did you want to talk about, Jake?\u201d He hesitated. \u201cNothing really, I guess. I . . . wanted to hear your voice.\u201d \u201cYeah, I know. I\u2019m so glad you called me, Jake. I . . .\u201d But I didn\u2019t know what more to say. I wanted to tell him I was on my way to La Push right now. And I couldn\u2019t tell him that. \u201cI have to go,\u201d he said abruptly. \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you soon, okay?\u201d \u201cBut Jake \u2014\u201d He was already gone. I listened to the dial tone with disbelief. \u201cThat was short,\u201d I muttered. \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d Edward asked. His voice was low and careful. I turned slowly to face him. His expression was perfectly smooth \u2014 impossible to read. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I wonder what that was about.\u201d It didn\u2019t make sense that Jacob had been hounding Charlie all day just to ask me if I was going to school. And if he\u2019d wanted to hear my voice, then why did he hang up so quickly? \u201cYour guess is probably better than mine,\u201d Edward said, the hint of a smile tugging at the corner of his mouth. \u201cMmm,\u201d I murmured. That was true. I knew Jake inside and out. It shouldn\u2019t be that complicated to figure out his motivations. With my thoughts miles away \u2014 about fifteen miles away, up the road to La Push \u2014 I started combing through the fridge, assembling ingredients for Charlie\u2019s dinner. Edward leaned against the counter, and I was distantly aware that his eyes were on my face, but too preoccupied to worry about what he saw there. The school thing seemed like the key to me. That was the only real question Jake had asked. And he had to be after an answer to something, or he wouldn\u2019t have been bugging Charlie so persistently. Why would my attendance record matter to him, though? I tried to think about it in a logical way. So, if I hadn\u2019t been going to school tomorrow, what would be the problem with that, from Jacob\u2019s perspective? Charlie had given me a little grief about missing a day of school so close to finals, but I\u2019d convinced him that one Friday wasn\u2019t going to derail my studies. Jake would hardly care about that. My brain refused to come up with any brilliant insights. Maybe I was missing some vital piece of information. What could have changed in the past three days that was so important that Jacob would break his long streak of refusing to answer my phone calls and contact me? What difference could three days make? I froze in the middle of the kitchen. The package of icy hamburger in my hands slipped through my numb fingers. It took me a slow second to miss the thud it should have made against the floor. Edward had caught it and thrown it onto the counter. His arms were already around me, his lips at my ear. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I shook my head, dazed. Three days could change everything. Hadn\u2019t I just been thinking about how impossible college was? How I couldn\u2019t be anywhere near people after I\u2019d gone through the painful three-day conversion that would set me free from mortality, so that I could spend eternity with Edward? The conversion that would make me forever a prisoner to my own thirst. . . . Had Charlie told Billy that I\u2019d vanished for three days? Had Billy jumped to conclusions? Had Jacob really been asking me if I was still human? Making sure that the werewolves\u2019 treaty was unbroken \u2014 that none of the Cullens had dared to bite a human . . . bite, not kill . . . ? But did he honestly think I would come home to Charlie if that was the case? Edward shook me. \u201cBella?\u201d he asked, truly anxious now. \u201cI think . . . I think he was checking,\u201d I mumbled. \u201cChecking to make sure. That I\u2019m human, I mean.\u201d Edward stiffened, and a low hiss sounded in my ear. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to leave,\u201d I whispered. \u201cBefore. So that it doesn\u2019t break the treaty. We won\u2019t ever be able to come back.\u201d His arms tightened around me. \u201cI know.\u201d \u201cAhem.\u201d Charlie cleared his voice loudly behind us. I jumped, and then pulled free of Edward\u2019s arms, my face getting hot. Edward leaned back against the counter. His eyes were tight. I could see worry in them, and anger. \u00a0\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to make dinner, I can call for a pizza,\u201d Charlie hinted. \u201cNo, that\u2019s okay, I\u2019m already started.\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d Charlie said. He propped himself against the doorframe, folding his arms. I sighed and got to work, trying to ignore my audience. \u201cIf I asked you to do something, would you trust me?\u201d Edward asked, an edge to his soft voice. We were almost to school. Edward had been relaxed and joking just a moment ago, and now suddenly his hands were clenched tight on the steering wheel, his knuckles straining in an effort not to snap it into pieces. I stared at his anxious expression \u2014 his eyes were far away, like he was listening to distant voices. My pulse sped in response to his stress, but I answered carefully. \u201cThat depends.\u201d We pulled into the school lot. \u201cI was afraid you would say that.\u201d \u201cWhat do you want me to do, Edward?\u201d \u201cI want you to stay in the car.\u201d He pulled into his usual spot and turned the engine off as he spoke. \u201cI want you to wait here until I come back for you.\u201d \u201cBut . . .why ?\u201d That was when I saw him. He would have been hard to miss, towering over the students the way he did, even if he hadn\u2019t been leaning against his black motorcycle, parked illegally on the sidewalk. \u201cOh.\u201d Jacob\u2019s face was a calm mask that I recognized well. It was the face he used when he was determined to keep his emotions in check, to keep himself under control. It made him look like Sam, the oldest of the wolves, the leader of the Quileute pack. But Jacob could never quite manage the perfect serenity Sam always exuded. I\u2019d forgotten how much this face bothered me. Though I\u2019d gotten to know Sam pretty well before the Cullens had come back \u2014 to like him, even \u2014 I\u2019d never been able to completely shake the resentment I felt when Jacob mimicked Sam\u2019s expression. It was a stranger\u2019s face. He wasn\u2019t my Jacob when he wore it. \u201cYou jumped to the wrong conclusion last night,\u201d Edward murmured. \u201cHe asked about school because he knew that I would be where you were. He was looking for a safe place to talk to me. A place with witnesses.\u201d So I\u2019d misinterpreted Jacob\u2019s motives last night. Missing information, that was the problem. Information like why in the world Jacob would want to talk to Edward. \u201cI\u2019m not staying in the car,\u201d I said. Edward groaned quietly. \u201cOf course not. Well, let\u2019s get this over with.\u201d Jacob\u2019s face hardened as we walked toward him, hand in hand. I noticed other faces, too \u2014 the faces of my classmates. I noticed how their eyes widened as they took in all six foot seven inches of Jacob\u2019s long body, muscled up the way no normal sixteen-and-a-half-year-old ever had been. I saw those eyes rake over his tight black t-shirt \u2014 short-sleeved, though the day was unseasonably cool \u2014 his ragged, grease-smeared jeans, and the glossy black bike he leaned against. Their eyes didn\u2019t linger on his face \u2014 something about his expression had them glancing quickly away. And I noticed the wide berth everyone gave him, the bubble of space that no one dared to encroach on. With a sense of astonishment, I realized that Jacob looked dangerous to them. How odd. Edward stopped a few yards away from Jacob, and I could tell that he was uncomfortable having me so close to a werewolf. He drew his hand back slightly, pulling me halfway behind his body. \u201cYou could have called us,\u201d Edward said in a steel-hard voice. \u201cSorry,\u201d Jacob answered, his face twisting into a sneer. \u201cI don\u2019t have any leeches on my speed dial.\u201d \u201cYou could have reached me at Bella\u2019s house, of course.\u201d Jacob\u2019s jaw flexed, and his brows pulled together. He didn\u2019t answer. \u201cThis is hardly the place, Jacob. Could we discuss this later?\u201d \u201cSure, sure. I\u2019ll stop by your crypt after school.\u201d Jacob snorted. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with now?\u201d Edward looked around pointedly, his eyes resting on the witnesses who were just barely out of hearing range. A few people were hesitating on the sidewalk, their eyes bright with expectation. Like they were hoping a fight might break out to alleviate the tedium of another Monday morning. I saw Tyler Crowley nudge Austin Marks, and they both paused on their way to class. \u201cI already know what you came to say,\u201d Edward reminded Jacob in voice so low that I could barely make it out. \u201cMessage delivered. Consider us warned.\u201d Edward glanced down at me for a fleeting second with worried eyes. \u201cWarned?\u201d I asked blankly. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell her?\u201d Jacob asked, his eyes widening with disbelief. \u201cWhat, were you afraid she\u2019d take our side?\u201d \u201cPlease drop it, Jacob,\u201d Edward said in an even voice. \u201cWhy?\u201d Jacob challenged. I frowned in confusion. \u201cWhat don\u2019t I know? Edward?\u201d Edward just glared at Jacob as if he hadn\u2019t heard me. \u201cJake?\u201d Jacob raised his eyebrow at me. \u201cHe didn\u2019t tell you that his big . . .brother crossed the line Saturday night?\u201d he asked, his tone thickly layered with sarcasm. Then his eyes flickered back to Edward. \u201cPaul was totally justified in \u2014\u201d \u201cIt was no-man\u2019s land!\u201d Edward hissed. \u201cWas not!\u201d Jacob was fuming visibly. His hands trembled. He shook his head and sucked in two deep lungfuls of air. \u201cEmmett and Paul?\u201d I whispered. Paul was Jacob\u2019s most volatile pack brother. He was the one who\u2019d lost control that day in the woods \u2014 the memory of the snarling gray wolf was suddenly vivid in my head. \u201cWhat happened? Were they fighting?\u201d My voice strained higher in panic. \u201cWhy? Did Paul get hurt?\u201d \u201cNo one fought,\u201d Edward said quietly, only to me. \u201cNo one got hurt. Don\u2019t be anxious.\u201d Jacob was staring at us with incredulous eyes. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell her anything at all, did you? Is that why you took her away? So she wouldn\u2019t know that \u2014?\u201d \u201cLeave now.\u201d Edward cut him off mid-sentence, and his face was abruptly frightening \u2014 truly frightening. For a second, he looked like . . . like a vampire . He glared at Jacob with vicious, unveiled loathing. Jacob raised his eyebrows, but made no other move. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you told her?\u201d They faced each other in silence for a long moment. More students gathered behind Tyler and Austin. I saw Mike next to Ben \u2014 Mike had one hand on Ben\u2019s shoulder, like he was holding him in place. In the dead silence, all the details suddenly fell into place for me with a burst of intuition. Something Edward didn\u2019t want me to know. Something that Jacob wouldn\u2019t have kept from me. Something that had the Cullens and the wolves both in the woods, moving in hazardous proximity to each other. Something that would cause Edward to insist that I fly across the country. Something that Alice had seen in a vision last week \u2014 a vision Edward had lied to me about. Something I\u2019d been waiting for anyway. Something I knew would happen again, as much as I might wish it never would. It was never going to end, was it? I heard the quick gasp, gasp, gasp, gasp of the air dragging through my lips, but I couldn\u2019t stop it. It looked like the school was shaking, like there was an earthquake, but I knew it was my own trembling that caused the illusion. \u201cShe came back for me,\u201d I choked out. Victoria was never going to give up till I was dead. She would keep repeating the same pattern \u2014 feint and run, feint and run \u2014 until she found a hole through my defenders. Maybe I\u2019d get lucky. Maybe the Volturi would come for me first \u2014 they\u2019d kill me quicker, at least. Edward held me tight to his side, angling his body so that he was still between me and Jacob, and stroked my face with anxious hands. \u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he whispered to me. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll never let her get close to you, it\u2019s fine.\u201d Then he glared at Jacob. \u201cDoes that answer your question, mongrel?\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t think Bella has a right to know?\u201d Jacob challenged. \u201cIt\u2019s her life.\u201d Edward kept his voice muted; even Tyler, edging forward by inches, would be unable to hear. \u201cWhy should she be frightened when she was never in danger?\u201d \u201cBetter frightened than lied to.\u201d I tried to pull myself together, but my eyes were swimming in moisture. I could see it behind my lids \u2014 I could see Victoria\u2019s face, her lips pulled back over her teeth, her crimson eyes glowing with the obsession of her vendetta; she held Edward responsible for the demise of her love, James. She wouldn\u2019t stop until his love was taken from him, too. Edward wiped the tears from my cheek with his fingertips. \u201cDo you really think hurting her is better than protecting her?\u201d he murmured. \u201cShe\u2019s tougher than you think,\u201d Jacob said. \u201cAnd she\u2019s been through worse.\u201d Abruptly, Jacob\u2019s expression shifted, and he was staring at Edward with an odd, speculative expression. His eyes narrowed like he was trying to do a difficult math problem in his head. I felt Edward cringe. I glanced up at him, and his face was contorted in what could only be pain. For one ghastly moment, I was reminded of our afternoon in Italy, in the macabre tower room of the Volturi, where Jane had tortured Edward with her malignant gift, burning him with her thoughts alone. . . . The memory snapped me out of my near hysteria and put everything in perspective. Because I\u2019d rather Victoria killed me a hundred times over than watch Edward suffer that way again. \u201cThat\u2019s funny,\u201d Jacob said, laughing as he watched Edward\u2019s face. Edward winced, but smoothed his expression with a little effort. He couldn\u2019t quite hide the agony in his eyes. I glanced, wide-eyed, from Edward\u2019s grimace to Jacob\u2019s sneer. \u201cWhat are you doing to him?\u201d I demanded. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, Bella,\u201d Edward told me quietly. \u201cJacob just has a good memory, that\u2019s all.\u201d Jacob grinned, and Edward winced again. \u201cStop it! Whatever you\u2019re doing.\u201d \u201cSure, if you want.\u201d Jacob shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s his own fault if he doesn\u2019t like the things I remember, though.\u201d I glared at him, and he smiled back impishly \u2014 like a kid caught doing something he knows he shouldn\u2019t by someone who he knows won\u2019t punish him. \u201cThe principal\u2019s on his way to discourage loitering on school property,\u201d Edward murmured to me. \u201cLet\u2019s get to English, Bella, so you\u2019re not involved.\u201d \u201cOverprotective, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Jacob said, talking just to me. \u201cA little trouble makes life fun. Let me guess, you\u2019re not allowed to have fun, are you?\u201d Edward glowered, and his lips pulled back from his teeth ever so slightly. \u201cShut up, Jake,\u201d I said. Jacob laughed. \u201cThat sounds like a no . Hey, if you ever feel like having a life again, you could come see me. I\u2019ve still got your motorcycle in my garage.\u201d \u1eea  This news distracted me. \u201cYou were supposed to sell that. You promised Charlie you would.\u201d If I hadn\u2019t begged on Jake\u2019s behalf \u2014 after all, he\u2019d put weeks of labor into both motorcycles, and he deserved some kind of payback \u2014 Charlie would have thrown my bike in a Dumpster. And possibly set that Dumpster on fire. \u201cYeah, right. Like I would do that. It belongs to you, not me. Anyway, I\u2019ll hold on to it until you want it back.\u201d A tiny hint of the smile I remembered was suddenly playing around the edges of his lips. \u201cJake . . .\u201d He leaned forward, his face earnest now, the bitter sarcasm fading. \u201cI think I might have been wrong before, you know, about not being able to be friends. Maybe we could manage it, on my side of the line.\u00a0 Come see me.\u201d I was vividly conscious of Edward, his arms still wrapped protectively around me, motionless as a stone. I shot a look at his face \u2014 it was calm, patient. \u201cI, er, don\u2019t know about that, Jake.\u201d Jacob dropped the antagonistic fa\u00e7ade completely. It was like he\u2019d forgotten Edward was there, or at least he was determined to act that way. \u201cI miss you every day, Bella. It\u2019s not the same without you.\u201d \u201cI know and I\u2019m sorry, Jake, I just . . .\u201d He shook his head, and sighed. \u201cI know. Doesn\u2019t matter, right? I guess I\u2019ll survive or something. Who needs friends?\u201d He grimaced, trying to cover the pain with a thin attempt at bravado. Jacob\u2019s suffering had always triggered my protective side. It was not entirely rational \u2014 Jacob was hardly in need of any physical protection I could offer. But my arms, pinned beneath Edward\u2019s, yearned to reach out to him. To wrap around his big, warm waist in a silent promise of acceptance and comfort. Edward\u2019s shielding arms had become restraints. \u201cOkay, get to class,\u201d a stern voice sounded behind us. \u201cMove along, Mr. Crowley.\u201d \u201cGet to school, Jake,\u201d I whispered, anxious as soon as I recognized the principal\u2019s voice. Jacob went to the Quileute school, but he might still get in trouble for trespassing or the equivalent. Edward released me, taking just my hand and pulling me behind his body again. Mr. Greene pushed through the circle of spectators, his brows pressing down like ominous storm clouds over his small eyes. \u201cI mean it,\u201d he was threatening. \u201cDetention for anyone who\u2019s still standing here when I turn around again.\u201d The audience melted away before he was finished with his sentence. \u201cAh, Mr. Cullen. Do we have a problem here?\u201d \u201cNot at all, Mr. Greene. We were just on our way to class.\u201d \u201cExcellent. I don\u2019t seem to recognize your friend.\u201d Mr. Greene turned his glower on Jacob. \u201cAre you a new student here?\u201d Mr. Greene\u2019s eyes scrutinized Jacob, and I could see that he\u2019d come to the same conclusion everyone else had: dangerous. A troublemaker. \u201cNope,\u201d Jacob answered, half a smirk on his broad lips. \u201cThen I suggest you remove yourself from school property at once, young man, before I call the police.\u201d Jacob\u2019s little smirk became a full-blown grin, and I knew he was picturing Charlie showing up to arrest him. This grin was too bitter, too full of mocking to satisfy me. This wasn\u2019t the smile I\u2019d been waiting to see. Jacob said, \u201cYes, sir,\u201d and snapped a military salute before he climbed on his bike and kicked it to a start right there on the sidewalk. The engine snarled and then the tires squealed as he spun it sharply around. In a matter of seconds, Jacob raced out of sight. Mr. Greene gnashed his teeth together while he watched the performance. \u201cMr. Cullen, I expect you to ask your friend to refrain from trespassing again.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s no friend of mine, Mr. Greene, but I\u2019ll pass along the warning.\u201d Mr. Greene pursed his lips. Edward\u2019s perfect grades and spotless record were clearly a factor in Mr. Greene\u2019s assessment of the incident. \u201cI see. If you\u2019re worried about any trouble, I\u2019d be happy to \u2014\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to worry about, Mr. Greene. There won\u2019t be any trouble.\u201d \u201cI hope that\u2019s correct. Well, then. On to class. You, too, Miss Swan.\u201d Edward nodded, and pulled me quickly along toward the English building. \u201cDo you feel well enough to go to class?\u201d he whispered when we were past the principal. \u201cYes,\u201d I whispered back, not quite sure if this was a lie. Whether I felt well or not was hardly the most important consideration. I needed to talk to Edward right away, and English class wasn\u2019t the ideal place for the conversation I had in mind. But with Mr. Greene right behind us, there weren\u2019t a lot of other options. We got to class a little late and took our seats quickly. Mr. Berty was reciting a Frost poem. He ignored our entrance, refusing to let us break his rhythm. I yanked a blank page out of my notebook and started writing, my handwriting more illegible than normal thanks to my agitation. What happened? Tell me everything . And screw the protecting me crap, please. I shoved the note at Edward. He sighed, and then began writing. It took him less time than me, though he wrote an entire paragraph in his own personal calligraphy before he slipped the paper back. Alice saw that Victoria was coming back. I took you out of town merely as a precaution \u2014 there was never a chance that she would have gotten anywhere close to you. Emmett and Jasper very nearly had her, but Victoria seems to have some instinct for evasion. She escaped right down the Quileute boundary line as if she were reading it from a map. It didn\u2019t help that Alice\u2019s abilities were nullified by the Quileutes\u2019 involvement. To be fair, the Quileutes might have had her, too, if we hadn\u2019t gotten in the way. The big gray one thought Emmett was over the line, and he got defensive. Of course Rosalie reacted to that, and everyone left the chase to protect their companions. Carlisle and Jasper got things calmed down before it got out of hand. But by then, Victoria had slipped away. That\u2019s everything.  I frowned at the letters on the page. All of them had been in on it \u2014 Emmett, Jasper, Alice, Rosalie, and Carlisle. Maybe even Esme, though he hadn\u2019t mentioned her. And then Paul and the rest of the Quileute pack. It might so easily have turned into a fight, pitting my future family and my old friends against each other. Any one of them could have been hurt. I imagined the wolves would be in the most danger, but picturing tiny Alice next to one of the huge werewolves, fighting . . . I shuddered. Carefully, I scrubbed out the entire paragraph with my eraser and then I wrote over the top:\u00a0  What about Charlie? She could have been after him. Edward was shaking his head before I finished, obviously going to <em>downplay</em> any danger on Charlie\u2019s behalf. He held a hand out, but I ignored that and started again. You can\u2019t know that she wasn\u2019t thinking that, because you weren\u2019t here. Florida was a bad idea. He took the paper from underneath my hand. I wasn\u2019t about to send you off alone. With your luck, not even the black box would survive. That wasn\u2019t what I\u2019d meant at all; I hadn\u2019t thought of going without him. I\u2019d meant that we should have stayed here together. But I was sidetracked by his response, and a little miffed. Like I couldn\u2019t fly cross country without bringing the plane down. Very funny. So let\u2019s say my bad luck did crash the plane. What exactly were you going to do about it? Why is the plane crashing? He was trying to hide a smile now. The pilots are passed out drunk. Easy. I\u2019d fly the plane. Of course. I pursed my lips and tried again. Both engines have exploded and we\u2019re falling in a death spiral toward the earth. I\u2019d wait till we were close enough to the ground, get a good grip on you, kick out the wall, and jump. Then I\u2019d run you back to the scene of the accident, and we\u2019d stumble around like the two luckiest survivors in history. I stared at him wordlessly. \u201cWhat?\u201d he whispered. I shook my head in awe. \u201cNothing,\u201d I mouthed. I scrubbed out the disconcerting conversation and wrote one more line. You will tell me next time. I knew there would be a next time. The pattern would continue until someone lost. Edward stared into my eyes for a long moment. I wondered what my face looked like \u2014 it felt cold, so the blood hadn\u2019t returned to my cheeks. My eyelashes were still wet. He sighed and then nodded once. Thanks. The paper disappeared from under my hand. I looked up, blinking in surprise, just as Mr. Berty came down the aisle. \u201cIs that something you\u2019d like to share there, Mr. Cullen?\u201d Edward looked up innocently and held out the sheet of paper on top of his folder. \u201cMy notes?\u201d he asked, sounding confused. Mr. Berty scanned the notes \u2014 no doubt a perfect transcription of his lecture \u2014 and then walked away frowning. It was later, in Calculus \u2014 my one class without Edward \u2014 that I heard the gossip. \u201cMy money\u2019s on the big Indian,\u201d someone was saying. I peeked up to see that Tyler, Mike, Austin, and Ben had their heads bent together, deep in conversation. \u201cYeah,\u201d Mike whispered. \u201cDid you see the size of that Jacob kid? I think he could take Cullen down.\u201d Mike sounded pleased by the idea. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Ben disagreed. \u201cThere\u2019s something about Edward. He\u2019s always so . . . confident. I have a feeling he can take care of himself.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m with Ben,\u201d Tyler agreed. \u201cBesides, if that other kid messed Edward up, you know those big brothers of his would get involved.\u201d \u201cHave you been down to La Push lately?\u201d Mike asked. \u201cLauren and I went to the beach a couple of weeks ago, and believe me, Jacob\u2019s friends are all just as big as he is.\u201d \u201cHuh,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cToo bad it didn\u2019t turn into anything. Guess we\u2019ll never know how it would have turned out.\u201d \u201cIt didn\u2019t look over to me,\u201d Austin said. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll get to see.\u201d Mike grinned. \u201cAnyone in the mood for a bet?\u201d \u201cTen on Jacob,\u201d Austin said at once. \u201cTen on Cullen,\u201d Tyler chimed in. \u201cTen on Edward,\u201d Ben agreed. \u201cJacob,\u201d Mike said. \u201cHey, do you guys know what it was about?\u201d Austin wondered. \u201cThat might affect the odds.\u201d \u201cI can guess,\u201d Mike said, and then he shot a glance at me at the same time that Ben and Tyler did. From their expressions, none of them had realized I was in easy hearing distance. They all looked away quickly, shuffling the papers on their desks. \u201cI still say Jacob,\u201d Mike muttered under his breath.",
