Isn\u2019t it getting any better?\u201d His warm hand curled around mine. \u201cIt\u2019s not so bad,\u201d he said, but he wouldn\u2019t meet my eyes. He walked slowly back to the driftwood bench, staring at the rainbow-colored pebbles, and pulling me along at his side. I sat back down on our tree, but he sat on the wet, rocky ground rather than next to me. I wondered if it was so that he could hide his face more easily. He kept my hand. I started babbling to fill the silence. \u201cIt\u2019s been so long since I was here. I\u2019ve probably missed a ton of things. How are Sam and Emily? And Embry? Did Quil \u2014?\u201d I broke off mid-sentence, remembering that Jacob\u2019s friend Quil had been a sensitive subject. \u201cAh, Quil,\u201d Jacob sighed. So then it must have happened \u2014 Quil must have joined the pack. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I mumbled. To my surprise, Jacob snorted. \u201cDon\u2019t say that to him.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cQuil\u2019s not looking for pity. Just the opposite \u2014 he\u2019s jazzed. Totally thrilled.\u201d This made no sense to me. All the other wolves had been so depressed at the idea of their friend sharing their fate. \u201cHuh?\u201d Jacob tilted his head back to look at me. He smiled and rolled his eyes.    \u201cQuil thinks it\u2019s the coolest thing that\u2019s ever happened to him. Part of it is finally knowing what\u2019s going on. And he\u2019s excited to have his friends back \u2014 to be part of the \u2018in crowd.\u2019\u201d Jacob snorted again. \u201cShouldn\u2019t be surprised, I guess. It\u2019s so Quil.\u201d \u201cHe likes it?\u201d \u201cHonestly . . . most of them do,\u201d Jacob admitted slowly. \u201cThere are definitely good sides to this \u2014 the speed, the freedom, the strength . . . the sense of \u2014 of family . . . . Sam and I are the only ones who ever felt really bitter. And Sam got past that a long time ago. So I\u2019m the crybaby now.\u201d Jacob laughed at himself. There were so many things I wanted to know. \u201cWhy are you and Sam different? What happened to Sam anyway? What\u2019s his problem?\u201d The questions tumbled out without room to answer them, and Jacob laughed again. \u201cThat\u2019s a long story.\u201d \u201cI told you a long story. Besides, I\u2019m not in any hurry to get back,\u201d I said, and then I grimaced as I thought of the trouble I would be in. He looked up at me swiftly, hearing the double edge in my words. \u201cWill he be mad at you?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d I admitted. \u201cHe really hates it when I do things he considers . . . risky.\u201d \u201cLike hanging out with werewolves.\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d Jacob shrugged. \u201cSo don\u2019t go back. I\u2019ll sleep on the couch.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a great idea,\u201d I grumbled. \u201cBecause then he would come looking for me.\u201d Jacob stiffened, and then smiled bleakly. \u201cWould he?\u201d \u201cIf he was afraid I was hurt or something \u2014 probably.\u201d \u201cMy idea\u2019s sounding better all the time.\u201d \u201cPlease, Jake. That really bugs me.\u201d \u00a0\u201cWhat does?\u201d \u201cThat you two are so ready to kill each other!\u201d I complained. \u201cIt makes me crazy. Why can\u2019t you both just be civilized?\u201d \u201cIs he ready to kill me?\u201d Jacob asked with a grim smile, unconcerned by my anger. \u201cNot like you seem to be!\u201d I realized I was yelling. \u201cAt least he can be a grown-up about this. He knows that hurting you would hurt me \u2014 and so he never would. You don\u2019t seem to care about that at all!\u201d \u201cYeah, right,\u201d Jacob muttered. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s quite the pacifist.\u201d \u201cUgh!\u201d I ripped my hand out of his and shoved his head away. Then I pulled my knees up to my chest and wrapped my arms tightly around them. I glared out toward the horizon, fuming. Jacob was quiet for a few minutes. Finally, he got up off the ground and sat beside me, putting his arm around my shoulders. I shook it off. \u201cSorry,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI\u2019ll try to behave myself.\u201d I didn\u2019t answer. \u201cDo you still want to hear about Sam?\u201d he offered. I shrugged. \u00a0\u201cLike I said, it\u2019s a long story. And very . . . strange. There\u2019re so many strange things about this new life. I haven\u2019t had time to tell you the half of it. And this thing with Sam \u2014 well, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll even be able to explain it right.\u201d His words pricked my curiosity in spite of my irritation. \u201cI\u2019m listening,\u201d I said stiffly. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the side of his face pull up in a smile. \u201cSam had it so much harder than the rest of us. Because he was the first, and he was alone, and he didn\u2019t have anyone to tell him what was happening. Sam\u2019s grandfather died before he was born, and his father has never been around. There was no one there to recognize the signs. The first time it happened \u2014 the first time he phased \u2014 he thought he\u2019d gone insane. It took him two weeks to calm down enough to change back. \u00a0\u201cThis was before you came to Forks, so you wouldn\u2019t remember. Sam\u2019s mother and Leah Clearwater had the forest rangers searching for him, the police. People thought there had been an accident or something. . . .\u201d \u201cLeah?\u201d I asked, surprised. Leah was Harry\u2019s daughter. Hearing her name sent an automatic surge of pity through me. Harry Clearwater, Charlie\u2019s life-long friend, had died of a heart attack this past spring. His voice changed, became heavier. \u201cYeah. Leah and Sam were high school sweethearts. They started dating when she was just a freshman. She was frantic when he disappeared.\u201d \u201cBut he and Emily \u2014\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll get to that \u2014 it\u2019s part of the story,\u201d he said. He inhaled slowly, and then exhaled in a gust. I supposed it was silly for me to imagine that Sam had never loved anyone before Emily. Most people fall in and out of love many times in their lives. It was just that I\u2019d seen Sam with Emily, and I couldn\u2019t imagine him with someone else. The way he looked at her . . . well, it reminded me of a look I\u2019d seen sometimes in Edward\u2019s eyes \u2014 when he was looking at me. \u00a0\u201cSam came back,\u201d Jacob said, \u201cbut he wouldn\u2019t talk to anyone about where he\u2019d been. Rumors flew \u2014 that he was up to no good, mostly. And then Sam happened to run in to Quil\u2019s grandfather one afternoon when Old Quil Ateara came to visit Mrs. Uley. Sam shook his hand. Old Quil just about had a stroke.\u201d Jacob paused to laugh. \u201cWhy?\u201d Jacob put his hand on my cheek and pulled my face around to look at him \u2014 he was leaning toward me, his face was just a few inches away. His palm burned my skin, like he had a fever. \u00a0\u201cOh, right,\u201d I said. It was uncomfortable, having my face so close to his with his hand hot against my skin. \u201cSam was running a temperature.\u201d Jacob laughed again. \u201cSam\u2019s hand felt like he\u2019d left it sitting on a hot stovetop.\u201d He was so close, I could feel his warm breath. I reached up casually, to take his hand away and free my face, but wound my fingers through his so that I wouldn\u2019t hurt his feelings. He smiled and leaned back, undeceived by my attempt at nonchalance. \u201cSo Mr. Ateara went straight to the other elders,\u201d Jacob went on. \u201cThey were the only ones left who still knew, who remembered. Mr. Ateara, Billy, and Harry had actually seen their grandfathers make the change. When Old Quil told them, they met with Sam secretly and explained. \u201cIt was easier when he understood \u2014 when he wasn\u2019t alone anymore. They knew he wouldn\u2019t be the only one affected by the Cullens\u2019 return\u201d \u2014 he pronounced the name with unconscious bitterness \u2014 \u201cbut no one else was old enough. So Sam waited for the rest of us to join him. . . .\u201d  \u201cThe Cullens had no idea,\u201d I said in a whisper. \u201cThey didn\u2019t think that werewolves still existed here. They didn\u2019t know that coming here would change you.\u201d \u201cIt doesn\u2019t change the fact that it did.\u201d \u201cRemind me not to get on your bad side.\u201d \u201cYou think I should be as forgiving as you are? We can\u2019t all be saints and martyrs.\u201d \u201cGrow up, Jacob.\u201d \u00a0\u201cI wish I could,\u201d he murmured quietly. I stared at him, trying to make sense of his response. \u201cWhat?\u201d Jacob chuckled. \u201cOne of those many strange things I mentioned.\u201d \u201cYou . . . can\u2019t . . . grow up?\u201d I said blankly. \u201cYou\u2019re what? Not . . .aging? Is that a joke?\u201d \u201cNope.\u201d He popped his lips on the P. I felt blood flood my face. Tears \u2014 tears of rage \u2014 filled my eyes. My teeth mashed together with an audible grinding sound. \u201cBella? What did I say?\u201d I was on my feet again, my hands balled up into fists, my whole frame shaking. \u201cYou. Are. Not. Aging,\u201d I growled through my teeth. Jacob tugged my arm gently, trying to make me sit. \u201cNone of us are. What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d \u201cAm I the only one who has to get old? I get older every stinking day!\u201d I nearly shrieked, throwing my hands in the air. Some little part of me recognized that I was throwing a Charlie-esque fit, but that rational part was greatly overshadowed by the irrational part. \u201cDamn it! What kind of world is this? Where\u2019s the justice?\u201d \u201cTake it easy, Bella.\u201d \u201cShut up, Jacob. Just shut up! This is so unfair!\u201d \u201cDid you seriously just stamp your foot? I thought girls only did that on TV.\u201d I growled unimpressively. \u201cIt\u2019s not as bad as you seem to think it is. Sit down and I\u2019ll explain.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll stand.\u201d He rolled his eyes. \u201cOkay. Whatever you want. But listen, Iwill get older . . . someday.\u201d \u201cExplain.\u201d He patted the tree. I glowered for a second, but then sat; my temper had burned out as suddenly as it had flared and I\u2019d calmed down enough to realize that I was making a fool of myself. \u201cWhen we get enough control to quit . . . ,\u201d Jacob said. \u201cWhen we stop phasing for a solid length of time, we age again. It\u2019s not easy.\u201d He shook his head, abruptly doubtful. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna take a really long time to learn that kind of restraint, I think. Even Sam\u2019s not there yet. \u2019Course it doesn\u2019t help that there\u2019s a huge coven of vampires right down the road. We can\u2019t even think about quitting when the tribe needs protectors. But you shouldn\u2019t get all bent out of shape about it, anyway, because I\u2019m already older than you, physically at least.\u201d \u00a0\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d \u201cLook at me, Bells. Do I look sixteen?\u201d I glanced up and down his mammoth frame, trying to be unbiased. \u201cNot exactly, I guess.\u201d \u201cNot at all. Because we reach full growth inside of a few months when the werewolf gene gets triggered. It\u2019s one hell of a growth spurt.\u201d He made a face. \u201cPhysically, I\u2019m probably twenty-five or something. So there\u2019s no need for you to freak out about being too old for me for at least another seven years.\u201d Twenty-five or something.The idea messed with my head. But I remembered that growth spurt \u2014 I remembered watching him shoot up and fill out right before my eyes. I remembered how he would look different from one day to the next. . . . I shook my head, feeling dizzy. \u201cSo, did you want to hear about Sam, or did you want to scream at me some more for things that are out of my control?\u201d I took a deep breath. \u201cSorry. Age is a touchy subject for me. That hit a nerve.\u201d Jacob\u2019s eyes tightened, and he looked as if he were trying to decide how to word something. Since I didn\u2019t want to talk about the truly touchy stuff \u2014 my plans for the future, or treaties that might be broken by said plans, I prompted him. \u201cSo once Sam understood what was going on, once he had Billy and Harry and Mr. Ateara, you said it wasn\u2019t so hard anymore. And, like you also said, there are the cool parts. . . .\u201d I hesitated briefly. \u201cWhy does Sam hate them so much? Why does he wish I would hate them?\u201d Jacob sighed. \u201cThis is the really weird part.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a pro at weird.\u201d \u201cYeah, I know.\u201d He grinned before he continued. \u201cSo, you\u2019re right. Sam knew what was going on, and everything was almost okay. In most ways, his life was back to, well, not normal. But better.\u201d Then Jacob\u2019s expression tightened, like something painful was coming. \u201cSam couldn\u2019t tell Leah. We aren\u2019t supposed to tell anyone who doesn\u2019t have to know. And it wasn\u2019t really safe for him to be around her \u2014 but he cheated, just like I did with you. Leah was furious that he wouldn\u2019t tell her what was going on \u2014 where he\u2019d been, where he went at night, why he was always so exhausted \u2014 but they were working it out. They were trying. They really loved each other.\u201d \u201cDid she find out? Is that what happened?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cNo, that wasn\u2019t the problem. Her cousin, Emily Young, came down from the Makah reservation to visit her one weekend.\u201d I gasped. \u201cEmily is Leah\u2019s cousin?\u201d \u201cSecond cousins. They\u2019re close, though. They were like sisters when they were kids.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s . . . horrible. How could Sam . . . ?\u201d I trailed off, shaking my head. \u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t judge him just yet. Did anyone ever tell you . . . Have you ever heard of imprinting ?\u201d \u201cImprinting?\u201d I repeated the unfamiliar word. \u201cNo. What\u2019s that mean?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s one of those bizarre things we have to deal with. It doesn\u2019t happen to everyone. In fact, it\u2019s the rare exception, not the rule. Sam had heard all the stories by then, the stories we all used to think were legends. He\u2019d heard of imprinting, but he never dreamed . . .\u201d \u201cWhat is it?\u201d I prodded. Jacob\u2019s eyes strayed to the ocean. \u201cSam did love Leah. But when he saw Emily, that didn\u2019t matter anymore. Sometimes . . . we don\u2019t exactly know why . . . we find our mates that way.\u201d His eyes flashed back to me, his face reddening. \u201cI mean . . . our soul mates.\u201d \u00a0\u201cWhat way? Love at first sight?\u201d I snickered. Jacob wasn\u2019t smiling. His dark eyes were critical of my reaction. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit more powerful than that. More absolute.\u201d \u201cSorry,\u201d I muttered. \u201cYou\u2019re serious, aren\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cYeah, I am.\u201d \u201cLove at first sight? But more powerful?\u201d My voice still sounded dubious, and he could hear that. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to explain. It doesn\u2019t matter, anyway.\u201d He shrugged indifferently.  \u00a0\u201cYou wanted to know what happened to Sam to make him hate the vampires for changing him, to make him hate himself. And that\u2019s what happened. He broke Leah\u2019s heart. He went back on every promise he\u2019d ever made her. Every day he has to see the accusation in her eyes, and know that she\u2019s right.\u201d He stopped talking abruptly, as if he\u2019d said something he hadn\u2019t meant to. \u201cHow did Emily deal with this? If she was so close to Leah . . . ?\u201d Sam and Emily were utterly right together, two puzzle pieces, shaped for each other exactly. Still . . . how had Emily gotten past the fact that he\u2019d belonged to someone else? Her sister, almost. \u00a0\u201cShe was real angry, in the beginning. But it\u2019s hard to resist that level of commitment and adoration.\u201d Jacob sighed. \u201cAnd then, Sam could tell her everything. There are no rules that can bind you when you find your other half. You know how she got hurt?\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d The story in Forks was that she was mauled by a bear, but I was in on the secret. Werewolves are unstable, Edward had said.The people near them get hurt. \u201cWell, weirdly enough, that was sort of how they resolved things. Sam was so horrified, so sickened by himself, so full of hate for what he\u2019d done. . . . He would have thrown himself under a bus if it would have made her feel better. He might have anyway, just to escape what he\u2019d done. He was shattered. . . . Then, somehow, she was the one comforting him , and after that. . . .\u201d Jacob didn\u2019t finish his thought, and I sensed the story had gotten too personal to share. \u00a0\u201cPoor Emily,\u201d I whispered. \u201cPoor Sam. Poor Leah. . . .\u201d \u201cYeah, Leah got the worst end of the stick,\u201d he agreed. \u201cShe puts on a brave face. She\u2019s going to be a bridesmaid.\u201d I gazed away, toward the jagged rocks that rose from the ocean like stubby broken-off fingers on the south rim of the harbor, while I tried to make sense of it all. I could feel his eyes on my face, waiting for me to say something.   \u201cDid it happen to you?\u201d I finally asked, still looking away. \u201cThis love-at-first-sight thing?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d he answered briskly. \u201cSam and Jared are the only ones.\u201d \u201cHmm,\u201d I said, trying to sound only politely interested. I was relieved, and I tried to explain my reaction to myself. I decided I was just glad he didn\u2019t claim there was some mystical, wolfy connection between the two of us. Our relationship was confusing enough as it was. I didn\u2019t need any more of the supernatural than I already had to deal with. He was quiet, too, and the silence felt a little awkward. My intuition told me that I didn\u2019t want to hear what he was thinking.   \u00a0\u201cHow did that work out for Jared?\u201d I asked to break the silence. \u201cNo drama there. It was just a girl he\u2019d sat next to in school every day for a year and never looked at twice. And then, after he changed, he saw her again and never looked away. Kim was thrilled. She\u2019d had a huge crush on him. She\u2019d had his last name tacked on to the end of hers all over in her diary.\u201d He laughed mockingly. I frowned. \u201cDid Jared tell you that? He shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d  Jacob bit his lip. \u201cI guess I shouldn\u2019t laugh. It was funny, though.\u201d \u201cSome soul mate.\u201d He sighed. \u201cJared didn\u2019t tell us anything on purpose. I already told you this part, remember?\u201d \u201cOh, yeah. You can hear each other\u2019s thoughts, but only when you\u2019re wolves, right?\u201d \u201cRight. Just like your bloodsucker.\u201d He glowered. \u201cEdward,\u201d I corrected. \u00a0\u201cSure, sure. That\u2019s how come I know so much about how Sam felt. It\u2019s not like he would have told us all that if he\u2019d had a choice. Actually, that\u2019s something we all hate.\u201d The bitterness was abruptly harsh in his voice. \u201cIt\u2019s awful. No privacy, no secrets. Everything you\u2019re ashamed of, laid out for everyone to see.\u201d He shuddered. \u201cIt sounds horrible,\u201d I whispered. \u201cIt is sometimes helpful when we need to coordinate,\u201d he said grudgingly. \u201cOnce in a blue moon, when some bloodsucker crosses into our territory. Laurent was fun. And if the Cullens hadn\u2019t gotten in our way last Saturday . . . ugh!\u201d he groaned. \u201cWe could have had her!\u201d His fists clenched into angry balls. I flinched. As much as I worried about Jasper or Emmett getting hurt, it was nothing like the panic I felt at the idea of Jacob going up against Victoria. Emmett and Jasper were the closest thing to indestructible I could imagine. Jacob was still warm, still comparatively human. Mortal. I thought of Jacob facing Victoria, her brilliant hair blowing around her oddly feline face . . . and shuddered. Jacob looked up at me with a curious expression. \u201cBut isn\u2019t it like that for you all the time? Having him in your head?\u201d  \u201cOh, no. Edward\u2019s never in my head. He only wishes.\u201d Jacob\u2019s expression became confused. \u201cHe can\u2019t hear me,\u201d I explained, my voice a tiny bit smug from old habit. \u201cI\u2019m the only one like that, for him. We don\u2019t know why he can\u2019t.\u201d \u201cWeird,\u201d Jacob said. \u201cYeah.\u201d The smugness faded. \u201cIt probably means there\u2019s something wrong with my brain,\u201d I admitted. \u201cI already knew there was something wrong with your brain,\u201d Jacob muttered. \u201cThanks.\u201d The sun broke through the clouds suddenly, a surprise I hadn\u2019t been expecting, and I had to narrow my eyes against the glare off the water. Everything changed color \u2014 the waves turned from gray to blue, the trees from dull olive to brilliant jade, and the rainbow-hued pebbles glittered like jewels. We squinted for a moment, letting our eyes adjust. There were no sounds besides the hollow roar of the waves that echoed from every side of the sheltered harbor, the soft grinding of the stones against each other under the water\u2019s movement, and the cry of gulls high overhead. It was very peaceful. He settled closer to me, so that he was leaning against my arm. He was so warm. After a minute of this, I shrugged out of my rain jacket. He made a little sound of contentment in the back of his throat, and rested his cheek on the top of my head. I could feel the sun heat my skin \u2014 thought it was not quite as warm as Jacob \u2014 and I wondered idly how long it would take me to burn. Absentmindedly, I twisted my right hand to the side, and watched the sunlight glitter subtly off the scar James had left there. \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d he murmured. \u201cThe sun.\u201d \u201cMmm. It\u2019s nice.\u201d \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d I asked. He chuckled to himself. \u201cI was remembering that moronic movie you took me to. And Mike Newton puking all over everything.\u201d I laughed, too, surprised by how time had changed the memory. It used to be one of stress, of confusion. So much had changed that night. . . . And now I could laugh. It was the last night Jacob and I had had before he\u2019d learned the truth about his heritage. The last human memory. An oddly pleasant memory now. \u201cI miss that,\u201d Jacob said. \u201cThe way it used to be so easy . . . uncomplicated. I\u2019m glad I\u2019ve got a good memory.\u201d He sighed. He felt the sudden tension in my body as his words triggered a memory of my own. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked. \u201cAbout that good memory of yours . . .\u201d I pulled away from him so that I could read his face. At the moment, it was confused. \u201cDo you mind telling me what you were doing Monday morning? You were thinking something that bothered Edward.\u201d Bothered wasn\u2019t quite the word for it, but I wanted an answer, so I thought it was best not to start out too severely. Jacob\u2019s face brightened with understanding, and he laughed. \u201cI was just thinking about you. Didn\u2019t like that much, did he?\u201d \u201cMe? What about me?\u201d Jacob laughed, with a harder edge this time. \u201cI was remembering the way you looked that night Sam found you \u2014 I\u2019ve seen it in his head, and it\u2019s like I was there; that memory has always haunted Sam, you know. And then I remembered how you looked the first time you came to my place. I bet you don\u2019t even realize what a mess you were then, Bella. It was weeks before you started to look human again. And I remembered how you always used to have your arms wrapped around yourself, trying to hold yourself together. . . .\u201d Jacob winced, and then shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to remember how sad you were, and it wasn\u2019t my fault. So I figured it would be harder for him. And I thought he ought to get a look at what he\u2019d done.\u201d I smacked his shoulder. It hurt my hand. \u201cJacob Black, don\u2019t you ever do that again! Promise me you won\u2019t.\u201d \u201cNo way. I haven\u2019t had that much fun in months.\u201d \u201cSo help me, Jake \u2014\u201d \u201cOh, get a grip, Bella. When am I ever going to see him again? Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d I got to my feet, and he caught my hand as I started to walk away. I tried to tug free. \u201cI\u2019m leaving, Jacob.\u201d \u201cNo, don\u2019t go yet,\u201d he protested, his hand tightening around mine. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. And . . . okay, I won\u2019t do it again. Promise.\u201d I sighed. \u201cThanks, Jake.\u201d \u201cCome on, we\u2019ll go back to my house,\u201d he said eagerly. \u00a0\u201cActually, I think I really do need to go. Angela Weber is expecting me, and I know Alice is worried. I don\u2019t want to upset her too much.\u201d \u201cBut you just got here!\u201d \u201cIt feels that way,\u201d I agreed. I glared up at the sun, somehow already directly overhead. How had the time passed so quickly? His eyebrows pulled down over his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll see you again,\u201d he said in a hurt voice. \u201cI\u2019ll come back the next time he\u2019s away,\u201d I promised impulsively. \u201cAway?\u201d Jacob rolled his eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s a nice way to describe what he\u2019s doing. Disgusting parasites.\u201d \u201cIf you can\u2019t be nice, I won\u2019t come back at all!\u201d I threatened, trying to pull my hand free. He refused to let go. \u201cAw, don\u2019t be mad,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cKnee-jerk reaction.\u201d \u201cIf I\u2019m going to try to come back again, you\u2019re going to have to get something straight, okay?\u201d He waited. \u201cSee,\u201d I explained. \u201cI don\u2019t care who\u2019s a vampire and who\u2019s a werewolf. That\u2019s irrelevant. You are Jacob, and he is Edward, and I am Bella. And nothing else matters.\u201d His eyes narrowed slightly. \u201cBut I am a werewolf,\u201d he said unwillingly. \u201cAnd he is a vampire,\u201d he added with obvious revulsion. \u201cAnd I\u2019m a Virgo!\u201d I shouted, exasperated. He raised his eyebrows, measuring my expression with curious eyes. Finally, he shrugged. \u201cIf you can really see it that way . . .\u201d \u201cI can. I do.\u201d   \u201cOkay. Just Bella and Jacob. None of those <em>freaky</em> Virgos here.\u201d He smiled at me, the warm, familiar smile that I had missed so much. I felt the answering smile spread across my face. \u201cI\u2019ve really missed you, Jake,\u201d I admitted impulsively. \u201cMe, too,\u201d his smile widened. His eyes were happy and clear, free for once of the angry bitterness. \u201cMore than you know. Will you come back soon?\u201d \u201cAs soon as I can,\u201d I promised.",

            "en": "1 3            13. KILLER If it was anyone but Jacob, i thought to myself, shaking my head as I drove down  the forest-lined highway to La Push. I still wasn't sure if I was doing the right thing, but I'd made a compromise with myself. I couldn't condone what Jacob and his friends, his pack, were doing. I understood now what he'd said last night\u2014that I might not want to see him again\u2014and I could have called him as he'd suggested, but that felt cowardly. I owed him a face-to-face conversation, at least. I would tell him to his face that I couldn't just overlook what was going on. I couldn't be friends with a killer and say nothing, let the killing continue\u2026 That would make me a monster, too. But I couldn't not warn him, either. I had to do what I could to protect him. I pulled up to the Blacks' house with my lips pressed together into a hard line. It was bad enough that my best friend was a werewolf. Did he have to be a monster, too? The house was dark, no lights in the windows, but I didn't care if I woke them. My fist thudded against the front door with angry energy; the sound reverberated through the walls. \"Come in,\" I heard Billy call after a minute, and a light flicked on. I twisted the knob; it was unlocked. Billy was leaning around an open doorway just off the little kitchen, a bathrobe around his shoulders, not in his chair yet. When he saw who it was, his eyes widened briefly, and then his face turned stoic. \"Well, good morning, Bella. What are you doing up so early?\" \"Hey, Billy. I need to talk to Jake\u2014where is he?\" \"Um\u2026 I don't really know,\" he lied, straight-faced. \"Do you know what Charlie is doing this morning?\" I demanded, sick of the stalling. \"Should I?\" \"He and half the other men in town are all out in the woods with guns, hunting giant wolves.\" Billy's expression flickered, and then went blank. \"So I'd like to talk to Jake about that, if you don't mind,\" I continued. Billy pursed his thick lips for a long moment. \"I'd bet he's still asleep,\" he finally said, nodding toward the tiny hallway off the front room. \"He's out late a lot these days. Kid needs his rest\u2014probably you shouldn't wake him.\" \"It's my turn,\" I muttered under my breath as I stalked to the hallway. Billy sighed. Jacob's tiny closet of a room was the only door in the yard-long hallway. I didn't bother to knock. I threw the door open; it slammed against the wall with a bang. Jacob\u2014still wearing just the same black cut-off sweats he'd worn last night\u2014was stretched diagonally across the double bed that took up all of his room but a few inches around the edges. Even on a slant, it wasn't long enough; his feet hung off the one end and his head off the other. He was fast asleep, snoring lightly with his mouth hanging open. The sound of the door hadn't even made him twitch. His face was peaceful with deep sleep, all the angry lines smoothed out. There were circles under his eyes that I hadn't noticed before. Despite his ridiculous size, he looked very young now, and very weary. Pity shook me. I stepped back out, and shut the door quietly behind me. Billy stared with curious, guarded eyes as I walked slowly back into the front room. \"I think I'll let him get some rest.\" Billy nodded, and then we gazed at each other for a minute. I was dying to ask him about his part in this. What did he think of what his son had become? But I knew how he'd supported Sam from the very beginning, and so I supposed the murders must not bother him. How he justified that to himself I couldn't imagine. I could see many questions for me in his dark eyes, but he didn't voice them either. \"Look,\" I said, breaking the loud silence. \"I'll be down at the beach for a while. When he wakes up, tell him I'm waiting for him, okay?\" \"Sure, sure,\" Billy agreed. I wondered if he really would. Well, if he didn't, I'd tried, right? I drove down to First Beach and parked in the empty dirt lot. It was still dark\u2014the gloomy predawn of a cloudy day\u2014and when I cut the headlights it was hard to see. I had to let my eyes adjust before I could find the path that led through the tall hedge of weeds. It was colder here, with the wind whipping off the black water, and I shoved my hands deep into the pockets of my winter jacket. At least the rain had stopped. I paced down the beach toward the north seawall. I couldn't see St. James or the other islands, just the vague shape of the water's edge. I picked my way carefully across the rocks, watching out for driftwood that might trip me. I found what I was looking for before I realized I was looking for it. It materialized out of the gloom when it was just a few feet away: a long bone-white driftwood tree stranded deep on the rocks. The roots twisted up at the seaward end, like a hundred brittle tentacles. I couldn't be sure that it was the same tree where Jacob and I had had our first conversation\u2014a conversation that had begun so many different, tangled threads of my life\u2014but it seemed to be in about the same place I sat down where I'd sat before, and stared out across the invisible sea. Seeing Jacob like that\u2014innocent and vulnerable in sleep\u2014had stolen all my revulsion, dissolved all my anger. I still couldn't turn a blind eye to what was happening, like Billy seemed to, but I couldn't condemn Jacob for it either. Love didn't work that way, I decided. Once you cared about a person, it was impossible to be logical about them anymore. Jacob was my friend whether he killed people or not. And I didn't know what I was going to do about that. When I pictured him sleeping so peacefully, I felt an overpowering urge to protect him. Completely illogical. Illogical or not, I brooded over the memory his peaceful face, trying to come up with some answer, some way to shelter him, while the sky slowly turned gray. \"Hi, Bella.\" Jacob's voice came from the darkness and made me jump. It was soft, almost shy, but I'd been expecting some forewarning from the noisy rocks, and so it still startled me. I could see his silhouette against the coming sunrise\u2014it looked enormous. \"Jake?\" He stood several paces away, shifting his weight from foot to foot anxiously. \"Billy told me you came by\u2014didn't take you very long, did it? I knew you could figure it out.\" \"Yeah, I remember the right story now,\" I whispered. It was quiet for a long moment and, though it was still too dark to see well, my skin prickled as if his eyes were searching my face. There must have been enough light for him to read my expression, because when he spoke again, his voice was suddenly acidic. \"You could have just called,\" he said harshly. I nodded. \"I know.\" Jacob started pacing along the rocks. If I listened very hard, I could just hear the gentle brush of his feet on the rocks behind the sound of the waves. The rocks had clattered like castanets for me. \"Why did you come?\" he demanded, not halting his angry stride. \"I thought it would be better face-to-face.\" He snorted. \"Oh, much better.\" \"Jacob, I have to warn you\u2014\" \"About the rangers and the hunters? Don't worry about it. We already know.\" \"Don't worry about it?\" I demanded in disbelief. \"Jake, they've got guns! They're setting traps and offering rewards and\u2014\" \"We can take care of ourselves,\" he growled, still pacing. \"They're not going to catch anything. They're only making it more difficult\u2014they'll start disappearing soon enough, too.\" \"Jake!\" I hissed. \"What? It's just a fact.\" My voice was pale with revulsion. \"How can you\u2026 feel that way? You know these people. Charlie's out there!\" The thought made my stomach twist. He came to an abrupt stop. \"What more can we do?\" he retorted. The sun turned the clouds a slivery pink above us. I could see his expression now; it was angry, frustrated, betrayed. \"Could you\u2026 well, try to not be a\u2026 werewolf?\" I suggested in a whisper. He threw his hands up in the air. \"Like I have a choice about it!\" he shouted. \"And how would that help anything, if you're worried about people disappearing?\" \"I don't understand you.\" He glared at me, his eyes narrowing and his mouth twisting into a snarl. \"You know what makes me so mad I could just spit?\" I flinched away from his hostile expression. He seemed to be waiting for an answer, so I shook my head. \"You're such a hypocrite, Bella\u2014there you sit, terrified of me! How is that fair?\" His hands shook with anger. \"Hypocrite? How does being afraid of a monster make me a hypocrite?\" \"Ugh!\" he groaned, pressing his trembling fists to his temples and squeezing his eyes shut. \"Would you listen to yourself?\" \"What?\" He took two steps toward me, leaning over me and glaring with fury. \"Well, I'm so sorry that I can't be the right kind of monster for you, Bella. I guess I'm just not as great as a bloodsucker, am I?\" I jumped to my feet and glared back. \"No, you're not!\" I shouted. \"It's not what you are, stupid, it's what you do!\" \"What's that supposed to mean?\" He roared, his entire frame quivering with rage. I was taken entirely by surprise when Edward's voice cautioned me. \"Be very careful, Bella,\" his velvet voice warned. \"Don't push him too far. You need to calm him down.\" Even the voice in my head was making no sense today. I listened to him, though. I would do anything for that voice. \"Jacob,\" I pleaded, making my tone soft and even. \"Is it really necessary to kill people, Jacob? Isn't there some other way? I mean, if vampires can find a way to survive without murdering people, couldn't you give it a try, too?\" He straightened up with a jerk, like my words had sent an electric shock through him. His eyebrows shot up and his eyes stared wide. \"Killing people?\" he demanded. \"What did you think we were talking about?\" He wasn't trembling anymore. He looked at me with half-hopeful disbelief. \"I thought we were talking about your disgust for werewolves.\" \"No, Jake, no. It's not that you're a\u2026 wolf. That's fine,\" I promised him, and I knew as I said the words that I meant them. I really didn't care if he turned into a big wolf\u2014he was still Jacob. \"If you could just find a way not to hurt people\u2026 that's all that upsets me. These ate innocent people, Jake, people like Charlie, and I can't just look the other way while you\u2014\" \"Is that all? Really?\" he interrupted me, a smile breaking across his face. \"You're just scared because I'm a murderer? That's the only reason?\" \"Isn't that reason enough?\" He started to laugh. \"Jacob Black, this is so not funny!\" \"Sure, sure,\" he agreed, still chortling. He took one long stride and caught me in another vice-tight bear hug. \"You really, honestly don't mind that I morph into a giant dog?\" he asked, his voice joyful in my ear. \"No,\" I gasped. \"Can't\u2014breathe\u2014Jake!\" He let me go, but took both my hands. \"I'm not a killer, Bella.\" I studied his face, and it was clear that this was the truth. Relief pulsed through me. \"Really?\" I asked. \"Really,\" he promised solemnly. I threw my arms around him. It reminded me of that first day with the motorcycles\u2014he was bigger, though, and I felt even more like a child now. Like that other time, he stroked my hair. \"Sorry I called you a hypocrite,\" he apologized. \"Sorry I called you a murderer.\" He laughed. I thought of something then, and pulled away from him so that I could see his face. My eyebrows furrowed in anxiety. \"What about Sam? And the others?\" He shook his head, smiling like a huge burden had been removed from his shoulders.  \"Of course not. Don't you remember what we call ourselves?\" The memory was clear\u2014I'd just been thinking of that very day. \"Protectors?\" \"Exactly.\" \"But I don't understand. What's happening in the woods? The missing hikers, the blood?\" His face was serious, worried at once. \"We're trying to do our job, Bella. We're trying to protect them, but we're always just a little too late.\" \"Protect them from what? Is there really a bear out there, too?\" \"Bella, honey, we only protect people from one thing\u2014our one enemy. It's the reason we exist\u2014because they do.\" I stared at him blankly for one second before I understood. Then the blood drained from my face and a thin, wordless cry of horror broke through my lips. He nodded. \"I thought you, of all people, would realize what was really going on.\" \"Laurent,\" I whispered. \"He's still here.\" Jacob blinked twice, and cocked his head to one side. \"Who's Laurent?\" I tried to sort out the chaos in my head so that I could answer. \"You know\u2014you saw him in the meadow. You were there\u2026\" The words came out in a wondering tone as it all sunk in. \"You were there, and you kept him from killing me\u2026\" \"Oh, the black-haired leech?\" He grinned, a tight, fierce grin. \"Was that his name?\" I shuddered. \"What were you thinking?\" I whispered. \"He could have killed you! Jake, you don't realize how dangerous\u2014\" Another laugh interrupted me \"Bella, one lone vampire isn't much of a problem for a pack as big as ours. It was so easy, it was hardly even fun!\" \"What was so easy?\" \"Killing the bloodsucker who was going to kill you. Now, I don't count that towards the whole murder thing,\" he added quickly. \"Vampires don't count as people.\" I could only mouth the words. \"You\u2026 killed\u2026 Laurent?\" He nodded. \"Well, it was a group effort,\" he qualified. \"Laurent is dead?\" I whispered. His expression changed. \"You're not upset about that, are you? He was going to kill you\u2014he was going for the kill, Bella, we were sure of that before we attacked. You know that, right?\" \"I know that. No, I'm not upset\u2014I'm\u2026\" I had to sit down. I stumbled back a step until I felt the driftwood against my calves, and then sank down onto it. \"Laurent is dead. He's not coming back for me.\" \"You're not mad? He wasn't one of your friends or anything, was he?\" \"My friend?\" I stared up at him, confused and dizzy with relief. I started babbling, my eyes getting moist. \"No, Jake. I'm so\u2026 so relieved. I thought he was going to find me\u2014I've been waiting for him every night, just hoping that he'd stop with me and leave Charlie alone. I've been so frightened, Jacob\u2026 But how? He was a vampire! How did you kill him? He was so strong, so hard, like marble\u2026\" He sat down next to me and put one big arm around me comfortingly. \"It's what we're made for, Bells. \u00a0We're strong, too. I wish you would have told me that you were so afraid. You didn't need to be.\" \"You weren't around,\" I mumbled, lost in thought. \"Oh, right.\" \"Wait, Jake\u2014I thought you knew, though. Last night, you said it wasn't safe for you to be in my room. I thought you knew that a vampire might be coming. Isn't that what you were talking about?\" He looked confused for a minute, and then he ducked his head. \"No, that's not what I meant.\" \"Then why didn't you think it was safe for you there?\" He looked at me with guilt-ridden eyes. \"I didn't say it wasn't safe for me. I was thinking of you.\" \"What do you mean?\" He looked down and kicked a rock. \"There's more than one reason I'm not supposed to be around you, Bella. I wasn't supposed to tell you our secret, for one thing, but the other part is that it's not safe for you.\u00a0 If I get too mad\u2026 too upset\u2026 you might get hurt.\" I thought about that carefully. \"When you were mad before\u2026 when I was yelling at you\u2026 and you were shaking\u2026 ?\" \"Yeah.\" His face dropped even lower. \"That was pretty stupid of me. I have to keep a better hold on myself. I swore I wasn't going to get mad, no matter what you said to me. But\u2026 I just got so upset that I was going to lose you\u2026 that you couldn't deal with what I am\u2026\" \"What would happen\u2026 if you got too mad?\" I whispered. \"I'd turn into a wolf,\" he whispered back. \"You don't need a full moon.\" He rolled his eyes. \"Hollywood's version doesn't get much right.\" Then he sighed, and was serious again. \"You don't need to be so stressed out, Bells. We're going to take care of this. And we're keeping a special eye on Charlie and the others\u2014we won't let anything happen to him. Trust me on that.\" Something very, very obvious, something I should have grasped at once\u2014but I'd been so distracted by the idea of Jacob and his friends fighting with Laurent, that I'd completely missed it at the time\u2014occurred to me only then, when Jacob used the present tense again. We're going to take care of this. It wasn't over. \"Laurent is dead,\" I gasped, and my entire body went ice cold. \"Bella?\" Jacob asked anxiously, touching my ashen cheek. \"If Laurent died\u2026 a week ago\u2026 then someone else is killing people now.\" Jacob nodded; his teeth clenched together, and he spoke through them. \"There were two of them. We thought his mate would want to fight us\u2014in our stories, they usually get pretty pissed off if you kill their mate\u2014but she just keeps running away, and then coming back again. If we could figure out what she was after, it would be easier to take her down. But she makes no sense. She keeps dancing around the edges, like she's testing our defenses, looking for a way in\u2014but in where? Where does she want to go?\u00a0 Sam thinks she's trying to separate us, so she'll have a better chance\u2026\" His voice faded until it sounded like it was coming through a long tunnel; I couldn't make out the individual words anymore. My forehead dewed with sweat and my stomach rolled like I had the stomach flu again. Exactly like I had the flu. I turned away from him quickly, and leaned over the tree trunk. My body convulsed with useless heaves, my empty stomach contracting with horrified nausea, though there was nothing in it to expel. Victoria was here. Looking for me. Killing strangers in the woods. The woods where Charlie was searching\u2026 My head spun sickeningly. Jacob's hands caught my shoulders\u2014kept me from sliding forward onto the rocks. I could feel his hot breath on my cheek. \"Bella! What's wrong?\" \"Victoria,\" I gasped as soon as I could catch my breath around the nauseous spasms. In my head, Edward snarled in fury at the name. I felt Jacob pull me up from my slump. He draped me awkwardly across his lap, laying my limp head against his shoulder. He struggled to balance me, to keep me from sagging over, one way or the other he brushed the sweaty hair back from my face. \"Who?\" Jacob asked. \"Can you hear me, Bella? Bella?\" \"She wasn't Laurent's mate,\" I moaned into his shoulder. \"They were just old friends\u2026\" \"Do you need some water? A doctor? Tell me what to do,\" he demanded, frantic. \"I'm not sick\u2014I'm scared,\" I explained in a whisper. The word scared didn't really seem to cover it. Jacob patted my back. \"Scared of this Victoria?\" I nodded, shuddering. \"Victoria is the red-haired female?\" I trembled again, and whimpered, \"Yes.\" \"How do you know she wasn't his mate?\" \"Laurent told me James was her mate,\" I explained, automatically flexing the hand with the scar. He pulled my face around, holding it steady in his big hand. He stared intently into my eyes. \"Did he tell you anything else, Bella? This is important. Do you know what she wants?\" \"Of course,\" I whispered. \"She wants me.\" His eyes flipped wide, then narrowed into slits. \"Why?\" he demanded. \"Edward killed James,\" I whispered. Jacob held me so tightly that there was no need for me to clutch at the hole\u2014he kept me in one piece. \"She did get\u2026 pissed off. But Laurent said she thought it was fairer to kill me than Edward. Mate for mate. She didn't know\u2014still doesn't know, I guess\u2014that\u2026 that\u2026\" I swallowed hard. \"That things aren't like that with us anymore. Not for Edward, anyway.\" Jacob was distracted by that, his face torn between several different expressions. \"Is that what happened? Why the Cullens left?\" \"I'm nothing but a human, after all. Nothing special,\" I explained, shrugging weakly. Something like a growl\u2014not a real growl, just a human approximation\u2014rumbled in Jacob's chest under my ear. \"If that idiot bloodsucker is honestly stupid enough\u2014\" \"Please,\" I moaned. \"Please. Don't.\" Jacob hesitated, then nodded once. \"This is important,\" he said again, his face all business now. \"This is exactly what we needed to know.We've got to tell the others right away.\" He stood, pulling me to my feet. He kept two hands on my waist until he was sure I wasn't going to fall. \"I'm okay,\" I lied. He traded his hold on my waist for one of my hands. \"Let's go.\" He pulled me back toward the truck. \"Where are we going?\" I asked. \"I'm not sure yet,\" he admitted. \"I'll call a meeting. Hey, wait here for just a minute, okay?\" He leaned me against the side of the truck and released my hand. \"Where are you going?\" \"I'll be right back,\" he promised. Then he turned and sprinted through the parking lot, across the road, and into the bordering forest. He flitted into the trees, swift and sleek as a deer. \"Jacob!\" I yelled after him hoarsely, but he was already gone. It was not a good time to be left alone. Seconds after Jacob was out of sight, I was hyperventilating. I dragged myself into the cab of the truck, and mashed the locks down at once. It didn't make me feel any better. Victoria was already hunting me. It was just luck that she hadn't found me yet\u2014just luck and five teenage werewolves. I exhaled sharply. No matter what Jacob said, the thought of him coming anywhere close to Victoria was horrifying. I didn't care what he could turn into when he got mad. I could see her in my head, her face wild, her hair like flames, deadly, indestructible\u2026 But, according to Jacob, Laurent was gone. Was that really possible? Edward\u2014I clutched automatically at my chest\u2014had told me how difficult it was to kill a vampire. Only another vampire could do the job. Yet Jake said this was what werewolves were made for\u2026 He said they were keeping a special eye on Charlie\u2014that I should trust the werewolves to keep my father safe. How could I trust that? None of us were safe! Jacob the very least of all, if he was trying to put himself between Victoria and Charlie\u2026 between Victoria and me. I felt like I might be about to throw up again. A sharp rap on the truck's window made me yelp in terror\u2014but it was just Jacob, back already. I unlocked the door with trembling, grateful fingers. \"You're really scared, aren't you?\" he asked as he climbed in. I nodded. \"Don't be. We'll take care of you\u2014and Charlie, too. I promise.\" \"The idea of you finding Victoria is scarier than the idea of her finding me,\" I whispered. He laughed. \"You've got to have a little more confidence in us than that. It's insulting.\" I just shook my head. I'd seen too many vampires in action. \"Where did you go just now?\" I asked. He pursed his lips, and said nothing. \"What? Is it a secret?\" He frowned. \"Not really. It's kind of weird, though. I don't want to freak you out.\" \"I'm sort of used to weird by this point, you know.\" I tried to smile without much success. Jacob grinned back easily. \"Guess you'd have to be. Okay. See, when we're wolves, we can\u2026 hear each other.\" My eyebrows pulled down in confusion. \"Not hear sounds,\" he went on, \"but we can hear\u2026 thoughts\u2014each other's anyway\u2014no matter how far away from each other we are. It really helps when we hunt, but it's a big pain otherwise. It's embarrassing\u2014having no secrets like that. <em>Freaky</em>, eh?\" \"Is that what you meant last night, when you said you would tell them you'd seen me, even though you didn't want to?\" \"You're quick.\" \"Thanks.\" \"You're also very good with weird. I thought that would bother you.\" \"It's not\u2026 well, you're not the first person I've known who could do that. So it doesn't seem so weird to me.\" \"Really?\u2026 Wait\u2014are you talking about your bloodsuckers?\" \"I wish you wouldn't call them that.\" He laughed. \"Whatever. The Cullens, then?\" \"Just\u2026 just Edward.\" I pulled one arm surreptitiously around my torso. Jacob looked surprised\u2014unpleasantly so. \"I thought those were just stories. I've heard legends about vampires who could do\u2026 extra stuff, but I thought that was just a myth.\" \"Is anything just a myth anymore?\" I asked him wryly. He scowled. \"Guess not. Okay, we're going to meet Sam and the others at the place we go to ride our bikes.\" I started the truck and headed back up the road. \"So did you just turn into a wolf now, to talk to Sam?\" I asked, curious. Jacob nodded, seeming embarrassed. \"I kept it real short\u2014I tried not to think about you so they wouldn't know what was going on. I was afraid Sam would tell me I couldn't bring you.\" \"That wouldn't have stopped me.\" I couldn't get rid of my perception of Sam as the bad guy. My teeth clenched together whenever I heard his name. \"Well, it would have stopped me,\" Jacob said, morose now. \"Remember how I couldn't finish my sentences last night? How I couldn't just tell you the whole story?\" \"Yeah. You looked like you were choking on something.\" He chuckled darkly. \"Close enough. Sam told me I couldn't tell you. He's\u2026 the head of the pack, you know. He's the Alpha. When he tells us to do something, or not to do something\u2014when he really means it, well, we can't just ignore him.\" \"Weird,\" I muttered. \"Very,\" he agreed. \"It's kind of a wolf thing.\" \"Huh\" was the best response I could think of. \"Yeah, there's a load of stuff like that\u2014wolf things. I'm still learning. I can't imagine what it was like for Sam, trying to deal with this alone.\u00a0 It sucks bad enough to go through it with a whole pack for support.\" \"Sam was alone?\" \"Yeah.\" Jacob's voice lowered. \"When I\u2026 changed, it was the most\u2026 horrible, the most terrifying thing I've ever been through\u2014worse than anything I could have imagined. But I wasn't alone\u2014there were the voices there, in my head, telling me what had happened and what I had to do. That kept me from losing my mind, I think. But Sam\u2026\" He shook his head. \"Sam had no help.\" This was going to take some adjusting. When Jacob explained it like that, it was hard not to feel compassion for Sam. I had to keep reminding myself that there was no reason to hate him anymore. \"Will they be angry that I'm with you?\" I asked. He made a face. \"Probably.\" \"Maybe I shouldn't\u2014\" \"No, it's okay,\" he assured me. \"You know a ton of things that can help us. It's not like you're just some ignorant human. You're like a\u2026 I don't know, spy or something. You've been behind enemy lines.\" I frowned to myself. Was that what Jacob would want from me? Insider information to help them destroy their enemies? I wasn't a spy, though. I hadn't been collecting that kind of information. Already, his words made me feel like a traitor. But I wanted him to stop Victoria, didn't I? No. I did want Victoria to be stopped, preferably before she tortured me to death or ran into Charlie or killed another stranger. I just didn't want Jacob to be the one to stop her, or rather to try. I didn't want Jacob within a hundred miles of her. \"Like the stuff about the mind-reading bloodsucker,\" he continued, oblivious to my reverie. \"That's the kind of thing we need to know about. That really sucks that those stories are true. It makes everything more complicated. Hey, do you think this Victoria can do anything special?\" \"I don't think so,\" I hesitated, and then sighed. \"He would have mentioned it.\" \"He? Oh, you mean Edward\u2014oops, sorry. I forgot. You don't like to say his name. Or hear it.\" I squeezed my midsection, trying to ignore the throbbing around the edges of my chest. \"Not really, no.\" \"Sorry.\" \"How do you know me so well, Jacob? Sometimes it's like you can read my mind.\" \"Naw. I just pay attention.\" We were on the little dirt road where Jacob had first taught me to ride the motorcycle. \"This good?\" I asked. \"Sure, sure.\" I pulled over and cut the engine. \"You're still pretty unhappy, aren't you?\" he murmured. I nodded, staring unseeingly into the gloomy forest. \"Did you ever think\u2026 that maybe\u2026 you're better off?\" I inhaled slowly, and then let my breath out. \"No.\" \"'Cause he wasn't the best\u2014\" \"Please, Jacob,\" I interrupted, begging in a whisper. \"Could we please not talk about this? I can't stand it.\" \"Okay.\" He took a deep breath. \"I'm sorry I said anything.\" \"Don't feel bad. If things were different, it would be nice to finally be able to talk to someone about it.\" He nodded. \"Yeah, I had a hard time keeping a secret from you for two weeks. It must be hell to not be able to talk to anyone.\" \"Hell,\" I agreed. Jacob sucked in a sharp breath. \"They're here. Let's go.\" \"Are you sure?\" I asked while he popped his door open. \"Maybe I shouldn't be here.\" \"They'll deal with it,\" he said, and then he grinned. \"Who's afraid of the big, bad wolf?\" \"Ha ha,\" I said. But I got out of the truck, hurrying around the front end to stand close beside Jacob. I remembered only too clearly the giant monsters in the meadow. My hands were trembling like Jacob's had been before, but with fear rather than rage. Jake took my hand and squeezed it. \"Here we go.\"",
