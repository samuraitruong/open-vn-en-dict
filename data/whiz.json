            "en": "Bringing the Beauty of Math to Life           For many people, math can be intimidating. But Alex Bellos finds it intriguing.  The journalist has degrees in mathematics and philosophy from Oxford University. After 20 years as a reporter, Bellos decided to combine his profession and his degrees. He traveled around the world - and back in time - to uncover fascinating stories of mathematical achievements and to profile people whose lives are intertwined with numbers.  Alex Bellos discovered that mathematics - which seems so absolute - is not the same everywhere around the globe.  \"While two plus two is indeed four all over the world, the approach to math is so, so different,\" Bellos says. \"I came from the U.K. where being good at math is seen as being uncool. This is not the case even in France. The French love their math. It's quite cool to be a mathematician. Mathematicians in France are seen as great intellectuals. And being good at arithmetic in India is almost seen as a badge of national pride. In Japan, which is a culture most different from mine, a million children study the abacus for fun after school. Counting is seen as fun. It's quite fun to be able to calculate and do multiplication very, very quickly.\"  Japan was one of the places Bellos visited on his year-long journey. There, he met the creator of the popular Sudoku puzzles and talked about the brain-teasing delights of mathematical games. In a town near Tokyo, he spent time with a guru of origami, the traditional Japanese art of paper folding. Origami, Bellos says, is one of the hottest areas of mathematical work today.   \"It turns out that origami is a brilliant way to understand geometry,\" he says. \"And if you start to think about paper folding, there are lots of things you can't do with the methods that have been taught in schools really since the Greeks. For instance, trisection of an angle. Just using a compass and straight-edge, you cannot construct an angle which is a third of another angle, but you can do that with origami. So it's quite interesting to think that origami in Japan, it may be a cultural thing for children, but now people study origami at the highest level in academia.\"  While in Japan, Bellos also met a math <em>whiz</em> who is not human.  \"I met the world's most numeric chimpanzee, he says. \"And it's fascinating just to see that chimpanzees can learn to count.\"  Bellos recounts his adventures in a new book, \"Here's Looking at Euclid.\" The title is a play on Humphrey Bogart's famous line, \"Here's looking at you, kid,\" from the movie \"Casablanca.\" \u00a0  The ancient Greek mathematician Euclid is known as the father of geometry. Bellos also had fun with the title of the UK edition of the book, \"Alex's Adventures in Numberland,\"\u00a0 an obvious takeoff on the British classic, \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.\"  The book is subtitled, \"A Surprising Excursion through the Astonishing World of Math.\"  In it, Bellos talks to two Ukrainian-American brothers who have built the world's biggest supercomputer in their New York apartment. He also went to Reno, Nevada to meet the man who sets the odds for more than half of the world's slot machines. While in Missouri, Bellos met with the president of the Dozenal Society of America.  \"Dozenalists are people who believe the decimal system - the system of 10 digits, zero to nine - is not very good, is not sufficient, and suggest we need to add two extra digits,\" say Bellos. \"One might say it's crazy, trying to introduce two new numbers to the number system, but mathematically it makes a perfect sense because multiplication and division become much easier if we count in twelves rather than tens.\u201d  In exploring the wonder of math, Bellos discovered numbers are not innate to humans. They were first used only about 5,000 years ago. And he found groups of people today that don't use numbers at all or very few of them.  \"In the Amazon, I spoke to a man who has been researching the tribe, the Munduruku, who have numbers up to five and that's it,\" he says. \"Actually, they maybe even have numbers up to four because they have a word for one, for two, for three-ish, for four-ish and then they use the word palm or handful for five.\"  Bellos also stopped in Germany this summer to report on the bi-annual Mental Calculation World Cup. The 10-year-old competition has several categories: addition, multiplication, square root and calendar calculation. In that last event, contestants are given a number of dates and they have to figure out which days of the week those dates fall on - all in their head. The winner of the 2010 competition is 11 years old.  \"Priyanshi Somani from India. She learned to calculate using an abacus,\" he says. \"So when she's calculating, she's moving her hands around in the air in front of her as if there is an abacus there.\"  Somani later told Bellos she imagined she was using an abacus during the competition. When asked whether she could do the mental calculations without using her hands, Somani told Bellos that she didn't think so.  Bellos embarked on his around-the-world excursion to prove that mathematics is not a dry field of learning. The stories in his book prove that it's surprising and astonishing, as surely as the square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle equals the sum of the square of its two other sides.",

            "en": "Getting along with your teachers    Your algebra teacher wears clothes from 1985 and always mispronounces your name. Your English teacher loves to start classes with pop quizzes. It can be hard to think of these givers of grades as real people. But they eat pizza, watch movies, and enjoy sports on the weekends, just like you.  So how can you get along with your teachers? Here are some tips.  Why work on good relationships with teachers? A good relationship with a teacher today may help you in the future. You will need teachers' recommendations to apply to a college or for a job after high school. And if you're thinking about going into a career in science, who better to ask about the field than your science teacher? Teachers are often plugged into the community and may be the first to find out about local competitions, activities, or contests. They also may know about grants and scholarships. Sonia's Spanish teacher found out about a contest for exchange program scholarships in Brazil and Spain. Her teacher encouraged and guided her, and Sonia's months and months of work earned her a scholarship as an exchange student. Teachers are often asked to appoint students to student offices or they may recommend students as volunteers for special community programs. All of these activities can help you get into college or get a good job. Teachers are another group of adults in your life who can look out for you, guide you, and provide you with an adult perspective. Many are willing to answer questions, offer advice, and help with personal problems. Developing good teacher-student relationships We all have our favorite teachers \u2014 those who seem truly interested and treat us as intelligent beings. But what about teachers we don't know as well (or even don't like much)? You can do lots of things to get a good connection going with your teacher. First, do the obvious stuff: show up for class on time, with all assignments completed. Be alert, be respectful, and ask questions. Show an interest in the subject. Obviously, your teachers are really interested in their subjects or they wouldn't have decided to teach them! Showing the teacher that you care \u2014 even if you're not a math <em>whiz</em> or fluent in French \u2014 sends the message that you are a dedicated student.  You can also schedule a private conference during a teacher's free period. Use this time to get extra help, ask questions, inquire about a career in the subject, or talk about your progress in class. You may be surprised to learn that your teacher is a bit more relaxed one-on-one than when lecturing in front of the whole class. It is possible to do so, though. Here are some things to avoid when trying to establish a relationship with your teacher: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Not being sincere. Teachers sense when your only motivation is to get special treatment, a college reference, or a job recommendation. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Trying to be teacher's pet. Your behavior will come off as phony and your classmates may start to resent you. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Giving extravagant gifts. It's OK to offer a small token of appreciation to teachers if they've been helpful to you. But flashy, expensive items could send the wrong message, and a teacher is usually not allowed to accept anything expensive. Common teacher-student problems If you're having problems with a teacher, try to figure out why. Do you dislike the subject? Or do you like the subject but just can't warm up to the teacher? If you don't like the subject being taught, it can affect your relationship with the teacher. Some students say it helps them to think of classes that seem like chores as stepping stones toward a bigger goal, like getting a diploma or going on to college. That allows them to keep the class in perspective. Other students say they try to find the practical value in classes they don't like. You may hate math, but learning how to calculate averages and percentages can help you in everything from sports to leaving a tip. If you find a subject hard, talk to your teacher or a parent about extra tutoring. If you find it boring, talk to your teacher (or another favorite teacher, friend, or parent) about ways to see the subject in a different light. Ian constantly fell asleep in his sophomore history class because the past seemed so removed from reality. But things changed when he mentioned his struggle to his homeroom teacher. The teacher talked to Ian and found out that his great-grandfather had fought in World War II. The teacher suggested Ian use his great-grandfather's letters in his project. Not only did Ian get an A, he also learned a lot about a family member he barely remembered from childhood. What if you just don't like the teacher? People naturally just get along better with some people than with others \u2014 it's impossible to like everyone all the time. Learning to work with people you don't connect with easily is a good skill to have in life, no matter what your goals are.  Common courtesy and respect are basic requirements of any relationship. Just as teachers need to be fair and treat everyone equally, students have responsibilities too. You don't have to like your teacher or agree with what he or she says, but it is necessary to be polite. If you need to be out of school for medical or other reasons, let your teacher know. And it's your responsibility to make up the work from missed classes. Don't expect your teacher to hunt you down or take class time to fill you in. Just like personal problems can sometimes slow you down, the same is true for your teachers. Job stress, family issues, or health problems are all factors that can affect a teacher's performance, leaving him or her cranky, irritable, or unable to concentrate. Keep in mind that too much disciplinary action can show up on a student's permanent record. This means that when someone asks for your high school record, they can see the things you did \u2014 even if they happened years ago. What to do if you don't get along Before you try to get out of a class to escape a teacher you don't like, here are a few things you can try to make a difficult relationship work: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Meet with the teacher and try to communicate what you're feeling. Tell him or her what's on your mind, using statements such as, \"It embarrasses me in class when I feel like my intelligence is being put down\" or \"I can't learn in class when I feel like only a few people ever get called on to participate.\" See if you can work it out between the two of you. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Ask yourself, \"What can I learn from this teacher?\" Even if you don't worship his or her personality or lectures, focus on one part of the teacher's personality, and use it as a tool for learning. Not only will you gain more knowledge in that subject, but a closer relationship with your teacher may help you understand one another better. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Talk to students who are doing well in the class and ask them for tips and a plan of action to get along with the teacher better. Sometimes asking a classmate who is willing to share them with you is a great idea. If you're too shy to talk to other students, study their actions and behavior in the classroom and try to follow that lead. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * If you still can't get along, make an appointment with the school guidance counselor, who can offer many tips and suggestions for getting out of difficult teacher relationships. Sometimes a guidance counselor can act as a mediator between you and the teacher. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * If your relationship problems can't be solved in school, then it's time to tell your parents. Let them meet with your teacher and try to work it out. Chances are that you won't encounter physical or verbal abuse (like racist or sexist comments) in the classroom. But if a teacher has done or said anything that makes you uncomfortable, immediately report it to your parents, your guidance counselor, another teacher, the school principal, or an administrator. Teachers are there for more than just homework, and they know about more than just their subject matter. They can help you learn how to function as an adult and a lifelong learner. Undoubtedly, there will be a few teachers along the way who you'll always remember \u2014 and who might change your life forever.",

            "en": "2010 FIFA World Cup\u2122 - Key players          Claudia Wong spots three key players from each group at the 2010 FIFA World Cup\u2122. Group A South Africa Steven Pienaar Described as their \u2018best player by an absolute mile' by Everton Manager David Moyes, Steven Pienaar is the star player of the South African national team.  He brings not only his outstanding skills to the fore, but also his European experience at Everton.  Backed by the home crowd, the \u2018Mighty Peanut' is sure to deliver with his adept left foot and fast pace.  The pride of Johannesburg, he looks set to fly his country's colours at this year's World Cup on home soil. Uruguay Diego Forlan Born into a family of football stars, Diego Forlan's father and grandfather played for Uruguay and Independiente in Argentina.  As top scorer in 2005 with Villarreal and Atletico Madrid in 2009, Forlan scored a hat-trick against Peru in the South American qualifiers.  Uruguay's hopes will rely solely on this forward to showcase his two-footedness in South Africa. France William Gallas During his days as a Chelsea player, William Gallas formed an impregnable partnership with John Terry, before moving on to become a key player for Arsene Wenger's Arsenal side.  At the center of defense, any player seeking to sneak past France will have to face the experienced might of the Frenchman.  Group B Argentina Lionel Messi Debuting in the 2004-05 season, Lionel Messi broke the La Liga record for the youngest footballer to appear in a league game, and the youngest to score a league goal.  His power, balance, strength and versatility makes Messi an integral part of Barcelona's dominance in Spain and Europe over the last few seasons.  Living up to the Argentine number ten shirt, Messi wore this jersey for the first time in the FIFA World Cup\u2122 qualifier against Venezuela. Goals from Messi are sure to come in South Africa. Nigeria John Michael Ncekwube Obinna Carlo Ancelotti, Chelsea's current manager and a former Italian midfielder, claims that with regard to playing characteristics, John Michael Ncekwube Obinna, more commonly known as Mikel, plays like himself.  He impressed Jose Mourinho in the first week at Chelsea, and has exceeded expectations.  Able to disrupt attacks and spread play, Mikel's presence in the 2010 FIFA World Cup\u2122 will stir up and unite hopes in the hearts of Nigerians.   South Korea Park Ji-Sung Asia's pride, Park Ji-Sung was the star in the 2002 World Cup\u2122 where South Korea advanced to the semi-finals, scoring the match winner against Portugal.  Kick-starting his career as a defensive midfielder, Park is the only Korean to win the UEFA Champions League and the first Asian to ever play in a final of such a tournament.  His speed, skill and never-say-die attitude make him an indispensible and a legendary team captain of the gutsy South Korean side. Group C England John Terry John Terry led Chelsea to two Premier League titles in 2004-05 with an excellent defensive record ever in football League history. His experience in the centre-back role, ability to read the game well from the back and his flawless defensive skills made him the only English player to make the all-star squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup\u2122.  Although he will not be captaining the English side this World Cup\u2122, his sterling performance will be fundamental to the Three Lions hopes. United States of America Clinton Drew Dempsey Scored the only goal by a US player in the 2006 World Cup\u2122, Clinton Drew Dempsey portrays versatility and style in the midfield.  He brings his Fulham experience, tenacity in approaching goal, and excellent dribbling skills to the table.  His spirit of perseverance in playing games through injuries will only bring his team further in the World Cup\u2122. Slovenia Milivoje Novakovic Scoring five goals in qualifiers, Milivoje Novakovic is Slovenia's forward to mark.  He was remembered for his brilliant hat-trick against Trinidad and Tobago.  Slovenia will need Novakovic to be at his sharpest if they are to progress from Group C. Group D Germany Miroslav Klose All of Miroslav Klose's five goals in the 2002 World Cup\u2122 were headers, and he holds the only record for scoring five goals each in consecutive World Cups\u2122. Having won the golden boot in the 2006 World Cup\u2122, he was also one of the two players from the All-Star Team of 2002 to make it again to the All-Star Team of the 2006 World Cup\u2122.  Bayern Munich's heading machine, he also provides good assists and has an innate instinct to make the most of his chances. Serbia Nemanja Vidic Part of the \u2018Famous Four' of Serbia's defence, Nemanja Vidic's aggressiveness on the pitch and perfectly timed tackles caused his side to let in only one goal in the ten-game qualification of the 2006 World Cup\u2122.  In his 2008-09 season with Manchester United, he had a Premiership-record of 14 consecutive clean sheets.  His ability to turn defense into effective counter-attacks makes him an exceptional player. Ghana Michael Kojo Essien A formidable midfield presence, Michael Kojo Essien is Ghana's national hero.  Not afraid to unleash his shooting prowess from the distance, Essien is an all-rounder who excels in defensive play too.  His versatility has deployed him to several roles both defensively and offensively, and his opponents are often wary of him.  The energy, spirit and attitude he puts into every play is more than commendable. Group E Netherlands Dirk Kuyt Having boundless energy and a high work rate, Dirk Kuyt makes excellent assists with his crossing and angled runs in attack.  A selfless player, he tracks back to aid in defense and is always on his feet for any chance at goal.  Scoring three in the 2010 World Cup\u2122 qualifiers, he is a danger in the box to opposing defenders.  Denmark Christian Bager Poulsen Christian Bager Poulsen's two-footed passing ability and charismatic presence makes him a national team favourite.  His playmaking skills and determination on the pitch to destroy even the best attacks all reek of his talent.  He has his aggressive bouts of temper, including the infamous Rosenbeg punch, which have led to disciplinary records, but as a player, he has grown and matured.  He was also the first player to win Danish Player of the Year awards consecutively in 2005-06. Japan Shunsuke Nakamura The hopes of Japan in this World Cup\u2122 lie on the shoulders of Shunsuke Nakamura, famous for his trusty left-foot and accurate free-kick taking abilities.  Named the Most Valuable Player in the 2004 Asian Cup, he was the first Japanese player and second Asian to score in the UEFA Champions League.  Japan is by far the most successful Asian team having won the Asian Cup thrice, and is looking forward to doing Asian football proud in the World Cup\u2122. Group F Italy Gianluigi Buffon Awarded his first Italy cap at the age of 19, Gianluigi Buffon has kept five clean sheets and denied goals to any attacker in the 2006 World Cup\u2122 finals.  He is the epitome of all goalkeeping ability, skill and positional sense.  Guarding the goalmouth with his accuracy in stopping and blocking shots, knowing when to come off the line and when to stay back has led to him attaining Serie A Goalkeeper of the Year a record of nine times. Paraguay Roque Santa Cruz A tall and powerfully built physique gives Roque Santa Cruz the pace to <em>whiz</em> around and have an edge over any defender.  Ambitious with a winning attitude, Cruz's touch often converts into goals and victories.  This Manchester City striker's determination to score made him one of Paraguay's top scorers in the 2010 FIFA World Cup\u2122 qualifiers. New Zealand Ryan Nelsen Captaining the All Whites and as centre-back of Blackburn Rovers, Ryan Nelsen exudes outstanding defensive capabilities.  Five clean sheets in the qualification rounds all speak of his defensive resilience.  They have a relatively easy route than the other Asian World Cup\u2122 participants, and might possibly be this year's underdog team to root for. Group G Brazil Ricardo Izecson dos Santos Leite Kaka's speed, intelligence with the ball and mastery on both feet enables him to weave through midfield, slip past defenders, and find the back of the net repeatedly. Flashy footwork, composure, and an eye for goal are all part of his goal-scoring prowess. Successes at AC Milan and Real Madrid have caused many to rate him as the best player on the planet. Cote D'Ivoire Didier Yves Drogba Tebily Having a slightly later start in his football career, Didier Drogba has muscled his way into prominence with goalscoring determination.  Drogba's pace, strength, aerial accuracy contributes to his assists from both the left and right side of the pitch. An inspiring captain, he helped his team qualify for their first ever World Cup\u2122 in 2006 in Germany.  Named 2009 African Footballer of the Year, this was his second win of this award. Portugal Cristiano Ronaldo Cristiano Ronaldo's trademark stepovers, quick turning, and tricky bypasses leave his opponents tripping over their own feet.  In addition, Ronaldo is the most expensive player in the history of football. An asset to Real Madrid, the goals he contributed are certainly worth the price.  He has many awards to his name, including Manchester United's first Ballon d'Or in 40 years and FIFA World Player of the Year in 2008. Group H Spain Fernando Jose Torres Sanz El Nino, the hero that scored the winner for Spain in the Euro 2008 Final, is in the cream of the crop among today's football stars.  Whenever he plays he is bound to score, fully utilizing his lightning pace, sharp twists and turns, and overpowering skill.  Moving from Atletico Madrid to Liverpool, he is a star wherever he goes. This FIFA World Cup\u2122, Spain's number nine is one to look out for. Switzerland Alexander Frei Switzerland's captain and all-time top scorer, Alexander Frei currently plays for FC Basel.  A steady player who never fails to assist and contribute last-minute goals, Frei is an inspiring leader and an able team player at the same time.  Swiss Footballer of the Year in 2004 and 2007, his country will be depending on him to put in some goals. Chile Mark Gonzalez Burning down the left flanks, Mark Gonzalez is nicknamed \"Speedy Gonzalez\". Having stints at Real Betis, Liverpool and Club Deportivo Universidad Catolica, he has a wealth of experience, including being the highest-capped player in the squad. Born in South Africa but moving on to Chile later on, Gonzalez looks set to score in the country he was born in.",
