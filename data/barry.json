            "en": "iPads, E-Readers, Notebook Computers Top Wish Lists    A report by the Consumer Electronics Association says electronics are among the most popular gifts being bought this holiday season. It also predicts that spending on these devices will set new records. The CEA says consumers will spend an average of about two hundred thirty dollars on electronics. This is five percent more than last year and the highest level since the organization began keeping records of holiday spending. Jim <em>Barry</em> is a spokesman for the Consumer Electronics Association. He says the CEA study found that electronics represent three of the top five things on its \"holiday gift wish list\" this year. JIM <em>BARRY</em>: \"Notebook computers are at the top, followed by iPads and then e-readers. IPad is a touch-screen tablet computer and that's really the big player in that category.\" The computer company Apple began selling its small, touch-screen computers in April. The company reported that it had sold more than three million iPads by the end of July. Its latest earnings report shows sales of more than four million iPads during the last three months of this year. People use the touch-screen computers to surf the Web, write e-mails, watch movies and read books.\u00a0 Since the iPad's release earlier this year, several other companies have come out with their own tablet computers just in time for Christmas. A report from the e-Marketer research group predicts that worldwide, tablet sales will reach more than eighty-one million in two thousand twelve. Still, Jim <em>Barry</em> says these devices are facing tough competition this year from another Christmas favorite. JIM <em>BARRY</em>: \"Another hot category right behind that are the e-readers. So you can read on an iPad or a touch-screen tablet, but the e-book readers are less expensive. The Kindle is the market leader there, from Amazon.\u00a0 But you also have the Nook from Barnes and Noble and the e-reader from Sony. And you have more and more of those e-readers coming into the market as well.\" Jim <em>Barry</em> says modern technology is changing the way people relate and increasing their expectations for their electronic devices. JIM <em>BARRY</em>: \"The buzz phrase in the industry is 'content anywhere.' And it's really the ability to take your information and entertainment with you just about anywhere to stay connected to your work and your family. And that's what all of these devices do.\" The Consumer Electronics Association report found that iPod music players are also in high demand this holiday season. So are video game systems and digital cameras. But not all of the things on the holiday gift wish list involved electronics. Clothes, cars and motorcycles also made the list. So did family togetherness and good health. And the one thing that people wanted most? JIM <em>BARRY</em>: \"At the top of the list was peace and happiness.\" That is also our wish for you this holiday season.",

            "en": "Strong quake hits New Zealand, causing injuries          A strong, 6.3-magnitude earthquake rocked the southern New Zealand city of Christchurch on Tuesday, seriously injuring people and damaging buildings throughout the city. Live video footage showed parts of buildings collapsed into the streets, which were strewn with bricks and shattered concrete. Sidewalks and roads were cracked and split, and hundreds of dazed, screaming and crying residents wandered through the streets as sirens blared throughout the city. Christchurch Mayor Bob Parker said he was on the top floor of the city council building when the quake hit just before 1 p.m. local time. \"I got down onto the street and there were scenes of great confusion, a lot of very upset people,\" he said. \"I know of people in our building who are injured and I've had some reports of serious injuries throughout the city.\" Radio New Zealand reported that a church near the city center collapsed. The station also said staffers in its Christchurch newsroom had to cling to their desks during the shaking, with large filing cabinets toppling over. The airport was closed and Christchurch Hospital was evacuated. Power and telephone lines were knocked out, and pipes burst, flooding the streets with water. Some cars apparently parked on the street were buried under rubble. \"What I can see from where I am in the central city is that there are significant amounts of additional damage,\" Parker said. The U.S. Geological Survey said the temblor was centered 3 miles (5 kilometers) from the city at a depth of 2.5 miles (4 kilometers). A 5.6-magnitude aftershock hit shortly after 7 miles (11 kilometers) east of the city at a depth of 3.7 miles (6 kilometers). \"When the shaking had stopped I looked out of the window, which gives a great view onto Christchurch, and there was just dust,\" said city councilman <em>Barry</em> Corbett, who was on one of the top floors of the city council building when the quake struck. \"It was evident straight away that a lot of buildings had gone.\" Christchurch has been hit by hundreds of aftershocks since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck Sept. 4 last year, causing extensive damage and a handful of injuries, but no deaths. The city is home to about 350,000 people and is considered a tourist center and gateway to the South Island. New Zealand sits on the Pacific \"ring of fire\" \u2014 an arc of earthquake and volcanic zones stretching from Chile in South America through Alaska and down through the South Pacific. It records more than 14,000 earthquakes a year \u2014 but only about 150 are felt by residents, and fewer than 10 a year do any damage. The Sept. 4 quake wrecked hundreds of buildings in the city, and caused an estimated 4 billion New Zealand dollars ($3 billion) in damage. A strong aftershock in December caused further damage to buildings. The city was still rebuilding from those quakes when Tuesday's temblor hit.",
