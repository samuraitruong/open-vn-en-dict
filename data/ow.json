            "en": "3          3. PHENOMENON When I opened my eyes in the morning, something was different.  It was the light. It was still the gray-green light of a cloudy day in the forest, but it was clearer somehow. I realized there was no fog veiling my window. I jumped up to look outside, and then groaned in horror. A fine layer of snow covered the yard, dusted the top of my truck, and whitened the road. But that wasn't the worst part. All the rain from yesterday had frozen solid \u2014 coating the needles on the trees in fantastic, gorgeous patterns, and making the driveway a deadly ice slick. I had enough trouble not falling down when the ground was dry; it might be safer for me to go back to bed now. Charlie had left for work before I got downstairs. In a lot of ways, living with Charlie was like having my own place, and I found myself reveling in the aloneness instead of being lonely. I threw down a quick bowl of cereal and some orange juice from the carton. I felt excited to go to school, and that scared me. I knew it wasn't the stimulating learning environment I was anticipating, or seeing my new set of friends. If I was being honest with myself, I knew I was eager to get to school because I would see Edward Cullen. And that was very, very stupid. I should be avoiding him entirely after my brainless and embarrassing babbling yesterday. And I was suspicious of him; why should he lie about his eyes? I was still frightened of the hostility I sometimes felt emanating from him, and I was still tongue-tied whenever I pictured his perfect face. I was well aware that my league and his league were spheres that did not touch. So I \u00a0shouldn't be at all anxious to see him today. It took every ounce of my concentration to make it down the icy brick driveway alive. I almost lost my balance when I finally got to the truck, but I managed to cling to the side mirror and save myself. Clearly, today was going to be nightmarish. Driving to school, I distracted myself from my fear of falling and my unwanted speculations about Edward Cullen by thinking about Mike and Eric, and the obvious difference in how teenage boys responded to me here. I was sure I looked exactly the same as I had in Phoenix. Maybe it was just that the boys back home had watched me pass slowly through all the awkward phases of adolescence and still thought of me that way.  Perhaps it was because I was a novelty here, where novelties were few and far between. Possibly my crippling clumsiness was seen as endearing rather than pathetic, casting me as a damsel in distress. Whatever the reason, Mike's puppy dog behavior and Eric's apparent rivalry with him were disconcerting. I wasn't sure if I didn't prefer being ignored.  My truck seemed to have no problem with the black ice that covered the roads. I drove very slowly, though, not wanting to carve a path of destruction through Main Street. When I got out of my truck at school, I saw why I'd had so little trouble. Something silver caught my eye, and I walked to the back of the truck \u2014 carefully holding the side for support \u2014 to examine my tires.  There were thin chains crisscrossed in diamond shapes around them. Charlie had gotten up who knows how early to put snow chains on my truck.  My throat suddenly felt tight. I wasn't used to being taken care of, and Charlie's unspoken concern caught me by surprise.  I was standing by the back corner of the truck, struggling to fight back the sudden wave of emotion the snow chains had brought on, when I heard an odd sound. It was a high-pitched screech, and it was fast becoming painfully loud. I looked up, startled. I saw several things simultaneously. Nothing was moving in slow motion, the way it does in the movies. Instead, the adrenaline rush seemed to make my brain work much faster, and I was able to absorb in clear detail several things at once. Edward Cullen was standing four cars down from me, staring at me in horror. His face stood out from a sea of faces, all frozen in the same mask of shock. But of more immediate importance was the dark blue van that was skidding, tires locked and squealing against the brakes, spinning wildly across the ice of the parking lot. It was going to hit the back corner of my truck, and I was standing between them. I didn't even have time to close my eyes. Just before I heard the shattering crunch of the van folding around the truck bed, something hit me, hard, but not from the direction I was expecting. My head cracked against the icy blacktop, and I felt something solid and cold pinning me to the ground. I was lying on the pavement behind the tan car I'd parked next to. But I didn't have a chance to notice anything else, because the van was still coming. It had curled gratingly around the end of the truck and, still spinning and sliding, was about to collide with me again. A low oath made me aware that someone was with me, and the voice was impossible not to recognize. Two long, white hands shot out protectively in front of me, and the van shuddered to a stop a foot from my face, the large hands fitting providentially into a deep dent in the side of the van's body. Then his hands moved so fast they blurred. One was suddenly gripping under the body of the van, and something was dragging me, swinging my legs around like a rag doll's, till they hit the tire of the tan car. A groaning metallic thud hurt my ears, and the van settled, glass popping, onto the asphalt \u2014 exactly where, a second ago, my legs had been. It was absolutely silent for one long second before the screaming began.  In the abrupt bedlam, I could hear more than one person shouting my name. But more clearly than all the yelling, I could hear Edward Cullen's low, frantic voice in my ear. \"Bella? Are you all right?\" \"I'm fine.\" My voice sounded strange. I tried to sit up, and realized he was holding me against the side of his body in an iron grasp. \"Be careful,\" he warned as I struggled. \"I think you hit your head pretty hard.\" I became aware of a throbbing ache centered above my left ear. \"<em>Ow</em>,\" I said, surprised. \"That's what I thought.\" His voice, amazingly, sounded like he was suppressing laughter. \"How in the\u2026\" I trailed off, trying to clear my head, get my bearings. \"How did you get over here so fast?\" \"I was standing right next to you, Bella,\" he said, his tone serious again. I turned to sit up, and this time he let me, releasing his hold around my waist and sliding as far from me as he could in the limited space. I looked at his concerned, innocent expression and was disoriented again by the force of his gold-colored eyes. What was I asking him? And then they found us, a crowd of people with tears streaming down their faces, shouting at each other, shouting at us. \"Don't move,\" someone instructed. \"Get Tyler out of the van!\" someone else shouted. There was a flurry of activity around us. I tried to get up, but Edward's cold hand pushed my shoulder down. \"Just stay put for now.\" \"But it's cold,\" I complained. It surprised me when he chuckled under his breath. There was an edge to the sound. \"You were over there,\" I suddenly remembered, and his chuckle stopped short. \"You were by your car.\" His expression turned hard. \"No, I wasn't.\" \"I saw you.\" All around us was chaos. I could hear the gruffer voices of adults arriving on the scene. But I obstinately held on to our argument; I was right, and he was going to admit it. \"Bella, I was standing with you, and I pulled you out of the way.\" He unleashed the full, devastating power of his eyes on me, as if trying to communicate something crucial. \"No.\" I set my jaw. The gold in his eyes blazed. \"Please, Bella.\" \"Why?\" I demanded. \"Trust me,\" he pleaded, his soft voice overwhelming. I could hear the sirens now. \"Will you promise to explain everything to me later?\" \"Fine,\" he snapped, abruptly exasperated. \"Fine,\" I repeated angrily. It took six EMTs and two teachers \u2014 Mr. Varner and Coach Clapp \u2014 to shift the van far enough away from us to bring the stretchers in. Edward vehemently refused his, and I tried to do the same, but the traitor told them I'd hit my head and probably had a concussion. I almost died of humiliation when they put on the neck brace. It looked like the entire school was there, watching soberly as they loaded me in the back of the ambulance. Edward got to ride in the front. It was maddening.  To make matters worse, Chief Swan arrived before they could get me safely away. \"Bella!\" he yelled in panic when he recognized me on the stretcher. \"I'm completely fine, Char \u2014 Dad,\" I sighed. \"There's nothing wrong with me.\" He turned to the closest EMT for a second opinion. I tuned him out to consider the jumble of inexplicable images churning chaotically in my head. When they'd lifted me away from the car, I had seen the deep dent in the tan car's bumper \u2014 a very distinct dent that fit the contours of Edward's shoulders\u2026 as if he had braced himself against the car with enough force to damage the metal frame\u2026 And then there was his family, looking on from the distance, with expressions that ranged from disapproval to fury but held no hint of concern for their brother's safety. I tried to think of a logical solution that could explain what I had just seen \u2014 a solution that excluded the assumption that I was insane. Naturally, the ambulance got a police escort to the county hospital. I felt ridiculous the whole time they were unloading me. What made it worse was that Edward simply glided through the hospital doors under his own power. I ground my teeth together. They put me in the emergency room, a long room with a line of beds separated by pastel-patterned curtains. A nurse put a pressure cuff on my arm and a thermometer under my tongue. Since no one bothered pulling the curtain around to give me some privacy, I decided I wasn't obligated to wear the stupid-looking neck brace anymore. When the nurse walked away, I quickly unfastened the Velcro and threw it under the bed. There was another flurry of hospital personnel, another stretcher brought to the bed next to me. I recognized Tyler Crowley from my Government class beneath the bloodstained bandages wrapped tightly around his head.  Tyler looked a hundred times worse than I felt. But he was staring anxiously at me. \"Bella, I'm so sorry!\" \"I'm fine, Tyler \u2014 you look awful, are you all right?\" As we spoke, nurses began unwinding his soiled bandages, exposing a myriad of shallow slices all over his forehead and left cheek. He ignored me. \"I thought I was going to kill you! I was going too fast, and I hit the ice wrong\u2026\" He winced as one nurse started dabbing at his face. \"Don't worry about it; you missed me.\" \"How did you get out of the way so fast? You were there, and then you were gone\u2026\" \"Umm\u2026 Edward pulled me out of the way.\" He looked confused. \"Who?\" \"Edward Cullen \u2014 he was standing next to me.\" I'd always been a terrible liar; I didn't sound convincing at all. \"Cullen? I didn't see him\u2026 wow, it was all so fast, I guess. Is he okay?\" \"I think so. He's here somewhere, but they didn't make him use a stretcher.\" I knew I wasn't crazy. What had happened? There was no way to explain away what I'd seen. They wheeled me away then, to X-ray my head. I told them there was nothing wrong, and I was right. Not even a concussion. I asked if I could leave, but the nurse said I had to talk to a doctor first. So I was trapped in the ER, waiting, harassed by Tyler's constant apologies and promises to make it up to me. No matter how many times I tried to convince him I was fine, he continued to torment himself. Finally, I closed my eyes and ignored him. He kept up a remorseful mumbling. \"Is she sleeping?\" a musical voice asked. My eyes flew open. Edward was standing at the foot of my bed, smirking. I glared at him. It wasn't easy \u2014 it would have been more natural to ogle. \"Hey, Edward, I'm really sorry \u2014\" Tyler began. Edward lifted a hand to stop him. \"No blood, no foul,\" he said, flashing his brilliant teeth. He moved to sit on the edge of Tyler's bed, facing me. He smirked again. \"So, what's the verdict?\" he asked me. \"There's nothing wrong with me at all, but they won't let me go,\" I complained. \"How come you aren't strapped to a gurney like the rest of us?\" \"It's all about who you know,\" he answered. \"But don't worry, I came to spring you.\" Then a doctor walked around the corner, and my mouth fell open. He was young, he was blond\u2026 and he was handsomer than any movie star I'd ever seen. He was pale, though, and tired-looking, with circles under his eyes. From Charlie's description, this had to be Edward's father. \"So, Miss Swan,\" Dr. Cullen said in a remarkably appealing voice, \"how are you feeling?\" \"I'm fine,\" I said, for the last time, I hoped. He walked to the lightboard on the wall over my head, and turned it on. \"Your X-rays look good,\" he said. \"Does your head hurt? Edward said you hit it pretty hard.\" \"It's fine,\" I repeated with a sigh, throwing a quick scowl toward Edward. The doctor's cool fingers probed lightly along my skull. He noticed when I winced. \"Tender?\" he asked. \"Not really.\" I'd had worse. I heard a chuckle, and looked over to see Edward's patronizing smile. My eyes narrowed. \"Well, your father is in the waiting room \u2014 you can go home with him now. But come back if you feel dizzy or have trouble with your eyesight at all.\" \"Can't I go back to school?\" I asked, imagining Charlie trying to be attentive. \"Maybe you should take it easy today.\" I glanced at Edward. \"Does he get to go to school?\" \"Someone has to spread the good news that we survived,\" Edward said smugly. \"Actually,\" Dr. Cullen corrected, \"most of the school seems to be in the waiting room.\" \"Oh no,\" I moaned, covering my face with my hands. Dr. Cullen raised his eyebrows. \"Do you want to stay?\" \"No, no!\" I insisted, throwing my legs over the side of the bed and hopping down quickly. Too quickly \u2014 I staggered, and Dr. Cullen caught me. He looked concerned. \"I'm fine,\" I assured him again. No need to tell him my balance problems had nothing to do with hitting my head. \"Take some Tylenol for the pain,\" he suggested as he steadied me.  \"It doesn't hurt that bad,\" I insisted. \"It sounds like you were extremely lucky,\" Dr. Cullen said, smiling as he signed my chart with a flourish. \"Lucky Edward happened to be standing next to me,\" I amended with a hard glance at the subject of my statement. \"Oh, well, yes,\" Dr. Cullen agreed, suddenly occupied with the papers in front of him. Then he looked away, at Tyler, and walked to the next bed. My intuition flickered; the doctor was in on it. \"I'm afraid that you'll have to stay with us just a little bit longer,\" he said to Tyler, and began checking his cuts. As soon as the doctor's back was turned, I moved to Edward's side. \"Can I talk to you for a minute?\" I hissed under my breath. He took a step back from me, his jaw suddenly clenched. \"Your father is waiting for you,\" he said through his teeth \u2013  I glanced at Dr. Cullen and Tyler. \"I'd like to speak with you alone, if you don't mind,\" I pressed. He glared, and then turned his back and strode down the long room. I nearly had to run to keep up. As soon as we turned the corner into a short hallway, he spun around to face me. \"What do you want?\" he asked, sounding annoyed. His eyes were cold. His unfriendliness intimidated me. My words came out with less severity than I'd intended. \"You owe me an explanation,\" I reminded him. \"I saved your life \u2014 I don't owe you anything.\" I flinched back from the resentment in his voice. \"You promised.\" \"Bella, you hit your head, you don't know what you're talking about.\" His tone was cutting. My temper flared now, and I glared defiantly at him. \"There's nothing wrong with my head.\" He glared back. \"What do you want from me, Bella?\" \"I want to know the truth,\" I said. \"I want to know why I'm lying for you.\" \"What do you think happened?\" he snapped. It came out in a rush. \"All I know is that you weren't anywhere near me \u2014 Tyler didn't see you, either, so don't tell me I hit my head too hard. That van was going to crush us both \u2014 and it didn't, and your hands left dents in the side of it \u2014 and you left a dent in the other car, and you're not hurt at all \u2014 and the van should have smashed my legs, but you were holding it up\u2026\" I could hear how crazy it sounded, and I couldn't continue. I was so mad I could feel the tears coming; I tried to force them back by grinding my teeth together. He was staring at me incredulously. But his face was tense, defensive. \"You think I lifted a van off you?\" His tone questioned my sanity, but it only made me more suspicious. It was like a perfectly delivered line by a skilled actor. I merely nodded once, jaw tight. \"Nobody will believe that, you know.\" His voice held an edge of derision now. \"I'm not going to tell anybody.\" I said each word slowly, carefully controlling my anger. Surprise flitted across his face. \"Then why does it matter?\" \"It matters to me,\" I insisted. \"I don't like to lie \u2014 so there'd better be a good reason why I'm doing it.\" \"Can't you just thank me and get over it?\" \"Thank you.\" I waited, fuming and expectant. \"You're not going to let it go, are you?\" \"No.\" \"In that case\u2026 I hope you enjoy disappointment.\" We scowled at each other in silence. I was the first to speak, trying to keep myself focused. I was in danger of being distracted by his livid, glorious face. It was like trying to stare down a destroying angel. \"Why did you even bother?\" I asked frigidly. He paused, and for a brief moment his stunning face was unexpectedly vulnerable. \"I don't know,\" he whispered. And then he turned his back on me and walked away. I was so angry, it took me a few minutes until I could move. When I could walk, I made my way slowly to the exit at the end of the hallway. The waiting room was more unpleasant than I'd feared. It seemed like every face I knew in Forks was there, staring at me. Charlie rushed to my side; I put up my hands. \"There's nothing wrong with me,\" I assured him sullenly. I was still aggravated, not in the mood for chitchat. \"What did the doctor say?\" \"Dr. Cullen saw me, and he said I was fine and I could go home.\" I sighed. Mike and Jessica and Eric were all there, beginning to converge on us. \"Let's go,\" I urged. Charlie put one arm behind my back, not quite touching me, and led me to the glass doors of the exit. I waved sheepishly at my friends, hoping to convey that they didn't need to worry anymore. It was a huge relief\u2014 the first time I'd ever felt that way \u2014 to get into the cruiser. We drove in silence. I was so wrapped up in my thoughts that I barely knew Charlie was there. I was positive that Edward's defensive behavior in the hall was a confirmation of the bizarre things I still could hardly believe I'd witnessed. When we got to the house, Charlie finally spoke. \"Um\u2026 you'll need to call Ren\u00e9e.\" He hung his head, guilty. I was appalled. \"You told Mom!\" \"Sorry.\" I slammed the cruiser's door a little harder than necessary on my way out. My mom was in hysterics, of course. I had to tell her I felt fine at least thirty times before she would calm down. She begged me to come home \u2014 forgetting the fact that home was empty at the moment \u2014 but her pleas were easier to resist than I would have thought. I was consumed by the mystery Edward presented. And more than a little obsessed by Edward himself. Stupid, stupid, stupid. I wasn't as eager to escape Forks as I should be, as any normal, sane person would be. I decided I might as well go to bed early that night. Charlie continued to watch me anxiously, and it was getting on my nerves. I stopped on my way to grab three Tylenol from the bathroom. They did help, and, as the pain eased, I drifted to sleep. That was the first night I dreamed of Edward Cullen.",

            "en": "7 REPETITION          18. THE FUNERAL I SPRINTED DOWN THE STAIRS AND THREW THE DOOR open. It was Jacob, of course. Even blind, Alice wasn't slow. He was standing about six feet back from the door, his nose wrinkled in distaste, but his face otherwise smooth\u2014masklike. He didn't fool me; I could see the faint trembling of his hands. Hostility rolled off of him in waves. It brought back that awful afternoon when he'd chosen Sam over me, and I felt my chin jerk up defensively in response. Jacob's Rabbit idled by the curb with Jared behind the wheel and Embry in the passenger seat. I understood what this meant: they were afraid to let him come here alone. It made me sad, and a little annoyed. The Cullens weren't like that. \"Hey,\" I finally said when he didn't speak. Jake pursed his lips, still hanging back from the door. His eyes flickered across the front of the house. I ground my teeth. \"She's not here. Do you need something?\" He hesitated. \"You're alone?\" \"Yes.\" I sighed. \"Can I talk to you a minute?\" \"Of course you can, Jacob. Come on in.\" Jacob glanced over his shoulder at his friends in the car. I saw Embry shake his head just a tiny bit. For some reason, this bugged me to no end. My teeth clenched together again. \"Chicken\" I mumbled under my breath. Jake's eyes flashed back to me, his thick, black brows pushing into a furious angle over \u00a0his deep-set eyes. His jaw set, and he marched\u2014there was no other way to describe the way he moved\u2014up the sidewalk and shrugged past me into the house. I locked gazes with first Jared and then Embry\u2014I didn't like the hard way they eyed me; did they really think I would let anything hurt Jacob?\u2014before I shut the door on them. Jacob was in the hall behind me, staring at the mess of blankets in the living room. \"Slumber party?\" he asked, his tone sarcastic. \"Yeah,\" I answered with the same level of acid. I didn't like Jacob when he acted this way. \"What's it to you? He wrinkled his nose again like he smelled something unpleasant. \"Where's your friend'?\" I could hear the quotation marks in his tone. \"She had some errands to run. Look, Jacob, what do you want?\" Something about the room seemed to make him edgier\u2014his long arms were quivering. He didn't answer my question. Instead he moved on to the kitchen, his restless eyes darting everywhere. I followed him. He paced back and forth along the short counter. \"Hey,\" I said, putting myself in his way. He stopped pacing and stared down at me. \"What's your problem?\" \"I don't like having to be here.\" That stung. I winced, and his eyes tightened. \"Then I'm sorry you had to come,\" I muttered. \"Why don't you tell me what you need so you can leave?\" \"I just have to ask you a couple of questions. It shouldn't take long. We have to get back for the funeral.\" \"Okay. Get it over with then.\" I was probably overdoing it with the antagonism, but I didn't want him to see how much this hurt. I knew I wasn't being fair. After all, I'd picked the bloodsucker over him last night. I'd hurt him first. He took a deep breath, and his trembling fingers were suddenly still. His face smoothed into a serene mask. \"One of the Cullens is staying here with you,\" he stated. \"Yes. Alice Cullen.\" He nodded thoughtfully. \"How long is she here for?\" \"As long as she wants to be.\" The belligerence was still there in my tone. \"It's an open invitation.\" \"Do you think you could\u2026 please\u2026 explain to her about the other one\u2014Victoria?\" I paled. \"I told her about that.\" He nodded. \"You should know that we can only watch our own lands with a Cullen here. You'll only be safe in La Push. I can't protect you here anymore.\" \"Okay,\" I said in a small voice. He looked away then, out the back windows. He didn't continue. \"Is that all?\" He kept his eyes on the glass as he answered. \"Just one more thing.\" I waited, but he didn't continue. \"Yes?\" I finally prompted. \"Are the rest of them coming back now?\" he asked in a cool, quiet voice. It reminded me of Sam's always calm manner. Jacob was becoming more like Sam\u2026 I wondered why that bothered me so much. Now I didn't speak. He looked back at my face with probing eyes. \"Well?\" he asked. He struggled to conceal the tension behind his serene expression. \"No.\" I said finally. Grudgingly. \"They aren't coming back.\" His expression didn't change. \"Okay. That's all.\" I glared at him, annoyance rekindled. \"Well, run along now. Go tell Sam that the scary monsters aren't coming to get you.\" \"Okay,\" he repeated, still calm. That seemed to be it. Jacob walked swiftly from the kitchen. I waited to hear the front door open, but I heard nothing. I could hear the clock over the stove ticking, and I marveled again at how quiet he'd become. What a disaster. How could I have alienated him so completely in such a short amount of time?  Would he forgive me when Alice was gone? What if he didn't? I slumped against the counter and buried my face in my hands. How had I made such a mess of everything? But what could I have done differently? Even in hindsight, I couldn't think of any better way, any perfect course of action. \"Bella\u2026 ?\" Jacob asked in a troubled voice. I pulled my face out of my hands to see Jacob hesitating in the kitchen doorway; he hadn't left when I'd thought. It was only when I saw the clear drops sparkling in my hands that I realized I was crying. Jacob's calm expression was gone; his face was anxious and unsure. He walked quickly back to stand in front of me, ducking his head so that his eyes were closer to being on the same level with mine. \"Did it again, didn't I?\" \"Did what?\" I asked, my voice cracking. \"Broke my promise. Sorry.\" \"'It\u2019s okay,\" I mumbled. \"I started it this time.\" His face twisted. \"I knew how you felt about them. It shouldn't have taken me by surprise like that.\" I could see the revulsion in his eyes. I wanted to explain to him what Alice was really like, to defend her against the judgments he'd made, but something warned me that now was not the time. So I just said, \"Sorry,\" again. \"Let's not worry about it, okay? She's just visiting, right? She'll leave, and things will go back to normal.\" \"Can't I be friends with you both at the same time?\" I asked, my voice not hiding an ounce of the hurt I felt. He shook his head slowly. \"No, I don't think you can.\" I sniffed and stared at his big feet. \"But you'll wait, right? You'll still be my friend, even though I love Alice, too?\" I didn't look up, afraid to see what he'd think of that last part. It took him a minute to answer, so I was probably right not to look. \"Yeah, I'll always be your friend,\" he said gruffly. \"No matter what you love.\" \"Promise?\" \"Promise.\" I felt his arms wind around me, and I leaned against his chest, still sniffling. \"This sucks.\" \"Yeah.\" Then he sniffed my hair and said, \"Ew.\" \"What?\" I demanded. I looked up to see that his nose was wrinkled again. \"Why does everyone keep doing that to me? I don't smell!\" He smiled a little. \"Yes, you do\u2014you smell like them. Blech. Too sweet\u2014sickly sweet. And\u2026 icy. It burns my nose.\" \"Really?\" That was strange. Alice smelled unbelievably wonderful. To a human, anyway. \"But why would Alice think I smelled, too, then?\" That wiped his smile away. \"Huh. Maybe I don't smell so good to her, either. Huh.\" \"Well, you both smell fine to me.\" I rested my head against him again. I was going to miss him terribly when he walked out my door. It was a nasty catch-22\u2014on the one hand, I wanted Alice to stay forever. I was going to die\u2014metaphorically\u2014when she left me. But how was I supposed to go without seeing Jake for any length of time? What a mess, I thought again. \"I'll miss you,\" Jacob whispered, echoing my thoughts. \"Every minute. I hope she leaves soon.\" \"It really doesn't have to be that way, Jake.\" He sighed. \"Yes, it really does. Bella. You\u2026 love her. So I'd better not get anywhere near her. I'm not sure that I'm even-tempered enough to handle that. Sam would be mad if I broke the treaty, and\"\u2014his voice turned sarcastic\u2014\"you probably wouldn't like it too much if I killed your friend.\" I recoiled from him when he said that, but he only tightened his arms, refusing to let me escape. \"There's no point in avoiding the truth. That's the way things are, Bells.\" \"I do not like the way things are.\" Jacob freed one arm so that he could cup his big brown hand under my chin and make me look at him. \"Yeah. It was easier when we were both human, wasn't it?\" I sighed. We stared at each other for a long moment. His hand smoldered against my skin. In my face, I knew there was nothing but wistful sadness\u2014I didn't want to have to say goodbye now, no matter for how short a time. At first his face reflected mine, but then, as neither of us looked away, his expression changed. He released me, lifting his other hand to brush his fingertips along my cheek, trailing them down to my jaw. I could feel his fingers tremble\u2014not with anger this time. He pressed his palm against my cheek, so that my face was trapped between his burning hands. \"Bella,\" he whispered. I was frozen. No! I hadn't made this decision yet. I didn't know if I could do this, and now I was out of time to think. But I would have been a fool if I thought rejecting him now would have no consequences. I stared back at him. He was not my Jacob, but he could be. His face was familiar and beloved. In so many real ways, I did love him. He was my comfort, my safe harbor. Right now, I could choose to have him belong to me. Alice was back for the moment, but that changed nothing. True love was forever lost. The prince was never coming back to kiss me awake from my enchanted sleep. I was not a princess, after all. So what was the fairy-tale protocol for other kisses? The mundane kind that didn't break any spells? Maybe it would be easy\u2014like holding his hand or having his arms around me. Maybe it would feel nice. Maybe it wouldn't feel like a betrayal. Besides, who was I betraying, anyway? Just \u00a0myself. Keeping his eyes on mine, Jacob began to bend his face toward me. And I was still absolutely undecided. .  The shrill ring of the phone made us both jump, but it did not break his focus. He took his hand from under my chin and reached over me to grab the receiver, but still held my face securely with the hand against my cheek. His dark eyes did not free mine. I was too muddled to react, even to take advantage of the distraction. \"Swan residence,\" Jacob said, his husky voice low and intense. Someone answered, and Jacob altered in an instant. He straightened up, and his hand dropped from my face. His eyes went flat, his face blank, and I would have bet the measly remainder of my college and that it was Alice. I recovered myself and held out my hand for the phone. Jacob ignored me. \"He's not here,\" Jacob said, and the words were menacing. There was some very short reply, a request for more information it seemed, because he added unwillingly, \"He's at the funeral.\" Then Jacob hung up the phone. \"Filthy bloodsucker,\" he muttered under his breath. The face he turned back to me was the bitter mask again. \"Who did you just hang up on?\" I gasped, infuriated. \"In my house, and on my phone?\" \"Easy! He hung up on me!\" \"He? Who was it?!\" He sneered the title. \"Dr. Carlisle Cullen.\" \"Why didn't you let me talk to him?!\" \"He didn't ask for you,\" Jacob said coldly. His face was smooth, expressionless, but his hands shook. \"He asked where Charlie was and I told him. I don't think I broke any rules of etiquette.\" \"You listen to me, Jacob Black\u2014\" But he obviously wasn't listening. He looked quickly over his shoulder, as if someone had called his name from the other room. His eyes went wide and his body stiff, then he started trembling. I listened too, automatically, but heard nothing. \"Bye, Bells,\" he spit out, and wheeled toward the front door. I ran after him. \"What is it?\" And then I ran into him, as he rocked back on his heels, cussing under his breath. He spun around again, knocking me sideways. I bobbled and fell to the floor, my legs tangled with his. \"Shoot, <em>ow</em>!\" I protested as he hurriedly jerked his legs free one at a time. I struggled to pull myself up as he darted for the back door; he suddenly froze again. Alice stood motionless at the foot of the stairs. \"Bella,\" she choked. I scrambled to my feet and lurched to her side. Her eyes were dazed and far away, her face drawn and whiter than bone. Her slim body trembled to an inner turmoil. \"Alice, what's wrong?\" I cried. I put my hands on her face, trying to calm her. Her eyes focused on mine abruptly, wide with pain. \"Edward,\" was all she whispered. My body reacted faster than my mind was able to catch up with the implications of her reply. I didn't at first understand why the room was spinning or where the hollow roar in my ears was coming from. My mind labored, unable to make sense of Alice's bleak face and how it could possibly relate to Edward, while my body was already swaying, seeking the relief of unconsciousness before the reality could hit me. The stairway tilted at the oddest angle. Jacob's furious voice was suddenly in my ear, hissing out a stream of profanities. I felt a vague disapproval. His new friends were clearly a bad influence. I was on the couch without understanding how I got there, and Jacob was still swearing. It felt like there was an earthquake\u2014the couch was shaking under me. \"What did you do to her?\" he demanded. Alice ignored him. \"Bella? Bella, snap out of it. We have to hurry.\" \"Stay back,\" Jacob warned. \"Calm down, Jacob Black,\" Alice ordered. \"You don't want to do that so close to her.\" \"I don't think I'll have any problem keeping my focus,\" he retorted, but his voice sounded a little cooler. \"Alice?\" My voice was weak. \"What happened?\" I asked, even though I didn't want to hear. \"I don't know,\" she suddenly wailed. \"What is he thinking?!\" I labored to pull myself up despite the dizziness. I realized it was Jacob's arm I was gripping for balance. He was the one shaking, not the couch. Alice was pulling a small silver phone from her bag when my eyes relocated her. Her fingers dialed the numbers so fast they were a blur. \"Rose, I need to talk to Carlisle now.\" Her voice whipped through the words. \"Fine, as soon as he's back. No, I'll be on a plane. Look, have you heard anything from Edward?\" Alice paused now, listening with an expression that grew more appalled every second. Her mouth opened into a little O of horror, and the phone shook in her hand. \"Why?\" she gasped. \"Why would you do that, Rosalie?\" Whatever the answer was, it made her jaw tighten in anger. Her eyes flashed and narrowed. \"Well, you're wrong on both counts, though, Rosalie, so that would be a problem, don't you think?\" she asked acidly. \"Yes, that's right. She's absolutely fine\u2014I was wrong\u2026 It's a long story\u2026 But you're wrong about that part, too, that's why I'm calling\u2026 Yes, that's exactly what I saw.\" Alice's voice was very hard and her lips were pulled back from her teeth.  \"It's a bit late for that, Rose.\u00a0 Save your remorse for someone who believes it.\" Alice snapped the phone shut with a sharp twist of her fingers. Her eyes were tortured as she turned to face me. \"Alice,\" I blurted out quickly. I couldn't let her speak yet. I needed a few more seconds before she spoke and her words destroyed what was left of my life. \"Alice, Carlisle is back, though. He called just before\u2026\" She stared at me blankly. \"How long ago?\" she asked in a hollow voice. \"Half a minute before you showed up.\" \"What did he say?\" She really focused now, waiting for my answer. \"I didn't talk to him.\" My eyes flickered to Jacob. Alice turned her penetrating gaze on him. He flinched, but held his place next to me. He sit awkwardly, almost as if he were trying to shield me with his body. \"He asked for Charlie, and I told him Charlie wasn't here,\" Jacob muttered resentfully. \"Is that everything?\" Alice demanded, her voice like ice. \"Then he hung up on me,\" Jacob spit back. A tremor rolled down his spine, shaking me with it.  \"You told him Charlie was at the funeral,\" I reminded him. Alice jerked her head back toward me \"What were his exact words?\" \"He said, 'He's not here,' and when Carlisle asked where Charlie was, Jacob said, 'At the funeral.'\" Alice moaned and sank to her knees. \"Tell me Alice,\" I whispered. \"That wasn't Carlisle on the phone,\" she said hopelessly. \"Are you calling me a liar?\" Jacob snarled from beside me. Alice ignored him, focusing on my bewildered face. \"It was Edward.\" The words were just a choked whisper. \"He thinks you're dead.\" My mind started to work again. These words weren't the ones I'd been afraid of, and the relief cleared my head. \"Rosalie told him I killed myself, didn't she?\" I said, sighing as I relaxed. \"Yes,\" Alice admitted, her eyes flashing hard again. \"In her defense, she did believe it. They rely on my sight far too much for something that works so imperfectly. But for her to track him down to tell him this! Didn't she realize\u2026 or care\u2026 ?\" Her voice faded away in horror. \"And when Edward called here, he thought Jacob meant my funeral,\" I realized. It stung to know how close I'd been, just inches away from his voice. My nails dug into Jacob's arm, but he didn't flinch. Alice looked at me strangely. \"You're not upset,\" she whispered. \"Well, it's really rotten timing, but it will all get straightened out. The next time he calls, someone will tell him\u2026 what\u2026 really\u2026\" I trailed off. Her gaze strangled the words in my throat. Why was she so panicked? Why was her face twisting now with pity and horror? What was it she had said to Rosalie on the phone just now? Something about what she'd seen\u2026 and Rosalie's remorse; Rosalie would never feel remorse for anything that happened to me. But if she'd hurt her family, hurt her brother\u2026 \"Bella,\" Alice whispered. \"Edward won't call again. He believed her.\" \"I. Don't. Understand.\" My mouth framed each word in silence. I couldn't push the air out to actually say the words that would make her explain what that meant. \"He's going to Italy.\" It took the length of one heartbeat for me to comprehend. When Edward's voice came back to me now, it was not the perfect imitation of my \u00a0delusions. It was just the weak, flat tone of my memories. But the words alone were enough to shred through my chest and leave it gaping open. Words from a time when I would have bet everything that I owned or could borrow on that fact that he loved me. Well, I wasn't going to live without you, he'd said as we watched Romeo and Juliet die, here in this very room. But I wasn't sure how to do it\u2026 I knew Emmett and Jasper would never help\u2026 so I was thinking maybe I would go to Italy and do something to provoke the Volturi\u2026 You don't irritate them. Not unless you want to die. Not unless you want to die. \"NO!\" The half-shrieked denial was so loud after the whispered words, it made us all jump. I felt the blood rushing to my face as I realized what she'd seen. \"No! No, no, no! He can't! He can't do that!\" \"He made up his mind as soon as your friend confirmed that it was too late to save you.\" \"But he\u2026 he left! He didn't want me anymore! What difference does it make now? He knew I would die sometime!\" \"I don't think he ever planned to outlive you by long,\" Alice said quietly. \"How dare he!\" I screamed. I was on my feet now, and Jacob rose uncertainly to put himself between Alice and me again. \"Oh, get out of the way, Jacob!\" I elbowed my way around his trembling body with desperate impatience. \"What do we do?\" I begged Alice. There had to be something. \"Can't we call him? Can Carlisle?\" She was shaking her head. \"That was the first thing I tried. He left his phone in a trash can in Rio\u2014someone answered it\u2026\" she whispered. \"You said before we had to hurry. Hurry how? Let's do it, whatever it is!\" \"Bella, I\u2014I don't think I can ask you to\u2026\" She trailed off in indecision. \"Ask me!\" I commanded. She put her hands on my shoulders, holding me in place, her fingers flexing sporadically to emphasize her words. \"We may already be too late. I saw him going to the Volturi\u2026 and asking to die.\" We both cringed, and my eyes were suddenly blind. I blinked feverishly at the tears. \"It all depends on what they choose. I can't see that till they make a decision. \"But if they say no, and they might\u2014Aro is fond of Carlisle, and wouldn't want to offend him\u2014Edward has a backup plan. They're very protective of their city. If Edward does something to upset the peace, he thinks they'll act to stop him. And he's right. They will.\" I stared at her with my jaw clenched in frustration. I'd heard nothing yet that would explain why we were still standing here. \"So if they agree to grant his favor, we're too late. If they say no, and he comes up with a plan to offend them quickly enough, we're too late. If he gives into his more theatrical tendencies\u2026 we might have time.\" \"Let's go!\" \"Listen, Bella! Whether we are in time or not, we will be in the heart of the Volturi city. I will be considered his accomplice if he is successful. You will be a human who not only knows too much, but also smells too good. There's a very good chance that they will eliminate us all\u2014though in your case it won't be punishment so much as dinnertime.\" \"This is what's keeping us here?\" I asked in disbelief. \"I'll go alone if you're afraid.\" I mentally tabulated what money was left in my account, and wondered if Alice would lend me the rest. \"I'm only afraid of getting you killed.\" I snorted in disgust. \"I almost get myself killed on a daily basis! Tell me what I need to do!\" \"You write a note to Charlie. I'll call the airlines.\" \"Charlie,\" I gasped. Not that my presence was protecting him, but could I leave him here alone to face\u2026 \"I'm not going to let anything happen to Charlie.\" Jacob's low voice was gruff and angry. \"Screw the treaty.\" I glanced up at him, and he scowled at my panicked expression. \"Hurry, Bella,\" Alice interrupted urgently. I ran to the kitchen, yanking the drawers open and throwing the contents all over the floor as I searched for a pen. A smooth, brown hand held one out to me. \"Thanks,\" I mumbled, pulling the cap off with my teeth. He silently handed me the pad of paper we wrote phone messages on. I tore off the top sheet and threw it over my shoulder. Dad, I wrote. I'm with Alice. Edward's in trouble. You can ground me when I get back. I know it's a bad time. So sorry. Love you so much. Bella. \"Don't go,\" Jacob whispered. The anger was all gone now that Alice was out of sight. I wasn't about to waste time arguing with him. \"Please, please, please take care of \u00a0Charlie,\" I said as I dashed back out to the front room. Alice was waiting in the doorway with a bag over her shoulder. \"Get your wallet\u2014you'll need ID. Please tell me you have a passport. I don't have time to forge one.\" I nodded and then raced up the stairs, my knees weak with gratitude that my mother had wanted to marry Phil on a beach in Mexico. Of course, like all her plans, it had fallen through. But not before I'd made all the practical arrangements I could for her. I tore through my room. I stuffed my old wallet, a clean T-shirt, and sweatpants into my backpack, and then threw my toothbrush on top. I hurled myself back down the stairs. The sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu was nearly stifling by this point. At least, unlike the last time\u2014when I'd run away from Forks to escape thirsty vampires rather than to find them\u2014I wouldn't have to say goodbye to Charlie in person. Jacob and Alice were locked in some kind of confrontation in front of the open door, standing so far apart you wouldn't assume at first that they were having a conversation. Neither one seemed to notice my noisy reappearance. \"You might control yourself on occasion, but these leeches you're taking her to\u2014\" Jacob was furiously accusing her. \"Yes. You're right, dog.\" Alice was snarling, too. \"The Volturi are the very essence of our kind\u2014they're the reason your hair stands on end when you smell me. They are the substance of your nightmares, the dread behind your instincts. I'm not unaware of that.\" \"And you take her to them like a bottle of wine for a party!\" he shouted. \"You think she'd be better off if I left her here alone, with Victoria stalking her?\" \"We can handle the redhead.\" \"Then why is she still hunting?\" Jacob growled, and a shudder rippled through his torso. \"Stop that!\" I shouted at them both, wild with impatience. \"Argue when we get back, let's \u00a0go!\" Alice turned for the car, disappearing in her haste. I hurried after her, pausing automatically to turn and lock the door. Jacob caught my arm with a shivering hand. \"Please, Bella. I'm begging.\" His dark eyes were glistening with tears. A lump filled my throat. \"Jake, I have to\u2014\" \"You don't, though. You really don't. You could stay here with me. You could stay alive. For Charlie. For me.\" The engine of Carlisle's Mercedes purred; the rhythm of the thrumming spiked when Alice revved it impatiently. I shook my head, tears spattering from my eyes with the sharp motion. I pulled my arm free, and he didn't fight me. \"Don't die, Bella,\" he choked out. \"Don't go. Don't.\" What if I never saw him again? The thought pushed me past the silent tears; a sob broke out from my chest. I threw my arms around his waist and hugged for one too-short moment, burying my tear-wet face against his chest. He put his big hand on the back of my hair, as if to hold me there. \"Bye, Jake.\" I pulled his hand from my hair, and kissed his palm. I couldn't bear to look at his face. \"Sorry,\" I whispered. Then I spun and raced for the car. The door on the passenger side was open and waiting. I threw my backpack over the headrest and slid in, slamming the door behind me. \"Take care of Charlie!\" I turned to shout out the window, but Jacob was nowhere in sight. As Alice stomped on the gas and\u2014with the tires screeching like human screams\u2014spun us around to face the road, I caught sight of a shred of white near the edge of the trees. A piece of a shoe.",
