            "en": "7 REPETITION         16. PARIS AT THAT MOMENT, MY HEAD BROKE THE SURFACE. How disorienting. I'd been sure I was sinking. The current wouldn't let up. It was slamming me against more rocks; they beat against the center of my back sharply, rhythmically, pushing the water from my lungs. It gushed out in amazing volume, absolute torrents pouring from my mouth and nose. The salt burned and my lungs burned and my throat was too full of water to catch a breath and the rocks were hurting my back. Somehow I stayed in one place, though the waves still heaved around me. I couldn't see anything but water everywhere, reaching for my face. \"Breathe!\" a voice, wild with anxiety, ordered, and I felt a cruel stab of pain when I recognized the voice\u2014because it wasn't Edward's. I could not obey. The waterfall pouring from my mouth didn't stop long enough for me to catch a breath. The black, icy water filled my chest, burning. The rock smacked into my back again, right between my shoulder blades, and another volley of water choked its way out of my lungs. \"Breathe, Bella! C'mon!\" Jacob begged. Black spots bloomed across my vision, getting wider and wider, blocking out the light. The rock struck me again. The rock wasn't cold like the water; it was hot on my skin. I realized it was Jacob's hand, trying to beat the water from my lungs. The iron bar that had dragged me from the sea was also\u2026 warm\u2026 My head whirled, the black spots covered everything\u2026 Was I dying again, then? I didn't like it\u2014this wasn't as good as the last time. It was only dark now, nothing worth looking at here. The sound of the crashing waves faded into the black and became a quiet, even whoosh that sounded like it was coming from the inside of my ears\u2026 \"Bella?\" Jacob asked, his voice still tense, but not as wild as before. \"Bells, honey, can you hear me?\" The contents of my head swished and rolled sickeningly, like they'd joined the rough water\u2026 \"How long has she been unconscious?\" someone else asked. The voice that was not Jacob's shocked me, jarred me into a more focused awareness. I realized that I was still. There was no tug of the current on me\u2014the heaving was inside my head. The surface under me was flat and motionless. It felt grainy against my bare arms. \"I don't know,\" Jacob reported, still frantic. His voice was very close. Hands\u2014so warm they had to be his\u2014brushed wet hair from my cheeks. \"A few minutes? It didn't take long to tow her to the beach.\" The quiet whooshing inside my ears was not the waves\u2014it was the air moving in and out of my lungs again. Each breath burned\u2014the passageways were as raw as if I'd scrubbed them out with steel wool. But I was breathing. And I was freezing. A thousand sharp, icy beads were striking my face and arms, making the cold worse. \"She's breathing. She'll come around. We should get her out of the cold, though. I don't like the color she's turning\u2026\" I recognized Sam's voice this time. \"You think it's okay to move her?\" \"She didn't hurt her back or anything when she fell?\" \"I don't know.\" They hesitated. I tried to open my eyes. It took me a minute, but then I could see the dark, purple clouds, flinging the freezing rain down at me. \"Jake?\" I croaked. Jacob's face blocked out the sky. \"Oh!\" he gasped, relief washing over his features. His eyes were wet from the rain. \"Oh, Bella! Are you okay? Can you hear me? Do you hurt anywhere?\" \"J-Just m-my throat,\" I stuttered, my lips quivering from the cold. \"Let's get you out of here, then,\" Jacob said. He slid his arms under me and lifted me without effort\u2014like picking up an empty box. His chest was bare and warm; he hunched his shoulders to keep the rain off of me. My head lolled over his arm. I stared vacantly back toward the furious water, beating the sand behind him. \"You got her?\" I heard Sam ask. \"Yeah, I'll take it from here. Get back to the hospital. I'll join you later. Thanks, Sam.\" My head was still rolling. None of his words sunk in at first. Sam didn't answer. There was no sound, and I wondered if he were already gone. The water licked and writhed up the sand after us as Jacob carried me away, like it was angry that I'd escaped. As I stared wearily, a spark of color caught my unfocused eyes\u2014a small flash of fire was dancing on the black water, far out in the bay. The image made no sense, and I wondered how conscious I really was. My head swirled with the memory of the black, churning water\u2014of being so lost that I couldn't find up or down. So lost\u2026 but somehow Jacob\u2026 \"How did you find me?\" I rasped. \"I was searching for you,\" he told me. He was half-jogging through the rain, up the beach toward the road. \"I followed the tire tracks to your truck, and then I heard you scream\u2026\" He shuddered. \"Why would you jump, Bella? Didn't you notice that it's turning into a hurricane out here? Couldn't you have waited for me?\" Anger filled his tone as the relief faded. \"Sorry,\" I muttered. \"It was stupid.\" \"Yeah, it was really stupid,\" he agreed, drops of rain shaking free of his hair as he nodded. \"Look, do you mind saving the stupid stuff for when I'm around? I won't be able to concentrate if I think you're jumping off cliffs behind my back.\" \"Sure,\" I agreed. \"No problem.\" I sounded like a chain-smoker. I tried to clear my throat\u2014and then winced; the throat-clearing felt like stabbing a knife down there. \"What happened today? Did you\u2026 find her?\" It was my turn to shudder, though I wasn't so cold here, right next to his ridiculous body heat. Jacob shook his head. He was still more running than walking as he headed up the road to his house. \"No. She took off into the water\u2014the bloodsuckers have the advantage there. That's why I raced home\u2014I was afraid she was going to double back swimming. You spend so much time on the beach\u2026\" He trailed off, a catch in his throat. \"Sam came back with you\u2026 is everyone else home, too?\" I hoped they weren't still out searching for her. \"Yeah. Sort of.\" I tried to read his expression, squinting into the hammering rain. His eyes were tight with worry or pain. The words that hadn't made sense before suddenly did. \"You said\u2026 hospital. Before, to Sam. Is someone hurt? Did she fight you?\" My voice jumped up an octave, sounding strange with the hoarseness. \"No, no. When we got back, Em was waiting with the news. It's Harry Clearwater. Harry had a heart attack this morning.\" \"Harry?\" I shook my head, trying to absorb what he was saying. \"Oh, no! Does Charlie know?\" \"Yeah. He's over there, too, with my dad.\" \"Is Harry going to be okay?\" Jacob's eyes tightened again. \"It doesn't look so great right now.\" Abruptly, I felt really sick with guilt\u2014felt truly horrible about the brainless cliff dive. Nobody needed to be worrying about me right now. What a stupid time to be reckless. \"What can I do?\" I asked. At that moment the rain stopped. I hadn't realized we were already back to Jacob's house until he walked through the door. The storm pounded against the roof. \"You can stay here,\" Jacob said as he dumped me on the short couch. \"I mean it\u2014right here I'll get you some dry clothes.\" I let my eyes adjust to the dark room while Jacob banged around in his bedroom. The cramped front room seemed so empty without Billy, almost desolate. It was strangely ominous\u2014probably just because I knew where he was. Jacob was back in seconds. He threw a pile of gray cotton at me. \"These will be huge on you, but it's the best I've got. I'll, er, step outside so you can change.\" \"Don't go anywhere. I'm too tired to move yet. Just stay with me.\" Jacob sat on the floor next to me, his back against the couch. I wondered when he'd slept last. He looked as exhausted as I felt. He leaned his head on the cushion next to mine and yawned. \"Guess I could rest for a minute\u2026\" His eyes closed. I let mine slide shut, too. Poor Harry. Poor Sue. I knew Charlie was going to be beside himself. Harry was one of his best friends. Despite Jake's negative take on things, I hoped fervently that Harry would pull through. For Charlie's sake. For Sue's and Leah's and Seth's\u2026 Billy's sofa was right next to the radiator, and I was warm now, despite my soaked clothes. My lungs ached in a way that pushed me toward unconsciousness rather than keeping me awake. I wondered vaguely if it was wrong to sleep\u2026 or was I getting drowning mixed up with concussions\u2026 ? Jacob began softly snoring, and the sound of it soothed like a lullaby. I fell asleep quickly. For the first time in a very long time, my dream was just a normal dream. Just a blurred wandering through old memories\u2014blinding bright visions of the Phoenix sun, my mother's face, a ramshackle tree house, a faded quilt, a wall of mirrors, a flame on the black water\u2026 I forgot each of them as soon as the picture changed. The last picture was the only one that stuck in my head. It was meaningless\u2014just a set on a stage. A balcony at night, a painted moon hanging in the sky. I watched the girl in her nightdress lean on the railing and talk to herself. Meaningless\u2026 but when I slowly struggled back to consciousness, Juliet was on my mind. Jacob was still asleep; he'd slumped down to the floor and his breathing was deep and even. The house was darker now than before, it was black outside the window. I was stiff, but warm and almost dry. The inside of my throat burned with every breath I took. I was going to have to get up\u2014at least to get a drink. But my body just wanted to be here limp, to never move again. Instead of moving, I thought about Juliet some more. I wondered what she would have done if Romeo had left her, not because he was banished, but because he lost interests. \u00a0\u00a0What if Rosaline had given him the time of day, and he'd changed his mind? What if, instead of marrying Juliet, he'd just disappeared? I thought I knew how Juliet would feel. She wouldn't go back to her old life, not really. She wouldn't ever have moved on, I was sure of that.  Even if she'd lived until she was old and gray, every time she closed her eyes, it would have been Romeo's face she saw behind her lids. She would have accepted that, eventually. I wondered if she would have married Paris in the end, just to please her parents, to keep the peace. No, probably not, I decided. But then, the story didn't say much about Paris. He was just a stick figure\u2014a placeholder, a threat, a deadline to force her hand. What if there were more to Paris? What if Paris had been Juliet's friend? Her very best friend? What if he was the only one she could confide in about the whole devastating thing with Romeo? The one person who really understood her and made her feel halfway human again? What if he was patient and kind? What if he took care of her? What if Juliet knew she couldn't survive without him? What if he really loved her, and wanted her to be happy? And\u2026 what if she loved Paris? Not like Romeo. Nothing like that, of course. But enough that she wanted him to be happy, too? Jacob's slow, deep breathing was the only sound in the room\u2014like a lullaby hummed to a child, like the whisper of a rocking chair, like the ticking of an old clock when you had nowhere you needed to go\u2026It was the sound of comfort. If Romeo was really gone, never coming back, would it have mattered whether or not Juliet had taken Paris up on his offer? Maybe she should have tried to settle into the leftover scraps of life that were left behind. Maybe that would have been as close to happiness as she could get. I sighed, and then groaned when the sigh scraped my throat. I was reading too much into the story. Romeo wouldn't change his mind. That's why people still remembered his name, always twined with hers: Romeo and Juliet. That's why it was a good story. \"Juliet gets dumped and ends up with Paris\" would have never been a hit. I closed my eyes and drifted again, letting my mind wander away from the stupid play I didn't want to think about anymore. I thought about reality instead\u2014about jumping off the cliff and what a brainless mistake that had been. And not just the cliff, but the\u00a0\u00a0 motorcycles and the whole irresponsible Evel Knievel bit. What if something bad happened to me? What would that do to Charlie? Harry's heart attack had pushed everything suddenly into perspective for me. Perspective that I didn't want to see, because\u2014if I admitted to the truth of it\u2014it would mean that I would have to change my ways. Could I live like that? Maybe. It wouldn't be easy; in fact, it would be downright miserable to give up my hallucinations and try to be a grown-up. But maybe I should do it. And maybe I could. If I had Jacob. I couldn't make that decision right now. It hurt too much. I'd think about something else. Images from my ill-considered afternoon stunt rolled through my head while I tried to come up with something pleasant to think about\u2026 the feel of the air as I fell, the\u00a0 blackness of the water, the thrashing of the current\u2026 Edward's face\u2026 I lingered there for a long time. Jacob's warm hands, trying to beat life back into me\u2026 the stinging rain flung down by the purple clouds\u2026 the strange fire on the waves\u2026 There was something familiar about that flash of color on top of the water. Of course it couldn't really be fire\u2014 My thoughts were interrupted by the sound of a car squelching through the mud on the road outside. I heard it stop in front of the house, and doors started opening and closing. I thought about sitting up, and then decided against that idea. Billy's voice was easily identifiable, but he kept it uncharacteristically low, so that it was only a gravelly grumble. The door opened, and the light flicked on. I blinked, momentarily blind. Jake startled awake, gasping and jumping to his feet. \"Sorry,\" Billy grunted. \"Did we wake you?\" My eyes slowly focused on his face, and then, as I could read his expression, they filled with tears. \"Oh, no, Billy!\" I moaned. He nodded slowly, his expression hard with grief. Jake hurried to his father and took one of his hands. The pain made his face suddenly childlike\u2014it looked odd on top of the man's body. Sam was right behind Billy, pushing his chair through the door. His normal composure was absent from his agonized face. \"I'm so sorry,\" I whispered. Billy nodded. \"It's gonna be hard all around.\" \"Where's Charlie?\" \"Your dad is still at the hospital with Sue. There are a lot of\u2026 arrangements to be made.\" I swallowed hard. \"I'd better get back there,\" Sam mumbled, and he ducked hastily out the door. Billy pulled his hand away from Jacob, and then he rolled himself through the kitchen toward his room. Jake stared after him for a minute, then came to sit on the floor beside me again. He put his face in his hands. I rubbed his shoulder, wishing I could think of anything to say. After a long moment, Jacob caught my hand and held it to his face. \"How are you feeling? Are you okay? I probably should have taken you to a doctor or something.\" He sighed. \"Don't worry about me,\" I croaked. He twisted his head to look at me. His eyes were rimmed in red. \"You don't look so good.\" \"I don't feel so good, either, I guess.\" \"I'll go get your truck and then take you home\u2014you probably ought to be there when Charlie gets back.\" \"Right.\" I lay listlessly on the sofa while I waited for him. Billy was silent in the other room. I felt like a peeping torn, peering through the cracks at a private sorrow that wasn't mine. It didn't take Jake long. The roar of my truck's engine broke the silence before I expected it. He helped me up from the couch without speaking, keeping his arm around my shoulder when the cold air outside made me shiver. He took the driver's seat without asking, and then pulled me next to his side to keep his arm tight around me. I leaned my head against his chest. \"How will you get home?\" I asked. \"I'm not going home. We still haven't caught the bloodsucker, remember?\" My next shudder had nothing to do with cold. It was a quiet ride after that. The cold air had woken me up. My mind was alert, and it was working very hard and very fast. What if? What was the right thing to do? I couldn't imagine my life without Jacob now\u2014I cringed away from the idea of even trying to imagine that. Somehow, he'd become essential to my survival. But to leave things the way they were\u2026 was that cruel, as Mike had accused? I remembered wishing that Jacob were my brother. I realized now that all I really wanted was a claim on him. It didn't feel brotherly when he held me like this. It just felt nice\u2014warm and comforting and familiar. Safe. Jacob was a safe harbor. I could stake a claim. I had that much within my power. I'd have to tell him everything, I knew that. It was the only way to be fair. I'd have to explain it right, so that he'd know I wasn't settling, that he was much too good for me. He already knew I was broken, that part wouldn't surprise him, but he'd need to know the extent of it. I'd even have to admit that I was crazy\u2014explain about the voices I heard. He'd need to know everything before he made a decision. But, even as I recognized that necessity, I knew he would take me in spite of it all. He wouldn't even pause to think it through. I would have to commit to this\u2014commit as much of me as there was left, every one of the broken pieces. It was the only way to be fair to him. Would I? Could I? Would it be so wrong to try to make Jacob happy? Even if the love I felt for him was no more than a weak echo of what I was capable of, even if my heart was far away, wandering and grieving after my fickle Romeo, would it be so very wrong? Jacob stopped the truck in front of my dark house, cutting the engine so it was suddenly silent. Like so many other times, he seemed to be in tune with my thoughts now. He threw his other arm around me, crushing me against his chest, binding me to him. Again, this felt nice. Almost like being a whole person again. I thought he would be thinking of Harry, but then he spoke, and his tone was apologetic. \"Sorry. I know you don't feel exactly the way I do, Bella. I swear I don't mind. I'm just so glad you're okay that I could sing\u2014and that's something no one wants to hear.\" He laughed his throaty laugh in my ear. My breathing kicked up a notch, sanding the walls of my throat. Wouldn't Edward, indifferent as he might be, want me to be as happy as possible under the circumstances? Wouldn't enough friendly emotion linger for him to want that much for me? I thought he would. He wouldn't begrudge me this: giving just a small bit of love he didn't want to my friend Jacob. After all, it wasn't the same love at all. Jake pressed his warm cheek against the top of my hair. If I turned my face to the side\u2014if I pressed my lips against his bare shoulder... I knew without any doubt what would follow. It would be very easy. There would be no need for explanations tonight. But could I do it? Could I betray my absent heart to save my pathetic life? Butterflies assaulted my stomach as I thought of turning my head. And then, as clearly as if I were in immediate danger, Edward's velvet voice whispered in my ear. \"Be happy,\" he told me. I froze. Jacob felt me stiffen and released me automatically, reaching for the door. Wait, I wanted to say. Just a minute. But I was still locked in place, listening to the echo of Edward's voice in my head. Storm-cooled air blew through the cab of the truck. \"OH!\" The breath whooshed out of Jacob like someone had punched him in the gut. \"Holy crap!\" He slammed the door and twisted the keys in the ignition at the same moment. His hands were shaking so hard I didn't know how he managed it. \"What's wrong?\" He revved the engine too fast; it sputtered and faltered. \"Vampire,\" he spit out. The blood rushed from my head and left me dizzy. \"How do you know?\" \"Because I can smell it. Dammit!\" Jacob's eyes were wild, raking the dark street. He barely seemed aware of the tremors that were rolling through his body. \"Phase or get her out of here?\" he hissed at himself. He looked down at me for a split second, taking in my horror-struck eyes and white face, and then he was scanning the street again. \"Right. Get you out.\" The engine caught with a roar. The tires squealed as he spun the truck around, turning toward our only escape. The headlights washed across the pavement, lit the front line of the black forest, and finally glinted off a car parked across the street from my house. \"Stop!\" I gasped. It was a black car\u2014a car I knew. I might be the <em>furthest</em> thing from an autophile, but I could tell you everything about that particular car. It was a Mercedes S55 AMG. I knew the horsepower and the color of the interior. I knew the feel of the powerful engine purring through the frame. I knew the rich smell of the leather seats and the way the extra-dark tint made noon look like dusk through those windows. It was Carlisle's car. \"Stop!\" I cried again, louder this time, because Jacob was gunning the truck down the street. \"What?!\" \"It's not Victoria. Stop, stop! I want to go back.\" He stomped on the brake so hard I had to catch myself against the dashboard. \"What?\" he asked again, aghast. He stared at me with horror in his eyes. \"It's Carlisle's car! It's the Cullens. I know it.\" He watched dawn break across my face, and a violent tremor rocked his frame. \"Hey, calm down, Jake. It's okay. No danger, see? Relax.\" \"Yeah, calm,\" he panted, putting his head down and closing his eyes. While he concentrated on not exploding into a wolf, I stared out the back window at the black car. It was just Carlisle, I told myself. Don't expect anything more. Maybe Esme\u2026 Stop right there, I told myself. Just Carlisle. That was plenty. More than I'd ever hoped to have again. \"There's a vampire in your house,\" Jacob hissed. \"And you want to go back?\" I glanced at him, ripping my unwilling eyes off the Mercedes\u2014terrified that it would disappear the second I looked away. \"Of course,\" I said, my voice blank with surprise at his question. Of course I wanted to go back. Jacob's face hardened while I stared at him, congealing into the bitter mask that I'd thought was gone for good. Just before he had the mask in place, I caught the spasm of betrayal that flashed in his eyes. His hands were still shaking. He looked ten years older than me. He took a deep breath. \"You're sure it's not a trick?\" he asked in a slow, heavy voice. \"It's not a trick. It's Carlisle. Take me back!\" A shudder rippled through his wide shoulders, but his eyes were flat and emotionless. \"No.\" \"Jake, it's okay\u2014\" \"No. Take yourself back, Bella.\" His voice was a slap\u2014I flinched as the sound of it struck me. His jaw clenched and unclenched. \"Look, Bella,\" he said in the same hard voice. \"I can't go back. Treaty or no treaty, that's my enemy in there.\" \"It's not like that\u2014\" \"I have to tell Sam right away. This changes things. We can't be caught on their territory.\" \"Jake, it's not a war!\" He didn't listen. He put the truck in neutral and jumped out the door, leaving it running. \"Bye, Bella,\" he called back over his shoulder. \"I really hope you don't die.\" He sprinted into the darkness, shaking so hard that his shape seemed blurred; he disappeared before I could open my mouth to call him back. Remorse pinned me against the seat for one long second. What had I just done to Jacob'? But remorse couldn't hold me very long. I slid across the seat and put the truck back in drive. My hands were shaking almost as hard as Jake's had been, and this took a minute of concentration. Then I carefully turned the truck around and drove it back to my house. It was very dark when I turned off the headlights. Charlie had left in such a hurry that he'd forgotten to leave the porch lamp on. I felt a pang of doubt, staring at the house, deep in shadow. What if it was a trick? I looked back at the black car, almost invisible in the night. No. I knew that car. Still, my hands were shaking even worse than before as I reached for the key above the door. When I grabbed the doorknob to unlock it, it twisted easily under my hand. I let the door fall open. The hallway was black. I wanted to call out a greeting, but my throat was too dry. I couldn't quite seem to catch my breath. I took a step inside and fumbled for the light switch. It was so black\u2014like the black water\u2026 Where was that switch? Just like the black water, with the orange flame flickering impossibly on top of it. Flame that couldn't be a fire, but what then\u2026 ? My fingers traced the wall, still searching, still shaking\u2014 Suddenly, something Jacob had told me this afternoon echoed in my head, finally sinking in\u2026 She took off into the water, he'd said. The bloodsuckers have the advantage there. That's why I raced home \u2014I was afraid she was going to double back swimming. My hand froze in its searching, my whole body froze into place, as I realized why I recognized the strange orange color on the water. Victoria's hair, blowing wild in the wind, the color of fire\u2026 She'd been right there. Right there in the harbor with me and Jacob. If Sam hadn't been there, if it had been just the two of us\u2026 ? I couldn't breathe or move. The light flicked on, though my frozen hand had still not found the switch. I blinked into the sudden light, and saw that someone was there, waiting for me.",

            "en": "EPILOGUE:AN OCCASION        EPILOGUE:AN OCCASION Edward helped me into his car, being very careful of the wisps of silk and chiffon, the flowers he'd just pinned into my elaborately styled curls, and my bulky walking cast. He ignored the angry set of my mouth. When he had me settled, he got in the driver's seat and headed back out the long, narrow drive. \"At what point exactly are you going to tell me what's going on?\" I asked grumpily. I really hated surprises. And he knew that. I'm shocked that you haven't figured it out yet.\" He threw a mocking smile in my direction, and my breath caught in my throat. Would I ever get used to his perfection? \"I did mention that you looked very nice, didn't I?\" I verified. \"Yes.\" He grinned again. I'd never seen him dress in black before, and, with the contrast against his pale skin, his beauty was absolutely surreal. That much I couldn't deny, even if the fact that he was wearing a tuxedo made me very nervous. Not quite as nervous as the dress. Or the shoe. Only one shoe, as my other foot was still securely encased in plaster. But the stiletto heel, held on only by satin ribbons, certainly wasn't going to help me as I tried to hobble around. \"I'm not coming over anymore if Alice is going to treat me like Guinea Pig Barbie when I do,\" I griped. I'd spent the better part of the day in Alice's staggeringly vast bathroom, a helpless victim as she played hairdresser and cosmetician. Whenever I fidgeted or complained, she reminded me that she didn't have any memories of being human, and asked me not to ruin her vicarious fun. Then she'd dressed me in the most ridiculous dress \u2014 deep blue, frilly and off the shoulders, with French tags I couldn't read \u2014 a dress more suitable for a runway than Forks. Nothing good could come of our formal attire, of that I was sure. Unless\u2026 but I was afraid to put my suspicions into words, even in my own head.  I was distracted then by the sound of a phone ringing. Edward pulled his cell phone from a pocket inside his jacket, looking briefly at the caller ID before answering. \"Hello, Charlie,\" he said warily. \"Charlie?\" I frowned. Charlie had been\u2026 difficult since my return to Forks. He had compartmentalized my bad experience into two defined reactions. Toward Carlisle he was almost worshipfully grateful. On the other hand, he was stubbornly convinced that Edward was at fault \u2014 because, if not for him, I wouldn't have left home in the first place. And Edward was far from disagreeing with him. These days I had rules that hadn't existed before: curfews\u2026 visiting hours. Something Charlie was saying made Edward's eyes widen in disbelief, and then a grin spread across his face. \"You're kidding!\" He laughed. \"What is it?\" I demanded. He ignored me. \"Why don't you let me talk to him?\" Edward suggested with evident pleasure. He waited for a few seconds. \"Hello, Tyler, this is Edward Cullen.\" His voice was very friendly, on the surface. I knew it well enough to catch the soft edge of menace. What was Tyler doing at my house? The awful truth began to dawn on me. I looked again at the inappropriate dress Alice had forced me into. \"I'm sorry if there's been some kind of miscommunication, but Bella is unavailable tonight.\" Edward's tone changed, and the threat in his voice was suddenly much more evident as he continued. \"To be perfectly honest, she'll be unavailable every night, as far as anyone besides myself is concerned. No offense. And I'm sorry about your evening.\" He didn't sound sorry at all. And then he snapped the phone shut, a huge smirk on his face. My face and neck flushed crimson with anger. I could feel the rage-induced tears starting to fill my eyes. He looked at me in surprise. \"Was that last part a bit too much? I didn't mean to offend you.\" I ignored that.  \"You're taking me to the prom!\" I yelled. It was embarrassingly obvious now. If I'd been paying any attention at all, I'm sure I would have noticed the date on the posters that decorated the school buildings. But I'd never dreamed he was thinking of subjecting me to this. Didn't he know me at all? He wasn't expecting the force of my reaction, that was clear. He pressed his lips together and his eyes narrowed. \"Don't be difficult, Bella.\" My eyes flashed to the window; we were halfway to the school already. \"Why are you doing this to me?\" I demanded in horror. He gestured to his tuxedo. \"Honestly, Bella, what did you think we were doing?\" I was mortified. First, because I'd missed the obvious. And also because the vague suspicions \u2014 expectations, really \u2014 that I'd been forming all day, as Alice tried to transform me into a beauty queen, were so far wide of the mark. My half-fearful hopes seemed very silly now. I'd guessed there was some kind of occasion brewing. But prom! That was the <em>furthest</em> thing from my mind. The angry tears rolled over my cheeks. I remembered with dismay that I was very uncharacteristically wearing mascara. I wiped quickly under my eyes to prevent any smudges. My hand was unblackened when I pulled it away; maybe Alice had known I would need waterproof makeup. \"This is completely ridiculous. Why are you crying?\" he demanded in frustration. \"Because I'm mad!\" \"Bella.\" He turned the full force of his scorching golden eyes on me. \"What?\" I muttered, distracted. \"Humor me,\" he insisted. His eyes were melting all my fury. It was impossible to fight with him when he cheated like that. I gave in with poor grace. \"Fine,\" I pouted, unable to glare as effectively as I would have liked. \"I'll go quietly. But you'll see. I'm way overdue for more bad luck. I'll probably break my other leg. Look at this shoe! It's a death trap!\" I held out my good leg as evidence. \"Hmmm.\" He stared at my leg longer than was necessary. \"Remind me to thank Alice for that tonight.\" \"Alice is going to be there?\" That comforted me slightly. \"With Jasper, and Emmett\u2026 and Rosalie,\" he admitted. The feeling of comfort disappeared. There had been no progress with Rosalie, though I was on quite good terms with her sometimes-husband. Emmett enjoyed having me around \u2014 he thought my bizarre human reactions were hilarious\u2026 or maybe it was just the fact that I fell down a lot that he found so funny. Rosalie acted as if I didn't exist. While I shook my head to dispel the direction my thoughts had taken, I thought of something else. \"Is Charlie in on this?\" I asked, suddenly suspicious. \"Of course.\" He grinned, and then chuckled. \"Apparently Tyler wasn't, though.\" I gritted my teeth. How Tyler could be so delusional, I couldn't imagine. At school, where Charlie couldn't interfere, Edward and I were inseparable \u2014 except for those rare sunny days. We were at the school now; Rosalie's red convertible was conspicuous in the parking lot. The clouds were thin today, a few streaks of sunlight escaping through far away in the west. He got out and walked around the car to open my door. He held out his hand. I sat stubbornly in my seat, arms folded, feeling a secret twinge of smugness. The lot was crowded with people in formal dress: witnesses. He couldn't remove me forcibly from the car as he might have if we'd been alone. He sighed. \"When someone wants to kill you, you're brave as a lion \u2014 and then when someone mentions dancing\u2026\" He shook his head. I gulped. Dancing. \"Bella, I won't let anything hurt you \u2014 not even yourself. I won't let go of you once, I promise.\" I thought about that and suddenly felt much better. He could see that in my face. \"There, now,\" he said gently, \"it won't be so bad.\" He leaned down and wrapped one arm around my waist. I took his other hand and let him lift me from the car. He kept his arm tightly around me, supporting me as I limped toward the school. In Phoenix, they held proms in hotel ballrooms. This dance was in the gym, of course. It was probably the only room in town big enough for a dance. When we got inside, I giggled. There were actual balloon arches and twisted garlands of pastel crepe paper festooning the walls. \"This looks like a horror movie waiting to happen,\" I snickered. \"Well,\" he muttered as we slowly approached the ticket table \u2014 he was carrying most of my weight, but I still had to shuffle and wobble my feet forward \u2014 \"there are more than enough vampires present.\" I looked at the dance floor; a wide gap had formed in the center of the floor, where two couples whirled gracefully. The other dancers pressed to the sides of the room to give them space \u2014 no one wanted to stand in contrast with such radiance. Emmett and Jasper were intimidating and flawless in classic tuxedos. Alice was striking in a black satin dress with geometric cutouts that bared large triangles of her snowy white skin. And Rosalie was\u2026 well, Rosalie. She was beyond belief. Her vivid scarlet dress was backless, tight to her calves where it flared into a wide ruffled train, with a neckline that plunged to her waist. I pitied every girl in the room, myself included. \"Do you want me to bolt the doors so you can massacre the unsuspecting townsfolk?\" I whispered conspiratorially. \"And where do you fit into that scheme?\" He glared. \"Oh, I'm with the vampires, of course.\" He smiled reluctantly. \"Anything to get out of dancing.\" \"Anything.\" He bought our tickets, then turned me toward the dance floor. I cringed against his arm and dragged my feet. \"I've got all night,\" he warned. Eventually he towed me out to where his family was twirling elegantly \u2014 if in a style totally unsuitable to the present time and music. I watched in horror. \"Edward.\" My throat was so dry I could only manage a whisper. \"I honestly can't dance!\" I could feel the panic bubbling up inside my chest. \"Don't worry, silly,\" he whispered back. \"I can.\" He put my arms around his neck and lifted me to slide his feet under mine. And then we were whirling, too. \"I feel like I'm five years old,\" I laughed after a few minutes of effortless waltzing. \"You don't look five,\" he murmured, pulling me closer for a second, so that my feet were briefly a foot from the ground. Alice caught my eye on a turn and smiled in encouragement \u2014 I smiled back. I was surprised to realize that I was actually enjoying myself\u2026 a little. \"Okay, this isn't half bad,\" I admitted. But Edward was staring toward the doors, and his face was angry. \"What is it?\" I wondered aloud. I followed his gaze, disoriented by the spinning, but finally I could see what was bothering him. Jacob Black, not in a tux, but in a long-sleeved white shirt and tie, his hair smoothed back into his usual ponytail, was crossing the floor toward us. After the first shock of recognition, I couldn't help but feel bad for Jacob. He was clearly uncomfortable \u2014 excruciatingly so. His face was apologetic as his eyes met mine. Edward snarled very quietly. \"Behave!\" I hissed. Edward's voice was scathing. \"He wants to chat with you.\" Jacob reached us then, the embarrassment and apology even more evident on his face. \"Hey, Bella, I was hoping you would be here.\" Jacob sounded like he'd been hoping the exact opposite. But his smile was just as warm as ever.  \"Hi, Jacob.\" I smiled back. \"What's up?\" \"Can I cut in?\" he asked tentatively, glancing at Edward for the first time. I was shocked to notice that Jacob didn't have to look up. He must have grown half a foot since the first time I'd seen him. Edward's face was composed, his expression blank. His only answer was to set me carefully on my feet, and take a step back. \"Thanks,\" Jacob said amiably. Edward just nodded, looking at me intently before he turned to walk away. Jacob put his hands on my waist, and I reached up to put my hands on his shoulders. \"Wow, Jake, how tall are you now?\" He was smug. \"Six-two.\" We weren't really dancing \u2014 my leg made that impossible. Instead we swayed awkwardly from side to side without moving our feet. It was just as well; the recent growth spurt had left him looking gangly and uncoordinated, he was probably no better a dancer than I was. \"So, how did you end up here tonight?\" I asked without true curiosity. Considering Edward's reaction, I could guess. \"Can you believe my dad paid me twenty bucks to come to your prom?\" he admitted, slightly ashamed. \"Yes, I can,\" I muttered. \"Well, I hope you're enjoying yourself, at least. Seen anything you like?\" I teased, nodding toward a group of girls lined up against the wall like pastel confections. \"Yeah,\" he sighed. \"But she's taken.\" He glanced down to meet my curious gaze for just a second \u2014 then we both looked away, embarrassed. \"You look really pretty, by the way,\" he added shyly. \"Um, thanks. So why did Billy pay you to come here?\" I asked quickly, though I knew the answer. Jacob didn't seem grateful for the subject change; he looked away, uncomfortable again. \"He said it was a 'safe' place to talk to you. I swear the old man is losing his mind.\" I joined in his laughter weakly. \"Anyway, he said that if I told you something, he would get me that master cylinder I need,\" he confessed with a sheepish grin. \"Tell me, then. I want you to get your car finished.\" I grinned back. At least Jacob didn't believe any of this. It made the situation a bit easier. Against the wall, Edward was watching my face, his own face expressionless. I saw a sophomore in a pink dress eyeing him with timid speculation, but he didn't seem to be aware of her. Jacob looked away again, ashamed. \"Don't get mad, okay?\" \"There's no way I'll be mad at you, Jacob,\" I assured him. \"I won't even be mad at Billy. Just say what you have to.\" \"Well \u2014 this is so stupid, I'm sorry, Bella \u2014 he wants you to break up with your boyfriend. He asked me to tell you 'please.'\" He shook his head in disgust. \"He's still superstitious, eh?\" \"Yeah. He was\u2026 kind of over the top when you got hurt down in Phoenix. He didn't believe\u2026\"Jacob trailed off self-consciously. My eyes narrowed. \"I fell.\" \"I know that,\" Jacob said quickly. \"He thinks Edward had something to do with me getting hurt.\" It wasn't a question, and despite my promise, I was angry.  Jacob wouldn't meet my eyes. We weren't even bothering to sway to the music, though his hands were still on my waist, and mine around his neck. \"Look, Jacob, I know Billy probably won't believe this, but just so you know\" \u2014 he looked at me now, responding to the new earnestness in my voice \u2014 \"Edward really did save my life. If it weren't for Edward and his father, I'd be dead.\" \"I know,\" he claimed, but he sounded like my sincere words had affected him some. Maybe he'd be able to convince Billy of this much, at least. \"Hey, I'm sorry you had to come do this, Jacob,\" I apologized. \"At any rate, you get your parts, right?\" \"Yeah,\" he muttered. He was still looking awkward\u2026 upset. \"There's more?\" I asked in disbelief. \"Forget it,\" he mumbled, \"I'll get a job and save the money myself.\" I glared at him until he met my gaze. \"Just spit it out, Jacob.\" \"It's so bad.\" \"I don't care. Tell me,\" I insisted. \"Okay\u2026 but, geez, this sounds bad.\" He shook his head. \"He said to tell you, no, to warn you, that \u2014 and this is his plural, not mine\" \u2014 he lifted one hand from my waist and made little quotations marks in the air \u2014 '\"We'll be watching.'\" He watched warily for my reaction. It sounded like something from a mafia movie. I laughed out loud. \"Sorry you had to do this, Jake,\" I snickered. \"I don't mind that much.\" He grinned in relief. His eyes were appraising as they raked quickly over my dress. \"So, should I tell him you said to butt the hell out?\" he asked hopefully. \"No,\" I sighed. \"Tell him I said thanks. I know he means well.\" The song ended, and I dropped my arms. His hands hesitated at my waist, and he glanced at my bum leg. \"Do you want to dance again? Or can I help you get somewhere?\" Edward answered for me. \"That's all right, Jacob. I'll take it from here.\" Jacob flinched, and stared wide-eyed at Edward, who stood just beside us. \"Hey, I didn't see you there,\" he mumbled. \"I guess I'll see you around, Bella.\" He stepped back, waving halfheartedly. I smiled. \"Yeah, I'll see you later.\" \"Sorry,\" he said again before he turned for the door. Edward's arms wound around me as the next song started. It was a little up-tempo for slow dancing, but that didn't seem to concern him. I leaned my head against his chest, content. \"Feeling better?\" I teased. \"Not really,\" he said tersely. \"Don't be mad at Billy,\" I sighed. \"He just worries about me for Charlie's sake. It's nothing personal.\" \"I'm not mad at Billy,\" he corrected in a clipped voice. \"But his son is irritating me.\" I pulled back to look at him. His face was very serious. \"Why?\" \"First of all, he made me break my promise.\" I stared at him in confusion. He half-smiled. \"I promised I wouldn't let go of you tonight,\" he explained. \"Oh. Well, I forgive you.\" \"Thanks. But there's something else.\" Edward frowned. I waited patiently. \"He called you pretty,\" he finally continued, his frown deepening. \"That's practically an insult, the way you look right now. You're much more than beautiful.\" I laughed. \"You might be a little biased.\" \"I don't think that's it. Besides, I have excellent eyesight.\" We were twirling again, my feet on his as he held me close. \"So are you going to explain the reason for all of this?\" I wondered. He looked down at me, confused, and I glared meaningfully at the crepe paper. He considered for a moment, and then changed direction, spinning me through the crowd to the back door of the gym. I caught a glimpse of Jessica and Mike dancing, staring at me curiously. Jessica waved, and I smiled back quickly. Angela was there, too, looking blissfully happy in the arms of little Ben Cheney; she didn't look up from his eyes, a head lower than hers. Lee and Samantha, Lauren, glaring toward us, with Conner; I could name every face that spiraled past me. And then we were outdoors, in the cool, dim light of a fading sunset. As soon as we were alone, he swung me up into his arms, and carried me across the dark grounds till he reached the bench beneath the shadow of the madrone trees. He sat there, keeping me cradled against his chest. The moon was already up, visible through the gauzy clouds, and his face glowed pale in the white light. His mouth was hard, his eyes troubled. \"The point?\" I prompted softly. He ignored me, staring up at the moon. \"Twilight, again,\" he murmured. \"Another ending. No matter how perfect the day is, it always has to end.\" \"Some things don't have to end,\" I muttered through my teeth, instantly tense. He sighed. \"I brought you to the prom,\" he said slowly, finally answering my question, \"because I don't want you to miss anything. I don't want my presence to take anything away from you, if I can help it. I want you to be human. I want your life to continue as it would have if I'd died in nineteen-eighteen like I should have.\" I shuddered at his words, and then shook my head angrily. \"In what strange parallel dimension would I ever have gone to prom of my own free will? If you weren't a thousand times stronger than me, I would never have let you get away with this.\" He smiled briefly, but it didn't touch his eyes. \"It wasn't so bad, you said so yourself.\" \"That's because I was with you.\" We were quiet for a minute; he stared at the moon and I stared at him. I wished there was some way to explain how very uninterested I was in a normal human life. \"Will you tell me something?\" he asked, glancing down at me with a slight smile. \"Don't I always?\" \"Just promise you'll tell me,\" he insisted, grinning. I knew I was going to regret this almost instantly. \"Fine.\" \"You seemed honestly surprised when you figured out that I was taking you here,\" he began. \"I was,\" I interjected. \"Exactly,\" he agreed. \"But you must have had some other theory\u2026 I'm curious \u2014 what did you think I was dressing you up for?\" Yes, instant regret. I pursed my lips, hesitating. \"I don't want to tell you.\" \"You promised,\" he objected. \"I know.\" \"What's the problem?\" I knew he thought it was mere embarrassment holding me back. \"I think it will make you mad \u2014 or sad.\"  His brows pulled together over his eyes as he thought that through. \"I still want to know. Please?\" I sighed. He waited. \"Well\u2026 I assumed it was some kind of\u2026 occasion. But I didn't think it would be some trite human thing\u2026 prom!\" I scoffed. \"Human?\" he asked flatly. He'd picked up on the key word. I looked down at my dress, fidgeting with a stray piece of chiffon. He waited in silence. \"Okay,\" I confessed in a rush. \"So I was hoping that you might have changed your mind\u2026 that you were going to change me, after all.\" A dozen emotions played across his face. Some I recognized: anger\u2026 pain\u2026 and then he seemed to collect himself and his expression became amused. \"You thought that would be a black tie occasion, did you?\" he teased, touching the lapel of his tuxedo jacket. I scowled to hide my embarrassment. \"I don't know how these things work. To me, at least, it seems more rational than prom does.\" He was still grinning. \"It's not funny,\" I said. \"No, you're right, it's not,\" he agreed, his smile fading. \"I'd rather treat it like a joke, though, than believe you're serious.\" \"But I am serious.\" He sighed deeply. \"I know. And you're really that willing?\" The pain was back in his eyes. I bit my lip and nodded. \"So ready for this to be the end,\" he murmured, almost to himself, \"for this to be the twilight of your life, though your life has barely started. You're ready to give up everything.\" \"It's not the end, it's the beginning,\" I disagreed under my breath. \"I'm not worth it,\" he said sadly. \"Do you remember when you told me that I didn't see myself very clearly?\" I asked, raising my eyebrows. \"You obviously have the same blindness.\" \"I know what I am.\" I sighed. But his mercurial mood shifted on me. He pursed his lips, and his eyes were probing. He examined my face for a long moment.  \"You're ready now, then?\" he asked. \"Um.\" I gulped. \"Yes?\" He smiled, and inclined his head slowly until his cold lips brushed against the skin just under the corner of my jaw. \"Right now?\" he whispered, his breath blowing cool on my neck. I shivered involuntarily. \"Yes,\" I whispered, so my voice wouldn't have a chance to break. If he thought I was bluffing, he was going to be disappointed. I'd already made this decision, and I was sure. It didn't matter that my body was rigid as a plank, my hands balled into fists, my breathing erratic\u2026 He chuckled darkly, and leaned away. His face did look disappointed. \"You can't really believe that I would give in so easily,\" he said with a sour edge to his mocking tone. \"A girl can dream.\" His eyebrows rose. \"Is that what you dream about? Being a monster?\" \"Not exactly,\" I said, frowning at his word choice. Monster, indeed. \"Mostly I dream about being with you forever.\" His expression changed, softened and saddened by the subtle ache in my voice. \"Bella.\" His fingers lightly traced the shape of my lips. \"I will stay with you \u2014 isn't that enough?\" I smiled under his fingertips. \"Enough for now.\" He frowned at my tenacity. No one was going to surrender tonight. He exhaled, and the sound was practically a growl. I touched his face. \"Look,\" I said. \"I love you more than everything else in the world combined. Isn't that enough?\" \"Yes, it is enough,\" he answered, smiling. \"Enough for forever.\" And he leaned down to press his cold lips once more to my throat.",
