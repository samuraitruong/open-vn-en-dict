            "en": "7 REPETITION        22 FLIGHT DEMETRI LEFT US IN THE CHEERFULLY OPULENT RECEPTION area, where the woman Gianna was still at her post behind the polished counter. Bright, harmless music tinkled from hidden speakers. \"Do not leave until dark,\" he warned us. Edward nodded, and Demetri hurried away. Gianna did not seem at all surprised by the exchange, though she did eye Edward's borrowed cloak with shrewd speculation. \"Are you all right?\" Edward asked under his breath, too low for the human woman to hear. His voice was rough\u2014if velvet can be rough\u2014with anxiety. Still stressed by our situation, I imagined. \"You'd better make her sit before she falls,\" Alice said. \"She's going to pieces.\" It was only then that I realize I was shaking, shaking hard, my entire frame <em>vibrating</em> until my teeth chattered and the room around me seemed to wobble and blur in my eyes. For one wild second, I wondered if this was how Jacob felt just before exploding into a werewolf.  I heard a sound that didn't make sense, a strange, ripping counterpart to the otherwise cheery background music. Distracted by the shaking, I couldn't tell where it was coming from. \"Shh, Bella, shh,\" Edward said as he pulled me to the sofa farthest away from the curious human at the desk. \"I think she's having hysterics. Maybe you should slap her,\" Alice suggested. Edward threw a frantic glance at her. Then I understood. Oh. The noise was me. The ripping sound was the sobs coming from my chest. That's what was shaking me. \"It's all right, you're safe, it's all right,\" he chanted again and again. He pulled me onto his lap and tucked the thick wool cloak around me, protecting me from his cold skin. I knew it was stupid to react like this. Who knew how much time I had to look at his face? He was saved, and I was saved, and he could leave me as soon as we were free. To have my eyes so filled with tears that I could not see his features clearly was wasteful\u2014\u00a0 insanity. But, behind my eyes where the tears could not wash the image away, I could still see the panicked face of the tiny woman with the rosary. \"All those people,\" I sobbed. \"I know,\" he whispered. \"It's so horrible.\" \"Yes, it is. I wish you hadn't had to see that.\" I rested my head against his cold chest, using the thick cloak to wipe my eyes. I took a few deep breaths, trying to calm myself. \"Is there anything I can get you?\" a voice asked politely. It was Gianna, leaning over Edward's shoulder with a look that was both concerned and yet still professional and detached at the same time. It didn't seem to bother her that her face was inches from a hostile vampire. She was either totally oblivious, or very good at her job. \"No,\" Edward answered coldly. She nodded, smiled at me, and then disappeared. I waited until she was out of hearing range. \"Does she know what's going on here?\" I demanded, my voice low and hoarse. I was getting control of myself, my breathing evening out. \"Yes. She knows everything,\" Edward told me. \"Does she know they're going to kill her someday?\" \"She's knows it's a possibility,\" he said. That surprised me. Edward's face was hard to read. \"She's hoping they'll decide to keep her.\" I felt the blood leave my face. \"She wants to be one of them?\" He nodded once, his eyes sharp on my face, watching my reaction. I shuddered. \"How can she want that?\" I whispered, more to myself than really looking for an answer. \"How can she watch those people file through to that hideous room and want to be a part of that?\" Edward didn't answer. His expression twisted in response to something I'd said. As I stared at his too beautiful face, trying to understand the change, it suddenly struck me that I was really here, in Edward's arms, however fleetingly, and that we were not\u2014at this exact moment\u2014about to be killed. \"Oh, Edward,\" I cried, and I was sobbing again. It was such a stupid reaction. The tears were too thick for me to see his face again, and that was inexcusable. I only had until sunset for sure. Like a fairy tale again, with deadlines that ended the magic. \"What's wrong?\" he asked, still anxious, rubbing my back with gentle pats. I wrapped my arms around his neck\u2014what was the worst he could do? Just push me away\u2014and hugged myself closer to him. \"Is it really sick for me to be happy right now?\" I asked. My voice broke twice. He didn't push me away. He pulled me tight against his ice-hard chest, so tight it was hard to breathe, even with my lungs securely intact. \"I know exactly what you mean,\" he whispered. \"But we have lots of reasons to be happy. For one, we're alive.\" \"Yes,\" I agreed. \"That's a good one.\" \"And together,\" he breathed. His breath was so sweet it made my head swim. I just nodded, sure that he did not place the same weight on that consideration as I did. \"And, with any luck, we'll still be alive tomorrow.\" \"Hopefully,\" I said uneasily. \"The outlook is quite good,\" Alice assured me. She'd been so quiet, I'd almost forgotten her presence. \"I'll see Jasper in less than twenty-four hours,\" she added in a satisfied tone. Lucky Alice. She could trust her future. I couldn't keep my eyes off of Edward's face for long. I stared at him, wishing more than anything that the future would never happen. That this moment would last forever, or, if it couldn't, that I would stop existing when it did. Edward stared right back at me, his dark eyes soft, and it was easy to pretend that he felt the same way. So that's what I did. I pretended, to make the moment sweeter. His fingertips traced the circles under my eyes. \"You look so tired.\" \"And you look thirsty,\" I whispered back, studying the purple bruises under his black irises. He shrugged. \"It's nothing.\" \"Are you sure? I could sit with Alice,\" I offered, unwilling; I'd rather he killed me now than move one inch from where I was.  \"Don't be ridiculous.\" He sighed; his sweet breath caressed my face. \"I've never been in better control of that side of my nature than right now.\" I had a million questions for him. One of them bubbled to my lips now, but I held my tongue. I didn't want to ruin the moment, as imperfect as it was, here in this room that made me sick, under the eyes of the would-be monster. Here in his arms, it was so easy to fantasize that he wanted me. I didn't want to think about his motivations now\u2014about whether he acted this way to keep me calm while we were still in danger, or if he just felt guilty for where we were and relieved that he wasn't responsible for my death. Maybe the time apart had been enough that I didn't bore him for the moment. But it didn't matter. I was so much happier pretending. I lay quiet in his arms, re-memorizing his face, pretending\u2026 He stared at my face like he was doing the same, while he and Alice discussed how to get home. Their voices were so quick and low that I knew Gianna couldn't understand. I missed half of it myself. It sounded like more theft would be involved, though. I wondered idly if the yellow Porsche had made it back to its owner yet. \"What was all that talk about singers?\" Alice asked at one point. \"La tua cantante,\" Edward said. His voice made the words into music. \"Yes, that,\" Alice said, and I concentrated for a moment. I'd wondered about that, too, at the time. I felt Edward shrug around me. \"They have a name for someone who smells the way Bella does to me.\u00a0 They call her my singer\u2014because her blood sings for me.\" Alice laughed. I was tired enough to sleep, but I fought against the weariness. I wasn't going to miss a second of the time I had with him. Now and then, as he talked with Alice, he would lean down suddenly and kiss me\u2014his glass-smooth lips brushing against my hair, my forehead, the tip of my nose. Each time it was like an electric shock to my long dormant heart. The sound of its beating seemed to fill the entire room. It was heaven\u2014right smack in the middle of hell. I lost track of the time completely. So when Edward's arms tightened around me, and both he and Alice looked to the back of the room with wary eyes, I panicked. I cringed into Edward's chest as Alec\u2014his eyes now a vivid ruby, but still spotless in his light gray suit despite the afternoon meal\u2014walked through the double doors. It was good news. \"You're free to leave now,\" Alec told us, his tone so warm you'd think we were all lifelong friends. \"We ask that you don't linger in the city.\" Edward made no answering pretence; his voice was ice cold. \"That won't be a problem.\" Alec smiled, nodded, and disappeared again.  \"Follow the right hallway around the corner to the first set of elevators,\" Gianna told us as Edward helped me to my feet. \"The lobby is two floors down, and exits to the street. Goodbye, now,\" she added pleasantly. I wondered if her competence would be enough to save her.  Alice shot her a dark look. I was relieved there was another way out; I wasn't sure if I could handle another tour through the underground. We left through a tastefully luxurious lobby. I was the only one who glanced back at the medieval castle that housed the elaborate business facade. \u00a0I couldn't see the turret from here, for which I was grateful. The party was still in full swing in the streets. The street lamps were just coming on as we walked swiftly through the narrow, cobbled lanes. The sky was a dull, fading gray overhead, but the buildings crowded the streets so closely that it felt darker. The party was darker, too. Edward's long, trailing cloak did not stand out in the way it might have on a normal evening in Volterra. There were others in black satin cloaks now, and the plastic fangs I'd seen on the child in the square today seemed to be very popular with the adults. \"Ridiculous,\" Edward muttered once. I didn't notice when Alice disappeared from beside me. I looked over to ask her a question, and she was gone. \"Where's Alice?\" I whispered in a panic. \"She went to retrieve your bags from where she stashed them this morning.\" I'd forgotten that I had access to a toothbrush. It brightened my outlook considerably. \"She's stealing a car, too, isn't she?\" I guessed. He grinned. \"Not till we're outside.\" It seemed like a very long way to the entryway. Edward could see that I was spent; he wound his arm around my waist and supported most of my weight as we walked. I shuddered as he pulled me through the dark stone archway. The huge, ancient portcullis above was like a cage door, threatening to drop on us, to lock us in. He led me toward a dark car, waiting in a pool of shadow to the right of the gate with the engine running. To my surprise, he slid into the backseat with me, instead of insisting on driving. Alice was apologetic. \"I'm sorry.\" She gestured vaguely toward the dashboard. \"There wasn't much to choose from.\" \"It's fine, Alice.\" He grinned. \"They can't all be 911 Turbos.\" She sighed. \"I may have to acquire one of those legally. It was fabulous.\" \"I'll get you one for Christmas,\" Edward promised. Alice turned to beam at him, which worried me, as she was already speeding down the dark and curvy hillside at the same time. \"Yellow,\" she told him. Edward kept me tight in his arms. Inside the gray cloak, I was warm and comfortable. More than comfortable. \"You can sleep now, Bella,\" he murmured. \"It's over.\" I knew he meant the danger, the nightmare in the ancient city, but I still had to swallow hard before I could answer. \"I don't want to sleep. I'm not tired.\" Just the second part was a lie. I wasn't about to close my eyes. The car was only dimly lit by the dashboard controls, but it was enough that I could see his face. He pressed his lips to the hollow under my ear. \"Try,\" he encouraged. I shook my head. He sighed. \"You're still just as stubborn.\" I was stubborn; I fought with my heavy lids, and I won. The dark road was the hardest part; the bright lights at the airport in Florence made it easier, as did the chance to brush my teeth and change into clean clothes; Alice bought Edward new clothes, too, and he left the dark cloak on a pile of trash in an alley. The plane trip to Rome was so short that there wasn't really a chance for the fatigue to drag me under. I knew the flight from Rome to Atlanta would be another matter entirely, so I asked the flight attendant if she could bring me a Coke. \"Bella,\" Edward said disapprovingly. He knew my low tolerance for caffeine. Alice was behind us. I could hear her murmuring to Jasper on the phone. \"I don't want to sleep,\" I reminded him. I gave him an excuse that was believable because it was true. \"If I close my eyes now, I'll see things I don't want to see. I'll have nightmares.\" He didn't argue with me after that. It would have been a very good time to talk, to get the answers I needed\u2014needed but not really wanted; I was already despairing at the thought of what I might hear. We had an uninterrupted block of time ahead of us, and he couldn't escape me on an airplane\u2014well, not easily, at least. No one would hear us except Alice; it was late, and most of the passengers were turning off lights and asking for pillows in muted voices. Talk would help me fight off the exhaustion. But, perversely, I bit my tongue against the flood of questions. My reasoning was probably flawed by exhaustion, but I hoped that by postponing the discussion, I could buy a few more hours with him at some later time\u2014spin this out for another night, Scheherazade-style. So I kept drinking soda, and resisting even the urge to blink. Edward seemed perfectly content to hold me in his arms, his fingers tracing my face again and again. I touched his face, too. I couldn't stop myself, though I was afraid it would hurt me later, when I was alone again. He continued to kiss my hair, my forehead, my wrists\u2026 but never my lips, and that was good. After all, how many ways can one heart be mangled and still be expected to keep beating? I'd lived through a lot that should have finished me in the last few days, but it didn't make me feel strong. Instead, I felt horribly fragile, like one word could shatter me. Edward didn't speak. Maybe he was hoping I would sleep. Maybe he had nothing to say. I won the fight against my heavy lids. I was awake when we reached the airport in Atlanta, and I even watched the sun beginning to rise over Seattle's cloud cover before Edward slid the window shut. I was proud of myself. I hadn't missed one minute. Neither Alice nor Edward was surprised by the reception that waited for us at Sea-Tac airport, but it caught me off guard. Jasper was the first one I saw\u2014he didn't seem to see me at all. His eyes were only for Alice. She went quickly to his side; they didn't embrace like other couples meeting there. They only stared into each other's faces, yet, somehow, the moment was so private that I still felt the need to look away. Carlisle and Esme waited in a quiet corner far from the line for the metal detectors, in the shadow of a wide pillar. Esme reached for me, hugging me fiercely, yet awkwardly, because Edward kept his arms around me, too. \"Thank you so much,\" she said in my ear. Then she threw her arms around Edward, and she looked like she would be crying if that were possible. \"You will never put me through that again,\" she nearly growled. Edward grinned, repentant. \"Sorry, Mom.\" \"Thank you, Bella,\" Carlisle said. \"We owe you.\" \"Hardly,\" I mumbled. The sleepless night was suddenly overpowering. My head felt disconnected from my body. \"She's dead on her feet,\" Esme scolded Edward. \"Let's get her home.\" Not sure if home was what I wanted at this point, I stumbled, half-blind, through the airport, Edward dragging me on one side and Esme on the other. I didn't know if Alice and Jasper were behind us or not, and I was too exhausted to look. I think I was mostly asleep, though I was still walking, when we reached their car. The surprise of seeing Emmett and Rosalie leaning against the black sedan under the dim lights of the parking garage revived me some. Edward stiffened. \"Don't,\" Esme whispered. \"She feels awful.\" \"She should,\" Edward said, making no attempt to keep his voice down. \"It's not her fault,\" I said, my words garbled with exhaustion. \"Let her make amends,\" Esme pleaded.  \"We'll ride with Alice and Jasper.\"\u00a0 Edward glowered at the absurdly lovely blond vampire waiting for us. \"Please, Edward,\" I said. I didn't want to ride with Rosalie any more than he seemed to, but I'd caused more than enough discord in his family. He sighed, and towed me toward the car. Emmett and Rosalie got in the front seat without speaking, while Edward pulled me in the back again. I knew I wasn't going to be able to fight my eyelids anymore, and I laid my head against his chest in defeat, letting them close. I felt the car purr to life. \"Edward,\" Rosalie began. \"I know.\" Edward's brusque tone was not generous. \"Bella?\" Rosalie asked softly. My eyelids fluttered open in shock. It was the first time she'd ever spoken directly to me. \"Yes, Rosalie?\" I asked, hesitant. \"I'm so very sorry, Bella. I feel wretched about every part of this, and so grateful that you were brave enough to go save my brother after what I did. Please say you'll forgive me.\" The words were awkward, stilted because of her embarrassment, but they seemed sincere. \"Of course, Rosalie,\" I mumbled, grasping at any chance to make her hate me a little less. \"It's not your fault at all. I'm the one who jumped off the damn cliff. Of course I forgive you.\" The words came out like mush. \"It doesn't count until she's conscious, Rose,\" Emmett chuckled. \"I'm conscious,\" I said; it just sounded like a garbled sigh. \"Let her sleep,\" Edward insisted, but his voice was a little warmer. It was quiet then, except for the gentle thrum of the engine. I must have fallen asleep, because it seemed like seconds later when the door opened and Edward was carrying me from the car. My eyes wouldn't open. At first I thought we were still at the airport. And then I heard Charlie. \"Bella!\" he shouted from some distance. \"Charlie,\" I mumbled, trying to shake off the stupor. \"Shh,\" Edward whispered. \"It's okay; you're home and safe. Just sleep.\" \"I can't believe you have the nerve to show your face here.\" Charlie bellowed at Edward, his voice much closer now. \"Stop it, Dad,\" I groaned. He didn't hear me. \"What's wrong with her?\" Charlie demanded. \"She's just very tired, Charlie,\" Edward assured him quietly. \"Please let her rest.\" \"Don't tell me what to do!\" Charlie yelled. \"Give her to me. Get your hands off her!\" Edward tried to pass me to Charlie, but I clung to him with locked, tenacious fingers. I could feel my dad yanking on my arm. \"Cut it out, Dad,\" I said with more volume. I managed to drag my lids back to stare at Charlie with bleary eyes. \"Be mad at me.\" We were in front of my house. The front door was standing open. The cloud cover overhead was too thick to guess at a time of day. \"You bet I will be,\" Charlie promised. \"Get inside.\" \u201cO\u2019Kay. Let me down,\" I sighed. Edward set me on my feet. I could see that I was upright, but I couldn't feel my legs. I trudged forward anyway, until the sidewalk swirled up toward my face. Edward's arms caught me before I hit the concrete. \"Just let me get her upstairs,\" Edward said. \"Then I'll leave.\" \"No,\" I cried, panicking. I hadn't got my answers yet. He had to stay for at least that much, didn't he? \"I won't be far,\" Edward promised, whispering so low in my ear that Charlie didn't have a hope of hearing. I didn't hear Charlie answer, but Edward headed into the house. My open eyes only made it till the stairs. The last thing I felt was Edward's cool hands prying my fingers loose from his shirt.",

            "en": "7 REPETITION          14. FAMILY I COWERED INTO JACOB'S SIDE, MY EYES SCANNING the forest for the other werewolves. When they appeared, striding out from between the trees, they weren't what I was expecting. I'd gotten the image of the wolves stuck in my head. These were just four really big half-naked boys. Again, they reminded me of brothers, quadruplets. Something about the way they moved almost in synchronization to stand across the road from us, the way they all had the same long, round muscles under the same red-brown skin, the same cropped black hair, and the way their expressions altered at exactly the same moment. They started out curious and cautious. When they saw me there, half-hidden beside Jacob, they all became furious in the same second. Sam was still the biggest, though Jacob was getting close to catching up with him. Sam didn't really count as a boy. His face was older\u2014not in the sense of lines or signs of aging, but in the maturity, the patience of his expression. \"What have you done, Jacob?\" he demanded. One of the others, one I didn't recognize\u2014Jared or Paul\u2014thrust past Sam and spoke before Jacob could defend himself. \"Why can't you just follow the rules, Jacob?\" he yelled, throwing his arms in the air. \"What the hell are you thinking? Is she more important than everything\u2014than the whole tribe? Than the people getting killed?\" \"She can help,\" Jacob said quietly. \"Help!\" the angry boy shouted. His arms begin to quiver. \"Oh, that's likely! I'm sure the leech-lover is just dying to help us out!\" \"Don't talk about her like that!\" Jacob shouted back, stung by the boy's criticism. A shudder rippled through the other boy, along his shoulders and down his spine. \"Paul! Relax!\" Sam commanded. Paul shook his head back and forth, not in defiance, but as though he were trying to concentrate. \"Jeez, Paul,\" one of the other boys\u2014probably Jared\u2014muttered. \"Get a grip.\" Paul twisted his head toward Jared, his lips curling back in irritation. Then he shifted his glare in my direction. Jacob took a step to put himself in front of me. That did it. \"Right, protect her!\" Paul roared in outrage. Another shudder, a convulsion, heaved through his body. He threw his head back, a real growl tearing from between his teeth. \"Paul!\" Sam and Jacob shouted together. Paul seemed to fall forward, <em>vibrating</em> violently. Halfway to the ground, there was a loud ripping noise, and the boy exploded. Dark silver fur blew out from the boy, coalescing into a shape more than five-times his size\u2014a massive, crouched shape, ready to spring. The wolf's muzzle wrinkled back over his teeth, and another growl rolled through his colossal chest. His dark, enraged eyes focused on me. In the same second, Jacob was running across the road straight for the monster. \"Jacob!\" I screamed. Mid-stride, a long tremor shivered down Jacob's spine. He leaped forward, diving headfirst into the empty air. With another sharp tearing sound, Jacob exploded, too. He burst out of his skin\u2014shreds of black and white cloth blasted up into the air. It happened so quickly that if I'd blinked, I'd have missed the entire transformation. One second it was Jacob diving into the air, and then it was the gigantic, russet brown wolf\u2014so enormous that I couldn't make sense of its mass somehow fitting inside Jacob\u2014charging the crouched silver beast. Jacob met the other werewolf's attack head-on. Their angry snarls echoed like thunder off the trees. The black and white scraps\u2014the remains of Jacob's clothes\u2014fluttered to the ground where he'd disappeared. \"Jacob!\" I screamed again, staggering forward. \"Stay where you are, Bella,\" Sam ordered. It was hard to hear him over the roar of the fighting wolves. They were snapping and tearing at each other, their sharp teeth flashing toward each other's throats. The Jacob-wolf seemed to have the upper hand\u2014he was visibly bigger than the other wolf, and it looked like he was stronger, too. He rammed his shoulder against the gray wolf again and again, knocking him back toward the trees. \"Take her to Emily's,\" Sam shouted toward the other boys, who were watching the conflict with rapt expressions. Jacob had successfully shoved the gray wolf off the road, and they were disappearing into the forest, though the sound of their snarls was still loud. Sam ran after them, kicking off his shoes on the way. As he darted into the trees, he was quivering from head to toe.  The growling and snapping was fading into the distance. Suddenly, the sound cut off and it was very quiet on the road. One of the boys started laughing. I turned to stare at him\u2014my wide eyes felt frozen, like I couldn't even blink them. The boy seemed to be laughing at my expression. \"Well, there's something you don't see every day,\" he snickered. His face was vaguely familiar\u2014thinner than the others\u2026 Embry Call. \"I do,\" the other boy, Jared, grumbled. \"Every single day.\" \"Aw, Paul doesn't lose his temper every day,\" Embry disagreed, still grinning. \"Maybe two out of three.\" Jared stopped to pick something white up off the ground. He held it up toward Embry; it dangled in limp strips from his hand. \"Totally shredded,\" Jared said. \"Billy said this was the last pair he could afford\u2014guess Jacob's going barefoot now.\" \"This one survived,\" Embry said, holding up a white sneaker. \"Jake can hop,\" he added with a laugh. Jared started collecting various pieces of fabric from the dirt. \"Get Sam's shoes, will you? All the rest of this is headed for the trash.\" Embry grabbed the shoes and then jogged into the trees where Sam had disappeared. He was back in a few seconds with a pair of cut-off jeans draped over his arm. Jared gathered the torn remnants of Jacob's and Paul's clothes and wadded them into a ball. Suddenly, he seemed to remember me. He looked at me carefully, assessing. \"Hey, you're not going to faint or puke or anything?\" he demanded. \"I don't think so,\" I gasped. \"You don't look so good. Maybe you should sit down.\" \"Okay,\" I mumbled. For the second time in one morning, I put my head between my\u00a0 knees. \"Jake should have warned us,\" Embry complained. \"He shouldn't have brought his girlfriend into this. What did he expect?\" \"Well, the wolf's out of the bag now.\" Embry sighed. \"Way to go, Jake.\" I raised my head to glare at the two boys who seemed to be taking this all so lightly. \"Aren't you worried about them at all?\" I demanded. Embry blinked once in surprise \"Worried? Why?\" \"They could hurt each other!\" Embry and Jared guffawed. \"I hope Paul gets a mouthful of him,\" Jared said. \"Teach him a lesson.\" I blanched. \"Yeah, right!\" Embry disagreed. \"Did you see Jake? Even Sam couldn't have phased on the fly like that.\u00a0 He saw Paul losing it, and it took him, what, half a second to attack? The boy's got a gift.\" \"Paul's been fighting longer. I'll bet you ten bucks he leaves a mark.\" \"You're on. Jake's a natural. Paul doesn't have a prayer.\" They shook hands, grinning. I tried to comfort myself with their lack of concern, but I couldn't drive the brutal image of the fighting werewolves from my head. My stomach churned, sore and empty, my head ached with worry. \"Let's go see Emily. You know she'll have food waiting.\" Embry looked down at me. \"Mind giving us a ride?\" \"No problem,\" I choked. Jared raised one eyebrow. \"Maybe you'd better drive, Embry. She still looks like she might hurl.\" \"Good idea. Where are the keys?\" Embry asked me. \"Ignition.\" Embry opened the passenger-side door. \"In you go,\" he said cheerfully, hauling me up from the ground with one hand and stuffing me into my seat. He appraised the available space. \"You'll have to ride in the back,\" he told Jared. \"That's fine. I got a weak stomach. I don't want to be in there when she blows.\" \"I bet she's tougher than that. She runs with vampires.\" \"Five bucks?\" Jared asked. \"Done. I feel guilty, taking your money like this.\" Embry got in and started the engine while Jared leapt agilely into the bed. As soon as his door was closed, Embry muttered to me, \"Don't throw up, okay? I've only got a ten, and if Paul got his teeth into Jacob\u2026\" \"Okay,\" I whispered. Embry drove us back toward the village. \"Hey, how did Jake get around the injunction anyway?\" \"The\u2026 what?\" \"Er, the order. You know, to not spill the beans. How did he tell you about this?\" \"Oh, that,\" I said, remembering Jacob trying to choke out the truth to me last night. \"He didn't. I guessed right.\" Embry pursed his lips, looking surprised. \"Hmm. S'pose that would work.\" \"Where are we going?\" I asked. \"Emily's house. She's Sam's girlfriend\u2026 no, fianc\u00e9e, now, I guess. They'll meet us back there after Sam gives it to them for what just happened. And after Paul and Jake scrounge up some new clothes, if Paul even has any left.\" \"Does Emily know about\u2026 ?\" \"Yeah. And hey, don't stare at her. That bugs Sam.\" I frowned at him. \"Why would I stare?\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Embry looked uncomfortable. \"Like you saw just now, hanging out around werewolves has its risks.\" He changed the subject quickly. \"Hey, are you okay about the whole thing with the black-haired bloodsucker in the meadow? It didn't look like he was a friend of yours, but. .\" Embry shrugged. \"No, he wasn't my friend.\" \"That's good. We didn't want to start anything, break the treaty, you know.\" \"Oh, yeah, Jake told me about the treaty once, a long time ago. Why would killing Laurent break the treaty?\" \"Laurent,\" he repeated, snorting, like he was amused the vampire had had a name. \"Well, we were technically on Cullen turf. We're not allowed to attack any of them, the Cullens, at least, off our land\u2014unless they break the treaty first. We didn't know if the black-haired one was a relative of theirs or something. Looked like you knew him.\" \"How would they go about breaking the treaty?\" \"If they bite a human. Jake wasn't so keen on the idea of letting it go that far.\" \"Oh. Um, thanks. I'm glad you didn't wait.\" \"Our pleasure.\" He sounded like he meant that in a literal sense. Embry drove past the easternmost house on the highway before turning off onto a narrow dirt road. \"Your truck is slow,\" he noted. \"Sorry.\" At the end of the lane was a tiny house that had once been gray. There was only one narrow window beside the weathered blue door, but the window box under it was filled with bright orange and yellow marigolds, giving the whole place a cheerful look. Embry opened the truck door and inhaled. \"Mmm, Emily's cooking.\" Jared jumped out of the back of the truck and headed for the door, but Embry stopped him with one hand on his chest. He looked at me meaningfully, and cleared his throat. \"I don't have my wallet on me,\" Jared said. \"That's okay. I won't forget.\" They climbed up the one step and entered the house without knocking. I followed timidly after them. The front room, like Billy's house, was mostly kitchen. A young woman with satiny copper skin and long, straight, crow-black hair was standing at the counter by the sink, popping big muffins out of a tin and placing them on a paper plate. For one second, I thought the reason Embry had told me not to stare was because the girl was so beautiful. And then she asked \"You guys hungry?\" in a melodic voice, and she turned to face us full on, a smile on half of her face. The right side of her face was scarred from hairline to chin by three thick, red lines, livid in color though they were long healed. One line pulled down the corner of her dark, almond-shaped right eye, another twisted the right side of her mouth into a permanent grimace. Thankful for Embry's warning, I quickly turned my eyes to the muffins in her hands. They smelled wonderful\u2014like fresh blueberries. \"Oh,\" Emily said, surprised. \"Who's this?\" I looked up, trying to focus on the left half of her face. \"Bella Swan,\" Jared told her, shrugging. Apparently, I'd been a topic of conversation before. \"Who else?\" \"Leave it to Jacob to find a way around,\" Emily murmured. She stared at me, and neither half of her once-beautiful face was friendly. \"So, you're the vampire girl.\" I stiffened. \"Yes. Are you the wolf girl?\" She laughed, as did Embry and Jared. The left half of her face warmed. \"I guess I am.\" She turned to Jared. \"Where's Sam?\" \"Bella, er, surprised Paul this morning.\" Emily rolled her good eye. \"Ah, Paul,\" she sighed. \"Do you think they'll be long? I was just about to start the eggs.\" \"Don't worry,\" Embry told her. \"If they're late, we won't let anything go to waste.\" Emily chuckled, and then opened the refrigerator. \"No doubt,\" she agreed. \"Bella, are you hungry? Go ahead and help yourself to a muffin.\" \"Thanks.\" I took one from the plate and started nibbling around the edges. It was delicious, and it felt good in my tender stomach. Embry picked up his third and shoved it into his mouth whole. \"Save some for your brothers,\" Emily chastised him, hitting him on the head with a wooden spoon. The word surprised me, but the others thought nothing of it. \"Pig,\" Jared commented. I leaned against the counter and watched the three of them banter like a family. Emily's kitchen was a friendly place, bright with white cupboards and pale wooden floorboards. On the little round table, a cracked blue-and-white china pitcher was overflowing with wildflowers. Embry and Jared seemed entirely at ease here. Emily was mixing a humongous batch of eggs, several dozen, in a big yellow bowl. She had the sleeves of her lavender shirt pushed up, and I could see that the scars extended all the way down her arm to the back of her right hand. Hanging out with werewolves truly did have its risks, just as Embry had said. The front door opened, and Sam stepped through. \"Emily,\" he said, and so much love saturated his voice that I felt embarrassed, intrusive, as I watched him cross the room in one stride and take her face in his wide hands. He leaned down and kissed the dark scars on her right cheek before he kissed her lips. \"Hey, none of that,\" Jared complained. \"I'm eating.\" \"Then shut up and eat,\" Sam suggested, kissing Emily's ruined mouth again. \"Ugh,\" Embry groaned. This was worse than any romantic movie; this was so real that it sang out loud with joy and life and true love. I put my muffin down and folded my arms across my empty chest. I stared at the flowers, trying to ignore the utter peace of their moment, and the wretched throbbing of my wounds. I was grateful for the distraction when Jacob and Paul came through the door, and then shocked when I saw that they were laughing. While I watched, Paul punched Jacob on the shoulder and Jacob went for a kidney jab in return. They laughed again. They both appeared to be in one piece. Jacob scanned the room, his eyes stopping when he found me leaning, awkward and out of place, against the counter in the far corner of the kitchen. \"Hey, Bells,\" he greeted me cheerfully. He grabbed two muffins as he passed the table and came to stand beside me. \"Sorry about before,\" he muttered under his breath. \"How are you holding up.'\" \"Don't worry, I'm okay. Good muffins.\" I picked mine back up and started libber again. My chest felt better as soon as Jacob was beside me. \"Oh, man!\" Jared wailed, interrupting us. I looked up, and he and Embry were examining a fading pink line on Paul's forearm. Embry was grinning, exultant. \"Fifteen dollars,\" he crowed. \"Did you do that?\" I whispered to Jacob, remembering the bet. \"I barely touched him. He'll be perfect by sundown.\" \"By sundown?\" I looked at the line on Paul's arm. Odd, but it looked weeks old. \"Wolf thing,\" Jacob whispered. I nodded, trying to not look weirded out. \"You okay?\" I asked him under my breath. \"Not a scratch on me.\" His expression was smug. \"Hey, guys,\" Sam said in a loud voice, interrupting all the conversations going on in the small room. Emily was at the stove, scraping the egg mixture around a big skillet, but Sam still had one hand touching the small of her back, an unconscious gesture. \"Jacob has information for us.\" Paul looked unsurprised. Jacob must have explained this to him and Sam already. Or\u2026 they'd just heard his thoughts. \"I know what the redhead wants.\" Jacob directed his words toward Jared and Embry. \"That's what I was trying to tell you before.\" He kicked the leg of the chair Paul had settled into. \"And?\" Jared asked. Jacob's face got serious. \"She is trying to avenge her mate\u2014only it wasn't the black-haired leech we killed. The Cullens got her mate last year, and she's after Bella now.\" This wasn't news to me, but I still shivered. Jared, Embry, and Emily stared at me with open-mouthed surprise. \"She's just a girl,\" Embry protested. \"I didn't say it made sense. But that's why the bloodsucker's been trying to get past us. She's been heading for Forks.\" They continued to stare at me, mouths still hanging open, for a long moment. I ducked my head. \"Excellent,\" Jared finally said, a smile beginning to pull up the corners of his mouth. \"We've got bait.\" With stunning speed, Jacob yanked a can opener from the counter and launched it at Jared's head. Jared's hand flicked up faster than I would have thought possible, and he snagged the tool just before it hit his face. \"Bella is not bait.\" \"You know what I mean,\" Jared said, unabashed. \"So we'll be changing our patterns,\" Sam said, ignoring their squabble. \"We'll try leaving a few holes, and see if she falls for it. We'll have to split up, and I don't like that. But if she's really after Bella, she probably won't try to take advantage of our divided numbers.\" \"Quit's got to be close to joining us,\" Embry murmured. \"Then we'll be able to split evenly.\" Everyone looked down. I glanced at Jacob's face, and it was hopeless, like it had been yesterday afternoon, outside his house. No matter how comfortable they seemed to be with their fate, here in this happy kitchen, none of these werewolves wanted the same fate for their friend. \"Well, we won't count on that,\" Sam said in a low voice, and then continued at his regular volume. \"Paul, Jared, and Embry will take the outer perimeter, and Jacob and I will take the inner. We'll collapse in when we've got her trapped.\" I noticed that Emily didn't particularly like that Sam would be in the smaller grouping. Her worry had me glancing up at Jacob, worrying, too. Sam caught my eye. \"Jacob thinks it would be best if you spent as much time as possible here in La Push.\u00a0 She won't know where to find you so easily, just in case.\" \"What about Charlie?\" I demanded. \"March Madness is still going,\" Jacob said. \"I think Billy and Harry can manage to keep Charlie down here when he's not at work.\" \"Wait,\" Sam said, holding one hand up. His glance flickered to Emily and then back to me. \"That's what Jacob thinks is best, but you need to decide for yourself. You should weigh the risks of both options very seriously. You saw this morning how easily things can get dangerous here, how quickly they get out of hand. If you choose to stay with us, I can't make any guarantees about your safety.\" \"I won't hurt her,\" Jacob mumbled, looking down. Sam acted as if he hadn't heard him speak. \"If there was somewhere else you felt safe\u2026\" I bit my lip. Where could I go that wouldn't put someone else in danger? I recoiled again from the idea of bringing Renee into this\u2014pulling her into the circle of the target I wore\u2026 \"I don't want to lead Victoria anywhere else,\" I whispered. Sam nodded. \"That's true. It's better to have her here, where we can end this.\" I flinched. I didn't want Jacob or any of the rest of them trying to end Victoria. I glanced at Jake's face; it was relaxed, almost the same as I remembered it from before the onset of the wolf thing, and utterly unconcerned by the idea of hunting vampires. \"You'll be careful, right?\" I asked, an audible lump in my throat. The boys burst into loud hoots of amusement. Everyone laughed at me\u2014except Emily. She met my eyes, and I could suddenly see the symmetry underlying her deformity. Her face was still beautiful, and alive with a concern even more fierce than mine. I had to look away, before the love behind that concern could start me aching again. \"Food's ready,\" she announced then, and the strategic conversation was history. The guys hurried to surround the table\u2014which looked tiny and in danger of being crushed by them\u2014and devoured the buffet-sized pan of eggs Emily placed in their midst in record time. Emily ate leaning against the counter like me\u2014avoiding the bedlam at the table\u2014and watched them with affectionate eyes. Her expression clearly stated that this was her family. All in all, it wasn't exactly what I'd been expecting from a pack of werewolves. I spent the day in La Push, the majority of it in Billy's house. He left a message on Charlie's phone and at the station, and Charlie showed up around dinnertime with two pizzas. It was good he brought two larges; Jacob ate one all by himself. I saw Charlie eyeing the two of us suspiciously all night, especially the much-changed Jacob. He asked about the hair; Jacob shrugged and told him it was just more convenient. I knew that as soon as Charlie and I were headed home, Jacob would take off\u2014off to run around as a wolf, as he had done intermittently through the entire day. He and his brothers of sorts kept up a constant watch, looking for some sign of Victoria's return. But since they'd chased her away from the hot springs last night\u2014chased her halfway to Canada, according to Jacob\u2014she'd yet to make another foray. I had no hope at all that she might just give up. I didn't have that kind of luck. Jacob walked me to my truck after dinner and lingered by the window, waiting for Charlie to drive away first. \"Don't be afraid tonight,\" Jacob said, while Charlie pretended to be having trouble with his seat belt. \"We'll be out there, watching.\" \"I won't worry about myself,\" I promised. \"You're silly. Hunting vampires is fun. It's the best part of this whole mess.\" I shook my head. \"If I'm silly, then you're dangerously unbalanced.\" He chuckled. \"Get some rest, Bella, honey. You look exhausted.\" \"I'll try.\" Charlie honked his horn impatiently. \"See you tomorrow,\" Jacob said. \"Come down first thing.\" \"I will.\" Charlie followed me home. I paid scant attention to the lights in my rearview mirror. Instead, I wondered where Sam and Jared and Embry and Paul were, out running in the night. I wondered if Jacob had joined them yet. When we got home, I hurried for the stairs, but Charlie was right behind me. \"What's going on, Bella?\" he demanded before I could escape. \"I thought Jacob was part of a gang and you two were fighting.\" \"We made up.\" \"And the gang?\" \"I don't know\u2014who can understand teenage boys? They're a mystery. But I met Sam Uley and his fianc\u00e9e, Emily. They seemed pretty nice to me.\" I shrugged. \"Must have all been a misunderstanding.\" His face changed. \"I hadn't heard that he and Emily had made it official. That's nice. Poor girl.\" \"Do you know what happened to her?\" \"Mauled by a bear, up north, during salmon spawning season\u2014horrible accident .\u00a0 It was more than a year ago now. I heard Sam was really messed up over it.\" \"That's horrible,\" I echoed. More than a year ago. I'd bet that meant it had happened when there was just one werewolf in La Push. I shuddered at the thought of how Sam must have felt every time he looked at Emily's face. That night, I lay awake for a long time trying to sort through the day. I worked my way backward through dinner with Billy, Jacob, and Charlie, to the long afternoon in the Blacks' house, waiting anxiously to hear something from Jacob, to Emily's kitchen, to the horror of the werewolf fight, to talking with Jacob on the beach. I thought about what Jacob had said early this morning, about hypocrisy. I thought about that for a long time. I didn't like to think that I was a hypocrite, only what was the point of lying to myself? I curled into a tight ball. No, Edward wasn't a killer. Even in his darker past, he'd never been a murderer of innocents, at least. But what if he had been? What if, during the time I that I'd known him, he'd been just like any other vampire? What if people had been disappearing from the woods, just like now? Would that have kept me away from him? I shook my head sadly. Love is irrational, I reminded myself. The more you loved someone, the less sense anything made. I rolled over and tried to think of something else\u2014and I thought of Jacob and his brothers, out running in the darkness. I fell asleep imagining the wolves, invisible in the night, guarding me from danger. When I dreamed, I stood in the forest again, but I didn't wander. I was holding Emily's scarred hand as we faced into the shadows and waited anxiously for our werewolves to come home.",

            "en": "8          8. TEMPER We ended up on the beach again, wandering aimlessly. Jacob was still full of himself for engineering my escape. \u201cDo you think they\u2019ll come looking for you?\u201d he asked, sounding hopeful. \u201cNo.\u201d I was certain about that. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be furious with me tonight, though.\u201d He picked up a rock and chucked it into the waves. \u201cDon\u2019t go back, then,\u201d he suggested again. \u00a0\u201cCharlie would love that,\u201d I said sarcastically. \u201cI bet he wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d I didn\u2019t answer. Jacob was probably right, and that made me grind my teeth together. Charlie\u2019s blatant preference for my Quileute friends was so unfair. I wondered if he would feel the same if he knew the choice was really between vampires and werewolves. \u201cSo what\u2019s the latest pack scandal?\u201d I asked lightly. Jacob skidded to a halt, and he stared down at me with shocked eyes. \u201cWhat? That was a joke.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d He looked away. I waited for him to start walking again, but he seemed lost in thought.  \u201cIs there a scandal?\u201d I wondered. Jacob chuckled once. \u201cI forget what it\u2019s like, not having everyone know everything all the time. Having a quiet, private place inside my head.\u201d We walked along the stony beach quietly for a few minutes. \u00a0\u201cSo what is it?\u201d I finally asked. \u201cThat everyone in your head already knows?\u201d He hesitated for a moment, as if he weren\u2019t sure how much he was going to tell me. Then he sighed and said, \u201cQuil imprinted. That\u2019s three now. The rest of us are starting to get worried. Maybe it\u2019s more common than the stories say. . . .\u201d He frowned, and then turned to stare at me. He gazed into my eyes without speaking, his eyebrows furrowed in concentration. \u201cWhat are you staring at?\u201d I asked, feeling self-conscious. He sighed. \u201cNothing.\u201d Jacob started walking again. Without seeming to think about it, he reached out and took my hand. We paced silently across the rocks. I thought of how we must look walking hand and hand down the beach \u2014 like a couple, certainly \u2014 and wondered if I should object. But this was the way it had always been with Jacob. . . . No reason to get worked up about it now. \u201cWhy is Quil\u2019s imprinting such a scandal?\u201d I asked when it didn\u2019t look like he was going to go on. \u201cIs it because he\u2019s the newest one?\u201d  \u201cThat doesn\u2019t have anything to do with it.\u201d \u201cThen what\u2019s the problem?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s another one of those legend things. I wonder when we\u2019re going to stop being surprised that they\u2019re all true?\u201d he muttered to himself. \u00a0\u201cAre you going to tell me? Or do I have to guess?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d never get it right. See, Quil hasn\u2019t been hanging out with us, you know, until just recently. So he hadn\u2019t been around Emily\u2019s place much.\u201d \u201cQuil imprinted on Emily, too?\u201d I gasped. \u201cNo! I told you not to guess. Emily had her two nieces down for a visit . . . and Quil met Claire.\u201d He didn\u2019t continue. I thought about that for a moment. \u201cEmily doesn\u2019t want her niece with a werewolf? That\u2019s a little hypocritical,\u201d I said. But I could understand why she of all people might feel that way. I thought again of the long scars that marred her face and extended all the way down her right arm. Sam had lost control just once when he was standing too close to her. Once was all it took. . . . I\u2019d seen the pain in Sam\u2019s eyes when he looked at what he\u2019d done to Emily. I could understand why Emily might want to protect her niece from that. \u00a0\u201cWould you please stop guessing? You\u2019re way off. Emily doesn\u2019t mind that part, it\u2019s just, well, a little early.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean early?\u201d Jacob appraised me with narrowed eyes. \u201cTry not to be judgmental, okay?\u201d I nodded cautiously. \u201cClaire is two,\u201d Jacob told me. Rain started to fall. I blinked furiously as the drops pelted my face. Jacob waited in silence. He wore no jacket, as usual; the rain left a spatter of dark spots on his black T-shirt, and dripped through his shaggy hair. His face was expressionless as he watched mine. \u201cQuil . . . imprinted . . . with a two-year-old?\u201d I was finally able to ask. \u201cIt happens.\u201d Jacob shrugged. He bent to grab another rock and sent it flying out into the bay. \u201cOr so the stories say.\u201d \u201cBut she\u2019s a baby,\u201d I protested. He looked at me with dark amusement. \u201cQuil\u2019s not getting any older,\u201d he reminded me, a bit of acid in his tone. \u201cHe\u2019ll just have to be patient for a few decades.\u201d \u201cI . . . don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d I was trying my hardest not to be critical, but, in truth, I was horrified. Until now, nothing about the werewolves had bothered me since the day I\u2019d found out they weren\u2019t committing the murders I\u2019d suspected them of. \u201cYou\u2019re making judgments,\u201d he accused. \u201cI can see it on your face.\u201d \u201cSorry,\u201d I muttered. \u201cBut it sounds really creepy.\u201d \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not like that; you\u2019ve got it all wrong,\u201d Jacob defended his friend, suddenly vehement. \u201cI\u2019ve seen what it\u2019s like, through his eyes. There\u2019s nothing romantic about it at all, not for Quil, not now.\u201d He took a deep breath, frustrated. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard to describe. It\u2019s not like love at first sight, really. It\u2019s more like . . .gravity moves. When you see her, suddenly it\u2019s not the earth holding you here anymore. She does. And nothing matters more than her. And you would do anything for her, be anything for her. . . . You become whatever she needs you to be, whether that\u2019s a protector, or a lover, or a friend, or a brother.   \u201cQuil will be the best, kindest big brother any kid ever had. There isn\u2019t a toddler on the planet that will be more carefully looked after than that little girl will be. And then, when she\u2019s older and needs a friend, he\u2019ll be more understanding, trustworthy, and reliable than anyone else she knows. And then, when she\u2019s grown up, they\u2019ll be as happy as Emily and Sam.\u201d A strange, bitter edge sharpened his tone at the very end, when he spoke of Sam. \u00a0\u201cDoesn\u2019t Claire get a choice here?\u201d \u201cOf course. But why wouldn\u2019t she choose him, in the end? He\u2019ll be her perfect match. Like he was designed for her alone.\u201d We walked in silence for a moment, till I paused to toss a rock toward the ocean. It fell to the beach several meters short. Jacob laughed at me. \u201cWe can\u2019t all be freakishly strong,\u201d I muttered. He sighed. \u201cWhen do you think it will happen for you?\u201d I asked quietly. His answer was flat and immediate. \u201cNever.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not something you can control, is it?\u201d He was silent for a few minutes. Unconsciously, we both walked slower, barely moving at all. \u201cIt\u2019s not supposed to be,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut you have to see her \u2014 the one that\u2019s supposedly meant for you.\u201d \u201cAnd you think that if you haven\u2019t seen her yet, then she\u2019s not out there?\u201d I asked skeptically. \u201cJacob, you haven\u2019t really seen much of the world \u2014 less than me, even.\u201d \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t,\u201d he said in a low voice. He looked at my face with suddenly piercing eyes. \u201cBut I\u2019ll never see anyone else, Bella. I only see you. Even when I close my eyes and try to see something else. Ask Quil or Embry. It drives them all crazy.\u201d I dropped my eyes to the rocks. We weren\u2019t walking anymore. The only sound was of the waves beating against the shore. I couldn\u2019t hear the rain over their roar. \u201cMaybe I\u2019d better go home,\u201d I whispered. \u201cNo!\u201d he protested, surprised by this conclusion. I looked up at him again, and his eyes were anxious now. \u201cYou have the whole day off, right? The bloodsucker won\u2019t be home yet.\u201d I glared at him. \u201cNo offense intended,\u201d he said quickly. \u201cYes, I have the whole day. But, Jake . . .\u201d He held up his hands. \u201cSorry,\u201d he apologized. \u201cI won\u2019t be like that anymore. I\u2019ll just be Jacob.\u201d I sighed. \u201cBut if that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking . . .\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me,\u201d he insisted, smiling with deliberate cheer, too brightly. \u201cI know what I\u2019m doing. Just tell me if I\u2019m upsetting you.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. . . .\u201d \u201cC\u2019mon, Bella. Let\u2019s go back to the house and get our bikes. You\u2019ve got to ride a motorcycle regularly to keep it in tune.\u201d  \u201cI really don\u2019t think I\u2019m allowed.\u201d \u201cBy who? Charlie or the blood \u2014 or him?\u201d \u201cBoth.\u201d Jacob grinned my grin, and he was suddenly the Jacob I missed the most, sunny and warm. I couldn\u2019t help grinning back. The rain softened, turned to mist. \u201cI won\u2019t tell anyone,\u201d he promised. \u201cExcept every one of your friends.\u201d He shook his head soberly and raised his right hand. \u201cI promise not to think about it.\u201d I laughed. \u201cIf I get hurt, it was because I tripped.\u201d \u201cWhatever you say.\u201d We rode our motorcycles on the back roads around La Push until the rain made them too muddy and Jacob insisted that he was going to pass out if he didn\u2019t eat soon. Billy greeted me easily when we got to the house, as if my sudden reappearance meant nothing more complicated than that I\u2019d wanted to spend the day with my friend. After we ate the sandwiches Jacob made, we went out to the garage and I helped him clean up the bikes. I hadn\u2019t been here in months \u2014 since Edward had returned \u2014 but there was no sense of import to it. It was just another afternoon in the garage.  \u201cThis is nice,\u201d I commented when he pulled the warm sodas from the grocery bag. \u201cI\u2019ve missed this place.\u201d He smiled, looking around at the plastic sheds bolted together over our heads. \u201cYeah, I can understand that. All the splendor of the Taj Mahal, without the inconvenience and expense of traveling to India.\u201d \u201cTo Washington\u2019s little Taj Mahal,\u201d I toasted, holding up my can. He touched his can to mine.  \u201cDo you remember last Valentine\u2019s Day? I think that was the last time you were here \u2014 the last time when things were still . . . normal, I mean.\u201d I laughed. \u201cOf course I remember. I traded a lifetime of servitude for a box of conversation hearts. That\u2019s not something I\u2019m likely to forget.\u201d He laughed with me. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Hmm, servitude. I\u2019ll have to think of something good.\u201d Then he sighed. \u201cIt feels like it was years ago. Another era. A happier one.\u201d I couldn\u2019t agree with him. This was my happy era now. But I was surprised to realize how many things I missed from my own personal dark ages. I stared through the opening at the murky forest. The rain had picked up again, but it was warm in the little garage, sitting next to Jacob. He was as good as a furnace. His fingers brushed my hand. \u201cThings have really changed.\u201d \u00a0\u201cYeah,\u201d I said, and then I reached out and patted the back tire of my bike. \u201cCharlie used to like me. I hope Billy doesn\u2019t say anything about today. . . .\u201d I bit my lip. \u201cHe won\u2019t. He doesn\u2019t get worked up about things the way Charlie does. Hey, I never did apologize officially for that stupid move with the bike. I\u2019m real sorry about ratting you out to Charlie. I wish I hadn\u2019t.\u201d I rolled my eyes. \u201cMe, too.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m really, really sorry.\u201d He looked at me hopefully, his wet, tangled black hair sticking up in every direction around his pleading face. \u201cOh, fine! You\u2019re forgiven.\u201d \u201cThanks, Bells!\u201d We grinned at each other for a second, and then his face clouded over. \u201cYou know that day, when I brought the bike over . . . I\u2019ve been wanting to ask you something,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cBut also . . . not wanting to.\u201d I held very still \u2014 a reaction to stress. It was a habit I\u2019d picked up from Edward. \u201cWere you just being stubborn because you were mad at me, or were you really serious?\u201d he whispered. \u00a0\u201cAbout what?\u201d I whispered back, though I was sure I knew what he meant. He glared at me. \u201cYou know. When you said it was none of my business . . . if \u2014 if he bit you.\u201d He cringed visibly at the end. \u201cJake . . .\u201d My throat felt swollen. I couldn\u2019t finish. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. \u201cWere you serious?\u201d He was trembling just slightly. His eyes stayed closed.  \u201cYes,\u201d I whispered. Jacob inhaled, slow and deep. \u201cI guess I knew that.\u201d I stared at his face, waiting for his eyes to open. \u201cYou know what this will mean?\u201d He demanded suddenly. \u201cYou do understand that, don\u2019t you? What will happen if they break the treaty?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll leave first,\u201d I said in a small voice. His eyes flashed open, their black depths full of anger and pain. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a geographic limit to the treaty, Bella. Our great-grandfathers only agreed to keep the peace because the Cullens swore that they were different, that humans weren\u2019t in danger from them. They promised they would never kill or change anyone ever again. If they go back on their word, the treaty is meaningless, and they are no different than any other vampires. Once that\u2019s established, when we find them again \u2014\u201d.  \u00a0\u201cBut, Jake, didn\u2019t you break the treaty already?\u201d I asked, grasping at straws. \u201cWasn\u2019t part of it that you not tell people about the vampires? And you told me. So isn\u2019t the treaty sort of moot, anyhow?\u201d Jacob didn\u2019t like the reminder; the pain in his eyes hardened into animosity. \u201cYeah, I broke the treaty \u2014 back before I believed any of it. And I\u2019m sure they were informed of that.\u201d He glared sourly at my forehead, not meeting my shamed gaze. \u201cBut it\u2019s not like that gives them a freebie or anything. There\u2019s no fault for a fault. They have only one option if they object to what I did. The same option we\u2019ll have when they break the treaty: to attack. To start the war.\u201d He made it sound so inevitable. I shuddered. \u201cJake, it doesn\u2019t have to be that way.\u201d His teeth ground together. \u201cIt is that way.\u201d The silence after his declaration felt very loud. \u201cWill you never forgive me, Jacob?\u201d I whispered. As soon as I said the words, I wished I hadn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t want to hear his answer. \u201cYou won\u2019t be Bella anymore,\u201d he told me. \u201cMy friend won\u2019t exist. There\u2019ll be no one to forgive.\u201d \u201cThat sounds like a no, \u201d I whispered. We faced each other for an endless moment. \u201cIs this goodbye then, Jake?\u201d He blinked rapidly, his fierce expression melting in surprise. \u201cWhy? We still have a few years. Can\u2019t we be friends until we\u2019re out of time?\u201d \u201cYears? No, Jake, not years.\u201d I shook my head, and laughed once without humor. \u201cWeeks is more accurate.\u201d I was not expecting his reaction. He was suddenly on his feet, and there was a loud pop as the soda can exploded in his hand. Soda flew everywhere, soaking me, like it was spraying from a hose. \u201cJake!\u201d I started to complain, but I fell silent when I realized that his whole body was quivering with anger. He glared at me wildly, a growling sound building in his chest. I froze in place, too shocked to remember how to move. The shaking rolled through him, getting faster, until it looked like he was <em>vibrating</em>. His shape blurred. . . . And then Jacob gritted his teeth together, and the growling stopped. He squeezed his eyes tight in concentration; the quivering slowed until only his hands were shaking.  \u201cWeeks,\u201d Jacob said in a flat monotone. I couldn\u2019t respond; I was still frozen. He opened his eyes. They were beyond fury now. \u201cHe\u2019s going to change you into a filthy bloodsucker in just a few weeks!\u201d Jacob hissed through his teeth. Too stunned to take offense at his words, I just nodded mutely. His face turned green under the russet skin.  \u201cOf course, Jake,\u201d I whispered after a long minute of silence. \u201cHe\u2019s seventeen, Jacob. And I get closer to nineteen every day. Besides, what\u2019s the point in waiting? He\u2019s all I want. What else can I do?\u201d I\u2019d meant that as a rhetorical question. His words cracked like snaps of a whip. \u201cAnything. Anything else. You\u2019d be better off dead. I\u2019d rather you were.\u201d I recoiled like he\u2019d slapped me. It hurt worse than if he had. And then, as the pain shot through me, my own temper burst into flame. \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll get lucky,\u201d I said bleakly, lurching to my feet. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll get hit by a truck on my way back.\u201d I grabbed my motorcycle and pushed it out into the rain. He didn\u2019t move as I passed him. As soon as I was on the small, muddy path, I climbed on and kicked the bike to life. The rear tire spit a fountain of mud toward the garage, and I hoped that it hit him. I got absolutely soaked as I sped across the slick highway toward the Cullens\u2019 house. The wind felt like it was freezing the rain against my skin, and my teeth were chattering before I was halfway there. Motorcycles were too impractical for Washington. I would sell the stupid thing first chance I got. I walked the bike into the Cullens\u2019 cavernous garage and was unsurprised to find Alice waiting for me, perched lightly on the hood of her Porsche. Alice stroked the glossy yellow paint. \u00a0\u201cI haven\u2019t even had a chance to drive it.\u201d She sighed. \u201cSorry,\u201d I spit through my rattling teeth. \u201cYou look like you could use a hot shower,\u201d she said, offhand, as she sprang lightly to her feet. \u201cYep.\u201d She pursed her lips, taking in my expression carefully. \u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d \u201cNope.\u201d She nodded in assent, but her eyes were raging with curiosity. \u201cDo you want to go to Olympia tonight?\u201d \u201cNot really. Can\u2019t I go home?\u201d She grimaced. \u201cNever mind, Alice,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll stay if it makes things easier for you.\u201d \u201cThanks,\u201d she sighed in relief. I went to bed early that night, curling up on his sofa again. It was still dark when I woke. I was groggy, but I knew it wasn\u2019t near morning yet. My eyes closed, and I stretched, rolling over. It took me a second before I realized that the movement should have dumped me onto the floor. And that I was much too comfortable. I rolled back over, trying to see. It was darker than last night \u2014 the clouds were too thick for the moon to shine through. \u201cSorry,\u201d he murmured so softly that his voice was part of the darkness. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to wake you.\u201d I tensed, waiting for the fury \u2014 both his and mine \u2014 but it was only quiet and calm in the darkness of his room. I could almost taste the sweetness of reunion in the air, a separate fragrance from the perfume of his breath; the emptiness when we were apart left its own bitter aftertaste, something I didn\u2019t consciously notice until it was removed. There was no friction in the space between us. The stillness was peaceful \u2014 not like the calm before the tempest, but like a clear night untouched by even the dream of a storm. And I didn\u2019t care that I was supposed to be angry with him. I didn\u2019t care that I was supposed to be angry with everyone. I reached out for him, found his hands in the darkness, and pulled myself closer to him. His arms encircled me, cradling me to his chest. My lips searched, hunting along his throat, to his chin, till I finally found his lips. Edward kissed me softly for a moment, and then he chuckled. \u201cI was all braced for the wrath that was going to put grizzlies to shame, and this is what I get? I should infuriate you more often.\u201d \u00a0\u201cGive me a minute to work up to it,\u201d I teased, kissing him again. \u201cI\u2019ll wait as long as you want,\u201d he whispered against my lips. His fingers knotted in my hair. My breath was becoming uneven. \u201cMaybe in the morning.\u201d \u201cWhatever you prefer.\u201d \u201cWelcome home,\u201d I said while his cold lips pressed under my jaw. \u201cI\u2019m glad you came back.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a very good thing.\u201d \u201cMmm,\u201d I agreed, tightening my arms around his neck. His hand curved around my elbow, moving slowly down my arm, across my ribs and over my waist, tracing along my hip and down my leg, around my knee. He paused there, his hand curling around my calf. He pulled my leg up suddenly, hitching it around his hip. I stopped breathing. This wasn\u2019t the kind of thing he usually allowed. Despite his cold hands, I felt suddenly warm. His lips moved in the hollow at the base of my throat. \u201cNot to bring on the ire prematurely,\u201d he whispered, \u201cbut do you mind telling me what it is about this bed that you object to?\u201d Before I could answer, before I could even concentrate enough to make sense of his words, he rolled to the side, pulling me on top of him. He held my face in his hands, angling it up so that his mouth could reach my throat. My breathing was too loud \u2014 it was almost embarrassing, but I couldn\u2019t care quite enough to be ashamed. \u201cThe bed?\u201d he asked again. \u201cI think it\u2019s nice.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s unnecessary,\u201d I managed to gasp. He pulled my face back to his, and my lips shaped themselves around his. Slowly this time, he rolled till he hovered over me. He held himself carefully so that I felt none of his weight, but I could feel the cool marble of his body press against mine. My heart was hammering so loudly that it was hard to hear his quiet laughter. \u201cThat\u2019s debatable,\u201d he disagreed. \u201cThis would be difficult on a couch.\u201d Cold as ice, his tongue lightly traced the shape of my lips. My head was spinning \u2014 the air was coming too fast and shallow.  \u201cDid you change your mind?\u201d I asked breathlessly. Maybe he\u2019d rethought all his careful rules. Maybe there was more significance to this bed than I\u2019d originally guessed. My heart pounded almost painfully as I waited for his answer. Edward sighed, rolling back so that we were on our sides again. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous, Bella,\u201d he said, disapproval strong in his voice \u2014 clearly, he understood what I meant. \u201cI was just trying to illustrate the benefits of the bed you don\u2019t seem to like. Don\u2019t get carried away.\u201d \u201cToo late,\u201d I muttered. \u201cAnd I like the bed,\u201d I added. \u00a0\u201cGood.\u201d I could hear the smile in his voice as he kissed my forehead. \u201cI do, too.\u201d \u201cBut I still think it\u2019s unnecessary,\u201d I continued. \u201cIf we\u2019re not going to get carried away, what\u2019s the point?\u201d He sighed again. \u201cFor the hundredth time, Bella \u2014 it\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d \u201cI like danger,\u201d I insisted. \u201cI know.\u201d There was a sour edge to his voice, and I realized that he would have seen the motorcycle in the garage. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s dangerous,\u201d I said quickly, before he could move to a new topic of discussion. \u201cI\u2019m going to spontaneously combust one of these days \u2014 and you\u2019ll have no one but yourself to blame.\u201d He started to push me away. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I objected, clinging to him. \u201cProtecting you from combustion. If this too much for you. . . .\u201d \u201cI can handle it,\u201d I insisted. He let me worm myself back into the circle of his arms. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I gave you the wrong impression,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to make you unhappy. That wasn\u2019t nice.\u201d \u201cActually, it was very, very nice.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cAren\u2019t you tired? I should let you sleep.\u201d \u201cNo, I\u2019m not. I don\u2019t mind if you want to give me the wrong impression again.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s probably a bad idea. You\u2019re not the only one who gets carried away.\u201d \u201cYes, I am,\u201d I grumbled. He chuckled. \u201cYou have no idea, Bella. It doesn\u2019t help that you are so eager to undermine my self-control, either.\u201d  \u201cI\u2019m not going to apologize for that.\u201d \u201cCan I apologize?\u201d \u201cFor what?\u201d \u201cYou were angry with me, remember?\u201d \u201cOh, that.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was wrong. It\u2019s much easier to have the proper perspective when I have you safely here.\u201d His arms tightened around me. \u201cI go a little berserk when I try to leave you. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll go so far again. It\u2019s not worth it.\u201d I smiled. \u201cDidn\u2019t you find any mountain lions?\u201d \u201cYes, I did, actually. Still not worth the anxiety. I\u2019m sorry I had Alice hold you hostage, though. That was a bad idea.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d I agreed. \u201cI won\u2019t do it again.\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d I said easily. He was already forgiven. \u201cBut slumber parties do have their advantages. . . .\u201d I curled myself closer to him, pressing my lips into the indentation over his collarbone. \u201cYou can hold me hostage any time you want.\u201d \u201cMmm,\u201d he sighed. \u201cI may take you up on that.\u201d \u201cSo is it my turn now?\u201d \u201cYour turn?\u201d his voice was confused. \u201cTo apologize.\u201d \u201cWhat do you have to apologize for?\u201d \u201cAren\u2019t you mad at me?\u201d I asked blankly. \u201cNo.\u201d It sounded like he really meant it. I felt my eyebrows pull together. \u201cDidn\u2019t you see Alice when you got home?\u201d \u201cYes \u2014 why?\u201d \u201cAre you going to take her Porsche back?\u201d \u201cOf course not. It was a gift.\u201d I wished I could see his expression. His voice sounded as if I\u2019d insulted him. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to know what I did?\u201d I asked, starting to be puzzled by his apparent lack of concern. I felt him shrug. \u201cI\u2019m always interested in everything you do \u2014 but you don\u2019t have to tell me unless you want to.\u201d \u201cBut I went to La Push.\u201d \u201cI know.\u201d \u201cAnd I ditched school.\u201d \u201cSo did I.\u201d I stared toward the sound of his voice, tracing his features with my fingers, trying to understand his mood. \u201cWhere did all this tolerance come from?\u201d I demanded. He sighed. \u201cI decided that you were right. My problem before was more about my . . . prejudice against werewolves than anything else. I\u2019m going to try to be more reasonable and trust your judgment. If you say it\u2019s safe, then I\u2019ll believe you.\u201d \u201cWow.\u201d  \u201cAnd . . . most importantly . . . I\u2019m not willing to let this drive a wedge between us.\u201d I rested my head against his chest and closed my eyes, totally content. \u201cSo,\u201d he murmured in a casual tone. \u201cDid you make plans to go back to La Push again soon?\u201d I didn\u2019t answer. His question brought back the memory of Jacob\u2019s words, and my throat was suddenly tight. He misread my silence and the tension in my body. \u201cJust so that I can make my own plans,\u201d he explained quickly. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to feel like you have to hurry back because I\u2019m sitting around waiting for you.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I said in a voice that sounded strange to me. \u201cI don\u2019t have plans go back.\u201d \u201cOh. You don\u2019t have to do that for me.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m welcome anymore,\u201d I whispered.  \u201cDid you run over someone\u2019s cat?\u201d he asked lightly. I knew he didn\u2019t want to force the story out of me, but I could hear the curiosity burning behind his words. \u201cNo.\u201d I took a deep breath, and then mumbled quickly through the explanation. \u201cI thought Jacob would have realized . . . I didn\u2019t think it would surprise him.\u201d Edward waited while I hesitated. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t expecting . . . that it was so soon.\u201d \u201cAh,\u201d Edward said quietly. \u201cHe said he\u2019d rather see me dead.\u201d My voice broke on the last word. Edward was too still for a moment, controlling whatever reaction he didn\u2019t want me to see. Then he crushed me gently to his chest. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d \u201cI thought you\u2019d be glad,\u201d I whispered. \u201cGlad over something that\u2019s hurt you?\u201d he murmured into my hair. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, Bella.\u201d I sighed and relaxed, fitting myself to the stone shape of him. But he was motionless again, tense. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d \u201cYou can tell me.\u201d He paused for a minute. \u201cIt might make you angry.\u201d \u201cI still want to know.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI could quite literally kill him for saying that to you. I want to.\u201d I laughed halfheartedly. \u201cI guess it\u2019s a good thing you\u2019ve got so much self-control.\u201d \u201cI could slip.\u201d His tone was thoughtful. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to have a lapse in control, I can think of a better place for it.\u201d I reached for his face, trying to pull myself up to kiss him. His arms held me tighter, restraining. He sighed. \u201cMust I always be the responsible one?\u201d I grinned in the darkness. \u201cNo. Let me be in charge of responsibility for a few minutes . . . or hours.\u201d \u201cGoodnight, Bella.\u201d \u201cWait \u2014 there was something else I wanted to ask you about.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cI was talking to Rosalie last night. . . .\u201d His body tensed again. \u201cYes. She was thinking about that when I got in. She gave you quite a lot to consider, didn\u2019t she?\u201d His voice was anxious, and I realized that he thought I wanted to talk about the reasons Rosalie\u2019d given me for staying human. But I was interested in something much more pressing. \u201cShe told me a little bit . . . about the time your family lived in Denali.\u201d There was a short pause; this beginning took him by surprise. \u201cYes?\u201d \u201cShe mentioned something about a bunch of female vampires . . . and you.\u201d He didn\u2019t answer, though I waited for a long moment.  \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I said, after the silence had grown uncomfortable. \u201cShe told me you didn\u2019t . . . show any preference. But I was just wondering, you know, if any of them had. Shown a preference for you, I mean.\u201d Again he said nothing. \u201cWhich one?\u201d I asked, trying to keep my voice casual, and not quite managing. \u201cOr was there more than one?\u201d No answer. I wished I could see his face, so I could try to guess what this silence meant. \u201cAlice will tell me,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll go ask her right now.\u201d His arms tightened; I was unable to squirm even an inch away. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s late,\u201d he said. His voice had a little edge to it that was something new. Sort of nervous, maybe a little embarrassed. \u201cBesides, I think Alice stepped out. . . .\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s bad,\u201d I guessed. \u201cIt\u2019s really bad, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I started to panic, my heart accelerating as I imagined the gorgeous immortal rival I\u2019d never realized I had. \u201cCalm down, Bella,\u201d he said, kissing the tip of my nose. \u201cYou\u2019re being absurd.\u201d \u201cAm I? Then why won\u2019t you tell me?\u201d  \u201cBecause there\u2019s nothing to tell. You\u2019re blowing this wildly out of proportion.\u201d \u201cWhich one?\u201d I insisted. He sighed. \u201cTanya expressed a little interest. I let her know, in a very courteous, gentlemanly fashion, that I did not return that interest. End of story.\u201d I kept my voice as even as possible. \u201cTell me something \u2014 what does Tanya look like?\u201d \u201cJust like the rest of us \u2014 white skin, gold eyes,\u201d he answered too quickly. \u201cAnd, of course, extraordinarily beautiful.\u201d I felt him shrug.  \u201cI suppose, to human eyes,\u201d he said, indifferent. \u201cYou know what, though?\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d My voice was petulant. He put his lips right to my ear; his cold breath tickled. \u201cI prefer brunettes.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s a blonde. That figures.\u201d \u201cStrawberry blonde \u2014 not at all my type.\u201d I thought about that for a while, trying to concentrate as his lips moved slowly along my cheek, down my throat, and back up again. He made the circuit three times before I spoke. \u201cI guess that\u2019s okay, then,\u201d I decided. \u201cHmm,\u201d he whispered against my skin. \u201cYou\u2019re quite adorable when you\u2019re jealous. It\u2019s surprisingly enjoyable.\u201d I scowled into the darkness. \u201cIt\u2019s late,\u201d he said again, murmuring, almost crooning now, his voice smoother than silk. \u201cSleep, my Bella. Dream happy dreams. You are the only one who has ever touched my heart. It will always be yours. Sleep, my only love.\u201d He started to hum my lullaby, and I knew it was only a matter of time till I succumbed, so I closed my eyes and snuggled closer into his chest.",
