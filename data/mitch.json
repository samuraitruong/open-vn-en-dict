            "en": "Obama Signs US Financial Reform into Law       President Barack Obama has signed legislation to reform the business practices of U.S. financial institutions. Passing the bill was one of the administration's major priorities. President Obama says the new regulations on major financial firms will protect consumers and prevent the abuses that many analysts say led to the global economic recession. \"Reform will also rein in the abuse and excess that nearly brought down our financial system,\" said President Obama. \"It will finally bring transparency to the kinds of complex and risky transactions that helped trigger the financial crisis.\" The new laws are the broadest reform of the U.S. financial industry since the Great Depression of 1930s. \u00a0Before he signed it, the president said the overhaul will have global implications. \"That is why we all stand to gain from these reforms,\" said Mr. Obama. \"We all win when investors around the world have confidence in our markets.\" The law will allow the government to take over failing financial institutions, if they are so big that their collapse would damage the U.S. economy.\u00a0 The government would then sell the properties to ensure that taxpayers do not bear the cost of the failure. Banks will be required to keep more money on hand to cover potential losses from bad investments. And complex transactions called derivatives will be more tightly regulated. Opposition Republicans in Congress are criticizing the overhaul as unnecessary government intrusion into private business. High-ranking Republican Representative Mike Pence says the reform amounts to a \"permanent bailout of Wall Street\" and he called for its repeal. The top Senate Republican, Minority Leader <em>Mitch</em> McConnell, says it will make America's unemployment problem worse. \"Job-stifling taxes, regulations, government intrusion - these appear to be the three pillars of every Democratic legislative effort,\" said <em>Mitch</em> McConnell. \"They are also the three things lawmakers can do that are guaranteed to kill more jobs.\" President Obama thanked the few Republicans who joined his fellow Democrats to vote for the bill.\u00a0 He called those who did not, \"a partisan minority determined to block change.\" Many of the biggest banks that were bailed out during the financial crisis have repaid their loans and are reporting profits. Peter Cardillo, chief market economist with the New York-based financial firm Avalon Partners, says the reforms might cut into those profits, at least initially. \"In certain cases, probably it will change the way Wall Street does business,\" said Peter Cardillo. \"And that means, perhaps, giving up some business.\u00a0 And that means lower earnings for some of the major [financial] houses on Wall Street.\" Mr. Obama signed the bill in Washington's Ronald Reagan building, named for a president who championed business deregulation.",

In South Carolina on Thursday, five men were expected to debate the US economy, the budget and healthcare, and to take shots at President Barack Obama. But only ex-Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty is seen as a credible candidate for the Republicans in 2012. While Mr Obama is seen as vulnerable, the field is slow to take shape. The debate - hosted by the South Carolina Republican Party and broadcast on Fox News - includes Mr Pawlenty, former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson, former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum, Congressman Ron Paul and former pizza restaurant magnate Herman Cain. Tea Party role A string of well-known potential contenders are sitting out the debate. They include former Alaska Governor and 2008 vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney. Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House of Representatives, is also not attending, and none of Indiana Governor <em>Mitch</em> Daniels, Congresswoman Michele Bachmann, real estate magnate and reality television star Donald Trump and former Ambassador to China Jon Huntsman will take to the stage. Mr Obama's poll numbers indicate he is vulnerable, due in large part to the poor state of the US economy. But a host of factors have left leading Republicans shy of jumping into the campaign, analysts say.  They include the uncertain role of the populist Tea Party, the consolidation of power among hard-right conservative Republicans and the perceived weakness of would-be front-runner Mr Romney. Mr Obama's fund-raising prowess is also seen as a factor dissuading potential opponents. By contrast, in May 2007 - when both Republican and Democratic nominations were open - a South Carolina Republican debate included two sitting senators, four former governors, three US congressmen, and a former New York City mayor. The first balloting of the 2012 primary campaign will be the Iowa caucus on 6 February 2012. Meanwhile, the Associated Press, America's most wide-reaching news agency, has said it is boycotting Thursday's debate to protest against the Fox News channel's restrictions on coverage by its photographers",

CIA director Leon Panetta should take over as the next defence secretary when Robert Gates retires in late June.  \"Leon appreciates the struggles of American troops,\" Mr Obama said. Gen Petraeus's job will be filled by Marine Corps Lt Gen John Allen. The Senate must still confirm the changes. Announcing the most sweeping shake-up of top security officials since he took office, Mr Obama also named Ryan Crocker as the next US ambassador to Afghanistan. \"These are the leaders that I've chosen to help guide us through the difficult days ahead,\" Mr Obama said with Mr Gates, Mr Panetta, Gen Petraeus and other officials standing next to him at the White House. 'Unity of effort'  Mr Obama said that after nearly 40 years in uniform, Gen Petraeus would retire from the US army and step into his new role at the CIA in September, pending Senate confirmation of the new positions. The announcement comes less than a year after Gen Petraeus took over responsibility for leading Nato forces in Afghanistan from Gen Stanley McChrystal. \"I will look to them and my entire national security team for their counsel, continuity and unity of effort that this moment in history demands,\" Mr Obama said of his newly nominated staff. Mr Obama said Mr Gates, who was first appointed as defence secretary by George W Bush in 2006, had \"more than earned the right to return to private life\". Gen Petraeus will be replaced in Afghanistan by Lt Gen Allen, currently deputy head of US Central Command - the command unit covering central Asia and the Middle East. Lt Gen Allen and Mr Crocker will not fill their new roles immediately but will step into the positions over the summer. \"The challenges are formidable and the stakes are high. 9/11 came to us out of Afghanistan. Our enemy must never again have that opportunity,\" said Mr Crocker. Senator John Kerry, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations committee, praised Mr Obama's decision to move Gen Petraeus to the CIA. \"General Petraeus is simply among the very best military leaders of his generation. He knows first-hand the life and death importance that good intelligence plays in protecting the security of the United States.\" Mr Kerry also noted Mr Panetta's \"extraordinarily deep institutional knowledge\" of Washington. Republican Senate Minority Leader <em>Mitch</em> McConnell said Mr Obama was \"to be commended for choosing competence and continuity\" in nominating Gen Petraeus and Mr Panetta for their respective roles. Mr Panetta, a 72-year-old Democrat from California, served as chief of staff to President Bill Clinton between 1994 and 1997 and took over at the CIA in February 2009. Prior to those positions, he served as director of Mr Clinton's Office of Management and Budget. Meanwhile, Afghanistan's spring fighting season is ramping up, testing Nato and Afghan national army territorial gains. \"Today we are a nation at war, and job one will be to ensure that we remain the strongest military power in the world, to protect that security that is so important to this country. Yet this is also a time for hard choices,\" said Mr Panetta. In July, the US is expected to begin what US President Barack Obama has called a \"significant\" withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, turning over security duties to Afghan military forces. As of February, more than 1.4m people were serving in the US armed forces.",
