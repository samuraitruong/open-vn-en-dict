            "en": "Ex-IMF head Dominique Strauss-Kahn freed without bail       \n  Former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn has been released from house arrest and had his $6m (\u00a33.7m) cash bail and bond returned amid doubts over the credibility of his <em>accuser</em>.  Prosecutors have agreed that Mr Strauss-Kahn should be freed \"on his own recognisance\", meaning he must simply promise to appear in court. He is accused of sexually assaulting a maid in a New York hotel on 14 May. The case is now close to collapse, US media reports say. The 62-year-old French politician - who had been seen as a leading candidate for the French presidency - appeared in court in New York on Friday over the sexual assault case.\n'Substantial change'  After assessing disclosures by prosecutors from the office of the Manhattan district attorney, a judge rescinded the strict bail terms imposed on Mr Strauss-Kahn, but did order that his passport be retained so he could not travel outside the US. In a letter submitted to the court prosecutors said that the maid gave false testimony to a grand jury, omitting the fact that she cleaned another room before alerting a supervisor to her claims of sexual assault.\n  \"I understand that the circumstances of this case have changed substantially, and I agree the risk that he would not be here has receded quite a bit. I release Mr Strauss-Kahn at his own recognisance,\" Justice Michael Obus told the court on Friday. \"In the meantime there will be no rush to judgment on this case,\" Mr Obus said.\nOn the court steps, opposing lawyers each maintained their case. \"I want to remind all of you that at each appearance in the last six weeks, we asked you and asked the world not to rush to judgement - now I think you can understand why,\" said Mr Strauss-Kahn's lawyer, William Taylor.\n  \"We believe the next step will lead to the complete dismissal of the charges,\" he added. After Friday's hearing, Mr Strauss-Kahn strode out of court smiling, with his wife on his arm. \n  In earlier court hearings, prosecutors had spoken of the strength of their case. One attorney said the proof against him was \"substantial\". Now prosecutors believe she may have lied under questioning and could have links to drug dealers and money-laundering.  But the alleged victim's lawyer, Kenneth P Thompson, maintained on Friday that his client's story was genuine and that Mr Strauss-Kahn was guilty of sexual assault charges.  \"The only defence Dominique Strauss-Kahn has is that this sexual encounter was consensual. That is a lie,\" he said. He continued at length, giving a detailed and graphic account of the maid's alleged encounter with Mr Strauss-Kahn and criticising District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr.\nMr Vance said the case would continue to be investigated, including concerns that had been raised about the credibility of Mr Strauss-Kahn's <em>accuser</em>. \"Our prosecutors from the Manhattan DA's office will continue their investigation into these alleged crimes and will do so until we have uncovered all relevant facts,\" he said. Mr Strauss-Kahn is to appear back in court on 18 July. Credibility doubts  The maid claims that Mr Strauss-Kahn chased her down a hallway in his expensive hotel suite in the Sofitel hotel before sexually assaulting her. However, unnamed law enforcement officials have now told US media the <em>accuser</em> has repeatedly lied since the alleged attack on 14 May. The officials believe the woman also lied on her application for asylum in the US, particularly over an allegation that she had been raped while at home in Guinea, in West Africa. \"She actually recounted the entire story to prosecutors and later said it was false,\" one law enforcement official told the Associated Press news agency. But Mr Thompson defended his client's story on Friday, offering up graphic details of the alleged encounter between Mr Strauss-Kahn and the maid.  \"From day one she has described a violent sexual assault that Dominique Strauss-Kahn committed against her,\" Mr Thompson said, adding that Mr Strauss-Kahn bruised the maid's body and threw her to the floor.\n\"She has never once changed a single thing about that account. The district attorney knows that,\" he added. Mr Thompson said that though the maid \"may have made some mistakes\", that does not mean the assault never occurred.  Following the twists to the sexual assault case on Friday, hopes among some have been raised about the possibility Mr Strauss-Kahn may once again be able to compete with Nicolas Sarkozy for the French presidency in 2012. The Socialist former Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin, said: \"It's a thunderbolt - but in the opposite direction this time.\" But it was too soon to say whether Mr Strauss-Kahn might stand, he added. \"If we hypothesise that Dominique is cleared of all suspicion and all charges, which I obviously hope will happen, then it will be first down to him to decide... and then it will be down to the Socialists to decide. \"It's too early to transform into politics what is so far a human drama which is developing before our eyes. Mr Strauss-Kahn had been under house arrest in a New York apartment since posting a $6m (\u00a33.7m) cash bail and bond in May. He is charged with seven counts including four more serious felony charges - two of criminal sexual acts, one of attempted rape and one of sexual abuse - plus three misdemeanour offences, including unlawful imprisonment.\nMr Strauss-Kahn, who resigned as head of the International Monetary Fund to defend himself, vigorously denies the charges.",

            "en": "Dominique Strauss-Kahn DNA 'linked to maid'        Dominique Strauss-Kahn is being held under house arrest in New York DNA found on the clothes of a New York hotel maid who accused Dominique Strauss-Kahn of sexually assaulting her matches that of the former IMF chief, US media reports say. The unconfirmed reports cited sources close to the investigation.  More tests from the room where the alleged attack took place are pending.  Mr Strauss-Kahn denies the charges, and resigned as head of the International Monetary Fund last week to defend himself. He is under house arrest in a New York apartment, after a judge granted him a $1m (\u00a3620,000) bail last week. Further tests  Reports about the DNA samples came after authorities analysed the work clothes of the 32-year-old hotel maid who says she was assaulted in the New York Sofitel near Times Square on 14 May. Police and judicial spokespeople have declined to confirm the reports, carried by the Associated Press and ABC News, among others. Investigators are reported to be carrying out further tests on samples taken from the carpet and other surfaces in the hotel room. Mr Strauss-Kahn is charged with seven counts including four felony charges - two of criminal sexual acts, one of attempted rape and one of sexual abuse - plus three misdemeanour offences, including unlawful imprisonment. His <em>accuser</em>, an immigrant from the West African state of Guinea, told authorities that Mr Strauss-Kahn had accosted her after she entered his hotel room to clean it. Mr Strauss-Kahn's defence team is expected to argue that a sexual encounter occurred, but that it was consensual. \"The forensic evidence, we believe, will not be consistent with a forcible encounter,\" Mr Strauss-Kahn's lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, has said. Mr Strauss-Kahn, 62, is due to enter a formal plea on 6 June. He was seen as a leading candidate to be the next centre-left French presidential candidate until news of the accusations broke. In France, the newspaper Le Monde reports that \"people close\" to President Nicolas Sarkozy knew more about the private life of Mr Strauss-Kahn than was publicly known.   The newspaper said those closest to Nicolas Sarkozy were touting information, leaked from a police report, that suggested Mr Strauss Kahn had been caught kerb-crawling in a known red light district in Paris.",

            "en": "Dominique Strauss-Kahn: Ex-IMF boss wins New York bail         \nDominique Strauss-Kahn has been granted bail by a judge in a New York court, after being formally charged with trying to rape a hotel maid. Mr Strauss-Kahn had earlier resigned as the International Monetary Fund's boss. His lawyers said he was honourable and would not try to abscond. Prosecutors said he had \"incentive to flee\". Supreme Court Justice Michael Obus imposed $1m cash bail and said there must be 24-hour home detention, with an armed guard and electronic monitoring. The judge said one armed guard must be deployed at all times, at Mr Strauss-Kahn's expense, and the defendant must surrender all travel documents. In addition to the $1m (\u00a3618,000) cash bail, a $5m insurance bond would also apply. Mr Strauss-Kahn will spend a fourth night at the notorious Rikers Island prison on Thursday before the bail papers are signed. He will appear in court again on 6 June, when he will formally enter a plea. He has denied all the accusations against him. 'Life of ease'  Mr Strauss-Kahn's wife, Anne Sinclair, was in court for Thursday's hearing. The Frenchman - who was not wearing handcuffs or shackles, but was flanked by four police officers - smiled at her as he entered the Manhattan courtroom. Mr Strauss-Kahn had been denied bail at an earlier hearing on Monday. But defence lawyers said the prosecution's bail position was unfair and not consistent with the law. The prosecution said Mr Strauss-Kahn, 62, had left the alleged crime scene with \"unusual haste\" and that any bail arrangement would be insufficient. The judge asked for details of Mr Strauss-Kahn's financial situation. The defence said he had a net worth of roughly $2m and offered $1m bail. Prosecutor John McConnell said this was \"unreasonable\", adding: \"We are in possession right now of only one passport. We simply don't know what other documents he has access to or could get.\"  He said Mr Strauss-Kahn had the means to live \"a life of ease and comfort\" in parts of the world \"beyond this country's jurisdiction\". But Mr Strauss-Kahn's lawyer, William Taylor, said: \"The prospect of Mr Strauss-Kahn teleporting himself to France and living there as an accused sex offender, fugitive, is ludicrous.\" After the ruling, Mr Taylor said: \"We want to express our pleasure that the judge has made this decision. It's great relief to the family to be able to have him with them.\" Mr Strauss-Kahn has now been formally charged following a grand jury hearing, attended on Wednesday by his <em>accuser</em>, a 32-year-old originally from Guinea in west Africa. The charges set out by the New York district attorney's office included four felony counts - two of criminal sexual acts, one of attempted rape and one of sexual abuse - plus three misdemeanour offences, including unlawful imprisonment. Manhattan district attorney Cyrus Vance said Mr Strauss-Kahn had been indicted on all the charges presented to the grand jury. The incident allegedly took place at New York's Sofitel hotel on 14 May. Mr Strauss-Kahn earlier announced his resignation from the IMF. In a statement posted on the IMF website late on Wednesday, he said he had resigned with \"infinite sadness\" but wanted to \"devote all my strength, all my time, and all my energy to proving my innocence\". His resignation has sparked debate about his successor. Leading voices in Europe say another European should head the fund. A number of figures have voiced support for French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde.",

            "en": "A New York judge has dismissed the sexual assault case against former IMF director Dominique Strauss-Kahn. The move came as prosecutors cited doubts over the credibility of his <em>accuser</em>, 32-year-old hotel maid Nafissatou Diallo.  \u00a0 Mr Strauss-Kahn, 62, was accused in May of attacking the African immigrant as she entered his hotel room to clean it. \u00a0 The ruling means he is a free man, though he still faces a civil suit Ms Diallo filed this month. \u00a0 \"Our inability to believe the complainant beyond a reasonable doubt means, in good faith, that we could not ask a jury to do that,\" Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi-Orbon told Judge Michael Obus. \u00a0   \u00a0\u201cHurried sexual encounter\u201d  \u00a0 The dismissal of criminal charges at the New York State Supreme Court will take effect once the judge rules on an appeal against the move. \u00a0  Mr Strauss-Kahn, considered a French presidential contender before the case, arrived for the hearing in lower Manhattan on Tuesday in a six-car motorcade with his wife Anne Sinclair.  \u00a0 Outside, about two dozen placard-waving protesters denounced the result, their cries audible from the packed courtroom on the 13th floor. \u00a0 Ms Diallo claimed Mr Strauss-Kahn had confronted her in his luxury hotel suite in the city on 14 May and forced her to perform oral sex.  \u00a0 Prosecutors said DNA evidence had found that a \"hurried\" sexual encounter did occur between the two, but it did not establish Ms Diallo's claim that it was non-consensual. \u00a0 In a statement released by his legal team on Tuesday, Mr Strauss-Kahn said: \"These past two-and-a-half months have been a nightmare for me and my family.  \u00a0 \"I want to thank all the friends in France and in the United States who have believed in my innocence, and to the thousands of people who sent us their support personally and in writing.  \u00a0 \"I am most deeply grateful to my wife and family who have gone through this ordeal with me.\" \u00a0 He added: \"We will have nothing further to say about this matter and we look forward to returning to our home and resuming something of a more normal life.\" \u00a0 'Rush to judgment'  \u00a0 Outside the court on Tuesday, Mr Strauss-Kahn's lawyer, William Taylor, accused the media, police and prosecutors of a \"collective rush to judgment\". \u00a0 \"I want to remind you how uncritically the media examined this case from the beginning without even looking at the improbability of the story on its face,\" he said. \u00a0 In court papers filed on Monday, Manhattan prosecutors said they did not feel at ease pursuing the case, citing deep concerns over Ms Diallo's credibility.\u00a0  \u00a0 She \"has not been truthful on matters great and small\" and has an ability to present \"fiction as fact with complete conviction,\" they wrote. \u00a0 Medical and DNA evidence, meanwhile, was \"simply inconclusive\" as proof of a forced sexual encounter, they added. \u00a0 Mr Strauss-Kahn was forced from his job as director of the International Monetary Fund after his arrest on board an Air France jet in May. \u00a0 But within weeks, prosecutors said there were inconsistencies in Ms Diallo's accounts of the alleged assault and of her background. \u00a0 It was revealed that she had been recorded discussing the case with a jailed friend and appeared to refer to Mr Strauss-Kahn's wealth, which his supporters said pointed to a financial motive. \u00a0 Prosecutors also said Ms Diallo had not been truthful in tax documents, nor on an asylum application form in her account of a gang rape she said she suffered back in Guinea. \u00a0 Mr Strauss-Kahn was later freed from his restrictive bail conditions. \u00a0 Ms Diallo then took the unusual step of giving media interviews, defending her allegations against him, and on 8 August, she filed a civil suit against Mr Strauss-Kahn. \u00a0 The Frenchman's legal travails are not yet over: authorities in Paris are still considering whether to press charges against him over a claim by French writer Tristane Banon that he tried to rape her during a 2003 interview.  \u00a0 Ms Banon made the allegation after the Diallo case, saying that she feared no-one would have believed her beforehand. \u00a0",

            "en": "Allies of Dominique Strauss-Kahn eye political comeback       \nAllies of former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn have said he could make a political comeback in France now he has been freed from house arrest in the US.  Before being accused of sexually assaulting a hotel maid in New York on 14 May, Mr Strauss-Kahn was tipped as a possible French presidential candidate. But doubts have since emerged about the credibility of the maid, and the case is reportedly close to collapse. On Friday, a judge ordered Mr Strauss-Kahn released on his own recognisance. He is now free to travel in the US, although he cannot leave the country and must appear in court again later this month. Mr Strauss-Kahn, who resigned as head of the International Monetary Fund to defend himself, vigorously denies the charges. Deadline  Mr Strauss-Kahn had earlier been the favourite to be the Socialist Party's candidate for the French presidency in May 2011.  The BBC's Christian Fraser in Paris says that regardless of events in court, the expectation is growing here in France the case will ultimately collapse.  And if that happens, the only person who can rule him out of next year's contest is Mr Strauss-Kahn himself, our correspondent adds. The last Socialist Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin, said: \"If we hypothesise that Dominique is cleared of all suspicion and all charges, which I obviously hope will happen, then it will be first down to him to decide... and then it will be down to the Socialists to decide.\" A Socialist MP, Jean-Marie Le Guen, said he thought it was likely that Mr Strauss-Kahn would stand. \"Yes, he will be present for the presidential campaign,\" he said. \"If what we heard... is true, that the American justice will free him and re-habilitate him, give him back his honour and dignity. Then, since Dominique Strauss-Kahn is a fighter, he will fight in our country.\" The list for nominations is due to close on 13 July - five days before his next scheduled court appearance. But the senior Socialist, Francois Hollande, said the deadline could be extended. Our correspondent says there are though plenty in France who hold Mr Strauss-Kahn in high admiration for the way he has conducted himself in court, there is sympathy and renewed hope among his staunchest allies.  'Lie'  A judge in New York lifted the strict bail conditions imposed on Mr Strauss-Kahn, amid intense speculation that the sexual assault case against him was faltering.  He had been under house arrest since posting a $6m bail bond. When the 62-year-old appeared in court, prosecutors were forced to admit that they were reassessing the strength of the evidence against him - although the charges that he attempted to rape a hotel maid still stand. In a letter submitted to the court, the prosecutors said that the maid had given false testimony to a grand jury, omitting the fact that she had cleaned another room before alerting a supervisor to her claims of sexual assault.  \"I understand that the circumstances of this case have changed substantially, and I agree the risk that he would not be here has receded quite a bit. I release Mr Strauss-Kahn at his own recognisance,\" Justice Michael Obus told the court. The maid claims that Mr Strauss-Kahn chased her down a hallway in his expensive hotel suite in the Sofitel hotel before sexually assaulting her. However, unnamed law enforcement officials have now told US media the <em>accuser</em> has repeatedly lied since the alleged attack. The officials believe the woman also lied on her application for asylum, particularly over an allegation that she had been raped while at home in Guinea. They also suspect she has links to drugs dealers and money-laundering. Mr Strauss-Kahn's lawyer, William Taylor, said he believed the next step would lead to the complete dismissal of the charges. But the maid's lawyer, Kenneth Thompson, maintained that his client's story was genuine and that Mr Strauss-Kahn was guilty of sexual assault charges.  \"From day one she has described a violent sexual assault that Dominique Strauss-Kahn committed against her,\" Mr Thompson said, adding that Mr Strauss-Kahn bruised the maid's body and threw her to the floor. \"She has never once changed a single thing about that account. The district attorney knows that,\" he added. \"The only defence Dominique Strauss-Kahn has is that this sexual encounter was consensual. That is a lie.\"",
