The arrests were made on Thursday morning throughout New York City, New Jersey, Rhode Island and other areas in the north-east US, FBI officials said. They were accused of a range of crimes including murder and extortion. Attorney General Eric Holder said the arrests were the largest single-day mob crackdown in the history of the FBI. \"We are committed and determined to eradicating these criminal enterprises and bringing their members to justice,\" Mr Holder said during a news conference in Brooklyn. In a statement, the justice department officials said illegal mafia-imposed \"taxes\" on commerce, including at US ports and small businesses, have a negative impact on the US economy. Officials also said the groups had infiltrated labour unions and extorted union members. \"It [the mafia] is an ongoing threat to the economic well-being of this country,\" he said. FBI Director Robert Mueller said: \"Some believe organised crime is a thing of the past; unfortunately, there are still people who extort, intimidate, and victimise innocent Americans. The costs legitimate businesses are forced to pay are ultimately borne by American consumers nationwide.\" Officials said alleged leaders of all the five major crime families in New York were arrested, including the entire leadership of the Colombo family not already in prison. In addition, the arrests hit the Gambino, Genovese, Lucchese, Bonanno, and DeCavalcante families. Decades of offences  The arrests were made as the result of information obtained through wiretaps, co-operation from informants and other central intelligence, said Janice Fedarcyk, FBI's New York division Former mob members, who recorded thousands of hours of conversations with mafia family bosses, also assisted in the investigation, authorities said. Indictments released on Thursday charge the suspects with crimes that include arson, extortion, gambling, loan sharking and labour racketeering. Mr Holder said the charges spawned from decades of offences, including murders within rivalling crime families, a killing during a <em>botched</em> robbery and even a double homicide after an argument in a pub. The sweep began before dawn on Thursday with some 800 federal agents and police officers arresting a range of individuals in the US, from suspected small-time bookers to senior family leaders. One person was also arrested in Italy in connection with the investigation. Double-crossing  Mafia families in the US have seen a sharp decline in fortunes in the past 10 years as the result of court testimony from informants, who have begun breaking their code of silence in recent years. Former mafia member Salvatore Vitale was sentenced to prison in October after federal officials and prosecutors praised his work in double-crossing his own crime syndicate. Vitale, who was arrested in 2003, gave authorities information on at least 11 murders, which helped bring down the once prominent Bonanno family in the New York area. John \"Sonny\" Franzese, a 93-year-old member of the Colombo crime family, was also sentenced in Brooklyn on Friday to eight years in prison for extorting strip clubs and a pizzeria in the New York Metro Area. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-12243086",

            "en": "China AIDS sufferers being denied medical care          BEIJING (Reuters) \u2013 People in China living with HIV and AIDS are routinely being denied medical treatment in mainstream hospitals due to fear and ignorance about the disease, according to a study released by the United Nations' International Labor Organization (ILO). The world's most populous nation -- with 1.34 billion people -- had 740,000 people infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, with 105,000 AIDS patients, in 2009, according to state news agency Xinhua, citing United Nations estimates.  HIV/AIDS became a major problem for China in the 1990s when hundreds of thousands of impoverished farmers in rural Henan province became infected through <em>botched</em> blood-selling schemes, but the virus is now primarily spread in the country via sexual contact.  Based on interviews with 103 people living with HIV and 23 healthcare workers, the ILO and China's National Center for STD and AIDS Prevention and Control found that people have been refused medical care and have been discriminated against by healthcare workers.  One HIV-positive man, talking at a news conference to unveil the report, recounted how he was denied medical treatment for his back problem because of his HIV status in hospitals in Tianjin and Beijing.  \"The doctor said at our hospital, many patients need surgery, and if other patients get infected, it will be a very bad thing,\" said the man, who declined to be identified.  \"At the second hospital ... the doctor told me: 'I sympathize with your suffering but because of your status, I dare not operate on you',\" said the man, who is a farmer from Tianjin and added he was forced to leave his job in a steel firm after his boss discovered he had HIV.  \"I've visited many other hospitals and encountered similar denials and excuses such as a lack of equipment.\"  Beijing was initially slow to acknowledge the threat of the disease but has since stepped up the fight against it, spending more on prevention programs, launching schemes to give universal access to anti-retroviral drugs to contain the disease, and introducing policies to curb discrimination. But in a country where taboos surrounding sex remain strong and discussion of the topic is largely limited, persistent discrimination by healthcare workers could mean that many sufferers are likely to avoid medical treatment.  Zhang Ke, deputy director of the infectious disease department of the Beijing You An Hospital, said China's policy that people with HIV and AIDS should only be treated in designated hospitals for treating infectious diseases was one of the root causes for the discrimination.  \"We should eliminate these designated hospitals,\" said the doctor, who treats HIV-infected patients.  Another HIV-positive man from Hebei province, who contracted the virus through a blood transfusion, recalled how hospital workers insisted on discharging him quickly after they found out he had HIV.  \"I talked to them later ... and their worry is that in rural hospitals, when a HIV positive person receives procedures, very few people would visit the hospital. They are worried about the impact on economic gains,\" he said.",
