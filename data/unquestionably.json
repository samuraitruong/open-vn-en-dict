To be elite at anything, you need to possess talent, natural ability and good teachers. <em>Unquestionably</em>, Jordan didn't lack in any of these categories: exceptional athlete exposed to multiple Hall of Fame coaches as a young player and a professional.   However every year, there are many elite athletes that come from blue chip programs who not only fail to become all-stars, but also fail to make it in the league at all. What separated Jordan? In the book, Relentless, by Tim Grover (Jordan's former trainer), he says of Jordan, \"After every game, I used to ask Michael one question: Five, six or seven? As in, what time are we hitting the gym tomorrow morning?\"  A willingness to pay the price isn't something that is restricted to the genetically gifted or those born with genius level IQs; it\u2019s something that can be earned through discipline. What separated Jordan from the pack was his other-worldly ability to focus on what he wanted and the discipline to see it through. Says Grover, \"Most people can't begin to comprehend the psychological makeup of an individual who is one of the the best in the world at what he does, and what he's been through to get there.\"",

            "en": "4         4. INVITATIONS In my dream it was very dark, and what dim light there was seemed to be radiating from Edward's skin. I couldn't see his face, just his back as he walked away from me, leaving me in the blackness. No matter how fast I ran, I couldn't catch up to him; no matter how loud I called, he never turned. Troubled, I woke in the middle of the night and couldn't sleep again for what seemed like a very long time. After that, he was in my dreams nearly every night, but always on the periphery, never within reach. The month that followed the accident was uneasy, tense, and, at first, embarrassing. To my dismay, I found myself the center of attention for the rest of that week. Tyler Crowley was impossible, following me around, obsessed with making amends to me somehow. I tried to convince him what I wanted more than anything else was for him to forget all about it \u2014 especially since nothing had actually happened to me \u2014 but he remained insistent. He followed me between classes and sat at our now-crowded lunch table. Mike and Eric were even less friendly toward him than they were to each other, which made me worry that I'd gained another unwelcome fan. No one seemed concerned about Edward, though I explained over and over that he was the hero \u2014 how he had pulled me out of the way and had nearly been crushed, too. I tried to be convincing. Jessica, Mike, Eric, and everyone else always commented that they hadn't even seen him there till the van was pulled away. I wondered to myself why no one else had seen him standing so far away, before he was suddenly, impossibly saving my life. With chagrin, I realized the probable cause \u2014 no one else was as aware of Edward as I always was. No one else watched him the way I did. How pitiful. Edward was never surrounded by crowds of curious bystanders eager for his firsthand account. People avoided him as usual. The Cullens and the Hales sat at the same table as always, not eating, talking only among themselves. None of them, especially Edward, glanced my way anymore.  When he sat next to me in class, as far from me as the table would allow, he seemed totally unaware of my presence. Only now and then, when his fists would suddenly ball up \u2014 skin stretched even whiter over the bones \u2014 did I wonder if he wasn't quite as oblivious as he appeared.  He wished he hadn't pulled me from the path of Tyler's van \u2014 there was no other conclusion I could come to. I wanted very much to talk to him, and the day after the accident I tried. The last time I'd seen him, outside the ER, we'd both been so furious. I still was angry that he wouldn't trust me with the truth, even though I was keeping my part of the bargain flawlessly. But he had in fact saved my life, no matter how he'd done it. And, overnight, the heat of my anger faded into awed gratitude. He was already seated when I got to Biology, looking straight ahead. I sat down, expecting him to turn toward me. He showed no sign that he realized I was there. \"Hello, Edward,\" I said pleasantly, to show him I was going to behave myself. He turned his head a fraction toward me without meeting my gaze, nodded once, and then looked the other way. And that was the last contact I'd had with him, though he was there, a foot away from me, every day. I watched him sometimes, unable to stop myself\u2014 from a distance, though, in the cafeteria or parking lot. I\u00a0 watched as his golden eyes grew perceptibly darker day by day. But in class I gave no more notice that he existed than he showed toward me. I was miserable. And the dreams continued. Despite my outright lies, the tenor of my e-mails alerted Ren\u00e9e to my depression, and she called a few times, worried. I tried to convince her it was just the weather that had me down. Mike, at least, was pleased by the obvious coolness between me and my lab partner. I could see he'd been worried that Edward's daring rescue might have impressed me, and he was relieved that it seemed to have the opposite effect. He grew more confident, sitting on the edge of my table to talk before Biology class started, ignoring Edward as completely as he ignored us. The snow washed away for good after that one dangerously icy day. Mike was disappointed he'd never gotten to stage his snowball fight, but pleased that the beach trip would soon be possible. The rain continued heavily, though, and the weeks passed. Jessica made me aware of another event looming on the horizon \u2014 she called the first Tuesday of March to ask my permission to invite Mike to the girls' choice spring dance in two weeks. \"Are you sure you don't mind\u2026 you weren't planning to ask him?\" she persisted when I told her I didn't mind in the least. \"No, Jess, I'm not going,\" I assured her. Dancing was glaringly outside my range of abilities. \"It will be really fun.\" Her attempt to convince me was halfhearted. I suspected that Jessica enjoyed my inexplicable popularity more than my actual company. \"You have fun with Mike,\" I encouraged. The next day, I was surprised that Jessica wasn't her usual gushing self in Trig and Spanish. She was silent as she walked by my side between classes, and I was afraid to ask her why. If Mike had turned her down, I was the last person she would want to tell. My fears were strengthened during lunch when Jessica sat as far from Mike as possible, chatting animatedly with Eric. Mike was unusually quiet.  Mike was still quiet as he walked me to class, the uncomfortable look on his face a bad sign. But he didn't broach the subject until I was in my seat and he was perched on my desk. As always, I was electrically aware of Edward sitting close enough to touch, as distant as if he were merely an invention of my imagination. \"So,\" Mike said, looking at the floor, \"Jessica asked me to the spring dance.\" \"That's great.\" I made my voice bright and enthusiastic. \"You'll have a lot of fun with Jessica.\" \"Well\u2026\" He floundered as he examined my smile, clearly not happy with my response. \"I told her I had to think about it.\" \"Why would you do that?\" I let disapproval color my tone, though I was relieved he hadn't given her an absolute no. His face was bright red as he looked down again. Pity shook my resolve. \"I was wondering if\u2026 well, if you might be planning to ask me.\" I paused for a moment, hating the wave of guilt that swept through me. But I saw, from the corner of my eye, Edward's head tilt reflexively in my direction. \"Mike, I think you should tell her yes,\" I said.  \"Did you already ask someone?\" Did Edward notice how Mike's eyes flickered in his direction? \"No,\" I assured him. \"I'm not going to the dance at all.\" \"Why not?\" Mike demanded. I didn't want to get into the safety hazards that dancing presented, so I quickly made new plans. \"I'm going to Seattle that Saturday,\" I explained. I needed to get out of town anyway \u2014 it was suddenly the perfect time to go. \"Can't you go some other weekend?\" \"Sorry, no,\" I said. \"So you shouldn't make Jess wait any longer \u2014 it's rude.\" \"Yeah, you're right,\" he mumbled, and turned, dejected, to walk back to his seat. I closed my eyes and pressed my fingers to my temples, trying to push the guilt and sympathy out of my head. Mr. Banner began talking.  I sighed and opened my eyes. And Edward was staring at me curiously, that same, familiar edge of frustration even more distinct now in his black eyes. I stared back, surprised, expecting him to look quickly away. But instead he continued to gaze with probing intensity into my eyes. There was no question of me looking away. My hands started to shake. \"Mr. Cullen?\" the teacher called, seeking the answer to a question that I hadn't heard. \"The Krebs Cycle,\" Edward answered, seeming reluctant as he turned to look at Mr. Banner. I looked down at my book as soon as his eyes released me, trying to find my place. Cowardly as ever, I shifted my hair over my right shoulder to hide my face. I couldn't believe the rush of emotion pulsing through me \u2014 just because he'd happened to look at me for the first time in a half-dozen weeks. I couldn't allow him to have this level of influence over me. It was pathetic. More than pathetic, it was unhealthy. I tried very hard not to be aware of him for the rest of the hour, and, since that was impossible, at least not to let him know that I was aware of him. When the bell rang at last, I turned my back to him to gather my things, expecting him to leave immediately as usual. \"Bella?\" His voice shouldn't have been so familiar to me, as if I'd known the sound of it all my life rather than for just a few short weeks. I turned slowly, unwillingly. I didn't want to feel what I knew I would feel when I looked at his too-perfect face. My expression was wary when I finally turned to him; his expression was unreadable. He didn't say anything. \"What? Are you speaking to me again?\" I finally asked, an unintentional note of petulance in my voice. His lips twitched, fighting a smile. \"No, not really,\" he admitted. I closed my eyes and inhaled slowly through my nose, aware that I was gritting my teeth. He waited. \"Then what do you want, Edward?\" I asked, keeping my eyes closed; it was easier to talk to him coherently that way. \"I'm sorry.\" He sounded sincere. \"I'm being very rude, I know. But it's better this way, really.\" I opened my eyes. His face was very serious. \"I don't know what you mean,\" I said, my voice guarded. \"It's better if we're not friends,\" he explained. \"Trust me.\" My eyes narrowed. I'd heard that before. \"It's too bad you didn't figure that out earlier,\" I hissed through my teeth. \"You could have saved yourself all this regret.\" \"Regret?\" The word, and my tone, obviously caught him off guard. \"Regret for what?\" \"For not just letting that stupid van squish me.\" He was astonished. He stared at me in disbelief. When he finally spoke, he almost sounded mad. \"You think I regret saving your life?\" \"I know you do,\" I snapped. \"You don't know anything.\" He was definitely mad. I turned my head sharply away from him, clenching my jaw against all the wild accusations I wanted to hurl at him. I gathered my books together, then stood and walked to the door. I meant to sweep dramatically out of the room, but of course I caught the toe of my boot on the door jamb and dropped my books. I stood there for a moment, thinking about leaving them. Then I sighed and bent to pick them up. He was there; he'd already stacked them into a pile. He handed them to me, his face hard. \"Thank you,\" I said icily. His eyes narrowed. \"You're welcome,\" he retorted. I straightened up swiftly, turned away from him again, and stalked off to Gym without looking back. Gym was brutal. We'd moved on to basketball. My team never passed me the ball, so that was good, but I fell down a lot. Sometimes I took people with me. Today I was worse than usual because my head was so filled with Edward. I tried to concentrate on my feet, but he kept creeping back into my thoughts just when I really needed my balance. It was a relief, as always, to leave. I almost ran to the truck; there were just so many people I wanted to avoid. The truck had suffered only minimal damage in the accident. I'd had to replace the taillights, and if I'd had a real paint job, I would have touched that up. Tyler's parents had to sell their van for parts. I almost had a stroke when I rounded the corner and saw a tall, dark figure leaning against the side of my truck. Then I realized it was just Eric. I started walking again. \"Hey, Eric,\" I called. \"Hi, Bella.\" \"What's up?\" I said as I was unlocking the door. I wasn't paying attention to the uncomfortable edge in his voice, so his next words took me by surprise. \"Uh, I was just wondering\u2026 if you would go to the spring dance with me?\" His voice broke on the last word. \"I thought it was girls' choice,\" I said, too startled to be diplomatic. \"Well, yeah,\" he admitted, shamefaced. I recovered my composure and tried to make my smile warm. \"Thank you for asking me, but I'm going to be in Seattle that day.\" \"Oh,\" he said. \"Well, maybe next time.\" \"Sure,\" I agreed, and then bit my lip. I wouldn't want him to take that too literally. He slouched off, back toward the school. I heard a low chuckle. Edward was walking past the front of my truck, looking straight forward, his lips pressed together. I yanked the door open and jumped inside, slamming it loudly behind me. I revved the engine deafeningly and reversed out into the aisle. Edward was in his car already, two spaces down, sliding out smoothly in front of me, cutting me off. He stopped there \u2014 to wait for his family; I could see the four of them walking this way, but still by the cafeteria. I considered taking out the rear of his shiny Volvo, but there were too many witnesses. I looked in my rearview mirror. A line was beginning to form. Directly behind me, Tyler Crowley was in his recently acquired used Sentra, waving.  I was too aggravated to acknowledge him. While I was sitting there, looking everywhere but at the car in front of me, I heard a knock on my passenger side window. I looked over; it was Tyler. I glanced back in my rearview mirror, confused. His car was still running, the door left open. I leaned across the cab to crank the window down. It was stiff. I got it halfway down, then gave up. \"I'm sorry, Tyler, I'm stuck behind Cullen.\" I was annoyed \u2014 obviously the holdup wasn't my fault. \"Oh, I know \u2014 I just wanted to ask you something while we're trapped here.\" He grinned. This could not be happening. \"Will you ask me to the spring dance?\" he continued. \"I'm not going to be in town, Tyler.\" My voice sounded a little sharp. I had to remember it wasn't his fault that Mike and Eric had already used up my quota of patience for the day. \"Yeah, Mike said that,\" he admitted. \"Then why \u2014\" He shrugged. \"I was hoping you were just letting him down easy.\" Okay, it was completely his fault. \"Sorry, Tyler,\" I said, working to hide my irritation. \"I really am going out of town.\" \"That's cool. We still have prom.\" And before I could respond, he was walking back to his car. I could feel the shock on my face. I looked forward to see Alice, Rosalie, Emmett, and Jasper all sliding into the Volvo. In his rearview mirror, Edward's eyes were on me. He was <em>unquestionably</em> shaking with laughter, as if he'd heard every word Tyler had said. My foot itched toward the gas pedal\u2026 one little bump wouldn't hurt any of them, just that glossy silver paint job. I revved the engine. But they were all in, and Edward was speeding away. I drove home slowly, carefully, muttering to myself the whole way. When I got home, I decided to make chicken enchiladas for dinner. It was a long process, and it would keep me busy. While I was simmering the onions and chilies, the phone rang. I was almost afraid to answer it, but it might be Charlie or my mom. It was Jessica, and she was jubilant; Mike had caught her after school to accept her invitation. I celebrated with her briefly while I stirred. She had to go, she wanted to call Angela and Lauren to tell them. I suggested \u2014 with casual innocence \u2014 that maybe Angela, the shy girl who had Biology with me, could ask Eric. And Lauren, a \u00a0standoffish girl who had always ignored me at the lunch table, could ask Tyler; I'd heard he was still available. Jess thought that was a great idea. Now that she was sure of Mike, she actually sounded sincere when she said she wished I would go to the dance. I gave her my Seattle excuse. After I hung up, I tried to concentrate on dinner \u2014 dicing the chicken especially; I didn't want to take another trip to the emergency room. But my head was spinning, trying to analyze every word Edward had spoken today. What did he mean, it was better if we weren't friends?  My stomach twisted as I realized what he must have meant. He must see how absorbed I was by him; he must not want to lead me on\u2026 so we couldn't even be friends\u2026 because he wasn't interested in me at all. Of course he wasn't interested in me, I thought angrily, my eyes stinging \u2014 a delayed reaction to the onions. I wasn't interesting. And he was. Interesting\u2026 and brilliant\u2026 and mysterious\u2026 and perfect\u2026 and beautiful\u2026 and possibly able to lift full-sized vans with one hand. Well, that was fine. I could leave him alone. I would leave him alone. I would get through my self-imposed sentence here in purgatory, and then hopefully some school in the Southwest, or possibly Hawaii, would offer me a scholarship. I focused my thoughts on sunny beaches and palm trees as I finished the enchiladas and put them in the oven. Charlie seemed suspicious when he came home and smelled the green peppers. I couldn't blame him \u2014 the closest edible Mexican food was probably in southern California. But he was a cop, even if just a small-town cop, so he was brave enough to take the first bite. He seemed to like it. It was fun to watch as he slowly began trusting me in the kitchen. \"Dad?\" I asked when he was almost done. \"Yeah, Bella?\" \"Um, I just wanted to let you know that I'm going to Seattle for the day a week from Saturday\u2026 if that's okay?\" I didn't want to ask permission \u2014 it set a bad precedent \u2014 but I felt rude, so I tacked it on at the end. \"Why?\" He sounded surprised, as if he were unable to imagine something that Forks couldn't offer. \"Well, I wanted to get few books \u2014 the library here is pretty limited \u2014 and maybe look at some clothes.\" I had more money than I was used to having, since, thanks to Charlie, I hadn't had to pay for a car. Not that the truck didn't cost me quite a bit in the gas department. \"That truck probably doesn't get very good gas mileage,\" he said, echoing my thoughts. \"I know, I'll stop in Montesano and Olympia \u2014 and Tacoma if I have to.\" \"Are you going all by yourself?\" he asked, and I couldn't tell if he was suspicious I had a secret boyfriend or just worried about car trouble. \"Yes.\" \"Seattle is a big city \u2014 you could get lost,\" he fretted. \"Dad, Phoenix is five times the size of Seattle \u2014 and I can read a map, don't worry about it.\" \"Do you want me to come with you?\" I tried to be crafty as I hid my horror. \"That's all right, Dad, I'll probably just be in dressing rooms all day \u2014 very boring.\" \"Oh, okay.\" The thought of sitting in women's clothing stores for any period of time immediately put him off. \"Thanks.\" I smiled at him. \"Will you be back in time for the dance?\" Grrr. Only in a town this small would a father know when the high school dances were. \"No \u2014 I don't dance, Dad.\" He, of all people, should understand that \u2014 I didn't get my balance problems from my mother. He did understand. \"Oh, that's right,\" he realized. The next morning, when I pulled into the parking lot, I deliberately parked as far as possible from the silver Volvo. I didn't want to put myself in the path of too much temptation and end up owing him a new car. Getting out of the cab, I fumbled with my key and it fell into a puddle at my feet. As I bent to get it, a white hand flashed out and grabbed it before I could. I jerked upright. Edward Cullen was right next to me, leaning casually against my truck. \"How do you do that?\" I asked in amazed irritation. \"Do what?\" He held my key out as he spoke. As I reached for it, he dropped it into my palm. \"Appear out of thin air.\" \"Bella, it's not my fault if you are exceptionally unobservant.\" His voice was quiet as usual \u2014 velvet, muted. I scowled at his perfect face. His eyes were light again today, a deep, golden honey color. Then I had to look down, to reassemble my now-tangled thoughts. \"Why the traffic jam last night?\" I demanded, still looking away. \"I thought you were supposed to be pretending I don't exist, not irritating me to death.\" \"That was for Tyler's sake, not mine. I had to give him his chance.\" He snickered. \"You\u2026\" I gasped. I couldn't think of a bad enough word. It felt like the heat of my anger should physically burn him, but he only seemed more amused. \"And I'm not pretending you don't exist,\" he continued. \"So you are trying to irritate me to death? Since Tyler's van didn't do the job?\" Anger flashed in his tawny eyes. His lips pressed into a hard line, all signs of humor gone. \"Bella, you are utterly absurd,\" he said, his low voice cold. My palms tingled \u2014 I wanted so badly to hit something. I was surprised at myself. I was usually a nonviolent person. I turned my back and started to walk away. \"Wait,\" he called. I kept walking, sloshing angrily through the rain. But he was next to me, easily keeping pace. \"I'm sorry, that was rude,\" he said as we walked. I ignored him. \"I'm not saying it isn't true,\" he continued, \"but it was rude to say it, anyway.\" \"Why won't you leave me alone?\" I grumbled. \"I wanted to ask you something, but you sidetracked me,\" he chuckled. He seemed to have recovered his good humor. \"Do you have a multiple personality disorder?\" I asked severely. \"You're doing it again.\" I sighed. \"Fine then. What do you want to ask?\" \"I was wondering if, a week from Saturday \u2014 you know, the day of the spring dance \u2014\" \"Are you trying to be funny?\" I interrupted him, wheeling toward him. My face got drenched as I looked up at his expression. His eyes were wickedly amused. \"Will you please allow me to finish?\" I bit my lip and clasped my hands together, interlocking my fingers, so I couldn't do anything rash. \"I heard you say you were going to Seattle that day, and I was wondering if you wanted a ride.\" That was unexpected. \"What?\" I wasn't sure what he was getting at. \"Do you want a ride to Seattle?\" \"With who?\" I asked, mystified. \"Myself, obviously.\" He enunciated every syllable, as if he were talking to someone mentally handicapped. I was still stunned. \"Why?\" \"Well, I was planning to go to Seattle in the next few weeks, and, to be honest, I'm not sure if your truck can make it.\" \"My truck works just fine, thank you very much for your concern.\" I started to walk again, but I was too surprised to maintain the same level of anger. \"But can your truck make it there on one tank of gas?\" He matched my pace again. \"I don't see how that is any of your business.\" Stupid, shiny Volvo owner. \"The wasting of finite resources is everyone's business.\" \"Honestly, Edward.\" I felt a thrill go through me as I said his name, and I hated it. \"I can't keep up with you. I thought you didn't want to be my friend.\" \"I said it would be better if we weren't friends, not that I didn't want to be.\" \"Oh, thanks, now that's all cleared up.\" Heavy sarcasm. I realized I had stopped walking again. We were under the shelter of the cafeteria roof now, so I could more easily look at his face. Which certainly didn't help my clarity of thought. \"It would be more\u2026 prudent for you not to be my friend,\" he explained.  \"But I'm tired of trying to stay away from you, Bella.\" His eyes were gloriously intense as he uttered that last sentence, his voice smoldering. I couldn't remember how to breathe. \"Will you go with me to Seattle?\" he asked, still intense. I couldn't speak yet, so I just nodded. He smiled briefly, and then his face became serious. \"You really should stay away from me,\" he warned. \"I'll see you in class.\" He turned abruptly and walked back the way we'd come.",

            "en": "4         4. WAKING UP TIME PASSES. EVEN WHEN IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE. EVEN when each tick of the second hand aches like the pulse of blood behind a bruise. It passes unevenly, in strange lurches and dragging lulls, but pass it does. Even for me. CHARLIE'S FIST CAME DOWN ON THE TABLE. \"THAT'S IT, Bella! I'm sending you home.\" I looked up from my cereal, which I was pondering rather than eating, and stared at Charlie in shock. I hadn't been following the conversation\u2014actually, I hadn't been aware that we were having a conversation\u2014and I wasn't sure what he meant. \"I am home,\" I mumbled, confused. \"I'm sending you to Renee, to Jacksonville,\" he clarified. Charlie watched with exasperation as I slowly grasped the meaning of his words. \"What did I do?\" I felt my face crumple. It was so unfair. My behavior had been above reproach for the past four months. After that first week, which neither of us ever mentioned, I hadn't missed a day of school or work. My grades were perfect. I never broke curfew\u2014I never went anywhere from which to break curfew in the first place. I only very rarely served leftovers. Charlie was scowling. \"You didn't do anything. That's the problem. You never do anything.\" \"You want me to get into trouble?\" I wondered, my eyebrows pulling together in mystification. I made an effort to pay attention. It wasn't easy. I was so used to tuning everything out, my ears felt stopped up. \"Trouble would be better than this\u2026 this moping around all the time!\" That stung a bit. I'd been careful to avoid all forms of moroseness, moping included. \"I am not moping around.\" \"Wrong word,\" he grudgingly conceded. \"Moping would be better\u2014that would be doing something. You're just\u2026 lifeless, Bella. I think that's the word I want.\" This accusation struck home. I sighed and tried to put some animation into my response. \"I'm sorry, Dad.\" My apology sounded a little flat, even to me. I'd thought I'd been fooling him. Keeping Charlie from suffering was the whole point of all this effort. How depressing to think that the effort had been wasted. \"I don't want you to apologize.\" I sighed. \"Then tell me what you do want me to do.\" \"Bella,\" he hesitated, scrutinizing my reaction to his next words. \"Honey, you're not the first person to go through this kind of thing, you know.\" \"I know that.\" My accompanying grimace was limp and unimpressive. .  \"Listen, honey. I think that\u2014that maybe you need some help.\" \"Help?\" He paused, searching for the words again. \"When your mother left,\" he began, frowning, \"and took you with her.\" He inhaled deeply. \"Well, that was a really bad time for me.\" \"I know, Dad,\" I mumbled. \"But I handled it,\" he pointed out. \"Honey, you're not handling it. I waited, I hoped it would get better.\" He stared at me and I looked down quickly. \"I think we both know it's not getting better.\" \"I'm fine.\" He ignored me. \"Maybe, well, maybe if you talked to someone about it. A professional.\" \"You want me to see a shrink?\" My voice was a shade sharper as I realized what he was getting at. \"Maybe it would help.\" \"And maybe it wouldn't help one little bit.\" I didn't know much about psychoanalysis, but I was pretty sure that it didn't work unless the subject was relatively honest. Sure, I could tell the truth\u2014if I wanted to spend the rest of my life in a padded cell. He examined my obstinate expression, and switched to another line of attack. \"It's beyond me, Bella. Maybe your mother\" \"Look,\" I said in a flat voice. \"I'll go out tonight, if you want. I'll call Jess or Angela.\" \"That's not what I want,\" he argued, frustrated. \"I don't think I can live through seeing you try harder. I've never seen anyone trying so hard. It hurts to watch.\" I pretended to be dense, looking down at the table. \"I don't understand, Dad. First you're mad because I'm not doing anything, and then you say you don't want me to go out.\" \"I want you to be happy\u2014no, not even that much. I just want you not to be miserable. I think you'll have a better chance if you get out of Forks.\" My eyes flashed up with the first small spark of feeling I'd had in too long to contemplate. \"I'm not leaving,\" I said. \"Why not?\" he demanded. \"I'm in my last semester of school\u2014it would screw everything up.\" \"You're a good student\u2014you'll figure it out.\" \"I don't want to crowd Mom and Phil.\" \"Your mother's been dying to have you back.\" \"Florida is too hot.\" His fist came down on the table again. \"We both know what's really going on here, Bella, and it's not good for you.\" He took a deep breath. \"It's been months. No calls, no letters, no contact. You can't keep waiting for him.\" I glowered at him. The heat almost, but not quite, reached my face. It had been a long time since I'd blushed with any emotion. This whole subject was utterly forbidden, as he was well aware. \"I'm not waiting for anything. I don't expect anything,\" I said in a low monotone. \"Bella\u2014,\" Charlie began, his voice thick. \"I have to get to school,\" I interrupted, standing up and yanking my untouched breakfast from the table. I dumped my bowl in the sink without pausing to wash it out. I couldn't deal with any more conversation. \"I'll make plans with Jessica,\" I called over my shoulder as I strapped on my school bag, not meeting his eyes. \"Maybe I won't be home for dinner. We'll go to Port Angeles and watch a movie.\" I was out the front door before he could react. In my haste to get away from Charlie, I ended up being one of the first ones to school. The plus side was that I got a really good parking spot. The downside was that I had free time on my hands, and I tried to avoid free time at all costs. Quickly, before I could start thinking about Charlie's accusations, I pulled out my Calculus book. I flipped it open to the section we should be starting today, and tried to make sense of it. Reading math was even worse than listening to it, but I was getting better at it. In the last several months, I'd spent ten times the amount of time on Calculus than I'd ever spent on math before. As a result, I was managing to keep in the range of a low A. I knew Mr. Varner felt my improvement was all due to his superior teaching methods. And if that made him happy, I wasn't going to burst his bubble. I forced myself to keep at it until the parking lot was full, and I ended up rushing to English. We were working on Animal Farm, an easy subject matter. I didn't mind communism; it was a welcome change from the exhausting romances that made up most of the curriculum. I settled into my seat, pleased by the distraction of Mr. Berty's lecture. Time moved easily while I was in school. The bell rang all too soon. I started repacking my bag. \"Bella?\" I recognized Mike's voice, and I knew what his next words would be before he said them. \"Are you working tomorrow?\" I looked up. He was leaning across the aisle with an anxious expression. Every Friday he asked me the same question. Never mind that I hadn't taken so much as a sick day. Well, with one exception, months ago. But he had no reason to look at me with such concern. I was a model employee. \"Tomorrow is Saturday, isn't it?\" I said. Having just had it pointed out to me by Charlie, I realized how lifeless my voice really sounded. \"Yeah, it is,\" he agreed. \"See you in Spanish.\" He waved once before turning his back. He didn't bother walking me to class anymore. I trudged off to Calculus with a grim expression. This was the class where I sat next to Jessica. It had been weeks, maybe months, since Jess had even greeted me when I passed her in the hall. I knew I had offended her with my antisocial behavior, and she was sulking. It wasn't going to be easy to talk to her now\u2014especially to ask her to do me a favor. I weighed my options carefully as I loitered outside the classroom, procrastinating. I wasn't about to face Charlie again without some kind of social interaction to report. I knew I couldn't lie, though the thought of driving to Port Angeles and back alone\u2014being sure my odometer reflected the correct mileage, just in case he checked\u2014was very tempting. Jessica's mom was the biggest gossip in town, and Charlie was bound to run into Mrs. Stanley sooner rather than later. When he did, he would no doubt mention the trip. Lying was out. With a sigh, I shoved the door open. Mr. Varner gave me a dark look\u2014he'd already started the lecture. I hurried to my seat. Jessica didn't look up as I sat next to her. I was glad that I had fifty minutes to mentally prepare myself. This class flew by even faster than English. A small part of that speed was due to my goody-goody preparation this morning in the truck\u2014but mostly it stemmed from the fact that time always sped up when I was looking forward to something unpleasant. I grimaced when Mr. Varner dismissed the class five minutes early. He smiled like he was being nice.  \"Jess?\" My nose wrinkled as I cringed, waiting for her to turn on me. She twisted in her seat to face me, eyeing me incredulously. \"Are you talking to me, Bella?\" \"Of course.\" I widened my eyes to suggest innocence. \"What? Do you need help with Calculus?\" Her tone was a tad sour. \"No.\" I shook my head. \"Actually, I wanted to know if you would\u2026 go to the movies with me tonight? I really need a girls' night out.\" The words sounded stiff, like badly delivered lines, and she looked suspicious. \"Why are you asking me?\" she asked, still unfriendly. \"You're the first person I think of when I want girl time.\" I smiled, and I hoped the smile looked genuine. It was probably true. She was at least the first person I thought of when I wanted to avoid Charlie. It amounted to the same thing. She seemed a little mollified. \"Well, I don't know.\" \"Do you have plans?\" \"No\u2026 I guess I can go with you. What do you want to see?\" \"I'm not sure what's playing,\" I hedged. This was the tricky part. I racked my brain for a clue\u2014hadn't I heard someone talk about a movie recently? Seen a poster? \"How about that one with the female president?\" She looked at me oddly. \"Bella, that one's been out of the theater forever.\" \"Oh.\" I frowned. \"Is there anything you'd like to see?\" Jessica's natural bubbliness started to leak out in spite of herself as she thought out loud. \"Well, there's that new romantic comedy that's getting great reviews. I want to see that one. And my dad just saw Dead End and he really liked it.\" I grasped at the promising title. \"What's that one about?\" \"Zombies or something. He said it was the scariest thing he'd seen in years.\" \"That sounds perfect.\" I'd rather deal with real zombies than watch a romance. \"Okay.\" She seemed surprised by my response. I tried to remember if I liked scary movies, but I wasn't sure. \"Do you want me to pick you up after school?\" she offered. \"Sure.\" Jessica smiled at me with tentative friendliness before she left. My answering smile was just a little late, but I thought that she saw it. The rest of the day passed quickly, my thoughts focused on planning for tonight. I knew from experience that once I got Jessica talking, I would be able to get away with a few mumbled responses at the appropriate moments. Only minimal interaction would be required. The thick haze that blurred my days now was sometimes confusing. I was surprised when I found myself in my room, not clearly remembering the drive home from school or even opening the front door. But that didn't matter. Losing track of time was the most I asked from life. I didn't fight the haze as I turned to my closet. The numbness was more essential in some places than in others. I barely registered what I was looking at as I slid the door aside to reveal the pile of rubbish on the left side of my closet, under the clothes I never wore. My eyes did not stray toward the black garbage bag that held my present from that last birthday, did not see the shape of the stereo where it strained against the black plastic; I didn't think of the bloody mess my nails had been when I'd finished clawing it out of the dashboard. I yanked the old purse I rarely used off the nail it hung from, and shoved the door shut. Just then I heard a horn honking. I swiftly traded my wallet from my schoolbag into the purse. I was in a hurry, as if rushing would somehow make the night pass more quickly. I glanced at myself in the hall mirror before I opened the door, arranging my features carefully into a smile and trying to hold them there. \"Thanks for coming with me tonight,\" I told Jess as I climbed into the passenger seat, trying to infuse my tone with gratitude. It had been a while since I'd really thought about what I was saying to anyone besides Charlie. Jess was harder. I wasn't sure which were the right emotions to fake. \"Sure. So, what brought this on?\" Jess wondered as she drove down my street. \"Brought what on?\" \"Why did you suddenly decide\u2026 to go out?\" It sounded like she changed her question halfway through. I shrugged. \"Just needed a change.\" I recognized the song on the radio then, and quickly reached for the dial. \"Do you mind?\" I asked. \"No, go ahead.\" I scanned through the stations until I found one that was harmless. I peeked at Jess's expression as the new music filled the car. Her eyes squinted. \"Since when do you listen to rap?\" \"I don't know,\" I said. \"A while.\" \"You like this?\" she asked doubtfully. \"Sure.\" It would be much too hard to interact with Jessica normally if I had to work to tune out the music, too. I nodded my head, hoping I was in time with the beat. \"Okay\u2026\" She stared out the windshield with wide eyes. \"So what's up with you and Mike these days?\" I asked quickly. \"You see him more than I do.\" The question hadn't started her talking like I'd hoped it would. \"It's hard to talk at work,\" I mumbled, and then I tried again. \"Have you been out with anyone lately?\" \"Not really. I go out with Conner sometimes. I went out with Eric two weeks ago.\" She rolled her eyes, and I sensed a long story. I clutched at the opportunity. \"Eric Yorkie? Who asked who?\" She groaned, getting more animated. \"He did, of course! I couldn't think of a nice way to say no.\" \"Where did he take you?\" I demanded, knowing she would interpret my eagerness as interest. \"Tell me all about it.\" She launched into her tale, and I settled into my seat, more comfortable now. I paid strict attention, murmuring in sympathy and gasping in horror as called for. When she was finished with her Eric story, she continued into a Conner comparison without any prodding. The movie was playing early, so Jess thought we should hit the twilight showing and eat later. I was happy to go along with whatever she wanted; after all, I was getting what I wanted\u2014Charlie off my back. I kept Jess talking through the previews, so I could ignore them more easily. But I got nervous when the movie started. A young couple was walking along a beach, swinging hands and discussing their mutual affection with gooey falseness. I resisted the urge to cover my ears and start humming. I had not bargained for a romance. \"I thought we picked the zombie movie,\" I hissed to Jessica. \"This is the zombie movie.\" \"Then why isn't anyone getting eaten?\" I asked desperately. She looked at me with wide eyes that were almost alarmed. \"I'm sure that part's coming,\" she whispered. \"I'm getting popcorn. Do you want any?\" \"No, thanks.\" Someone shushed us from behind. I took my time at the concession counter, watching the clock and debating what percentage of a ninety-minute movie could be spent on romantic exposition. I decided ten minutes was more than enough, but I paused just inside the theater doors to be sure. I could hear horrified screams blaring from the speakers, so I knew I'd waited long enough. \"You missed everything,\" Jess murmured when I slid back into my seat. \"Almost everyone is a zombie now.\" \"Long line.\" I offered her some popcorn. She took a handful. The rest of the movie was comprised of gruesome zombie attacks and endless screaming from the handful of people left alive, their numbers dwindling quickly. I would have thought there was nothing in that to disturb me. But I felt uneasy, and I wasn't sure why at first. It wasn't until almost the very end, as I watched a haggard zombie shambling after the last shrieking survivor, that I realized what the problem was. The scene kept cutting between the horrified face of the heroine, and the dead, emotionless face of her pursuer, back and forth as it closed the distance. And I realized which one resembled me the most. I stood up. \"Where are you going? There's, like, two minutes left,\" Jess hissed. \"I need a drink,\" I muttered as I raced for the exit. I sat down on the bench outside the theater door and tried very hard not to think of the irony. But it was ironic, all things considered, that, in the end, I would wind up as a zombie. I hadn't seen that one coming. Not that I hadn't dreamed of becoming a mythical monster once\u2014just never a grotesque, animated corpse. I shook my head to dislodge that train of thought, feeling panicky. I couldn't afford to think about what I'd once dreamed of. It was depressing to realize that I wasn't the heroine anymore, that my story was over. Jessica came out of the theater doors and hesitated, probably wondering where the best place was to search for me. When she saw me, she looked relieved, but only for a moment. Then she looked irritated. \"Was the movie too scary for you?\" she wondered. \"Yeah,\" I agreed. \"I guess I'm just a coward.\" \"That's funny.\" She frowned. \"I didn't think you were scared\u2014I was screaming all the time, but I didn't hear you scream once. So I didn't know why you left.\" I shrugged. \"Just scared.\" She relaxed a little. \"That was the scariest movie I think I've ever seen. I'll bet we're going to have nightmares tonight.\" \"No doubt about that,\" I said, trying to keep my voice normal. It was inevitable that I would have nightmares, but they wouldn't be about zombies. Her eyes flashed to my face and away. Maybe I hadn't succeeded with the normal voice. \"Where do you want to eat?\" Jess asked. \"I don't care.\" \"Okay.\" Jess started talking about the male lead in the movie as we walked. I nodded as she gushed over his hotness, unable to remember seeing a non-zombie man at all. I didn't watch where Jessica was leading me. I was only vaguely aware that it was dark and quieter now. It took me longer than it should have to realize why it was quiet. Jessica had stopped babbling. I looked at her apologetically, hoping I hadn't hurt her feelings. Jessica wasn't looking at me. Her face was tense; she stared straight ahead and walked fast. As I watched, her eyes darted quickly to the right, across the road, and back again. I glanced around myself for the first time. We were on a short stretch of unlit sidewalk. The little shops lining the street were all locked up for the night, windows black. Half a block ahead, the streetlights started up again, and I could see, farther down, the bright golden arches of the McDonald's she was heading for. Across the street there was one open business. The windows were covered from inside and there were neon signs, advertisements for different brands of beer, glowing in front of them. The biggest sign, in brilliant green, was the name of the bar\u2014One-Eyed Pete's. I wondered if there was some pirate theme not visible from outside. The metal door was propped open; it was dimly lit inside, and the low murmur of many voices and the sound of ice clinking in glasses floated across the street. Lounging against the wall beside the door were four men. I glanced back at Jessica. Her eyes were fixed on the path ahead and she moved briskly. She didn't look frightened\u2014just wary, trying to not attract attention to herself. I paused without thinking, looking back at the four men with a strong sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. This was a different road, a different night, but the scene was so much the same. One of them was even short and dark. As I stopped and turned toward them, that one looked up in interest.  I stared back at him, frozen on the sidewalk. \"Bella?\" Jess whispered. \"What are you doing?\" I shook my head, not sure myself. \"I think I know them\u2026\" I muttered. What was I doing? I should be running from this memory as fast as I could, blocking the image of the four lounging men from my mind, protecting myself with the numbness I couldn't function without. Why was I stepping, dazed, into the street? It seemed too coincidental that I should be in Port Angeles with Jessica, on a dark street even. My eyes focused on the short one, trying to match the features to my memory of the man who had threatened me that night almost a year ago. I wondered if there was any way I would recognize the man, if it was really him. That particular part of that particular evening was just a blur. My body remembered it better than my mind did; the tension in my legs as I tried to decide whether to run or to stand my ground, the dryness in my throat as I struggled to build a decent scream, the tight stretch of skin across my knuckles as I clenched my hands into fists, the chills on the back of my neck when the dark-haired man called me \"sugar.\"\u2026 There was an indefinite, implied kind of menace to these men that had nothing to do with that other night. It sprung from the fact that they were strangers, and it was dark here, and they outnumbered us\u2014nothing more specific than that. But it was enough that Jessica's voice cracked in panic as she called after me. \"Bella, come on!\" I ignored her, walking slowly forward without ever making the conscious decision to move my feet. I didn't understand why, but the nebulous threat the men presented drew me toward them. It was a senseless impulse, but I hadn't felt any kind of impulse in so long\u2026 I followed it. Something unfamiliar beat through my veins. Adrenaline, I realized, long absent from my system, drumming my pulse faster and fighting against the lack of sensation. It was strange\u2014why the adrenaline when there was no fear? It was almost as if it were an echo of the last time I'd stood like this, on a dark street in Port Angeles with strangers. I saw no reason for fear. I couldn't imagine anything in the world that there was left to be afraid of, not physically at least. One of the few advantages of losing everything. I was halfway across the street when Jess caught up to me and grabbed my arm. \"Bella! You can't go in a bar!\" she hissed. \"I'm not going in,\" I said absently, shaking her hand off. \"I just want to see something\u2026\" \"Are you crazy?\" she whispered. \"Are you suicidal?\" That question caught my attention, and my eyes focused on her. \"No, I'm not.\" My voice sounded defensive, but it was true. I wasn't suicidal. Even in the beginning, when death <em>unquestionably</em> would have been a relief, I didn't consider it. I owed too much to Charlie. I felt too responsible for Renee. I had to think of them. And I'd made a promise not to do anything stupid or reckless. For all those reasons, I was still breathing. Remembering that promise. I felt a twinge of guilt.\u00a0 But what I was doing fight now didn't really count. It wasn't like I was taking a blade to my wrists. Jess's eyes were round, her mouth hung open. Her question about suicide had been rhetorical, I realized too late. \"Go eat,\" I encouraged her, waving toward the fast food. I didn't like the way she looked at me. \"I'll catch up in a minute.\" I turned away from her, back to the men who were watching us with amused, curious eyes. \"Bella, stop this right now!\" My muscles locked into place, froze me where I stood. Because it wasn't Jessica's voice that rebuked me now. It was a furious voice, a familiar voice, a beautiful voice\u2014soft like velvet even though it was irate. It was his voice\u2014I was exceptionally careful not to think his name\u2014and I was surprised that the sound of it did not knock me to my knees, did not curl me onto the pavement in a torture of loss. But there was no pain, none at all. In the instant that I heard his voice, everything was very clear. Like my head had\u00a0 suddenly surfaced out of some dark pool. I was more aware of everything\u2014sight, sound, the feel of the cold air that I hadn't noticed was blowing sharply against my face, the smells coming from the open bar door. I looked around myself in shock. \"Go back to Jessica,\" the lovely voice ordered, still angry. \"You promised\u2014nothing stupid.\" I was alone. Jessica stood a few feet from me, staring at me with frightened eyes. Against the wall, the strangers watched, confused, wondering what I was doing, standing there motionless in the middle of the street. I shook my head, trying to understand. I knew he wasn't there, and yet, he felt improbably close, close for the first time since\u2026 since the end. The anger in his voice was concern, the same anger that was once very familiar\u2014something I hadn't heard in what felt like a lifetime. \"Keep your promise.\" The voice was slipping away, as if the volume was being turned down on a radio. I began to suspect that I was having some kind of hallucination. Triggered, no doubt, by the memory\u2014the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, the strange familiarity of the situation. I ran through the possibilities quickly in my head. Option one: I was crazy. That was the layman's term for people who heard voices in their heads. Possible. Option two: My subconscious mind was giving me what it thought I wanted. This was wish fulfillment\u2014a momentary relief from pain by embracing the incorrect idea that he cared whether I lived or died. Projecting what he would have said if A) he were here, and B) he would be in any way bothered by something bad happening to me. Probable. I could see no option three, so I hoped it was the second option and this was just my subconscious running amuck, rather than something I would need to be hospitalized for. My reaction was hardly sane, though\u2014I was grateful. The sound of his voice was something that I'd feared I was losing, and so, more than anything else, I felt overwhelming gratitude that my unconscious mind had held onto that sound better than my conscious one had. I was not allowed to think of him. That was something I tried to be very strict about. Of course I slipped; I was only human. But I was getting better, and so the pain was something I could avoid for days at a time now. The tradeoff was the never-ending numbness. Between pain and nothing, I'd chosen nothing. I waited for the pain now. I was not numb\u2014my senses felt unusually intense after so many months of the haze\u2014but the normal pain held off. The only ache was the disappointment that his voice was fading. There was a second of choice. The wise thing would be to run away from this potentially destructive\u2014and certainly mentally unstable\u2014development. It would be stupid to encourage hallucinations. But his voice was fading. I took another step forward, testing. \"Bella, turn around,\" he growled. I sighed in relief. The anger was what I wanted to hear\u2014false, fabricated evidence that he cared, a dubious gift from my subconscious. Very few seconds had passed while I sorted this all out. My little audience watched, curious. It probably looked like I was just dithering over whether or not I was going to approach them. How could they guess that I was standing there enjoying an unexpected moment of insanity? \"Hi,\" one of the men called, his tone both confident and a bit sarcastic. He was fair-skinned and fair-haired, and he stood with the assurance of someone who thought of himself as quite good-looking. I couldn't tell whether he was or not. I was prejudiced. The voice in my head answered with an exquisite snarl. I smiled, and the confident man seemed to take that as encouragement. \"Can I help you with something? You look lost.\" He grinned and winked. I stepped carefully over the gutter, running with water that was black in the darkness. \"No. I'm not lost.\" Now that I was closer\u2014and my eyes felt oddly in focus\u2014I analyzed the short, dark man's face. It was not familiar in any way. I suffered a curious sensation of disappointment that this was not the terrible man who had tried to hurt me almost a year ago. The voice in my head was quiet now. The short man noticed my stare. \"Can I buy you a drink?\" he offered, nervous, seeming flattered that I'd singled him out to stare at. \"I'm too young,\" I answered automatically. He was baffled\u00a0 \u2014wondering why I had approached them. I felt compelled to explain. \"From across the street, you looked like someone I knew. Sorry, my mistake.\" The threat that had pulled me across the street had evaporated. These were not the dangerous men I remembered. They were probably nice guys. Safe. I lost interest. \"That's okay,\" the confident blonde said. \"Stay and hang out with us.\" \"Thanks, but I can't.\" Jessica was hesitating in the middle of the street, her eyes wide with outrage and betrayal. \"Oh, just a few minutes.\" I shook my head, and turned to rejoin Jessica. \"Let's go eat,\" I suggested, barely glancing at her. Though I appeared to be, for the moment, freed of the zombie abstraction, I was just as distant. My mind was preoccupied. The safe, numb deadness did not come back, and I got more anxious with every minute that passed without its return. \"What were you thinking?\" Jessica snapped. \"You don't know them\u2014they could have been psychopaths!\" I shrugged, wishing she would let it go. \"I just thought I knew the one guy.\" \"You are so odd, Bella Swan. I feel like I don't know who you are.\" \"Sorry.\" I didn't know what else to say to that. We walked to McDonald's in silence. I'd bet that she was wishing we'd taken her car instead of walking the short distance from the theater, so that she could use the drive-through. She was just as anxious now for this evening to be over as I had been from the beginning. I tried to start a conversation a few times while we ate, but Jessica was not cooperative. I must have really offended her. When we go back in the car, she tuned the stereo back to her favorite station and turned the volume too loud to allow easy conversation. I didn't have to struggle as hard as usual to ignore the music. Even though my mind, for once, was not carefully numb and empty, I had too much to think about to hear the lyrics. I waited for the numbness to return, or the pain. Because the pain must be coming. I'd broken my personal rules. Instead of shying away from the memories, I'd walked forward and greeted them. I'd heard his voice, so clearly, in my head. That was going to cost me, I was sure of it. Especially if I couldn't reclaim the haze to protect myself. I felt too alert, and that frightened me. But relief was still the strongest emotion in my body\u2014relief that came from the very core of my being. As much as I struggled not to think of him, I did not struggle to forget. I worried\u2014late in the night, when the exhaustion of sleep deprivation broke down my defenses\u2014that it was all slipping away. That my mind was a sieve, and I would someday not be able to remember the precise color of his eyes, the feel of his cool skin, or the texture of his voice. I could not think of them, but I must remember them. Because there was just one thing that I had to believe to be able to live\u2014I had to know that he existed. That was all. Everything else I could endure. So long as he existed. That's why I was more trapped in Forks than I ever had been before, why I'd fought with Charlie when he suggested a change. Honestly, it shouldn't matter; no one was ever coming back here. But if I were to go to Jacksonville, or anywhere else bright and unfamiliar, how could I be sure he was real? In a place where I could never imagine him, the conviction might fade\u2026 and that I could not live through. Forbidden to remember, terrified to forget; it was a hard line to walk. I was surprised when Jessica stopped the car in front of my house. The ride had not taken long, but, short as it seemed, I wouldn't have thought that Jessica could go that long without speaking. \"Thanks for going out with me, Jess,\" I said as I opened my door. \"That was\u2026fun.\" I hoped that fun was the appropriate word. \"Sure,\" she muttered. \"I'm sorry about\u2026 after the movie.\" \"Whatever, Bella.\" She glared out the windshield instead of looking at me. She seemed to be growing angrier rather than getting over it. \"See you Monday?\" \"Yeah. Bye.\" I gave up and shut the door. She drove away, still without looking at me. I'd forgotten her by the time I was inside. Charlie was waiting for me in the middle of the hall, his arms folded tight over his chest with his hands balled into fists. \"Hey, Dad,\" I said absentmindedly as I ducked around Charlie, heading for the stairs. I'd been thinking about him for too long, and I wanted to be upstairs before it caught up with me. \"Where have you been?\" Charlie demanded. I looked at my dad, surprised. \"I went to a movie in Port Angeles with Jessica. Like I told you this morning.\" \"Humph,\" he grunted. \"Is that okay?\u201d He studied my face, his eyes widening as if he saw something unexpected. \"Yeah, that's fine. Did you have fun?\" \"Sure,\" I said. \"We watched zombies eat people. It was great.\" His eyes narrowed. \"'Night, Dad.\" He let me pass. I hurried to my room. I lay in my bed a few minutes later, resigned as the pain finally made its appearance. It was a crippling thing, this sensation that a huge hole had been punched through my chest, excising my most vital organs and leaving ragged, unhealed gashes around the edges that continued to throb and bleed despite the passage of time. Rationally, I knew my lungs must still be intact, yet I gasped for air and my head spun like my efforts yielded me nothing. My heart must have been beating, too, but I couldn't hear the sound of my pulse in my ears; my hands felt blue with cold. I curled inward, hugging my ribs to hold myself together. I scrambled for my numbness, my denial, but it evaded me. And yet, I found I could survive. I was alert, I felt the pain\u2014the aching loss that radiated out from my chest, sending wracking waves of hurt through my limbs and head\u2014but it was manageable. I could live through it. It didn't feel like the pain had weakened over time, rather that I'd grown strong enough to bear it. Whatever it was that had happened tonight\u2014and whether it was the zombies, the\u00a0 adrenaline, or the hallucinations that were responsible\u2014it had woken me up. For the first time in a long time, I didn't know what to expect in the morning.",

            "en": "13        13. CONFESSIONS Edward in the sunlight was shocking. I couldn't get used to it, though I'd been staring at him all afternoon. His skin, white despite the faint flush from yesterday's hunting trip, literally sparkled, like thousands of tiny diamonds were embedded in the surface. He lay perfectly still in the grass, his shirt open over his sculpted, incandescent chest, his scintillating arms bare. His glistening, pale lavender lids were shut, though of course he didn't sleep. A perfect statue, carved in some unknown stone, smooth like marble, glittering like crystal. Now and then, his lips would move, so fast it looked like they were trembling. But, when I asked, he told me he was singing to himself; it was too low for me to hear. I enjoyed the sun, too, though the air wasn't quite dry enough for my taste. I would have liked to lie back, as he did, and let the sun warm my face. But I stayed curled up, my chin resting on my knees, unwilling to take my eyes off him. The wind was gentle; it tangled my hair and ruffled the grass that swayed around his motionless form. The meadow, so spectacular to me at first, paled next to his magnificence. Hesitantly, always afraid, even now, that he would disappear like a mirage, too beautiful to be real\u2026 hesitantly, I reached out one finger and stroked the back of his shimmering hand, where it lay within my reach. I marveled again at the perfect texture, satin smooth, cool as stone. When I looked up again, his eyes were open, watching me. Butterscotch today, lighter, warmer after hunting. His quick smile turned up the corners of his flawless lips. \"I don't scare you?\" he asked playfully, but I could hear the real curiosity in his soft voice. \"No more than usual.\" He smiled wider; his teeth flashed in the sun. I inched closer, stretched out my whole hand now to trace the contours of his forearm with my fingertips. I saw that my fingers trembled, and knew it wouldn't escape his notice. \"Do you mind?\" I asked, for he had closed his eyes again. \"No,\" he said without opening his eyes. \"You can't imagine how that feels.\" He sighed. I lightly trailed my hand over the perfect muscles of his arm, followed\u00a0 the faint pattern of bluish veins inside the crease at his elbow. With my other hand, I reached to turn his hand over. Realizing what I wished, he flipped his palm up in one of those blindingly fast, disconcerting movements of his. It startled me; my fingers froze on his arm for a brief second. \"Sorry,\" he murmured. I looked up in time to see his golden eyes close again. \"It's too easy to be myself with you.\" I lifted his hand, turning it this way and that as I watched the sun glitter on his palm. I held it closer to my face, trying to see the hidden facets in his skin. \"Tell me what you're thinking,\" he whispered. I looked to see his eyes watching me, suddenly intent. \"It's still so strange for me, not knowing.\" \"You know, the rest of us feel that way all the time.\" \"It's a hard life.\" Did I imagine the hint of regret in his tone? \"But you didn't tell me.\" \"I was wishing I could know what you were thinking\u2026\" I hesitated. \"And?\" \"I was wishing that I could believe that you were real. And I was wishing that I wasn't afraid.\" \"I don't want you to be afraid.\" His voice was just a soft murmur. I heard what he couldn't truthfully say, that I didn't need to be afraid, that there was nothing to fear. \"Well, that's not exactly the fear I meant, though that's certainly something to think about.\" So quickly that I missed his movement, he was half sitting, propped up on his right arm, his left palm still in my hands. His angel's face was only a few inches from mine. I might have \u2014 should have \u2014 flinched away from his unexpected closeness, but I was unable to move.  His golden eyes mesmerized me. \"What are you afraid of, then?\" he whispered intently. But I couldn't answer. As I had just that once before, I smelled his cool breath in my face. Sweet, delicious, the scent made my mouth water. It was unlike anything else. Instinctively, unthinkingly, I leaned closer, inhaling. And he was gone, his hand ripped from mine. In the time it took my eyes to focus, he was twenty feet away, standing at the edge of the small meadow, in the deep shade of a huge fir tree. He stared at me, his eyes dark in the shadows, his expression unreadable. I could feel the hurt and shock on my face. My empty hands stung. \"I'm\u2026 sorry\u2026 Edward,\" I whispered. I knew he could hear. \"Give me a moment,\" he called, just loud enough for my less sensitive ears. I sat very still. After ten incredibly long seconds, he walked back, slowly for him. He stopped, still several feet away, and sank gracefully to the ground, crossing his legs. His eyes never left mine.  He took two deep breaths, and then smiled in apology. \"I am so very sorry.\" He hesitated. \"Would you understand what I meant if I said I was only human?\" I nodded once, not quite able to smile at his joke. Adrenaline pulsed through my veins as the realization of danger slowly sank in. He could smell that from where he sat. His smile turned mocking. \"I'm the world's best predator, aren't I? Everything about me invites you in \u2014 my voice, my face, even my smell. As if I need any of that!\" Unexpectedly, he was on his feet, bounding away, instantly out of sight, only to appear beneath the same tree as before, having circled the meadow in half a second. \"As if you could outrun me,\" he laughed bitterly. He reached up with one hand and, with a deafening crack, effortlessly ripped a two-foot-thick branch from the trunk of the spruce. He balanced it in that hand for a moment, and then threw it with blinding speed, shattering it against another huge tree, which shook and trembled at the blow. And he was in front of me again, standing two feet away, still as a stone. \"As if you could fight me off,\" he said gently. I sat without moving, more frightened of him than I had ever been. I'd never seen him so completely freed of that carefully cultivated facade. He'd never been less human\u2026 or more beautiful. Face ashen, eyes wide, I sat like a bird locked in the eyes of a snake. His lovely eyes seem to glow with rash excitement. Then, as the seconds passed, they dimmed. His expression slowly folded into a mask of ancient sadness. \"Don't be afraid,\" he murmured, his velvet voice unintentionally seductive. \"I promise\u2026\" He hesitated. \"I swear not to hurt you.\" He seemed more concerned with convincing himself than me. \"Don't be afraid,\" he whispered again as he stepped closer, with exaggerated slowness. He sat sinuously, with deliberately unhurried movements, till our faces were on the same level, just a foot apart. \"Please forgive me,\" he said formally. \"I can control myself. You caught me off guard. But I'm on my best behavior now.\" He waited, but I still couldn't speak. \"I'm not thirsty today, honestly.\" He winked. At that I had to laugh, though the sound was shaky and breathless. \"Are you all right?\" he asked tenderly, reaching out slowly, carefully, to place his marble hand back in mine. I looked at his smooth, cold hand, and then at his eyes. They were soft, repentant. I looked back at his hand, and then deliberately returned to tracing the lines in his hand with my fingertip. I looked up and smiled timidly. His answering smile was dazzling. \"So where were we, before I behaved so rudely?\" he asked in the gentle cadences of an earlier century. \"I honestly can't remember.\" He smiled, but his face was ashamed. \"I think we were talking about why you were afraid, besides the obvious reason.\" \"Oh, right.\" \"Well?\" I looked down at his hand and doodled aimlessly across his smooth, iridescent palm. The seconds ticked by. \"How easily frustrated I am,\" he sighed. I looked into his eyes, abruptly grasping that this was every bit as new to him as it was to me. As many years of unfathomable experience as he had, this was hard for him, too. I took courage from that thought. \"I was afraid\u2026 because, for, well, obvious reasons, I can't stay with you. And I'm afraid that I'd like to stay with you, much more than I should.\" I looked down at his hands as I spoke. It was difficult for me to say this aloud. \"Yes,\" he agreed slowly. \"That is something to be afraid of, indeed. Wanting to be with me. That's really not in your best interest.\" I frowned. \"I should have left long ago,\" he sighed. \"I should leave now. But I don't know if I can.\" \"I don't want you to leave,\" I mumbled pathetically, staring down again. \"Which is exactly why I should. But don't worry. I'm essentially a selfish creature. I crave your company too much to do what I should.\" \"I'm glad.\" \"Don't be!\" He withdrew his hand, more gently this time; his voice was harsher than usual. Harsh for him, still more beautiful than any human voice. It was hard to keep up \u2014 his sudden mood changes left me always a step behind, dazed. \"It's not only your company I crave! Never forget that. Never forget I am more dangerous to you than I am to anyone else.\" He stopped, and I looked to see him gazing unseeingly into the forest. I thought for a moment. \"I don't think I understand exactly what you mean \u2014 by that last part anyway,\" I said. He looked back at me and smiled, his mood shifting yet again. \"How do I explain?\" he mused. \"And without frightening you again\u2026 hmmmm.\" Without seeming to think about it, he placed his hand back in mine; I held it tightly in both of mine. He looked at our hands. \"That's amazingly pleasant, the warmth.\" He sighed. A moment passed as he assembled his thoughts. \"You know how everyone enjoys different flavors?\" he began. \"Some people love chocolate ice cream, others prefer strawberry?\" I nodded. \"Sorry about the food analogy \u2014 I couldn't think of another way to explain.\" I smiled. He smiled ruefully back. \"You see, every person smells different, has a different essence. If you locked an alcoholic in a room full of stale beer, he'd gladly drink it. But he could resist, if he wished to, if he were a recovering alcoholic. Now let's say you placed in that room a glass of hundred-year-old brandy, the rarest, finest cognac \u2014 and filled the room with its warm aroma \u2014 how do you think he would fare then?\" We sat silently, looking into each other's eyes \u2014 trying to read each other's thoughts. He broke the silence first. \"Maybe that's not the right comparison. Maybe it would be too easy to turn down the brandy. Perhaps I should have made our alcoholic a heroin addict instead.\" \"So what you're saying is, I'm your brand of heroin?\" I teased, trying to lighten the mood. He smiled swiftly, seeming to appreciate my effort. \"Yes, you are exactly my brand of heroin.\" \"Does that happen often?\" I asked. He looked across the treetops, thinking through his response. \"I spoke to my brothers about it.\" He still stared into the distance. \"To Jasper, every one of you is much the same. He's the most recent to join our family. It's a struggle for him to abstain at all. He hasn't had time to grow sensitive to the differences in smell, in flavor.\" He glanced swiftly at me, his expression apologetic. \"Sorry,\" he said. \"I don't mind. Please don't worry about offending me, or frightening me, or whichever. That's the way you think. I can understand, or I can try to at least. Just explain however you can.\" He took a deep breath and gazed at the sky again. \"So Jasper wasn't sure if he'd ever come across someone who was as\" \u2014 he hesitated, looking for the right word \u2014 \"appealing as you are to me.\u00a0 Which makes me think not. Emmett has been on the wagon longer, so to speak, and he understood what I meant. He says twice, for him, once stronger than the other.\" \"And for you?\" \"Never.\" The word hung there for a moment in the warm breeze. \"What did Emmett do?\" I asked to break the silence. It was the wrong question to ask. His face grew dark, his hand clenched into a fist inside mine. He looked away. I waited, but he wasn't going to answer. \"I guess I know,\" I finally said. He lifted his eyes; his expression was wistful, pleading. \"Even the strongest of us fall off the wagon, don't we?\" \"What are you asking? My permission?\" My voice was sharper than I'd intended. I tried to make my tone kinder \u2014 I could guess what his honesty must cost him. \"I mean, is there no hope, then?\" How calmly I could discuss my own death! \"No, no!\" He was instantly contrite. \"Of course there's hope! I mean, of course I won't\u2026\" He left the sentence hanging. His eyes burned into mine. \"It's different for us. Emmett\u2026 these were strangers he happened across. It was a long time ago, and he wasn't as\u2026 practiced, as careful, as he is now.\" He fell silent and watched me intently as I thought it through. \"So if we'd met\u2026 oh, in a dark alley or something\u2026\" I trailed off. \"It took everything I had not to jump up in the middle of that class full of children and \u2014\" He stopped abruptly, looking away. \"When you walked past me, I could have ruined everything Carlisle has built for us, right then and there. If I hadn't been denying my thirst for the last, well, too many years, I wouldn't have been able to stop myself.\" He paused, scowling at the trees. He glanced at me grimly, both of us remembering. \"You must have thought I was possessed.\" \"I couldn't understand why. How you could hate me so quickly\u2026\" \"To me, it was like you were some kind of demon, summoned straight from my own personal hell to ruin me. The fragrance coming off your skin\u2026 I thought it would make me deranged that first day. In that one hour, I thought of a hundred different ways to lure you from the room with me, to get you alone. And I fought them each back, thinking of my family, what I could do to them. I had to run out, to get away before I could speak the words that would make you follow\u2026\" He looked up then at my staggered expression as I tried to absorb his bitter memories. His golden eyes scorched from under his lashes, hypnotic and deadly. \"You would have come,\" he promised. I tried to speak calmly. \"Without a doubt.\" He frowned down at my hands, releasing me from the force of his stare. \"And then, as I tried to rearrange my schedule in a pointless attempt to avoid you, you were there \u2014 in that close, warm little room, the scent was maddening. I so very nearly took you then. There was only one other frail human there \u2014 so easily dealt with.\" I shivered in the warm sun, seeing my memories anew through his eyes, only now grasping the danger. Poor Ms. Cope; I shivered again at how close I'd come to being inadvertently responsible for her death. \"But I resisted. I don't know how. I forced myself not to wait for you, not to follow you from the school. It was easier outside, when I couldn't smell you anymore, to think clearly, to make the right decision. I left the others near home \u2014 I was too ashamed to tell them how weak I was, they only knew something was very wrong \u2014 and then I went straight to Carlisle, at the hospital, to tell him I was leaving.\" I stared in surprise.  \"I traded cars with him \u2014 he had a full tank of gas and I didn't want to stop. I didn't dare to go home, to face Esme. She wouldn't have let me go without a scene. She would have tried to convince me that it wasn't necessary\u2026 \"By the next morning I was in Alaska.\" He sounded ashamed, as if admitting a great cowardice. \"I spent two days there, with some old acquaintances\u2026 but I was homesick. I hated knowing I'd upset Esme, and the rest of them, my adopted family. In the pure air of the mountains it was hard to believe you were so irresistible. I convinced myself it was weak to run away. I'd dealt with temptation before, not of this magnitude, not even close, but I was strong. Who were you, an insignificant little girl\" \u2014 he grinned suddenly \u2014 \"to chase me from the place I wanted to be? So I came back\u2026\" He stared off into space. I couldn't speak. \"I took precautions, hunting, feeding more than usual before seeing you again. I was sure that I was strong enough to treat you like any other human. I was arrogant about it. \"It was <em>unquestionably</em> a complication that I couldn't simply read your thoughts to know what your reaction was to me. I wasn't used to having to go to such circuitous measures, listening to your words in Jessica's mind\u2026 her mind isn't very original, and it was annoying to have to stoop to that. And then I couldn't know if you really meant what you said. It was all extremely irritating.\" He frowned at the memory. \"I wanted you to forget my behavior that first day, if possible, so I tried to talk with you like I would with any person. I was eager actually, hoping to decipher some of your thoughts. But you were too interesting, I found myself caught up in your expressions\u2026 and every now and then you would stir the air with your hand or your hair, and the scent would stun me again\u2026 \"Of course, then you were nearly crushed to death in front of my eyes. Later I thought of a perfectly good excuse for why I acted at that moment \u2014 because if I hadn't saved you, if your blood had been spilled there in front of me, I don't think I could have stopped myself from exposing us for what we are. But I only thought of that excuse later. At the time, all I could think was, 'Not her.'\" He closed his eyes, lost in his agonized confession. I listened, more eager than rational. Common sense told me I should be terrified. Instead, I was relieved to finally understand. And I was filled with compassion for his suffering, even now, as he confessed his craving to take my life. I finally was able to speak, though my voice was faint. \"In the hospital?\" His eyes flashed up to mine. \"I was appalled. I couldn't believe I had put us in danger after all, put myself in your power \u2014 you of all people. As if I needed another motive to kill you.\"  We both flinched as that word slipped out. \"But it had the opposite effect,\" he continued quickly. \"I fought with Rosalie, Emmett, and Jasper when they suggested that now was the time\u2026 the worst fight we've ever had. Carlisle sided with me, and Alice.\" He grimaced when he said her name. I couldn't imagine why. \"Esme told me to do whatever I had to in order to stay.\" He shook his head indulgently. \"All that next day I eavesdropped on the minds of everyone you spoke to, shocked that you kept your word. I didn't understand you at all. But I knew that I couldn't become more involved with you. I did my very best to stay as far from you as possible. And every day the perfume of your skin, your breath, your hair\u2026 it hit me as hard as the very first day.\" He met my eyes again, and they were surprisingly tender. \"And for all that,\" he continued, \"I'd have fared better if I had exposed us all at that first moment, than if now, here \u2014 with no witnesses and nothing to stop me \u2014 I were to hurt you.\" I was human enough to have to ask. \"Why?\" \"Isabella.\" He pronounced my full name carefully, then playfully ruffled my hair with his free hand. A shock ran through my body at his casual touch. \"Bella, I couldn't live with myself if I ever hurt you. You don't know how it's tortured me.\" He looked down, ashamed again. \"The thought of you, still, white, cold\u2026 to never see you blush scarlet again, to never see that flash of intuition in your eyes when you see through my pretenses\u2026 it would be unendurable.\" He lifted his glorious, agonized eyes to mine. \"You are the most important thing to me now. The most important thing to me ever.\" My head was spinning at the rapid change in direction our conversation had taken. From the cheerful topic of my impending demise, we were suddenly declaring ourselves. He waited, and even though I looked down to study our hands between us, I knew his golden eyes were on me.  \"You already know how I feel, of course,\" I finally said. \"I'm here\u2026 which, roughly translated, means I would rather die than stay away from you.\" I frowned. \"I'm an idiot.\" \"You are an idiot,\" he agreed with a laugh. Our eyes met, and I laughed, too. We laughed together at the idiocy and sheer impossibility of such a moment. \"And so the lion fell in love with the lamb\u2026\" he murmured. I looked away, hiding my eyes as I thrilled to the word. \"What a stupid lamb,\" I sighed. \"What a sick, masochistic lion.\" He stared into the shadowy forest for a long moment, and I wondered where his thoughts had taken him. \"Why\u2026 ?\" I began, and then paused, not sure how to continue. He looked at me and smiled; sunlight glinted off his face, his teeth.  \"Yes?\" \"Tell me why you ran from me before.\" His smile faded. \"You know why.\" \"No, I mean, exactly what did I do wrong? I'll have to be on my guard, you see, so I better start learning what I shouldn't do. This, for example\" \u2014 I stroked the back of his hand \u2014 \"seems to be all right.\" He smiled again. \"You didn't do anything wrong, Bella. It was my fault.\" \"But I want to help, if I can, to not make this harder for you.\" \"Well\u2026\" He contemplated for a moment. \"It was just how close you were. Most humans instinctively shy away from us, are repelled by our alienness\u2026 I wasn't expecting you to come so close. And the smell of your throat.\" He stopped short, looking to see if he'd upset me. \"Okay, then,\" I said flippantly, trying to alleviate the suddenly tense atmosphere. I tucked my chin. \"No throat exposure.\" It worked; he laughed. \"No, really, it was more the surprise than anything else.\" He raised his free hand and placed it gently on the side of my neck. I sat very still, the chill of his touch a natural warning \u2014 a warning telling me to be terrified. But there was no feeling of fear in me. There were, however, other feelings\u2026 \"You see,\" he said. \"Perfectly fine.\" My blood was racing, and I wished I could slow it, sensing that this must make everything so much more difficult \u2014 the thudding of my pulse in my veins. Surely he could hear it. \"The blush on your cheeks is lovely,\" he murmured. He gently freed his other hand. My hands fell limply into my lap. Softly he brushed my cheek, then held my face between his marble hands. \"Be very still,\" he whispered, as if I wasn't already frozen. Slowly, never moving his eyes from mine, he leaned toward me. Then abruptly, but very gently, he rested his cold cheek against the hollow at the base of my throat. I was quite unable to move, even if I'd wanted to. I listened to the sound of his even breathing, watching the sun and wind play in his bronze hair, more human than any other part of him. With deliberate slowness, his hands slid down the sides of my neck. I shivered, and I heard him catch his breath. But his hands didn't pause as they softly moved to my shoulders, and then stopped. His face drifted to the side, his nose skimming across my collarbone. He came to rest with the side of his face pressed tenderly against my chest. Listening to my heart. \"Ah,\" he sighed. I don't know how long we sat without moving. It could have been hours.  Eventually the throb of my pulse quieted, but he didn't move or speak again as he held me. I knew at any moment it could be too much, and my life could end \u2014 so quickly that I might not even notice. And I couldn't make myself be afraid. I couldn't think of anything, except that he was touching me. And then, too soon, he released me.  His eyes were peaceful. \"It won't be so hard again,\" he said with satisfaction. \"Was that very hard for you?\" \"Not nearly as bad as I imagined it would be. And you?\" \"No, it wasn't bad\u2026 for me.\" He smiled at my inflection. \"You know what I mean.\" I smiled. \"Here.\" He took my hand and placed it against his cheek. \"Do you feel how warm it is?\" And it was almost warm, his usually icy skin. But I barely noticed, for I was touching his face, something I'd dreamed of constantly since the first day I'd seen him. \"Don't move,\" I whispered. No one could be still like Edward. He closed his eyes and became as immobile as stone, a carving under my hand. I moved even more slowly than he had, careful not to make one unexpected move. I caressed his cheek, delicately stroked his eyelid, the purple shadow in the hollow under his eye. I traced the shape of his perfect nose, and then, so carefully, his flawless lips. His lips parted under my hand, and I could feel his cool breath on my fingertips. I wanted to lean in, to inhale the scent of him. So I dropped my hand and leaned away, not wanting to push him too far. He opened his eyes, and they were hungry. Not in a way to make me fear, but rather to tighten the muscles in the pit of my stomach and send my pulse hammering through my veins again. \"I wish,\" he whispered, \"I wish you could feel the\u2026 complexity\u2026 the confusion\u2026 I feel. That you could understand.\" He raised his hand to my hair, then carefully brushed it across my face. \"Tell me,\" I breathed. \"I don't think I can. I've told you, on the one hand, the hunger \u2014 the thirst \u2014 that, deplorable creature that I am, I feel for you. And I think you can understand that, to an extent. Though\" \u2014 he half-smiled \u2014 \"as you are not addicted to any illegal substances, you probably can't empathize completely. \"But\u2026\" His fingers touched my lips lightly, making me shiver again. \"There are other hungers. Hungers I don't even understand, that are foreign to me.\" \"I may understand that better than you think.\" \"I'm not used to feeling so human. Is it always like this?\" \"For me?\" I paused. \"No, never. Never before this.\" He held my hands between his. They felt so feeble in his iron strength. \"I don't know how to be close to you,\" he admitted. \"I don't know if I can.\" I leaned forward very slowly, cautioning him with my eyes. I placed my cheek against his stone chest. I could hear his breath, and nothing else. \"This is enough,\" I sighed, closing my eyes. In a very human gesture, he put his arms around me and pressed his face against my hair. \"You're better at this than you give yourself credit for,\" I noted. \"I have human instincts \u2014 they may be buried deep, but they're there.\" We sat like that for another immeasurable moment; I wondered if he could be as unwilling to move as I was. But I could see the light was fading, the shadows of the forest beginning to touch us, and I sighed. \"You have to go.\" \"I thought you couldn't read my mind.\" \"It's getting clearer.\" I could hear a smile in his voice. He took my shoulders and I looked into his face. \"Can I show you something?\" he asked, sudden excitement flaring in his eyes. \"Show me what?\" \"I'll show you how I travel in the forest.\" He saw my expression. \"Don't worry, you'll be very safe, and we'll get to your truck much faster.\" His mouth twitched up into that crooked smile so beautiful my heart nearly stopped. \"Will you turn into a bat?\" I asked warily. He laughed, louder than I'd ever heard. \"Like I haven't heard that one before!\" \"Right, I'm sure you get that all the time.\" \"Come on, little coward, climb on my back.\" I waited to see if he was kidding, but, apparently, he meant it. He smiled as he read my hesitation, and reached for me. My heart reacted; even though he couldn't hear my thoughts, my pulse always gave me away. He then proceeded to sling me onto his back, with very little effort on my part, besides, when in place, clamping my legs and arms so tightly around him that it would choke a normal person. It was like clinging to a stone. \"I'm a bit heavier than your average backpack,\" I warned.  \"Hah!\" he snorted. I could almost hear his eyes rolling. I'd never seen him in such high spirits before. He startled me, suddenly grabbing my hand, pressing my palm to his face, and inhaling deeply. \"Easier all the time,\" he muttered. And then he was running. If I'd ever feared death before in his presence, it was nothing compared to how I felt now. He streaked through the dark, thick underbrush of the forest like a bullet, like a ghost. There was no sound, no evidence that his feet touched the earth. His breathing never changed, never indicated any effort. But the trees flew by at deadly speeds, always missing us by inches. I was too terrified to close my eyes, though the cool forest air whipped against my face and burned them. I felt as if I were stupidly sticking my head out the window of an airplane in flight. And, for the first time in my life, I felt the dizzy faintness of motion sickness. Then it was over. We'd hiked hours this morning to reach Edward's meadow, and now, in a matter of minutes, we were back to the truck. \"Exhilarating, isn't it?\" His voice was high, excited. He stood motionless, waiting for me to climb down. I tried, but my muscles wouldn't respond. My arms and legs stayed locked around him while my head spun uncomfortably. \"Bella?\" he asked, anxious now. \"I think I need to lie down,\" I gasped. \"Oh, sorry.\" He waited for me, but I still couldn't move. \"I think I need help,\" I admitted. He laughed quietly, and gently unloosened my stranglehold on his neck. There was no resisting the iron strength of his hands. Then he pulled me around to face him, cradling me in his arms like a small child. He held me for a moment, then carefully placed me on the springy ferns. \"How do you feel?\" he asked. I couldn't be sure how I felt when my head was spinning so crazily. \"Dizzy, I think.\" \"Put your head between your knees.\" I tried that, and it helped a little. I breathed in and out slowly, keeping my head very still. I felt him sitting beside me. The moments passed, and eventually I found that I could raise my head. There was a hollow ringing sound in my ears. \"I guess that wasn't the best idea,\" he mused. I tried to be positive, but my voice was weak. \"No, it was very interesting.\" \"Hah! You're as white as a ghost \u2014 no, you're as white as me!\" \"I think I should have closed my eyes.\" \"Remember that next time.\" \"Next time!\" I groaned. He laughed, his mood still radiant. \"Show-off,\" I muttered. \"Open your eyes, Bella,\" he said quietly. And he was right there, his face so close to mine. His beauty stunned my mind \u2014 it was too much, an excess I couldn't grow accustomed to. \"I was thinking, while I was running\u2026\" He paused. \"About not hitting the trees, I hope.\" \"Silly Bella,\" he chuckled. \"Running is second nature to me, it's not something I have to think about.\" \"Show-off,\" I muttered again. He smiled. \"No,\" he continued, \"I was thinking there was something I wanted to try.\" And he took my face in his hands again. I couldn't breathe. He hesitated \u2014 not in the normal way, the human way. Not the way a man might hesitate before he kissed a woman, to gauge her reaction, to see how he would be received. Perhaps he would hesitate to prolong the moment, that ideal moment of anticipation, sometimes better than the kiss itself. Edward hesitated to test himself, to see if this was safe, to make sure he was still in control of his need. And then his cold, marble lips pressed very softly against mine. What neither of us was prepared for was my response. Blood boiled under my skin, burned in my lips. My breath came in a wild gasp. My fingers knotted in his hair, clutching him to me. My lips parted as I breathed in his heady scent. Immediately I felt him turn to unresponsive stone beneath my lips. His hands gently, but with irresistible force, pushed my face back. I opened my eyes and saw his guarded expression. \"Oops,\" I breathed. \"That's an understatement.\" His eyes were wild, his jaw clenched in acute restraint, yet he didn't lapse from his perfect articulation. He held my face just inches from his. He dazzled my eyes. \"Should I\u2026 ?\" I tried to disengage myself, to give him some room. His hands refused to let me move so much as an inch. \"No, it's tolerable. Wait for a moment, please.\" His voice was polite, controlled. I kept my eyes on his, watched as the excitement in them faded and gentled. Then he smiled a surprisingly impish grin. \"There,\" he said, obviously pleased with himself. \"Tolerable?\" I asked. He laughed aloud. \"I'm stronger than I thought. It's nice to know.\" \"I wish I could say the same. I'm sorry.\" \"You are only human, after all.\" \"Thanks so much,\" I said, my voice acerbic. He was on his feet in one of his lithe, almost invisibly quick movements. He held out his hand to me, an unexpected gesture. I was so used to our standard of careful non-contact. I took his icy hand, needing the support more than I thought. My balance had not yet returned. \"Are you still faint from the run? Or was it my kissing expertise?\" How lighthearted, how human he seemed as he laughed now, his seraphic face untroubled. He was a different Edward than the one I had known. And I felt all the more besotted by him. It would cause me physical pain to be separated from him now. \"I can't be sure, I'm still woozy,\" I managed to respond. \"I think it's some of both, though.\" \"Maybe you should let me drive.\" \"Are you insane?\" I protested. \"I can drive better than you on your best day,\" he teased. \"You have much slower reflexes.\" \"I'm sure that's true, but I don't think my nerves, or my truck, could take it.\" \"Some trust, please, Bella.\" My hand was in my pocket, curled tightly around the key. I pursed my lips, deliberated, then shook my head with a tight grin. \"Nope. Not a chance.\" He raised his eyebrows in disbelief. I started to step around him, heading for the driver's side. He might have let me pass if I hadn't wobbled slightly. Then again, he might not have. His arm created an inescapable snare around my waist. \"Bella, I've already expended a great deal of personal effort at this point to keep you alive. I'm not about to let you behind the wheel of a vehicle when you can't even walk straight. Besides, friends don't let friends drive drunk,\" he quoted with a chuckle. I could smell the unbearably sweet fragrance coming off his chest. \"Drunk?\" I objected. \"You're intoxicated by my very presence.\" He was grinning that playful smirk again. \"I can't argue with that,\" I sighed.; I couldn't resist him in anything. I held the key high and dropped it, watching his hand flash like lightning to catch it soundlessly. \"Take it easy \u2014 my truck is a senior citizen.\" \"Very sensible,\" he approved. \"And are you not affected at all?\" I asked, irked. \"By my presence?\" Again his mobile features transformed, his expression became soft, warm. He didn't answer at first; he simply bent his face to mine, and brushed his lips slowly along my jaw, from my ear to my chin, back and forth. I trembled. \"Regardless,\" he finally murmured, \"I have better reflexes.\"",
