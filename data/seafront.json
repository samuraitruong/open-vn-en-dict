About 100,000 homes were evacuated on the southern Chinese island of Hainan as Typhoon Nesat threatened to cause landslides.  Fishing boats in northern Vietnam have been ordered to return to port as the storm approaches.  The typhoon killed at least 39 people in the Philippines. The Chinese authorities on Hainan island called boats back to port, suspended flights and ferry services, and closed schools. Typhoon Nesat made landfall in Hainan's Wenchang city, packing winds of up to 150 km/h (93 mph). The typhoon forced the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and most businesses and schools there to close on Thursday as it swept past the territory, bringing howling winds, torrential rain and rough seas. All ferry and some bus services were cancelled, and trains operated at a reduced frequency.  There were few people on the streets, with 100km/h winds shredding umbrellas and making it hard to walk. Local radio reported that two people, including a taxi driver, were injured when scaffolding collapsed onto a taxi. And a large cargo barge crashed into the <em>seafront</em> after slipping its moorings, television footage showed. About 50 people had to be evacuated from a nearby block of flats. Neighbouring Macau was also affected, with schools and businesses closed. But the city's glittering casinos remained open for the tourists who managed to get there. \u00a0",
