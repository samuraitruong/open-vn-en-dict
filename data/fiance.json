Clark, 24, works as an animal tech in the lab where Le was found dead on Sunday. Police found the 24-year-old pharmacology student's body stuffed in a wall in the lab on Sunday - what would have been her wedding day. Police are looking for Clark, who was not home Tuesday as swarms of cops descended on his apartment about 20 miles from Yale's campus. Clark did not show up for work - and neither did his sister, brother-in-law or <em>fiance</em>, all of whom work for Yale, the Yale Daily News reports. Police zeroed in on the lab tech several days ago, after he failed lie detector tests and had scratch marks on his chest that suggest he was in a struggle. Cops and FBI agents interviewed Clark several times. At one point he stopped answering questions and asked for a lawyer, the New Haven Register reported. New Haven Police spokesman Joe Avery had said Tuesday morning he hoped an arrest would be made by 1 p.m., but later changed course, saying, \"As of right, now we have nobody in custody and there is no anticipated arrest as of today.\" Police set up road blocks along Route 15 in the nearby town of Hamden. They stopped cars to look at passenger's faces. Neighbors say they saw Clark and his girlfriend, Jennifer Hromadka, leaving with suitcases on Sunday around the time cops found Le's body. \"I saw them leaving this weekend with travel bags like they were in a hurry,\" said a 35-year-old neighbor who lives in the same Middletown apartment building She and another neighbor said the couple climbed in the back seat of a Ford that had two adults in the front. \"I thought they were going on vacation,\" the neighbor said. A woman who knew Clark when he lived in New Haven last year said he \"looked like he could snap\" at any moment, screamed at children and was \"very controlling\" of his girlfriend. \"Something was wrong in his eyes. He looked disturbed.\", said Anne Marie Goodwin, 40.  \"Ray was very controlling of his girlfriend,\" she said. \"He would never let her talk to anyone. I would hear a lot of yelling up stairs.\" Clark lives with his girlfriend and the couple share a MySpace page. Hromadka writes extensively about her \"wonderful boyfriend Ray.\" \"I love hanging out with Ray's family (he has a great one) and playing with [his sister] Denise and [her husband] Shawn's Adorable kids, Caleb and Brielle.\" In May, 2008, she blogged about a rumor that Clark was cheating on her with a girl in his Yale lab. \"My boyfriend, Ray, if you don't know him, has no interest in any of the other girls at YARC as anything more than friends,\" she wrote, referring to the Yale Animal Resource Center. \"He is a bit naive, doesn't always use the best judgement, definitely is not the best judge of character but, he is a good guy,\" she wrote. \"He has a big heart and tries to see the best in people ALL THE TIME! even when everyone else is telling him that the person is a psycho or that the person can't be trusted. \"He thinks everyone deserves a second chance and has a hard time hurting peoples feelings\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 Her most recent entry, written on Friday, says: \"Who are you to judge the life I live? I  know I'm not perfect and I don't live to be, but before you start pointing fingers at somebody make sure your hands are clean!!\u00e2\u20ac\u009d",
