            "en": "10 Bizarre Home Cures That Really Work         Of course there are some health staples you should never be without - bandages or OTC pain relievers come to mind. But you can treat or cure a surprising number of minor ailments with these unexpected household objects and foods. Next time you burn your tongue on piping hot pizza or come down with an unshakeable case of hiccups, keep these tips from The Big Doctors Book of Home Remedies in mind: Home cure: Vodka Use it for: Foot odor If your feet smell less than swell, wipe them down with a vodka-soaked washcloth to get rid of the stench. It\u2019s the same principle as rubbing alcohol (which works equally well if you\u2019d rather drink your Grey Goose). Vodka contains alcohol, which is antiseptic and drying, so it destroys odor-causing fungus and bacteria and dries out the moisture that lets these organisms grow.  Home cure: Pencil Use it for: Headaches When you\u2019re stressed or anxious, you subconsciously clench your jaw and teeth; this strains the muscle that connects your jaw to your temples and can trigger a tension headache. A solution: \u201cPut a pencil between your teeth but don\u2019t bite,\u201d says Fred Sheftell, M.D., director of the New England Center for Headache in Stamford, Conn. You automatically relax your jaw muscle to do this, which can prevent the pain. Home cure: Yogurt Use it for: Bad breath Preliminary research shows that the live bacteria in yogurt can suppress levels of bad breath\u2013causing bacteria. \u201cGood\u201d bugs in yogurt may crowd out the \u201cbad\u201d stink-causing bacteria or create an unhealthy environment for it, says John C. Moon, DDS, a cosmetic and general dentist in Half Moon Bay, Calif. Home cure: Listerine Use it for: Blisters The classic breath freshener\u2014and powerful antiseptic\u2014can also do a number on blisters. Moisten a cotton ball with Listerine and dab it on your blister three times a day until the area dries out and no longer hurts, says Janet Maccaro, Ph.D., CNC, a holistic nutritionist and certified nutrition consultant in Scottsdale, Ariz. Home cure: Tennis ball Use it for: Achy feet For an easy, free mini massage that stretches and soothes your feet, slip off your shoes and roll each foot over a tennis ball, golf ball or soup can for a minute or two. To cool throbbing feet, roll them over a bottle of frozen water.  Home cure: Sugar Use it for: Hiccups A teaspoon of sugar swallowed dry can stop hiccups in minutes. The sugar is believed to modify the nerve muscles that would otherwise tell the muscles in the diaphragm to contract spasmodically and contribute to hiccups.  Home cure: Olives or lemons Use it for: Motion sickness Motion sickness causes you to produce excess saliva, which can make you nauseated, some doctors say. Compounds in olives called tannins dry out your mouth and can help soothe the queasies. Pop a couple at the first hint of nausea; sucking on a lemon or sipping a small amount of mint tea can also do the trick. Home cure: Vegetable oil Use it for: Brittle nails In order to really fix dry nails, you have to address the problem of too little moisture. In addition to using hand lotion regularly, try this nighttime treatment from dermatologist Dee Anna Glaser, M.D. Before you go to bed, apply vegetable oil to your hands, then put on vinyl gloves or wrap your hands in plastic wrap to keep the oil off your bedding. The hand coverings force the oil to penetrate your skin, preventing your hands and nails from getting too dry. Home cure: Peppermint or cinnamon gum Use it for: The stress of a traffic-packed commute  In a NASA-funded study, scientists from Wheeling Jesuit University monitored the responses of 25 college students during simulated driving scenarios. The volunteers reported that peppermint lowered their feelings of fatigue or anxiety by 20 percent. Peppermint and cinnamon each decreased frustration by 25 percent, increased <em>alertness</em> by 30 percent and made the ride seem 30 percent shorter. Not a gum or candy person? Buy peppermint or cinnamon aromatherapy diffusers for the car. Home cure: Apple Use it for: Whiter teeth Crunchy fruits and vegetables act as little toothbrushes when you chew them; they have a natural cleansing action that works on tooth enamel to remove stains. In particular, \u201capples have a gentle malic acid that also helps dissolve stains,\u201d says Jennifer Jabow, DDS, of Park 56 Dental in New York City.",

            "en": "Foods to boost male health    Lean red meat If you're a steak-and-potatoes kind of guy, you're in luck. Red meat can be good for you, says Leslie Bonci, MPH, RD, nutritional consultant to the Pittsburgh Steelers. Lean cuts of beef and pork are packed with protein and have only a little more fat than chicken breast. Red meat is also one of the best sources of leucine, an amino acid that helps build muscle. Tart cherries How do the Pittsburgh Steelers soothe sore muscles? Cherry juice. Bonci says she keeps some in their training room at all times. \"The pigment in cherries and cherry juice mimics the effects of some anti-inflammatory medicines,\" she tells WebMD. \"And there are no side effects.\" Chocolate Chocolate may improve blood flow - if you eat the right kind. Studies suggest the flavanols in dark chocolate may curb levels of bad cholesterol, improve circulation, and keep blood pressure in check. Men with poor blood flow are more likely to develop erectile dysfunction, so heart-wise foods may protect your sex life, too. But too much chocolate can lead to weight gain. Bonci suggests eating one ounce a day in lieu of other sweets. Shellfish Shellfish and other types of seafood are rich in zinc, which is critically important for the heart, muscles, and reproductive system. Research has linked zinc deficiency to poor sperm quality and male infertility. If you're not a seafood fan, nuts and seeds provide an excellent alternative for stocking up on zinc. Avocado Sure, avocado is high in fat - but it's the \"good\" kind. The monounsaturated fat found in avocados replaces saturated or trans fats in your diet. It can knock down levels of total cholesterol and \"bad\" cholesterol (LDL), as no more than 25%-35% of your daily calories come from all types of fat. Olive oil and nuts also contain good fats. Fatty fish Fatty fish, like salmon or halibut, are another excellent source of healthy fat. They contain a special type known as omega-3 fatty acids, which protect against heart disease, some cancers, and arthritis. Studies suggest two servings of fatty fish per week can lower your chances of dying from heart disease. Ginger Like cherries, ginger may have anti-inflammatory properties that come in handy when you push yourself too hard. Research suggests eating ginger regularly may help reduce the pain of exercise-related muscle injuries. Milk and yogurt The whey in milk and yogurt is another source of leucine, the muscle-building amino acid. Bonci recommends Greek yogurt. \"It has a thicker consistency that men may like better,\" she says. It's also packed with protein, potassium, and friendly bacteria that keep the gut healthy. \"Plus, it requires no preparation whatsoever.\" Bananas The banana is celebrated for its bounty of potassium. Potassium is critically important in muscle contractions and bone health, Bonci says. It also helps blood pressure. In fact, getting enough potassium may be as important as reducing sodium when it comes to lowering blood pressure.  Pistachios Nuts provide protein, fiber, and zinc while satisfying the urge for a crunchy, salty snack. Pistachios stand out because they're higher in plant sterols that can improve cholesterol levels, Bonci says. She recommends eating them from the shell, so you work harder for each one. That will help control how many you eat - otherwise, the calories add up quickly. Brazil nuts A single ounce of Brazil nuts has seven times the recommended daily value of selenium. It was previously thought that selenium might ward off prostate cancer. Unfortunately, a large study by the National Institutes of Health found no such benefit from selenium supplements. Selenium does have other health benefits, though - it may help boost the immune system and promote healthy thyroid function. Tomato Sauce Tomatoes are rich in lycopene, a potent antioxidant that may protect against some cancers. Some research suggests that men who eat tomato sauce regularly are less likely to get prostate cancer, but not all studies support this. Bonci says tomatoes provide a variety of plant nutrients. Adding salsa to a burrito or tomato sauce to pasta is an easy way to make a meal more nutritious. Soy foods According to a study of more than 40 nations, the food that may offer the strongest protection against prostate cancer is soy. This includes tofu, miso soup, and soy milk. In Asian countries, people eat up to 90 times more soy foods than Americans eat. And prostate cancer is far less common in those countries. Mixed vegetables Vegetables are packed with phytochemicals, plant-based nutrients that boost cell health and protect against cancer. There are many different types of phytochemicals, and the best way to get a variety of them is to eat different colored veggies. \"There should be color on your plate at every meal,\" Bonci says.  Orange vegetables Orange vegetables are an excellent source of beta-carotene, lutein, and vitamin C. These nutrients lower your odds of developing an enlarged prostate, according to a large study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. Good choices include red bell peppers, carrots, pumpkins, and sweet potatoes. Leafy green vegetables Spinach, collard greens, and kale can benefit the eyes as well as the prostate. These leafy green vegetables are rich in lutein and zeaxanthin. Both nutrients protect against cataracts and age-related macular degeneration, a chronic eye disease that impairs vision.  Baked Potato Baked potatoes are hearty and easy to make. They're also surprisingly high in vitamin C, an antioxidant that works against free radicals in the body. These normal byproducts of our metabolism become damaging at high levels and are linked to the development of cancer, heart disease, even arthritis. Go easy on the butter, or top with salsa and reduced-fat cheese. Other sources of vitamin C include green peppers, kiwi, and citrus fruits. Eggs Eggs provide lutein, protein, and iron - but you have to eat the whole egg. \"Even though the yolk is a source of cholesterol, it has half the protein and most of the flavor,\" Bonci says. She recommends cutting back on high-cholesterol sweets to make room for whole eggs in your diet. If you have high cholesterol, ask your doctor if you should limit how many eggs you eat per week. High-fiber cereal Fiber may not sound manly, but it's a performance enhancer, Bonci says. Whether you're an executive or an athlete, you can't concentrate on your goals if your gut is acting up. Fiber helps keep your digestive system running smoothly, and it benefits the heart, too. This doesn't mean you have to give up your favorite cereal - just try mixing in some shredded wheat. \"Don't deprive yourself,\" Bonci advises, \"but add something good.\" Brown Rice Brown rice is another great source of fiber, and it's easy to dress up with nutritious, colorful food. Try adding lean meat, baby spinach, and pineapple. If you don't like the texture, mix some white rice in with the brown. There's good evidence that brown rice and other whole-grain foods can help you maintain a healthy body weight, while reducing the risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Berries \"Berries can help you be on top of your game mentally as well as physically,\" Bonci says. They're loaded with antioxidants that may reduce the risk of various types of cancer. Animal studies suggest blueberries can also enhance memory and brain function. Similar research in people is in its infancy, but looks promising. When fresh berries are expensive or tough to find, try buying them frozen and making a shake. Coffee When you need a pick-me-up, recommends making a good cup of joe. Research shows it can enhance <em>alertness</em>, and plain coffee has almost no calories. This makes it a far better choice than expensive, high-calorie energy drinks. Focus on the good stuff When making changes to your diet, Bonci suggests adding good foods rather than denying yourself bad ones. As you get used to eating more fruits, vegetables, lean meats, and whole grains, these foods may come to replace some of the less healthy choices. Bonci offers a sports metaphor to sum up the benefits: you'll play better today and stay in the game longer.",

            "en": "Looking at your newborn - What\u2019s normal    general appearance of newborns In delivery room scenes on TV and in the movies, the mother-to-be, often a famous actress in full makeup and with every hair in place, \"delivers\" a baby after a few token grunts and groans. Seconds later, the doctor presents the glowing parents with a perfect picture - a neatly combed and scrubbed, cooing several-month-old infant. Contrast that picture with how a baby really looks just after emerging from the womb: bluish, covered with blood and cream-cheesy glop, and looking as though the little one has just been in a fist-fight. Remember that the fetus develops immersed in fluid, folded up in an increasingly cramped space inside the uterus. The whole process usually culminates with the baby being pushed forcibly through a narrow, bone-walled birth canal, sometimes requiring the assistance of metal forceps or suction devices. Still, it helps to remember two things: 1. Usually, the features that may make a normal newborn look strange are temporary.  2. In the eyes of the adoring parent, every infant looks like the perfect baby anyway.  When you first get to see, touch, and inspect your newborn may depend on the type of delivery, your condition, and the condition of your baby. Following an uncomplicated vaginal delivery, you should have the opportunity to hold your baby within minutes after the birth. Bonding In most cases, infants seem to be in a state of quiet <em>alertness</em> during the first hour or so after delivery. It's a great time for you and your newborn to get acquainted and begin the bonding process. But don't despair if circumstances prevent you from meeting your infant right away. You'll have plenty of quality time together soon, and there's no scientific evidence that the delay will affect your infant's health, behavior, or relationship with you over the long run. During the first several weeks, you'll notice that much of the time your baby will tend to keep his or her fists clenched, elbows bent, hips and knees flexed, and arms and legs held close to the front of his or her body. This position is similar to the fetal position during the last months of pregnancy. Infants who are born prematurely may display several differences in their posture, appearance, activity, and behavior compared with full-term newborns. Primitive Reflexes Infants are born with a number of instinctual responses to stimuli, such as light or touch, known as primitive reflexes, which gradually disappear as the baby matures. These reflexes include the: * sucking reflex, which triggers an infant to forcibly suck on any object put in the mouth  * grasp reflex, which causes an infant to tightly close the fingers when pressure is applied to the inside of the infant's hand by a finger or other object  * Moro reflex, or startle response, which causes an infant to suddenly throw the arms out to the sides and then quickly bring them back toward the middle of the body whenever the infant has been startled by a loud noise, bright light, strong smell, sudden movement, or other stimulus  Also, due to the immaturity of their developing nervous systems, young infants' arms, legs, and chins may tremble or shake, particularly when they're crying or agitated. Sleeping and Breathing Patterns In the first weeks, infants usually spend most of their time sleeping. This may be even more exaggerated during the first day or two of life in newborns whose mothers received certain types of pain medications or anesthesia during the labor or delivery. Frequently, new parents become concerned about their newborn's breathing pattern, particularly with the increased attention that sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) has received in recent years. But rest assured that it's normal for young infants to breathe somewhat irregularly. When an infant is awake, his or her breathing rate may vary widely, sometimes exceeding 60 breaths per minute, particularly when the little one is excited or following a bout of crying. Newborns will also commonly have periods during which they stop breathing for about 5 to 10 seconds and then start up again on their own. This is known as periodic breathing, which is more likely to occur during sleep and is considered very normal. However, if your infant turns blue or stops breathing for longer stretches of time, it's considered an emergency and you should contact your child's doctor immediately or go to the emergency room. Head Because the infant's head is usually the first part through the birth canal, it can be affected by the delivery process. The newborn's skull is made up of several separate bones that will eventually fuse together. This situation permits the large head of the infant to be squeezed through the narrow birth canal without injury to mother or baby. The heads of infants born by vaginal delivery often show some degree of molding, which is when the skull bones shift and overlap, making the top of the infant's head look elongated, stretched out, or even pointed at birth. This sometimes bizarre appearance will go away over the next several days as the skull bones move into a more rounded configuration. The heads of babies born by cesarean section or breech (buttocks or feet first) delivery usually don't show molding. Because of the separation of your newborn's skull bones, you'll be able to feel (go ahead, you won't harm anything) two fontanels, or soft spots, on the top of the head. The larger one, located toward the front of the head, is diamond-shaped and usually about 1 to 3 inches wide. A smaller, triangle-shaped fontanel is found farther back on the head, where a beanie might be worn. Don't be alarmed if you see the fontanels bulge out when the infant cries or if they seem to move up and down in time with the baby's heartbeat. This is perfectly normal. The fontanels will eventually disappear as the skull bones close together \u2014 usually in about 12 to 18 months for the front fontanel and in about 6 months for the one in back. In addition to looking elongated, a newborn's head may have a lump or two as a result of the trauma of delivery. Caput succedaneum is a circular swelling and bruising of the scalp usually seen on top of the head toward the back, which is the part of the scalp most often leading the way through the birth canal. This will fade over a few days. A cephalohematoma is a symptom of blood that has seeped under the outer covering membrane of one of the skull bones. This is usually caused during birth by the pressure of the head against the mother's pelvic bones. The lump is confined to one side of the top of the baby's head and, in contrast to caput succedaneum, may take a week or two to disappear. The cephalohematoma may cause these infants to become somewhat more jaundiced than others during the first week of life. It's important to remember that both caput succedaneum and cephalohematoma occur due to trauma outside of the skull \u2014 neither indicates that there has been any injury to the infant's brain. Face A newborn's face may look quite puffy due to fluid accumulation and the rough trip through the birth canal. The infant's facial appearance often changes significantly during the first few days as the baby gets rid of the extra fluid and the trauma of delivery subsides. That's why the photos you take of your baby later on at home usually look a lot different than those \"new arrival\" nursery shots. In some cases, a newborn's facial features can be quite distorted as a result of positioning in the uterus and the squeeze through the birth canal. Not to worry \u2014 that folded ear, flattened nose, or crooked jaw usually comes back into place over time. Eyes A few minutes after birth, most infants open their eyes and start to look around at their environment. Newborns can see, but they probably don't focus well at first, which is why their eyes may seem out of line or crossed at times during the first 2 to 3 months. Because of the puffiness of their eyelids, some infants may not be able to open their eyes wide right away. When holding your newborn, you can encourage eye opening by taking advantage of your baby's \"doll's eye\" reflex, which is a tendency to open the eyes more when held in an upright position. Parents are sometimes startled to see that the white part of one or both of their newborn's eyes appears blood-red. Called subconjunctival hemorrhage, this occurs when blood leaks under the covering of the eyeball due to the trauma of delivery. It's a harmless condition similar to a skin bruise that goes away after several days, and it generally doesn't indicate that there has been any damage to the infant's eyes. Parents are often curious to know what color eyes their infant will have. If a baby's eyes are brown at birth, they will remain so. This is the case for most black and Asian infants. Most white infants are born with bluish-gray eyes, but the pigmentation of the iris (the colored part of the eye) may progressively darken, usually not becoming their permanent color until about 3 to 6 months of age. Ears A newborn's ears, as well as other features, may be distorted by the position they were in while inside the uterus. Because the baby hasn't yet developed the thick cartilage that gives firm shape to an older child's ears, it isn't unusual for newborns to come out with temporarily folded or otherwise misshapen ears. Small tags of skin or pits (shallow holes) in the skin on the side of the face just in front of the ear are also common. Usually, these skin tags can be easily removed (talk to your doctor). Nose Because newborns tend to breathe through their noses and their nasal passages are narrow, small amounts of nasal fluid or mucus can cause them to breathe noisily or sound congested even when they don't have a cold or other problem. Talk with your doctor about the use of salt-water nose drops and a bulb syringe to help clear the nasal passages if necessary. Sneezing is also common in newborns. This is a normal reflex and isn't due to an infection, allergies, or other problems. Mouth When your newborn opens his or her mouth to yawn or cry, you may notice some small white spots on the roof of the mouth, usually near the center. These small collections of cells are called Epstein's pearls and, along with fluid-filled cysts sometimes present on the gums, will disappear during the first few weeks. Neck Yes .... Normally the neck looks short in newborns because it tends to get lost in the chubby cheeks and folds of skin. Chest Because an infant's chest wall is thin, you may easily feel or observe your baby's upper chest move with each heartbeat. This is normal and isn't a cause for concern. Also, both male and female newborns can have breast enlargement. This is due to the female hormone estrogen passed to the fetus from the mother during pregnancy. You may feel firm, disc-shaped lumps of tissue beneath the nipples and, occasionally, a small amount of milky fluid may be released from the nipples. The breast enlargement almost always disappears during the first few weeks. Despite what some parents believe, you shouldn't squeeze the breast tissue \u2014 it will not make the breasts shrink any faster than they will on their own. arms and legs Following birth, full-term newborns tend to assume a posture similar to what their position in the cramped uterus had been: arms and legs flexed and held close to their bodies. The hands are usually tightly closed, and it may be difficult for you to open them up because touching or placing an object in the palms triggers a strong grasp reflex. Fingernails Infants' fingernails can be long enough at birth to scratch their skin as they bring their hands to their faces. If this is the case, you can carefully trim your baby's nails with a pair of small scissors. Sometimes parents are concerned about the curved appearance of their newborn's feet and legs. But if you recall the usual position of the fetus in the womb during the final months of pregnancy \u2014 hips flexed and knees bent with the legs and feet crossed tightly up against the abdomen \u2014 it's no surprise that a newborn's legs and feet tend to curve inward. You can usually move your newborn's legs and feet into a \"walking\" position; and this will happen naturally as the infant begins to bear weight, walk, and grow through the first 2 to 3 years of life. Abdomen It's normal for a baby's abdomen (belly) to appear somewhat full and rounded. When your baby cries or strains, you may also note that the skin over the central area of the abdomen may protrude between the strips of muscle tissue making up the abdominal wall on either side. This almost always disappears during the next several months as the infant grows. Many parents are concerned about the appearance and care of their infant's umbilical cord. The cord contains three blood vessels (two arteries and a vein) encased in a jelly-like substance. Following delivery, the cord is clamped or tied off before it's cut to separate the infant from the placenta. The umbilical stump is then simply allowed to wither and drop off, which usually happens in about 10 days to 3 weeks.  You may be instructed to swab the area with alcohol periodically or wash the area with soap and water if the stump becomes dirty or sticky to help prevent infection until the cord dries up and the stump falls off. The baby's navel area shouldn't be submerged in water during bathing until this occurs. The withering cord will go through color changes, from yellow to brown or black \u2014 this is normal. You should consult your baby's doctor if the navel area becomes red or if a foul odor or discharge develops. Umbilical (navel) hernias are common in newborns, particularly in infants of African heritage. A hole in the wall of the abdomen at the site of the umbilical cord/future navel allows the baby's intestine to protrude through when he or she cries or strains, causing the overlying skin to bulge outward. These hernias are generally harmless and aren't painful to the infant. The majority of them close on their own during the first few years, but a simple surgical procedure can fix the hernia if it doesn't close by itself. Home remedies for umbilical hernias that have been tried through the years, such as strapping and taping coins over the area, should not be attempted. These techniques are ineffective and may result in skin infections or other injuries. Genitalia The genitalia (sexual organs) of both male and female infants may appear relatively large and swollen at birth. Why? It's due to several factors, including the exposure to hormones produced by the mother and fetus, bruising and swelling of the genital tissues related to birth trauma, and the natural course of development of the genitalia. In girls, the outer lips of the vagina (labia majora) may appear puffy at birth. The skin of the labia may be either smooth or somewhat wrinkled. Sometimes, a small piece of pink tissue may protrude between the labia \u2014 this is a hymenal tag; it will eventually recede into the labia as the genitals grow. Due to the effects of maternal hormones, most newborn girls will have a vaginal discharge of mucus and perhaps some blood that lasts for a few days. This \"mini-period\" is normal menstrual-type bleeding from the infant's uterus that occurs as the estrogen passed to the infant by the mother begins to disappear. Although it's much more common in boys, swelling in the groin of an infant girl can indicate the presence of an inguinal (groin) hernia. Hydrocele In boys, the scrotum (the sack containing the testicles) often looks swollen. This is usually due to a hydrocele, a common collection of fluid in the scrotum of infant boys that usually disappears during the first 3 to 6 months. You should consult your doctor about swelling or bulging in your son's scrotum or groin area that persists beyond 3 to 6 months or that seems to come and go. That may indicate the presence of an inguinal hernia, which usually requires surgical treatment. The testicles of newborn boys may be difficult to feel in the swollen scrotum. Infant boys also normally experience frequent penile erections, often just before they urinate. More than 95% of newborns urinate within the first 24 hours. If your baby is delivered in a hospital, nursery personnel will want to know if this happens while your infant is with you. If a newborn doesn't urinate for what seems like a while at first, it may be that he or she urinated immediately after birth while still in the delivery room.  If your infant son was circumcised, it usually takes between 7 to 10 days for the penis to heal. Until it does, the tip may seem raw or yellowish in color. Although this is normal, certain other symptoms are not. Call your child's doctor right away if you notice persistent bleeding, redness around the tip of the penis that gets worse after 3 days, fever, signs of infection (such as the presence of pus-filled blisters), and not urinating normally within 6 to 8 hours after the circumcision. Bathing With both circumcised and uncircumcised penises, no cotton swabs, astringents, or any special bath products are needed \u2014 simple soap and warm water every time you bathe your baby will do the trick. No special washing precautions are needed for newly circumcised babies, other than to be gentle, as your baby may have some mild discomfort after the circumcision. If your son has a bandage on his incision, you might need to apply a new one whenever you change his diaper for a day or two after the procedure (put petroleum jelly on the bandage so it won't stick to his skin). Doctors often also recommend putting a dab of petroleum jelly on the baby's penis or on the front of the diaper to alleviate any potential discomfort caused by friction against the diaper. How you take care of your baby's penis may also vary depending on the type of circumcision procedure the doctor performs. Be sure to discuss what after-care will be needed. If your baby boy wasn't circumcised, be sure to never forcibly pull back the foreskin to clean beneath it. Instead, gently tense it against the tip of the penis and wash off any smegma (the whitish \"beads\" of dead skin cells mixed with the body's natural oil). Over time, the foreskin will retract on its own so that it can be pulled away from the glans toward the abdomen. This happens at different times for different children, but most boys can retract their foreskins by the time they're 5 years old. Skin There's little doubt about the origin of the expression \"still wet behind the ears,\" used to describe someone new or inexperienced. Newborns are covered with various fluids at delivery, including amniotic fluid and often some blood (the mother's, not the baby's). Nurses or other personnel attending the birth will promptly begin drying the infant to avoid a drop in the baby's body temperature that will occur if moisture on the skin evaporates rapidly. Newborns are also coated with a thick, pasty, white material called vernix caseosa, most of which will be washed off during the baby's first bath.  The hue and color patterns of a young infant's skin may be startling to some parents. Mottling of the skin, a pattern of reddish and pale areas, is common because of the normal instability of the blood circulation at the skin's surface. For similar reasons, acrocyanosis, or blueness of the skin of the hands and feet and the area surrounding the lips, is often present, especially if the infant is in a cool environment. When bearing down to cry or having a bowel movement, a young infant's skin temporarily may appear beet-red or bluish-purple. Red marks, scratches, bruises, and petechiae are all common on the face and other body parts. They're caused by the trauma of squeezing through the birth canal or by the pressure from obstetrical forceps used during the delivery. These will heal and disappear during the first week or two of life. Fine, soft hair, called lanugo, may be present on a newborn's face, shoulders, and back. Most of this hair is usually shed in the uterus before the baby is delivered; for this reason, lanugo is more frequently seen on babies born prematurely. In any case, this hair will disappear in a few weeks. The top layer of a newborn's skin will flake off during the first week or two. This is normal and expected and doesn't require any special skin care. Peeling skin may be present at birth in some infants, particularly those who are born past their due date. Birthmarks Despite what the name says, not all babies come with a birthmark. However, pink or red areas, sometimes called salmon patches, are common and generally disappear within the first year. Most frequently found on the back of the neck or on the bridge of the nose, eyelids, or brow, they can occur anywhere on the skin, especially in light-skinned infants. Mongolian spots, flat patches of slate-blue or blue-green color that resemble ink stains on the back, buttocks, or elsewhere on the skin, are found in more than half of black, Native American, and Asian infants and less often in white babies. These spots almost always fade or disappear within a few years. Strawberry or capillary hemangiomas are raised red marks caused by collections of widened blood vessels in the skin. These birthmarks may appear pale at birth and then typically become red and enlarge during the first months of life. Then, they usually shrink and disappear without treatment within the first 6 years.  Port-wine stains, which are large, flat, reddish-purple birthmarks, won't disappear on their own.  Cafe-au-lait spots, so called because of their \"coffee with milk\" light-brown color, are present on the skin of some infants. These may deepen in color (or may first appear) as the child grows older. They're usually of no concern unless, they're large or there are six or more spots on the body, which may indicate the presence of certain medical conditions. Common brown or black moles, known as pigmented nevi, may also be present at birth or appear or deepen in color as the child gets older. Larger moles or those with an unusual appearance should be brought to a doctor's attention because some may require removal. Rashes Several harmless skin rashes and conditions may be present at birth or appear during the first few weeks. Tiny, flat, yellow or white spots on the nose and chin, called milia and will disappear within the first few weeks. Miliaria \u2014 small, raised, red bumps that often have a white or yellow \"head\" \u2014 is sometimes called infant acne. Although miliaria often occurs on the face and may be present on large areas of the body, it's a harmless condition that will go away within the first several weeks with normal skin care. Despite the frightening sound of its medical name, erythema toxicum is also a harmless newborn rash consisting of red blotches with pale or yellowish bumps at the center, which give the rash a hive-like appearance. This rash usually blossoms during the first day or two after birth and disappears within a week. Pustular melanosis, a rash present at birth mainly in black infants, is characterized by dark brown bumps or blisters scattered over the neck, back, arms, legs, and palms, which disappear without treatment. Also, it isn't unusual to see infants born with blisters on the fingers, hands, or arms because the fetus can suck while still in the uterus. Newborn jaundice, a yellowish discoloration of the skin and white parts of the eyes, is a common condition that normally doesn't appear until the second or third day after birth and disappears within 1 to 2 weeks. Jaundice is caused by the accumulation of bilirubin in the blood, skin, and other tissues due to the temporary inability of the newborn's immature liver to clear this substance from the body effectively. Although a certain degree of this is expected, if an infant becomes jaundiced earlier than expected or their bilirubin level is higher than is normal, then the doctor will follow the baby very closely. Getting to Know Your Little One The first days and weeks of a newborn's life are a time of great wonder and delight for most new parents. However, being responsible for such a seemingly fragile creature can be intimidating, particularly if you're unfamiliar with how a normal newborn looks and behaves. If you feel anxious or uncertain about any aspect of caring for your infant, don't hesitate to consult your doctor, other health care professionals, or family or friends who have had experience caring for a newborn, too.",

            "en": "3          3. THE END I FELT ABSOLUTELY HIDEOUS IN THE MORNING. I HADN'T slept well; my arm burned and my head ached. It didn't help my outlook that Edward's face was smooth and remote as he kissed my forehead quickly and ducked out my window. I was afraid of the time I'd spent unconscious, afraid that he might have been thinking about right and wrong again while he watched me sleep. The anxiety seemed to ratchet up the intensity of the pounding in my head. Edward was waiting for me at school, as usual, but his face was still wrong. There was something buried in his eyes that I couldn't be sure of\u2014and it scared me. I didn't want to bring up last night, but I wasn't sure if avoiding the subject would be worse. He opened my door for me. \"How do you feel?\u00a0 \" \"Perfect,\" I lied, cringing as the sound of the slamming door echoed in my head. We walked in silence, he shortening his stride to match mine. There were so many questions I wanted to ask, but most of those questions would have to wait, because they were for Alice: How was Jasper this morning?\u00a0 \u00a0What had they said when I was gone?\u00a0 \u00a0What had Rosalie said?\u00a0 \u00a0And most importantly, what could she see happening now in her strange, imperfect visions of the future?\u00a0 \u00a0Could she guess what Edward was thinking, why he was so gloomy?\u00a0 \u00a0Was there a foundation for the tenuous, instinctive fears that I couldn't seem to shake?\u00a0  The morning passed slowly. I was impatient to see Alice, though I wouldn't be able to really talk to her with Edward there. Edward remained aloof. Occasionally he would ask about my arm, and I would lie. Alice usually beat us to lunch; she didn't have to keep pace with a sloth like me. But she wasn't at the table, waiting with a tray of food she wouldn't eat. Edward didn't say anything about her absence. I wondered to myself if her class was running late\u2014until I saw Conner and Ben, who were in her fourth hour French class. \"Where's Alice?\u00a0 \" I asked Edward anxiously. He looked at the granola bar he was slowly pulverizing between his fingertips while he answered. \"She's with Jasper.\" \"Is he okay?\u00a0 \" \"He's gone away for a while.\" \"What?\u00a0 \u00a0Where?\u00a0 \" Edward shrugged. \"Nowhere in particular.\" \"And Alice, too,\" I said with quiet desperation. Of course, if Jasper needed her, she would go.  \"Yes. She'll be gone for a while. She was trying to convince him to go to Denali.\" Denali was where the one other band of unique vampires\u2014good ones like the Cullens\u2014lived. Tanya and her family. I'd heard of them now and again. Edward had run to them last winter when my arrival had made Forks difficult for him. Laurent, the most civilized member of James's little coven, had gone there rather than siding with James against the Cullens. It made sense for Alice to encourage Jasper to go there. I swallowed, trying to dislodge the sudden lump in my throat. The guilt made my head bow and my shoulders slump. I'd run them out of their home, just like Rosalie and Emmett. I was a plague. \"Is your arm bothering you?\u00a0 \" he asked solicitously. \"Who cares about my stupid arm?\u00a0 \" I muttered in disgust. He didn't answer, and I put my head down on the table. By the end of the day, the silence was becoming ridiculous. I didn't want to be the one to break it, but apparently that was my only choice if I ever wanted him to talk to me again. \"You'll come over later tonight?\u00a0 \" I asked as he walked me\u2014silently\u2014to my truck. He always came over. \"Later?\u00a0 \" It pleased me that he seemed surprised. \"I have to work. I had to trade with Mrs. Newton to get yesterday off.\" \"Oh,\" he murmured. \"So you'll come over when I'm home, though, right?\u00a0 \" I hated that I felt suddenly unsure about this. \"If you want me to.\" \"I always want you,\" I reminded him, with perhaps a little more intensity than the conversation required. I expected he would laugh, or smile, or react somehow to my words. \"All right, then,\" he said indifferently. He kissed my forehead again before he shut the door on me. Then he turned his back and loped gracefully toward his car. I was able to drive out of the parking lot before the panic really hit, but I was hyperventilating by the time I got to Newton's. He just needed time, I told myself. He would get over this. Maybe he was sad because his family was disappearing. But Alice and Jasper would come back soon, and Rosalie and Emmett, too. If it would help, I would stay away from the big white house on the river\u2014I'd never set foot there again. That didn't matter. I'd still see Alice at school. She would have to come back for school, right?\u00a0 \u00a0And she was at my place all the time anyway. She wouldn't want to hurt Charlie's feelings by staying away. No doubt I would also run into Carlisle with regularity\u2014in the emergency room. After all, what had happened last night was nothing. Nothing had happened. So I fell down\u2014that was the story of my life. Compared to last spring, it seemed especially unimportant. James had left me broken and nearly dead from loss of blood\u2014and yet Edward had handled the interminable weeks in the hospital much better than this. Was it because, this time, it wasn't an enemy he'd had to protect me from?\u00a0  Because it was his brother?\u00a0  Maybe it would be better if he took me away, rather than his family being scattered. I grew slightly less depressed as I considered all the uninterrupted alone time. If he could just last through the school year, Charlie wouldn't be able to object. We could go away to college, or pretend that's what we were doing, like Rosalie and Emmett this year. Surely Edward could wait a year. What was a year to an immortal?\u00a0 \u00a0It didn't even seem like that much to me. I was able to talk myself into enough composure to handle getting out of the truck and walking to the store. Mike Newton had beaten me here today, and he smiled and waved when I came in. I grabbed my vest, nodding vaguely in his direction. I was still imagining pleasant scenarios that consisted of me running away with Edward to various exotic locales. Mike interrupted my fantasy. \"How was your birthday?\u00a0 \" \"Ugh,\" I mumbled. \"I'm glad it's over.\" Mike looked at me from the corners of his eyes like I was crazy. Work dragged. I wanted to see Edward again, praying that he would be past the worst of this, whatever it was exactly, by the time I saw him again. It's nothing, I told myself over and over again. Everything will go back to normal. The relief I felt when I turned onto my street and saw Edward's silver car parked in front of my house was an overwhelming, heady thing. And it bothered me deeply that it should be that way. I hurried through the front door, calling out before I was completely inside. \"Dad?\u00a0 \u00a0Edward?\u00a0 \" As I spoke, I could hear the distinctive theme music from ESPN's Sports Center coming from the living room. \"In here,\" Charlie called. I hung my raincoat on its peg and hurried around the corner. Edward was in the armchair, my father on the sofa. Both had their eyes trained on the TV. The focus was normal for my father. Not so much for Edward. \"Hi,\" I said weakly. \"Hey, Bella,\" my father answered, eyes never moving. \"We just had cold pizza. I think it's still on the table.\" \"Okay.\" I waited in the doorway. Finally, Edward looked over at me with a polite smile. \"I'll be right behind you,\" he promised. His eyes strayed back to the TV. I stared for another minute, shocked. Neither one seemed to notice. I could feel something, panic maybe, building up in my chest. I escaped to the kitchen. The pizza held no interest for me. I sat in my chair, pulled my knees up, and wrapped my arms around them. Something was very wrong, maybe more wrong than I'd realized. The sounds of male bonding and banter continued from the TV set. I tried to get control of myself, to reason with myself. What's the worst that can happen?\u00a0 \u00a0I flinched. That was definitely the wrong question to ask. I was having a hard time breathing right. Okay, I thought again, what's the worst I can live through?\u00a0 \u00a0I didn't like that question so much, either. But I thought through the possibilities I'd considered today. Staying away from Edward's family. Of course, he wouldn't expect Alice to be part of that. But if Jasper was off limits, that would lessen the time I could have with her. I nodded to myself\u2014I could live with that. Or going away. Maybe he wouldn't want to wait till the end of the school year, maybe it would have to be now. In front of me, on the table, my presents from Charlie and Renee were where I had left them, the camera I hadn't had the chance to use at the Cullens' sitting beside the album. I touched the pretty cover of the scrapbook my mother had given me, and sighed, thinking of Renee. Somehow, living without her for as long as I had did not make the idea of a more permanent separation easier. And Charlie would be left all alone here, abandoned. They would both be so hurt\u2026 But we'd come back, right?\u00a0 \u00a0We'd visit, of course, wouldn't we?\u00a0  I couldn't be certain about the answer to that. I leaned my cheek against my knee, staring at the physical tokens of my parents' love. I'd known this path I'd chosen was going to be hard. And, after all, I was thinking about the worst-case scenario\u2014the very worst I could live through. I touched the scrapbook again, flipping the front cover over. Little metal corners were already in place to hold the first picture. It wasn't a half-bad idea, to make some record of my life here. I felt a strange urge to get started. Maybe I didn't have that long left in Forks. I toyed with the wrist strap on the camera, wondering about the first picture on the roll. Could it possibly turn out anything close to the original?\u00a0 \u00a0I doubted it. But he didn't seem worried that it would be blank. I chuckled to myself, thinking of his carefree laughter last night. The chuckle died away. So much had changed, and so abruptly. It made me feel a little bit dizzy, like I was standing on an edge, a precipice somewhere much too high. I didn't want to think about that anymore. I grabbed the camera and headed up the stairs. My room hadn't really changed all that much in the seventeen years since my mother had been here. The walls were still light blue, the same yellowed lace curtains hung in front of the window. There was a bed, rather than a crib, but she would recognize the quilt draped untidily over the top\u2014it had been a gift from Gran. Regardless, I snapped a picture of my room. There wasn't much else I could do tonight\u2014it was too dark outside\u2014and the feeling was growing stronger, it was almost a\u00a0 compulsion now. I would record everything about Forks before I had to leave it. Change was coming. I could feel it. It wasn't a pleasant prospect, not when life was perfect the way it was. I took my time coming back down the stairs, camera in hand, trying to ignore the butterflies in my stomach as I thought of the strange distance I didn't want to see in Edward's eyes. He would get over this. Probably he was worried that I would be upset when he asked me to leave. I would let him work through it without meddling. And I would be prepared when he asked. I had the camera ready as I leaned around the corner, being sneaky. I was sure there was no chance that I had caught Edward by surprise, but he didn't look up. I felt a brief shiver as something icy twisted in my stomach; I ignored that and took the picture. They both looked at me then. Charlie frowned. Edward's face was empty, expressionless. \"What are you doing, Bella?\u00a0 \" Charlie complained. \"Oh, come on.\" I pretended to smile as I went to sit on the floor in front of the sofa where Charlie lounged. \"You know Mom will be calling soon to ask if I'm using my presents. I have to get to work before she can get her feelings hurt.\" \"Why are you taking pictures of me, though?\u00a0 \" he grumbled. \"Because you're so handsome,\" I replied, keeping it light. \"And because, since you\u00a0 bought the camera, you're obligated to be one of my subjects.\" He mumbled something unintelligible. \"Hey, Edward,\" I said with admirable indifference. \"Take one of me and my dad together.\"  I threw the camera toward him, carefully avoiding his eyes, and knelt beside the arm of the sofa where Charlie's face was. Charlie sighed. \"You need to smile, Bella,\" Edward murmured. I did my best, and the camera flashed. \"Let me take one of you kids,\" Charlie suggested. I knew he was just trying to shift the camera's focus from himself. Edward stood and lightly tossed him the camera. I went to stand beside Edward, and the arrangement felt formal and strange to me. He put one hand lightly on my shoulder, and I wrapped my arm more securely around his waist. I wanted to look at his face, but I was afraid to. \"Smile, Bella,\" Charlie reminded me again. I took a deep breath and smiled. The flash blinded me. \"Enough pictures for tonight,\" Charlie said then, shoving the camera into a crevice of the sofa cushions and rolling over it. \"You don't have to use the whole roll now.\" Edward dropped his hand from my shoulder and twisted casually out of my arm. He sat back down in the armchair. I hesitated, and then went to sit against the sofa again. I was suddenly so frightened that my hands were shaking. I pressed them into my stomach to hide them, put my chin on my knees and stared at the TV screen in front of me, seeing nothing. When the show ended, I hadn't moved an inch. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Edward stand. \"I'd better get home,\" he said. Charlie didn't look up from the commercial. \"See ya.\" I got awkwardly to my feet\u2014I was stiff from sitting so still\u2014and followed Edward out the front door. He went straight to his car. \"Will you stay?\u00a0 \" I asked, no hope in my voice. I expected his answer, so it didn't hurt as much. \"Not tonight.\" I didn't ask for a reason. He got in his car and drove away while I stood there, unmoving. I barely noticed that it was raining. I waited, without knowing what I waited for, until the door opened behind me. \"Bella, what are you doing?\u00a0 \" Charlie asked, surprised to see me standing there alone and dripping. \"Nothing.\" I turned and trudged back to the house. It was a long night, with little in the way of rest. I got up as soon as there was a faint light outside my window. I dressed for school mechanically, waiting for the clouds to brighten. When I had eaten a bowl of cereal, I decided that it was light enough for pictures. I took one of my truck, and then the front of the house. I turned and snapped a few of the forest by Charlie's house. Funny how it didn't seem sinister like it used to. I realized I would miss this\u2014the green, the timelessness, the mystery of the woods. All of it. I put the camera in my school bag before I left. I tried to concentrate on my new project rather than the fact that Edward apparently hadn't gotten over things during the night. Along with the fear, I was beginning to feel impatience. How long could this last?\u00a0  It lasted through the morning. He walked silently beside me, never seeming to actually look at me. I tried to concentrate on my classes, but not even English could hold my attention. Mr. Berty had to repeat his question about Lady Capulet twice before I realized he was talking to me. Edward whispered the correct answer under his breath and then went back to ignoring me. At lunch, the silence continued. I felt like I was going to start screaming at any moment, so, to distract myself, I leaned across the table's invisible line and spoke to Jessica. \"Hey, Jess?\u00a0 \" \"What's up, Bella?\u00a0 \" \"Could you do me a favor?\u00a0 \" I asked, reaching into my bag. \"My mom wants me to get some pictures of my friends for a scrapbook. So, take some pictures of everybody, okay?\u00a0 \" I handed her the camera. \"Sure,\" she said, grinning, and turned to snap a candid shot of Mike with his mouth full. A predictable picture war ensued. I watched them hand the camera around the table, giggling and flirting and complaining about being on film. It seemed strangely childish. Maybe I just wasn't in the mood for normal human behavior today. \"Uh-oh,\" Jessica said apologetically as she returned the camera. \"I think we used all your film.\" \"That's okay. I think I already got pictures of everything else I needed.\" After school, Edward walked me back to the parking lot in silence. I had to work again, and for once, I was glad. Time with me obviously wasn't helping things. Maybe time alone would be better. I dropped my film off at the Thriftway on my way to Newton's, and then picked up the developed pictures after work. At home, I said a brief hi to Charlie, grabbed a granola bar from the kitchen, and hurried up to my room with the envelope of photographs tucked under my arm. I sat in the middle of my bed and opened the envelope with wary curiosity. Ridiculously, I still half expected the first print to be a blank. When I pulled it out, I gasped aloud. Edward looked just as beautiful as he did in real life, staring at me out of the picture with the warm eyes I'd missed for the past few days. It was almost uncanny that anyone could look so\u2026 so\u2026 beyond description. No thousand words could equal this picture. I flipped through the rest of the stack quickly once, and then laid three of them out on the bed side by side. The first was the picture of Edward in the kitchen, his warm eyes touched with tolerant amusement. The second was Edward and Charlie, watching ESPN. The difference in Edward's expression was severe. His eyes were careful here, reserved. Still breathtakingly beautiful, but his face was colder, more like a sculpture, less alive. The last was the picture of Edward and me standing awkwardly side by side. Edward's face was the same as the last, cold and statue-like. But that wasn't the most troubling part of this photograph. The contrast between the two of us was painful. He looked like a god. I looked very average, even for a human, almost shamefully plain. I flipped the picture over with a feeling of disgust. Instead of doing my homework, I stayed up to put my pictures into the album. With a ballpoint pen I scrawled captions under all the pictures, the names and the dates. I got to the picture of Edward and me, and, without looking at it too long, I folded it in half and stuck it under the metal tab, Edward-side up. When I was done, I stuffed the second set of prints in a fresh envelope and penned a long thank-you letter to Renee. Edward still hadn't come over. I didn't want to admit that he was the reason I'd stayed up so late, but of course he was. I tried to remember the last time he'd stayed away like this, without an excuse, a phone call\u2026 He never had. Again, I didn't sleep well. School followed the silent, frustrating, terrifying pattern of the last two days. I felt relief when I saw Edward waiting for me in the parking lot, but it faded quickly. He was no different, unless maybe more remote. It was hard to even remember the reason for all this mess. My birthday already felt like the distant past. If only Alice would come back. Soon. Before this got any more out of hand.  But I couldn't count on that. I decided that, if I couldn't talk to him today, really talk, then I was going to see Carlisle tomorrow. I had to do something. After school, Edward and I were going to talk it out, I promised myself. I wasn't accepting any excuses. He walked me to my truck, and I steeled myself to make my demands. \"Do you mind if I come over today?\u00a0 \" he asked before we got to the truck, beating me to the punch. \"Of course not.\" \"Now?\u00a0 \" he asked again, opening my door for me. \"Sure,\" I kept my voice even, though I didn't like the urgency in his tone. \"I was just going to drop a letter for Renee in the mailbox on the way. I'll meet you there.\" He looked at the fat envelope on the passenger seat. Suddenly, he reached over me and snagged it. \"I'll do it,\" he said quietly. \"And I'll still beat you there.\" He smiled my favorite crooked smile, but it was wrong. It didn't reach his eyes. \"Okay,\" I agreed, unable to smile back. He shut the door, and headed toward his car. He did beat me home. He was parked in Charlie's spot when I pulled up in front of the house. That was a bad sign. He didn't plan to stay, then. I shook my head and took a deep breath, trying to locate some courage. He got out of his car when I stepped out of the truck, and came to meet me. He reached to take my book bag from me. That was normal. But he shoved it back onto the seat. That was not normal. \"Come for a walk with me,\" he suggested in an unemotional voice, taking my hand. I didn't answer. I couldn't think of a way to protest, but I instantly knew that I wanted to. I didn't like this. This is bad, this is very bad, the voice in my head repeated again and again. But he didn't wait for an answer. He pulled me along toward the east side of the yard, where the forest encroached. I followed unwillingly, trying to think through the panic. It was what I wanted, I reminded myself. The chance to talk it all through. So why was the panic choking me?\u00a0  We'd gone only a few steps into the trees when he stopped. We were barely on the trail\u2014I could still see the house. Some walk. Edward leaned against a tree and stared at me, his expression unreadable. \"Okay, let's talk,\" I said. It sounded braver than it felt. He took a deep breath. \"Bella, we're leaving.\" I took a deep breath, too. This was an acceptable option. I thought I was prepared. But I still had to ask. \"Why now?\u00a0 \u00a0Another year\u2014\" \"Bella, it's time. How much longer could we stay in Forks, after all?\u00a0 \u00a0Carlisle can barely pass for thirty, and he's claiming thirty-three now. We'd have to start over soon regardless.\" His answer confused me. I thought the point of leaving was to let his family live in peace. Why did we have to leave if they were going?\u00a0 \u00a0I stared at him, trying to understand what he meant. He stared back coldly. With a roll of nausea, I realized I'd misunderstood. \"When you say we\u2014,\" I whispered. \"I mean my family and myself.\" Each word separate and distinct. I shook my head back and forth mechanically, trying to clear it. He waited without any sign of impatience. It took a few minutes before I could speak. \"Okay,\" I said. \"I'll come with you.\" \"You can't, Bella. Where we're going\u2026 It's not the right place for you.\" \"Where you are is the right place for me.\" \"I'm no good for you, Bella.\" \"Don't be ridiculous.\" I wanted to sound angry, but it just sounded like I was begging. \"You're the very best part of my life.\" \"My world is not for you,\" he said grimly. \"What happened with Jasper\u2014that was nothing, Edward! Nothing!\" \"You're right,\" he agreed. \"It was exactly what was to be expected.\" \"You promised! In Phoenix, you promised that you would stay\u2014\" \"As long as that was best for you,\" he interrupted to correct me. \"No! This is about my soul, isn't it?\u00a0 \" I shouted, furious, the words exploding out of me\u2014somehow it still sounded like a plea. \"Carlisle told me about that, and I don't care,\u00a0 Edward. I don't care! You can have my soul. I don't want it without you\u2014it's yours already!\" He took a deep breath and stared, unseeingly, at the ground for a long moment. His mouth twisted the tiniest bit. When he finally looked up, his eyes were different, harder\u2014like the liquid gold had frozen solid. \"Bella, I don't want you to come with me.\" He spoke the words slowly and precisely, his cold eyes on my face, watching as I absorbed what he was really saying. There was a pause as I repeated the words in my head a few times, sifting through them for their real intent. \"You\u2026 don't\u2026 want me?\u00a0 \" I tried out the words, confused by the way they sounded, placed in that order. \"No.\" I stared, uncomprehending, into his eyes. He stared back without apology. His eyes were like topaz\u2014hard and clear and very deep. I felt like I could see into them for miles and miles, yet nowhere in their bottomless depths could I see a contradiction to the word he'd spoken. \"Well, that changes things.\" I was surprised by how calm and reasonable my voice sounded. It must be because I was so numb. I couldn't realize what he was telling me. It still didn't make any sense. He looked away into the trees as he spoke again. \"Of course, I'll always love you\u2026 in a way. But what happened the other night made me realize that it's time for a change. Because I'm\u2026 tired of pretending to be something I'm not, Bella. I am not human.\" He looked back, and the icy planes of his perfect face were not human. \"I've let this go on much too long, and I'm sorry for that.\" \"Don't.\" My voice was just a whisper now; awareness was beginning to seep through me, trickling like acid through my veins. \"Don't do this.\" He just stared at me, and I could see from his eyes that my words were far too late. He already had.  \"You're not good for me, Bella.\" He turned his earlier words around, and so I had no argument. How well I knew that I wasn't good enough for him. I opened my mouth to say something, and then closed it again. He waited patiently, his face wiped clean of all emotion. I tried again. \"If\u2026 that's what you want.\" He nodded once. My whole body went numb. I couldn't feel anything below the neck. \"I would like to ask one favor, though, if that's not too much,\" he said. I wonder what he saw on my face, because something flickered across his own face in response. But, before I could identify it, he'd composed his features into the same serene mask. \"Anything,\" I vowed, my voice faintly stronger. As I watched, his frozen eyes melted. The gold became liquid again, molten, burning down into mine with an intensity that was overwhelming. \"Don't do anything reckless or stupid,\" he ordered, no longer detached. \"Do you understand what I'm saying?\u00a0 \" I nodded helplessly. His eyes cooled, the distance returned. \"I'm thinking of Charlie, of course. He needs you. Take care of yourself\u2014for him.\" I nodded again. \"I will,\" I whispered. He seemed to relax just a little. \"And I'll make you a promise in return,\" he said. \"I promise that this will be the last time you'll see me. I won't come back. I won't put you through anything like this again. You can go on with your life without any more interference from me. It will be as if I'd never existed.\" My knees must have started to shake, because the trees were suddenly wobbling. I could hear the blood pounding faster than normal behind my ears. His voice sounded farther away. He smiled gently. \"Don't worry. You're human\u2014your memory is no more than a sieve. Time heals all wounds for your kind.\" \"And your memories?\u00a0 \" I asked. It sounded like there was something stuck in my throat, like I was choking. \"Well\"\u2014he hesitated for a short second\u2014\"I won't forget. But my kind\u2026 we're very easily distracted.\" He smiled; the smile was tranquil and it did not touch his eyes. He took a step away from me. \"That's everything, I suppose. We won't bother you again.\" The plural caught my attention. That surprised me; I would have thought I was beyond noticing anything. \"Alice isn't coming back,\" I realized. I don't know how he heard me\u2014the words made no sound\u2014but he seemed to understand. He shook his head slowly, always watching my face. \"No. They're all gone. I stayed behind to tell you goodbye.\" \"Alice is gone?\u00a0 \" My voice was blank with disbelief. \"She wanted to say goodbye, but I convinced her that a clean break would be better for you.\" I was dizzy; it was hard to concentrate. His words swirled around in my head, and I heard the doctor at the hospital in Phoenix, last spring, as he showed me the X-rays. You can see it's a clean break, his finger traced along the picture of my severed bone. That's good. It will heal more easily, more quickly. I tried to breathe normally. I needed to concentrate, to find a way out of this nightmare. \"Goodbye, Bella,\" he said in the same quiet, peaceful voice. \"Wait!\" I choked out the word, reaching for him, willing my deadened legs to carry me forward. I thought he was reaching for me, too. But his cold hands locked around my wrists and pinned them to my sides. He leaned down, and pressed his lips very lightly to my forehead for the briefest instant. My eyes closed. \"Take care of yourself,\" he breathed, cool against my skin. There was a light, unnatural breeze. My eyes flashed open. The leaves on a small vine maple shuddered with the gentle wind of his passage. He was gone. With shaky legs, ignoring the fact that my action was useless, I followed him into the forest. The evidence of his path had disappeared instantly. There were no footprints, the leaves were still again, but I walked forward without thinking. I could not do anything else. I had to keep moving. If I stopped looking for him, it was over. Love, life, meaning\u2026 over. I walked and walked. Time made no sense as I pushed slowly through the thick undergrowth. It was hours passing, but also only seconds. Maybe it felt like time had frozen because the forest looked the same no matter how far I went. I started to worry that I was traveling in a circle, a very small circle at that, but I kept going. I stumbled often, and, as it grew darker and darker, I fell often, too. Finally, I tripped over something\u2014it was black now, I had no idea what caught my foot\u2014and I stayed down. I rolled onto my side, so that I could breathe, and curled up on the wet bracken. As I lay there, I had a feeling that more time was passing than I realized. I couldn't remember how long it had been since nightfall. Was it always so dark here at night?\u00a0 \u00a0Surely, as a rule, some little bit of moonlight would filter down through the clouds, through the chinks in the canopy of trees, and find the ground. Not tonight. Tonight the sky was utterly black. Perhaps there was no moon tonight\u2014a lunar eclipse, a new moon. A new moon. I shivered, though I wasn't cold. It was black for a long time before I heard them calling. Someone was shouting my name. It was muted, muffled by the wet growth that surrounded me, but it was definitely my name. I didn't recognize the voice. I thought about answering, but I was dazed, and it took a long time to come to the conclusion that I should answer. By then, the calling had stopped. Sometime later, the rain woke me up. I don't think I'd really fallen asleep; I was just lost in an unthinking stupor, holding with all my strength to the numbness that kept me from realizing what I didn't want to know. The rain bothered me a little. It was cold. I unwrapped my arms from around my legs to cover my face.  It was then that I heard the calling again. It was farther away this time, and sometimes it sounded like several voices were calling at once. I tried to breathe deeply. I remembered that I should answer, but I didn't think they would be able to hear me. Would I be able to shout loud enough?\u00a0  Suddenly, there was another sound, startlingly close. A kind of snuffling, an animal sound. It sounded big. I wondered if I should feel afraid. I didn't\u2014just numb. It didn't matter. The snuffling went away. The rain continued, and I could feel the water pooling up against my cheek. I was trying to gather the strength to turn my head when I saw the light. At first it was just a dim glow reflecting off the bushes in the distance. It grew brighter and brighter, illuminating a large space unlike the focused beam of a flashlight. The light broke through the closest brush, and I could see that it was a propane lantern, but that was all I could see\u2014the brightness blinded me for a moment. \"Bella.\" The voice was deep and unfamiliar, but full of recognition. He wasn't calling my name to search, he was acknowledging that I was found. I stared up\u2014impossibly high it seemed\u2014at the dark face that I could now see above me. I was vaguely aware that the stranger probably only looked so tall because my head was still on the ground. \"Have you been hurt?\u00a0 \" I knew the words meant something, but I could only stare, bewildered. How could the meaning matter at this point?\u00a0  \"Bella, my name is Sam Uley.\" There was nothing familiar about his name. \"Charlie sent me to look for you.\" Charlie?\u00a0 \u00a0That struck a chord, and I tried to pay more attention to what he was saying. Charlie mattered, if nothing else did. The tall man held out a hand. I gazed at it, not sure what I was supposed to do. His black eyes appraised me for a second, and then he shrugged. In a quick and supple notion, he pulled me up from the ground and into his arms. I hung there, limp, as he loped swiftly through the wet forest. Some part of me knew this should upset me\u2014being carried away by a stranger. But there was nothing left in me to upset. It didn't seem like too much time passed before there were lights and the deep babble of many male voices. Sam Uley slowed as he approached the commotion. \"I've got her!\" he called in a booming voice. The babble ceased, and then picked up again with more intensity. A confusing swirl of faces moved over me. Sam's voice was the only one that made sense in the chaos, perhaps because my ear was against his chest. \"No, I don't think she's hurt,\" he told someone. \"She just keeps saying 'He's gone.' \" \u00a0Was I saying that out loud?\u00a0 \u00a0I bit down on my lip. \"Bella, honey, are you all right?\u00a0 \" That was one voice I would know anywhere\u2014even distorted, as it was now, with worry. \"Charlie?\u00a0 \" My voice sounded strange and small. \"I'm right here, baby.\" There was a shifting under me, followed by the leathery smell of my dad's sheriff jacket. Charlie staggered under my weight. \"Maybe I should hold on to her,\" Sam Uley suggested. \"I've got her,\" Charlie said, a little breathless. He walked slowly, struggling. I wished I could tell him to put me down and let me walk, but I couldn't find my voice. There were lights everywhere, held by the crowd walking with him. It felt like a parade. Or a funeral procession. I closed my eyes. \"We're almost home now, honey,\" Charlie mumbled now and then. I opened my eyes again when I heard the door unlock. We were on the porch of our house, and the tall dark man named Sam was holding the door for Charlie, one arm extended toward us, as if he was preparing to catch me when Charlie's arms failed. But Charlie managed to get me through the door and to the couch in the living room. \"Dad, I'm all wet,\" I objected feebly. \"That doesn't matter.\" His voice was gruff. And then he was talking to someone else. \"Blankets are in the cupboard at the top of the stairs.\" \"Bella?\u00a0 \" a new voice asked. I looked at the gray-haired man leaning over me, and recognition came after a few slow seconds. \"Dr. Gerandy?\u00a0 \" I mumbled. \"That's right, dear,\" he said. \"Are you hurt, Bella?\u00a0 \" It took me a minute to think that through. I was confused by the memory of Sam Uley's similar question in the woods. Only Sam had asked something else: Have you been hurt?\u00a0 \u00a0he'd said. The difference seemed significant somehow. Dr. Gerandy was waiting. One grizzled eyebrow rose, and the wrinkles on his forehead deepened.  \"I'm not hurt,\" I lied. The words, were true enough for what he'd asked. His warm hand touched my forehead, and his fingers pressed against the inside of my wrist. I watched his lips as he counted to himself, his eyes on his watch. \"What happened to you?\u00a0 \" he asked casually. I froze under his hand, tasting panic in the back of my throat. \"Did you get lost in the woods?\u00a0 \" he prodded. I was aware of several other people listening. Three tall men with dark faces\u2014from La Push, the Quileute Indian reservation down on the coastline, I guessed\u2014Sam Uley among them, were standing very close together and staring at me. Mr. Newton was there with Mike and Mr. Weber, Angela's father; they all were watching me more surreptitiously than the strangers. Other deep voices rumbled from the kitchen and outside the front door. Half the town must have been looking for me. Charlie was the closest. He leaned in to hear my answer. \"Yes,\" I whispered. \"I got lost.\" The doctor nodded, thoughtful, his fingers probing gently against the glands under my jaw. Charlie's face hardened. \"Do you feel tired?\u00a0 \" Dr. Gerandy asked. I nodded and closed my eyes obediently. \"I don't think there's anything wrong with her,\" I heard the doctor mutter to Charlie after a moment. \"Just exhaustion. Let her sleep it off, and I'll come check on her tomorrow,\" he paused. He must have looked at his watch, because he added, \"Well, later today actually.\" There was a creaking sound as they both pushed off from the couch to get to their feet. \"Is it true?\u00a0 \" Charlie whispered. Their voices were farther away now. I strained to hear. \"Did they leave?\u00a0 \" \"Dr. Cullen asked us not to say anything,\" Dr. Gerandy answered. \"The offer was very sudden; they had to choose immediately. Carlisle didn't want to make a big production out of leaving.\" \"A little warning might have been nice,\" Charlie grumbled. Dr. Gerandy sounded uncomfortable when he replied. \"Yes, well, in this situation, some warning might have been called for.\" I didn't want to listen anymore. I felt around for the edge of the quilt someone had laid on top of me, and pulled it over my ear. I drifted in and out of <em>alertness</em>. I heard Charlie whisper thanks to the volunteers as, one by one, they left. I felt his fingers on my forehead, and then the weight of another blanket. The phone rang a few times, and he hurried to catch it before it could wake me. He muttered reassurances in a low voice to the callers. \"Yeah, we found her. She's okay. She got lost. She's fine now,\" he said again and again. I heard the springs in the armchair groan when he settled himself in for the night. A few minutes later, the phone rang again. Charlie moaned as he struggled to his feet, and then he rushed, stumbling, to the kitchen I pulled my head deeper under the blankets, not wanting to listen to the same conversation again. \"Yeah,\" Charlie said, and yawned. His voice changed, it was much more alert when he spoke again. \"Where?\u00a0 '\" There was a pause. \"You're sure it's outside the reservation?\u00a0 \" Another short pause. \"But what could be burning out there?\u00a0 \" He sounded both worried and mystified. \"Look, I'll call down there and check it out.\" I listened with more interest as he punched in a number. \"Hey, Billy, it's Charlie\u2014sorry I'm calling so early\u2026 no, she's fine. She's sleeping\u2026 Thanks, but that's not why I called. I just got a call from Mrs. Stanley, and she says that from her second-story window she can see fires out on the sea cliffs, but I didn't really\u2026 Oh!\" Suddenly there was an edge in his voice\u2014irritation\u2026 or anger. \"And why are they doing that?\u00a0 \u00a0Uh huh. Really?\u00a0 \" He said it sarcastically. \"Well, don't apologize to me. Yeah, yeah. Just make sure the flames don't spread\u2026 I know, I know, I'm surprised they got them lit at all in this weather.\" Charlie hesitated, and then added grudgingly. \"Thanks for sending Sam and the other boys up. You were right\u2014they do know the forest better than we do. It was Sam who found her, so I owe you one\u2026 Yeah, I'll talk to you later,\" he agreed, still sour, before hanging up. Charlie muttered something incoherent as he shuffled back to the living room. \"What's wrong?\u00a0 \" I asked. He hurried to my side. \"I'm sorry I woke you, honey.\" \"Is something burning?\u00a0 \" \"It's nothing,\" he assured me. \"Just some bonfires out on the cliffs.\" \"Bonfires?\u00a0 \" I asked. My voice didn't sound curious. It sounded dead. Charlie frowned. \"Some of the kids from the reservation being rowdy,\" he explained. \"Why?\u00a0 \" I wondered dully. I could tell he didn't want to answer. He looked at the floor under his knees. \"They're celebrating the news.\" His tone was bitter. There was only one piece of news I could think of, try as I might not to. And then the pieces snapped together. \"Because the Cullens left,\" I whispered. \"They don't like the Cullens in La Push\u2014I'd forgotten about that.\" The Quileutes had their superstitions about the \"cold ones,\" the blood-drinkers that were enemies to their tribe, just like they had their legends of the great flood and wolf-men ancestors. Just stories, folklore, to most of them. Then there were the few that believed. Charlie's good friend Billy Black believed, though even Jacob, his own son, thought he was full of stupid superstitions. Billy had warned me to stay away from the Cullens\u2026 The name stirred something inside me, something that began to claw its way toward the surface, something I knew I didn't want to face. \"It's ridiculous,\" Charlie spluttered. We sat in silence for a moment. The sky was no longer black outside the window. Somewhere behind the rain, the sun was beginning to rise. \"Bella?\u00a0 \" Charlie asked. I looked at him uneasily. \"He left you alone in the woods?\u00a0 \" Charlie guessed. I deflected his question. \"How did you know where to find me?\u00a0 \" My mind shied away from the inevitable awareness that was coming, coming quickly now. \"Your note,\" Charlie answered, surprised. He reached into the back pocket of his jeans and pulled out a much-abused piece of paper. It was dirty and damp, with multiple creases from being opened and refolded many times. He unfolded it again, and held it up as evidence. The messy handwriting was remarkably close to my own. Going for a walk with Edward, up the path, it said. Back soon, B. \"When you didn't come back, I called the Cullens, and no one answered,\" Charlie said in a low voice. \"Then I called the hospital, and Dr. Gerandy told me that Carlisle was gone.\" \"Where did they go?\u00a0 \" I mumbled. He stared at me. \"Didn't Edward tell you?\u00a0 \" I shook my head, recoiling. The sound of his name unleashed the thing that was clawing inside of me\u2014a pain that knocked me breathless, astonished me with its force. Charlie eyed me doubtfully as he answered. \"Carlisle took a job with a big hospital in Los Angeles. I guess they threw a lot of money at him.\" Sunny L.A. The last place they would really go. I remembered my nightmare with the mirror\u2026 the bright sunlight shimmering off of his skin\u2014 Agony ripped through me with the memory of his face. \"I want to know if Edward left you alone out there in the middle of the woods,\" Charlie insisted. His name sent another wave of torture through me. I shook my head, frantic, desperate to escape the pain. \"It was my fault. He left me right here on the trail, in sight of the house\u2026 but I tried to follow him.\" Charlie started to say something; childishly, I covered my ears. \"I can't talk about this anymore, Dad. I want to go to my room.\" Before he could answer, I scrambled up from the couch and lurched my way up the stairs. Someone had been in the house to leave a note for Charlie, a note that would lead him to find me. From the minute that I'd realized this, a horrible suspicion began to grow in my head. I rushed to my room, shutting and locking the door behind me before I ran to the CD player by my bed. Everything looked exactly the same as I'd left it. I pressed down on the top of the CD player. The latch unhooked, and the lid slowly swung open. It was empty. The album Renee had given me sat on the floor beside the bed, just where I'd put it last. I lifted the cover with a shaking hand. I didn't have to flip any farther than the first page. The little metal corners no longer held a picture in place. The page was blank except for my own handwriting scrawled across the bottom: Edward Cullen, Charlie's kitchen, Sept. 13th. I stopped there. I was sure that he would have been very thorough. It will be as if I'd never existed, he'd promised me. I felt the smooth wooden floor beneath my knees, and then the palms of my hands, and then it was pressed against the skin of my cheek. I hoped that I was fainting, but, to my disappointment, I didn't lose consciousness. The waves of pain that had only lapped at me before now reared high up and washed over my head, pulling me under. I did not resurface.  OCTOBER NOVEMBER DECEMBER JANUARY",
