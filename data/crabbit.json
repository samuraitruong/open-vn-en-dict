What are you thinking, when you look at me,  A <em>crabbit</em> old woman, not very wise, Uncertain of habit, with far-away eyes, \u2026   What do you see, nurses, what do you see? What are you thinking, when you look at me, A <em>crabbit</em> old woman, not very wise, Uncertain of habit, with far-away eyes, Who, quite unresisting, lets you do as you will, With bathing and feeding the long day to fill. I\u2019ll tell you who I am as I sit here so still, As I move at your bidding, as I eat at your will. I\u2019m a small child of 10 with a father and mother, Brothers and sisters, who loved one another. A bride now at 20 my heart gives a leap, Remembering the vows that I promised to keep. At 25 now I have young of my own, Who need me to build a secure happy home, At 50 once more babies play around my knee, Again we know children, my loved one and me. Dark days are upon me, my husband is dead, I look at the future, I shudder with dread, For my young are all busy with young of their own, And I think of the years and the love that I\u2019ve known. The body it crumbles, grace and vigour depart, There is now a stone where I once had a heart, But inside this old carcass, a young girl still dwells, And now and again my battered heart swells. I remember the joys, I remember the pain, And I\u2019m loving and living life over again, I think of the years all too few gone too fast. And accept the stark fact that nothing can last. So open your eyes, nurse, open and see, Not a <em>crabbit</em> old woman, look closer see ME.",
