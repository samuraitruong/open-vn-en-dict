            "en": "Women And Finances: Is There A Gender Bias    Men and women both wear the jeans in heading today's households, but they still have gender-unique wallet-handling issues due to \"jeanetic\" differences and societal circumstances. Although these differences don't uniformly favor one gender over the other, they collectively challenge women more by limiting their incomes, making their lives more expensive and complicating money management. Confronting this challenge is the next step in the female financial revolution, which began with women becoming a permanent fixture in every part of the workplace. They first conformed to the expectation that they dress and act like male managers and executives whose jobs they aspired to - but they ultimately succeeded by understanding and accepting male business behavior, while embracing their own gender-unique traits to rival male professional success. Women can now apply those workplace lessons to their personal \"wealth-place\" financials. Regardless of relationship status, they can increasingly take full charge of their own financial fates by embracing and adapting for their unique fiscal gender characteristics. Earnings The biggest gender difference is no surprise; studies, such as the one published by the United States General Accounting Office in 2003 entitled \"Women's Earnings\", show that women are paid at a lower rate and earn significantly less overall than men - thus accruing lower Social Security benefits and retirement plan accumulations.  But, the reasons are surprisingly complex:  \nTotal Work Time  Because caregiving tasks (for kids, elderly parents and/or extended family) traditionally falls more on women, they end up having less time to devote to work. Single women without children are often seen as more available to care for an aging parent. These responsibilities cause them to more often opt for work that requires less travel and overtime, and also take more family leave, all of which affects career advancement. Although men increasingly have joint custody, single women are more often custodial parents, requiring them to take more time off, work fewer hours or develop a scheduled work relationship (such as telecommuting) where they can work from home.   \nCareer Choice   According to a study by Shelly J. Correll entitled \"Gender and the Career Choice Process: The Role of Biased Self-Assessments\" published in the American Journal of Sociology in 2001, parents, teachers and particularly the popular culture send a message based on traditional cultural beliefs to a significant percentage of girls. This message says: their career planning and choices are less important than boys' choices - although more than 55% of full-time college students are female. So it's not surprising that they're attracted to careers in traditional female-track or lower-paying jobs, where alternate work arrangements are usually more available. Statistics show that adult women with children (or women planning to have children) disproportionately favor such careers despite widened opportunities in all fields - such as scientific research and applied science, where women are woefully under-represented.  Furthermore, women less frequently choose more physically dangerous professions - such as law enforcement - that reward higher risk with premium wages and pensions. Most significantly, women are controlling their work schedules by starting businesses - often from home when children are very young - to the tune of more than 10 million female (majority-owned) U.S. businesses.  \nDivorce and Widowhood   The divorce rate is around 40% and the average age of widowhood is around 56; both forms of \"losing\" husbands are hazardous to women's financial health. Changing and evolving divorce laws and the way courts apply them, combined with women's increased numbers and earnings in the workplace, have put downward pressure on the length and amount of spousal support negotiated by or awarded to women (while also modestly increasing instances and amounts awarded to men). So women who leave ultimately lucrative careers to become stay-at-home mothers are often forced to work for inadequate pay when the support runs out before they've been able to catch up with experience, education, skills and experience needed for higher compensation. Similarly, pre-retirement homemaker widows are sometimes left with insufficient life insurance or other assets and, as a result, are also forced into low-paying jobs because they can't afford full-time education to jump-start a new career.   \nSocial-Security Formula Anomalies   Women are disproportionately hurt by the average-of-highest-35-years earnings formula, both because of getting zeros for non-working years and because earnings are limited by the taxable caps in each year. Thus, a woman who spends several years earning small amounts while establishing a successful business doesn't get full credit for six-figure earnings once the business becomes successful. Furthermore, divorced women are entitled to get the potentially larger husband-based benefit only if the marriage lasts at least 10 years - and then (along with widows) lose the right to that benefit under some circumstances if they later remarry. This can be <em>grossly</em> damaging to Social Security benefits if these women were mainly stay-at-home moms during their first marriages.   Lower Raise Expectations  Women tend to be less assertive than men about asking for raises and often less effective at negotiating them.   Residual Discrimination  A shrinking but still significant part of the wage gap remains due to lingering discriminatory attitudes about women's professional commitment, which ultimately reduces their share of higher-paying jobs, promotions, professional partnerships and funding for major entrepreneurial business ventures.  Expenses The longer you live and the more years you have of not earning income, the more it costs and the more years of earned income you will need to offset those costs. This adds up when you consider that the life expectancy of women is about five years longer than men. Combined with their greater resilience compared to men who succumb faster to chronic diseases, this results in (mostly single) women spending more old-age time getting in a savings-depleting, expensive long-term care service (such as in-home nursing care or in assisted living, rehabilitation and nursing facilities). Finally, even young women's health care is more expensive - as reflected in an average $25 per month higher premiums for individual health insurance.   Women also have several potentially higher living costs:  \nAppearance\n  Looks do matter. Attractive people tend to make better career progress in the business world. Add in societal expectations regarding female attractiveness and what's appropriate in the workplace, and that makes it very enticing for women to spend much more for high-end clothing, cosmetic items, personal care and, in extreme cases, cosmetic surgery.   \nSafety and Security\n  Women by nature tend to be more risk averse - especially as mothers - so their choices in vehicles and safer-neighborhood housing cost more.   \nMoney Momma Women may spend more on holiday gifts for friends, family and associates. Furthermore, women's willingness to open their purse strings is a new emphasis of charitable organizations, who are increasingly targeting female donors for larger gifts - given women's improved financial status, more altruistic attitudes and higher percentage (but lower per gift) affirmative and continuing response to charitable appeals.   Money Management and Investing Although married women have traditionally been in charge of managing the checkbook, their husbands still make most of the major financial decisions regarding big-ticket purchases and investing. And children of divorce or of single parents more often grow up in financially strapped families that invest less and made fewer big purchases. When combined with statistics showing 80% of purchases are female-driven (direct or decision), this makes a case for many women being more prepared for smart, substantial spending than for stingy saving and informed investing.   The Bottom Line As investors, women face unique challenges both in terms of making money and making that money grow for the future. Despite this, women also have equal access to investing and investment advice.

            "en": "Coroner's preliminary finding: Jackson overdosed on propofol          (CNN) -- The Los Angeles coroner has concluded preliminarily that singer Michael Jackson died of an overdose of propofol, a powerful sedative he was given to help him sleep, according to court documents released Monday. A search warrant filed in court showed toxicology reports found propofol in Michael Jackson's body. Los Angeles coroner Dr. Lakshmanan Sathyavagiswaran reached that preliminary conclusion after reviewing toxicology results carried out on Jackson's blood, according to a search warrant and affidavit unsealed in Houston, Texas.  The affidavit, used to outline probable cause for search warrants of the offices of doctors who are believed to have treated Jackson, disclosed many details of drugs given to Jackson in the weeks before his death. Jackson family lawyer Londell McMillan said the report \"reaffirms the very sad reality that there was a tragic and gross violation of duty and care for Michael Jackson.\" The publicist for Jackson's family said the \"family looks forward to the day that justice can be served.\" \"The Jackson family has full confidence in the legal process, and commends the ongoing efforts of the L.A. County Coroner, the L.A. District Attorney and the L.A. Police Department,\" the statement said. The Associated Press is quoting a single law enforcement official, who said the L.A. County Coroner ruled Michael Jackson's death a homicide. The Los Angeles County Coroner's office told CNN they had \"no comment\" on the report. An LAPD spokesman said the story did not come from their department. \"We will not comment on the \"anonymous\" law enforcement source that claims that Michael Jackson's death will be ruled a homicide,\" Murray's lawyer Ed Chernoff said in a statement on his firm's Web site. \"Most of the reports by \"anonymous\" sources have been proven wrong. We will be happy to address the Coroner's report when it is officially released.\" The 32-page warrant said Dr. Conrad Murray, Jackson's personal physician, told a detective that he had been treating Jackson for insomnia for six weeks. Murray said each night he gave Jackson 50 mg of propofol, also known as Diprivan, diluted with the anesthetic lidocaine via an intravenous drip.  Worried that Jackson may have been becoming addicted to the drug, the Houston cardiologist said he attempted to wean him from it, putting together combinations of other drugs that succeeded in helping Jackson sleep during the two nights prior to his death. On June 22 Murray said he gave Jackson a cocktail of drugs similar to what he gave him on the day he died, June 25 -- propofol, Ativan and Versed, which helped the star fall asleep, according to the documents. On June 23 he gave Jackson only the Ativan and Versed, which helped him sleep. But on June 25, other drugs failed to do the job, as Murray recounted to detectives in an hour-by-hour account detailed by detective Orlando Martinez of the Los Angeles Police  -- At about 1:30 a.m., Murray gave Jackson 10 mg of Valium. -- At about 2 a.m., he injected Jackson with 2 mg of the anti-anxiety drug Ativan. -- At about 3 a.m., Murray then administered 2 mg of the sedative Versed. -- At about 5 a.m., he administered another 2 mg of Ativan. -- At about 7:30 a.m., Murray gave Jackson yet another 2 mg of Versed while monitoring him with a device that measured the oxygen saturation of his blood. -- At about 10:40 a.m., \"after repeated demands/requests from Jackson,\" Murray administered 25 mg of propofol, the document said. \"Jackson finally went to sleep and Murray stated that he remained monitoring him. After approximately 10 minutes, Murray stated he left Jackson's side to go to the restroom and relieve himself. Murray stated he was out of the room for about two minutes maximum. Upon his return, Murray noticed that Jackson was no longer breathing,\" the affidavit said. Efforts at CPR proved fruitless, according Murray. Shortly after Murray said he found Jackson not breathing, Murray was on the phone with three separate callers starting at 11:18 a.m. and ending at 12:05 p.m., according to the court documents which cite the doctor's phone records. \"Murray didn't tell this to anyone when he was interviewed,\" the court documents said. Chernoff denied the timeline referenced in the affidavit. \"Much of what was in the search warrant affidavit is factual. However, unfortunately, much is police theory. Most egregiously, the timeline reported by law enforcement was not obtained through interviews with Dr. Murray, as was implied by the affidavit,\" the statement said. \"Dr. Murray simply never told investigators that he found Michael Jackson at 11:00 a.m. not breathing. He also never said that he waited a mere 10 minutes before leaving to make several phone calls. In fact, Dr. Murray never said that he left Michael Jackson's room to make phone calls at all.\" The document also cited reports from staff at the University of California at Los Angeles Medical Center, where Jackson's body was taken, who said Murray \"admitted\" to having given Jackson flumazenil to counteract the Ativan. The document lists another five doctors and a nurse practitioner who reportedly treated Jackson. \"Detectives ... believe that the miscellaneous prescriptions, from multiple doctors ... could have contributed to his death,\" the document said. \"It cannot be determined whether the cause of death is due to the actions of a single night and/or a single doctor, or the <em>grossly</em> negligent treatment of several doctors over an extended period of time.\" According to the warrant and affidavit, Murray said he was not the first doctor to give Jackson the powerful anesthetic, which the singer called his \"milk.\" The drug has a milky appearance. Jackson also told Murray about two unknown doctors in Germany who gave him propofol, according to documents. Documents show police found eight bottles of propofol inside Jackson's home. A search of Murray's doctor bag, which he left at the house the day Jackson died, contained multiple bottles/vials of Lidocaine and several bottles/vials of propofol, Ativan, Versed and Anexate, according to the documents. The affidavit said a search of Jackson's home revealed \"numerous bottles of medications\" at Jackson's bedside that were prescribed by Murray and two other physicians -- Dr. Allan Metzger and Dr. Arnold Klein. Many of the drugs \"have an indicated or off label use in the treatment of insomnia,\" the affidavit said. Metzger's lawyer told CNN last month that Metzger -- who treated Jackson in 2003 -- refused Jackson's request in April for a propofol prescription. Klein -- a dermatologist who also was Jackson's longtime friend -- has insisted he never gave Jackson dangerous drugs. Jackson visited Klein's Beverly Hills, California, medical office just days before his June 25 death. Murray took the job as Jackson's personal physician in May, as the pop star was preparing for a series of comeback concerts set to begin in July at London's O2 arena. Murray told investigators that Jackson would not tell him what drugs other doctors had given him, but he did tell Murray the medicine given to him by Klein and Metzger was not working, the affidavit said. The DEA has been unable to find a record of Dr. Murray purchasing, ordering or obtaining any propofol under his medical license or DEA number, according to the documents.",
