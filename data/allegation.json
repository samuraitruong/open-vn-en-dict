The judge said Mr Strauss-Kahn, 62, was a flight risk. He was arrested on Saturday after boarding a plane and accused of trying to rape a hotel maid. He faces seven charges and could be sentenced to up to 25 years in prison. Mr Strauss-Kahn, who had been seen as a favourite in France's 2012 presidential elections, denies the charges.  His lawyer expressed disappointment at bail being denied, but said his client would be exonerated. \"This battle has just begun,\" defence lawyer Benjamin Brafman told the court. Mr Strauss-Kahn had been due to attend an EU finance ministers' meeting in Brussels to discuss financial bail-outs. The IMF has played a central role in organising rescue packages for the troubled economies of Portugal and Greece. The BBC's Chris Morris in Brussels says the IMF chief has gained the trust of countries in Europe which are giving financial assistance, and those which are receiving it. The European Union says the scandal should not affect bail-outs for eurozone countries. Bail offer denied Jean-Claude Junker, the Luxembourg prime minister said: \"I am very sad and upset. He is a friend of mine... Mr Strauss-Kahn is in the hands of American justice, it's not up to us to comment on this, but it makes me deeply, deeply sad.\" French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde described Mr Strauss-Kahn's predicament was \"crushing and painful\".  The IMF said in a statement that it had been briefed on the charges against its managing director, and that it would \"continue to monitor developments\". Prosecutors told the court it was not the first time Mr Strauss-Kahn had been involved in such an incident and argued he had been arrested attempting to flee the country. Mr Strauss-Kahn's lawyer Benjamin Brafman contested this, saying the defendant had not tried to flee the scene and was actually rushing for a lunch appointment.  He added that Mr Strauss-Kahn later called the hotel to say he was at the airport and had left a mobile phone in his room. However, Judge Melissa Jackson denied the defence's offer to post $1m (\u00a3617,000) bail and agree to Mr Strauss-Kahn staying with his daughter in New York until the next hearing on Friday. \"When I hear your client was at JFK airport about to board a flight, that raises some concerns,\" Ms Jackson said. The charges relate to an alleged assault at the Times Square Sofitel hotel in New York. According to the New York Police Department, a 32-year-old maid told officers that when she entered his suite on Saturday afternoon, Mr Strauss-Kahn emerged from the bathroom naked, chased her and sexually assaulted her. The woman was able to break free and alert the authorities, a NYPD spokesman added. Later on Saturday Mr Strauss-Kahn was detained on board an Air France flight at New York's John F Kennedy airport minutes before take-off. The IMF chief underwent medical examinations on Sunday. Police were looking for scratches or any other evidence of his alleged assault. He was later charged with a \"criminal sexual act, unlawful imprisonment and attempted rape\". Police say the maid formally identified him in a line-up. 'Thunderbolt'   Until he was arrested, Mr Strauss-Kahn was considered a favourite to become the Socialist candidate for the French presidency next year. Opinion polls gave him a good chance of defeating President Nicolas Sarkozy.  Socialist party president Martine Aubry described his arrest as a \"thunderbolt\" but called for Mr Strauss-Kahn to be presumed innocent.  Mr Strauss-Kahn's wife, French TV personality Anne Sinclair, has also protested his innocence. Meanwhile, another <em>allegation</em> against Mr Strauss-Kahn has emerged. A French writer says she may file a complaint for an alleged sexual assault in 2002. Tristane Banon, 31, says Mr Strauss-Kahn tried to rape her when she went to interview him for a book she was writing.  \"We're planning to make a complaint,\" Ms Banon's lawyer told AFP news agency. Mr Strauss-Kahn's lawyers have so far not responded to the <em>allegation</em>.",

            "en": "Strauss-Kahn arrest: IMF boss faces new bail hearing          International Monetary Fund (IMF) head Dominique Strauss-Kahn will make a new plea for bail at a court hearing on Thursday morning, his lawyer says. Mr Strauss-Kahn, 62, faces a number of charges in the alleged sexual assault of a hotel maid in New York and was denied bail on Monday. Mr Strauss-Kahn, on suicide watch at New York's infamous Rikers Island prison, denies all the charges. The maid, 32, has said she is \"scared\" but will testify against him. Mr Strauss-Kahn's lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said the new bail hearing would be in Manhattan on Thursday morning. The IMF chief faces charges of committing a criminal sexual act, attempted rape, sexual abuse, unlawful imprisonment and forcible touching. On Monday a judge in New York denied Mr Strauss-Kahn bail - despite the offer of a $1m (\u00a3618,000) guarantee - saying there was a risk the IMF chief would flee the country. France and the US have no extradition agreement. The BBC's Laura Trevelyan in New York says the defence will offer a new package that they hope will convince the judge that Mr Strauss-Kahn will not try to flee while he prepares his defence.    That could include Mr Strauss-Kahn offering to wear an electronic ankle tag, surrendering his passport and living under very restrictive conditions, our correspondent says. 'Scared and incredulous'  Earlier on Wednesday the maid's lawyer, Jeffrey Shapiro, said that his client feared for herself and her daughter when she discovered Mr Strauss-Kahn's identity a day after the incident on 14 May. He said she had only become aware of Mr Strauss-Kahn's identity \"a day later when a friend called her to tell her, 'do you have any idea who this man is who did this to you?'\". Mr Shapiro said his client was \"scared and incredulous\". \"When she found out this encounter was with a man of great power and wealth she feared not only for herself but more importantly for her daughter.\" The woman had now been reunited with her 15-year-old daughter in a \"safe place\", he added. Mr Shapiro said she had tried to return to her home - a sub-let flat in the Bronx - but had found about 30 people waiting outside. He said: \"She has been in a whirlwind since this has taken place... She has not had a moment of peace, has not been able to return home or seek help. \"She doesn't know what her future will bring.\" Carpet examined   Mr Strauss-Kahn's lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said on Monday that the defence believes the forensic evidence \"will not be consistent with a forcible encounter\". However, Mr Shapiro said there was \"nothing consensual about what took place in that hotel room\" in New York. Police have removed a piece of carpet from the Sofitel hotel, in search of evidence to support the maid's <em>allegation</em> she was forced into an act of oral sex. Mr Shapiro told NBC television that his client was expected to testify before a grand jury later on Wednesday. The maid, from the West African nation of Guinea, told police that when she entered the hotel room, Mr Strauss-Kahn came out of the bathroom naked, chased her down and sexually assaulted her before she broke free and fled. Mr Strauss-Kahn, one of France's most high-profile politicians, has been seen as a front-runner in next year's presidential elections. His arrest has shocked France. His wife, former French TV interviewer Anne Sinclair, is thought to be visiting him in the next two days. Public opinion in France appears still to be backing Mr Strauss-Kahn, with polls suggesting many people believe he was the victim of a conspiracy - an accusation strongly denied by the accuser's lawyer, Mr Shapiro.",

            "en": "Ex-IMF head Dominique Strauss-Kahn freed without bail       \n  Former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn has been released from house arrest and had his $6m (\u00a33.7m) cash bail and bond returned amid doubts over the credibility of his accuser.  Prosecutors have agreed that Mr Strauss-Kahn should be freed \"on his own recognisance\", meaning he must simply promise to appear in court. He is accused of sexually assaulting a maid in a New York hotel on 14 May. The case is now close to collapse, US media reports say. The 62-year-old French politician - who had been seen as a leading candidate for the French presidency - appeared in court in New York on Friday over the sexual assault case.\n'Substantial change'  After assessing disclosures by prosecutors from the office of the Manhattan district attorney, a judge rescinded the strict bail terms imposed on Mr Strauss-Kahn, but did order that his passport be retained so he could not travel outside the US. In a letter submitted to the court prosecutors said that the maid gave false testimony to a grand jury, omitting the fact that she cleaned another room before alerting a supervisor to her claims of sexual assault.\n  \"I understand that the circumstances of this case have changed substantially, and I agree the risk that he would not be here has receded quite a bit. I release Mr Strauss-Kahn at his own recognisance,\" Justice Michael Obus told the court on Friday. \"In the meantime there will be no rush to judgment on this case,\" Mr Obus said.\nOn the court steps, opposing lawyers each maintained their case. \"I want to remind all of you that at each appearance in the last six weeks, we asked you and asked the world not to rush to judgement - now I think you can understand why,\" said Mr Strauss-Kahn's lawyer, William Taylor.\n  \"We believe the next step will lead to the complete dismissal of the charges,\" he added. After Friday's hearing, Mr Strauss-Kahn strode out of court smiling, with his wife on his arm. \n  In earlier court hearings, prosecutors had spoken of the strength of their case. One attorney said the proof against him was \"substantial\". Now prosecutors believe she may have lied under questioning and could have links to drug dealers and money-laundering.  But the alleged victim's lawyer, Kenneth P Thompson, maintained on Friday that his client's story was genuine and that Mr Strauss-Kahn was guilty of sexual assault charges.  \"The only defence Dominique Strauss-Kahn has is that this sexual encounter was consensual. That is a lie,\" he said. He continued at length, giving a detailed and graphic account of the maid's alleged encounter with Mr Strauss-Kahn and criticising District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr.\nMr Vance said the case would continue to be investigated, including concerns that had been raised about the credibility of Mr Strauss-Kahn's accuser. \"Our prosecutors from the Manhattan DA's office will continue their investigation into these alleged crimes and will do so until we have uncovered all relevant facts,\" he said. Mr Strauss-Kahn is to appear back in court on 18 July. Credibility doubts  The maid claims that Mr Strauss-Kahn chased her down a hallway in his expensive hotel suite in the Sofitel hotel before sexually assaulting her. However, unnamed law enforcement officials have now told US media the accuser has repeatedly lied since the alleged attack on 14 May. The officials believe the woman also lied on her application for asylum in the US, particularly over an <em>allegation</em> that she had been raped while at home in Guinea, in West Africa. \"She actually recounted the entire story to prosecutors and later said it was false,\" one law enforcement official told the Associated Press news agency. But Mr Thompson defended his client's story on Friday, offering up graphic details of the alleged encounter between Mr Strauss-Kahn and the maid.  \"From day one she has described a violent sexual assault that Dominique Strauss-Kahn committed against her,\" Mr Thompson said, adding that Mr Strauss-Kahn bruised the maid's body and threw her to the floor.\n\"She has never once changed a single thing about that account. The district attorney knows that,\" he added. Mr Thompson said that though the maid \"may have made some mistakes\", that does not mean the assault never occurred.  Following the twists to the sexual assault case on Friday, hopes among some have been raised about the possibility Mr Strauss-Kahn may once again be able to compete with Nicolas Sarkozy for the French presidency in 2012. The Socialist former Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin, said: \"It's a thunderbolt - but in the opposite direction this time.\" But it was too soon to say whether Mr Strauss-Kahn might stand, he added. \"If we hypothesise that Dominique is cleared of all suspicion and all charges, which I obviously hope will happen, then it will be first down to him to decide... and then it will be down to the Socialists to decide. \"It's too early to transform into politics what is so far a human drama which is developing before our eyes. Mr Strauss-Kahn had been under house arrest in a New York apartment since posting a $6m (\u00a33.7m) cash bail and bond in May. He is charged with seven counts including four more serious felony charges - two of criminal sexual acts, one of attempted rape and one of sexual abuse - plus three misdemeanour offences, including unlawful imprisonment.\nMr Strauss-Kahn, who resigned as head of the International Monetary Fund to defend himself, vigorously denies the charges.",

            "en": "A New York judge has dismissed the sexual assault case against former IMF director Dominique Strauss-Kahn. The move came as prosecutors cited doubts over the credibility of his accuser, 32-year-old hotel maid Nafissatou Diallo.  \u00a0 Mr Strauss-Kahn, 62, was accused in May of attacking the African immigrant as she entered his hotel room to clean it. \u00a0 The ruling means he is a free man, though he still faces a civil suit Ms Diallo filed this month. \u00a0 \"Our inability to believe the complainant beyond a reasonable doubt means, in good faith, that we could not ask a jury to do that,\" Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi-Orbon told Judge Michael Obus. \u00a0   \u00a0\u201cHurried sexual encounter\u201d  \u00a0 The dismissal of criminal charges at the New York State Supreme Court will take effect once the judge rules on an appeal against the move. \u00a0  Mr Strauss-Kahn, considered a French presidential contender before the case, arrived for the hearing in lower Manhattan on Tuesday in a six-car motorcade with his wife Anne Sinclair.  \u00a0 Outside, about two dozen placard-waving protesters denounced the result, their cries audible from the packed courtroom on the 13th floor. \u00a0 Ms Diallo claimed Mr Strauss-Kahn had confronted her in his luxury hotel suite in the city on 14 May and forced her to perform oral sex.  \u00a0 Prosecutors said DNA evidence had found that a \"hurried\" sexual encounter did occur between the two, but it did not establish Ms Diallo's claim that it was non-consensual. \u00a0 In a statement released by his legal team on Tuesday, Mr Strauss-Kahn said: \"These past two-and-a-half months have been a nightmare for me and my family.  \u00a0 \"I want to thank all the friends in France and in the United States who have believed in my innocence, and to the thousands of people who sent us their support personally and in writing.  \u00a0 \"I am most deeply grateful to my wife and family who have gone through this ordeal with me.\" \u00a0 He added: \"We will have nothing further to say about this matter and we look forward to returning to our home and resuming something of a more normal life.\" \u00a0 'Rush to judgment'  \u00a0 Outside the court on Tuesday, Mr Strauss-Kahn's lawyer, William Taylor, accused the media, police and prosecutors of a \"collective rush to judgment\". \u00a0 \"I want to remind you how uncritically the media examined this case from the beginning without even looking at the improbability of the story on its face,\" he said. \u00a0 In court papers filed on Monday, Manhattan prosecutors said they did not feel at ease pursuing the case, citing deep concerns over Ms Diallo's credibility.\u00a0  \u00a0 She \"has not been truthful on matters great and small\" and has an ability to present \"fiction as fact with complete conviction,\" they wrote. \u00a0 Medical and DNA evidence, meanwhile, was \"simply inconclusive\" as proof of a forced sexual encounter, they added. \u00a0 Mr Strauss-Kahn was forced from his job as director of the International Monetary Fund after his arrest on board an Air France jet in May. \u00a0 But within weeks, prosecutors said there were inconsistencies in Ms Diallo's accounts of the alleged assault and of her background. \u00a0 It was revealed that she had been recorded discussing the case with a jailed friend and appeared to refer to Mr Strauss-Kahn's wealth, which his supporters said pointed to a financial motive. \u00a0 Prosecutors also said Ms Diallo had not been truthful in tax documents, nor on an asylum application form in her account of a gang rape she said she suffered back in Guinea. \u00a0 Mr Strauss-Kahn was later freed from his restrictive bail conditions. \u00a0 Ms Diallo then took the unusual step of giving media interviews, defending her allegations against him, and on 8 August, she filed a civil suit against Mr Strauss-Kahn. \u00a0 The Frenchman's legal travails are not yet over: authorities in Paris are still considering whether to press charges against him over a claim by French writer Tristane Banon that he tried to rape her during a 2003 interview.  \u00a0 Ms Banon made the <em>allegation</em> after the Diallo case, saying that she feared no-one would have believed her beforehand. \u00a0",

            "en": "Allies of Dominique Strauss-Kahn eye political comeback       \nAllies of former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn have said he could make a political comeback in France now he has been freed from house arrest in the US.  Before being accused of sexually assaulting a hotel maid in New York on 14 May, Mr Strauss-Kahn was tipped as a possible French presidential candidate. But doubts have since emerged about the credibility of the maid, and the case is reportedly close to collapse. On Friday, a judge ordered Mr Strauss-Kahn released on his own recognisance. He is now free to travel in the US, although he cannot leave the country and must appear in court again later this month. Mr Strauss-Kahn, who resigned as head of the International Monetary Fund to defend himself, vigorously denies the charges. Deadline  Mr Strauss-Kahn had earlier been the favourite to be the Socialist Party's candidate for the French presidency in May 2011.  The BBC's Christian Fraser in Paris says that regardless of events in court, the expectation is growing here in France the case will ultimately collapse.  And if that happens, the only person who can rule him out of next year's contest is Mr Strauss-Kahn himself, our correspondent adds. The last Socialist Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin, said: \"If we hypothesise that Dominique is cleared of all suspicion and all charges, which I obviously hope will happen, then it will be first down to him to decide... and then it will be down to the Socialists to decide.\" A Socialist MP, Jean-Marie Le Guen, said he thought it was likely that Mr Strauss-Kahn would stand. \"Yes, he will be present for the presidential campaign,\" he said. \"If what we heard... is true, that the American justice will free him and re-habilitate him, give him back his honour and dignity. Then, since Dominique Strauss-Kahn is a fighter, he will fight in our country.\" The list for nominations is due to close on 13 July - five days before his next scheduled court appearance. But the senior Socialist, Francois Hollande, said the deadline could be extended. Our correspondent says there are though plenty in France who hold Mr Strauss-Kahn in high admiration for the way he has conducted himself in court, there is sympathy and renewed hope among his staunchest allies.  'Lie'  A judge in New York lifted the strict bail conditions imposed on Mr Strauss-Kahn, amid intense speculation that the sexual assault case against him was faltering.  He had been under house arrest since posting a $6m bail bond. When the 62-year-old appeared in court, prosecutors were forced to admit that they were reassessing the strength of the evidence against him - although the charges that he attempted to rape a hotel maid still stand. In a letter submitted to the court, the prosecutors said that the maid had given false testimony to a grand jury, omitting the fact that she had cleaned another room before alerting a supervisor to her claims of sexual assault.  \"I understand that the circumstances of this case have changed substantially, and I agree the risk that he would not be here has receded quite a bit. I release Mr Strauss-Kahn at his own recognisance,\" Justice Michael Obus told the court. The maid claims that Mr Strauss-Kahn chased her down a hallway in his expensive hotel suite in the Sofitel hotel before sexually assaulting her. However, unnamed law enforcement officials have now told US media the accuser has repeatedly lied since the alleged attack. The officials believe the woman also lied on her application for asylum, particularly over an <em>allegation</em> that she had been raped while at home in Guinea. They also suspect she has links to drugs dealers and money-laundering. Mr Strauss-Kahn's lawyer, William Taylor, said he believed the next step would lead to the complete dismissal of the charges. But the maid's lawyer, Kenneth Thompson, maintained that his client's story was genuine and that Mr Strauss-Kahn was guilty of sexual assault charges.  \"From day one she has described a violent sexual assault that Dominique Strauss-Kahn committed against her,\" Mr Thompson said, adding that Mr Strauss-Kahn bruised the maid's body and threw her to the floor. \"She has never once changed a single thing about that account. The district attorney knows that,\" he added. \"The only defence Dominique Strauss-Kahn has is that this sexual encounter was consensual. That is a lie.\"",

            "en": "Obama backs Google in dispute with China          The Obama administration has leapt to the defence of Google after the internet search giant threatened to pull the plug on its Chinese operations.  Hillary Clinton, the US Secretary of State, demanded \"an explanation\" for Beijing of Google's <em>allegation</em> that its Gmail email system was infiltrated. \"The ability to operate with confidence in cyberspace is critical in a modern society and economy,\" she said. Robert Gibbs, Mr Obama's press secretary, emphasised that the President backed internet freedom and said that Google had co-ordinated with the Obama administration before it had acted. The alleged cyber attacks have further strained Sino-US relations that are already fraying over issues of trade, currency, climate change and arms sales to Taiwan. \"We have been briefed by Google on these allegations, which raise very serious concerns and questions,\" Mrs Clinton said. Mrs Clinton had also met executives from Google and Microsoft, as well as with Cisco Systems, which provides much of China's internet infrastructure, to discuss how to stop countries from \"stifling\" access to information, the state department added. Next week the US is to launch a new technology policy to help citizens in other countries to gain access to an uncensored internet. The Chinese authorities said they were seeking clarification over Google's demand it be allowed to operate its Google.cn search engine free from the increasingly draconian censorship of the Great Firewall of China. China has spent millions trying to project it's 'soft power', however analysts said its rulers now faced a choice between protecting its power at home and suffering the embarrassment of being rejected by one of the free world's biggest brands with negative consequences for the investment climate. \"It is setting us up for a clash, and it's interesting to see who backs down. It's the US versus China, but the companies will be lobbying,\" said Chris McNally, a China analyst at the East-West Center in Hawaii.  A spokesman for Google said the company was 'in talks' with the authorities, while outside Google's offices in Beijing a handful of citizens braved the cold to lay flowers 'in mourning' at the prospect of Google's departure from China.  Despite hopes that China would start to relax freedom of speech restrictions after the 2008 Olympics, China has in fact tightened of internet controls, blocking popular as social networkings sites such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube.  The issue of censorship was raised by the US President Barack Obama on his maiden visit to China last November when he told an online town hall that he was \"a big supporter of non-censorship.\" \"I can tell you that in the United States, the fact that we have free internet \u2013 or unrestricted internet access \u2013 is a source of strength, and I think should be encouraged,\" he said.  The decision by Google to break ranks from other big corporations doing business in China and openly criticise the country's autocratic leadership comes after four rocky years during which Google was forced to compromise its core belief in the free-flow of information. Announcing its sudden change of heart on the company's blogsite, David Drummond, Google's chief legal officer, said: \"These attacks and the surveillance they have uncovered \u2013 combined with the attempts over the past year to further limit free speech on the Web \u2013 have led us to conclude that we should review the feasibility of our business operations in China. \"We are no longer willing to continue censoring our results on Google.cn, and so over the next few weeks we will be discussing with the Chinese government the basis on which we could operate an unfiltered search engine within the law, if at all,\" he said. Human rights groups, which have criticised Google's decision to submit Chinese censorship after setting up in China in 2006, applauded the company's stand. The New York-based Human Rights Watch described it as \"an important step\" to protect human rights online. \"Through international pressure, finally a big business in the West has come to realise its own conscience,\" said the prominent Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng who lives in exile in the United States after 18 years in prison in China.  \"Some Western businesses thought that by making compromises with the Chinese communists' regime, they could do business as they wished.  However, this is impossible because the Chinese government would not be satisfied.\"",
