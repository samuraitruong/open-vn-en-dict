Experts say the difference between brown rice and the more popular white rice is not just the color. White rice actually lacks the necessary quantities of over a dozen important nutrients, including vitamin E, thiamin, niacin, vitamin B1, B3, B6, folacin, potassium, magnesium and iron.  Relieve Constipation: The fibers present in brown rice, increase bowl movement, thus helping in reducing constipation. Prevention of Asthma: According to researchers, increased intake of whole grains and fish could reduce the risk of childhood asthma by about fifty percent. The numerous anti-inflammatory compounds found in fish and brown rice help in reducing wheezing Most people who eat brown rice expect to derive the health benefits that are attributed to this type of rice. Some benefits have been medically proven and research is continously being conducted to study the nutritional value of brown rice. It is widely believed that brown rice helps control blood pressure and also reduces wide fluctuations in blood sugar. The high fiber content of brown rice has a good effect on controlling cholestrol and cholestrol control is of prime importance in keeping away heart disease. The health benefits of high fiber content foods are numerous, it reduces the possibility of heart diseases, helps avoid abrupt spikes in sugar levels, helps digestion and reduces constipation etc. Some medical tests have indicated that the health benefits of brown rice could include controlling high blood pressure. Besides high fiber content, brown rice also contains other nutrients like, B vitamins, manganese, selenium and iron. By eating brown rice, you will also get the health benefits that such nutrients give the human body. Brown rice is essentially the same as white rice, in the fact that it comes from the same plant. There is no \"brown rice\" plant and \"white rice\" plant. The difference between the two colored rices is the process by which they are <em>hulled</em>. Whole grain rice consists of several layers. When only the outermost hull is removed, we end up with brown rice. It is when the rice is further milled, removing the bran and germ layer, that we end up with a whiter rice. The rice is then polished, removing the aleurone layer, giving us the white rice that we most often see in stores. Brown rice has reduces the risk of colon cancer. Brown rice is packed full of fiber. One cup supplies 14% of our suggested daily intake of fiber. Brown rice also contains Selenium which has also been shown to reduce the risk of colon cancer. It is also beneficial for stomach and intestinal ulcers, and for curing the dreaded case of diarrhea. In fact, brown rice is one of the most easily digested starches, and what's more - because of its high mineral content, brown rice supplies important nutrients for the hair, teeth, nails, muscles and bones.",
