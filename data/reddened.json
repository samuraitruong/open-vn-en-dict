You've made it through the excitement of labor and delivery, and now you're ready to head home and begin life with your baby. Once home, though, you frantically realize you have no idea what you're doing! Brushing up on these tips can help first-time parents feel confident about caring for a newborn in no time. getting help after the birth  Consider recruiting help from friends and family to get through this time. While in the hospital, use the expertise around you. Many hospitals have feeding specialists or lactation consultants who can help you get started nursing or bottle-feeding. In addition, nurses are a great resource to show you how to hold, burp, change, and care for your baby. For in-home help, you might want to hire a baby nurse or a responsible neighborhood teenager to help you for a short time after the birth. In addition, relatives and friends can be a great resource. They may be more than eager to help, and although you may disagree on certain things, don't dismiss their experience. But if you don't feel up to having guests or you have other concerns, don't feel guilty about placing restrictions on visitors. Handling a newborn  If you haven't spent a lot of time around newborns, their fragility may be intimidating. Here are a few basics to remember: Be careful to support your baby's head and neck. Cradle the head when carrying your baby and support the head when carrying the baby upright or when you lay him or her down.  Be careful not to shake your newborn, whether in play or in frustration. Shaking that is vigorous can cause bleeding in the brain and even death. If you need to wake your infant, don't do it by shaking \u2014 instead, tickle your baby's feet or blow gently on a cheek.  Make sure your baby is securely fastened into the carrier, stroller, or car seat. Limit any activity that would be too rough or bouncy.  Remember that your newborn is not ready for rough play, such as being jiggled on the knee or thrown in the air. Bonding and soothing techniques  Bonding, probably one of the most pleasurable aspects of infant care, occurs during the sensitive time in the first hours and days after birth when parents make a deep connection with their infant. Physical closeness can promote an emotional connection. For infants, the attachment contributes to their emotional growth, which also affects their development in other areas, such as physical growth. Another way to think of bonding is \"falling in love\" with your baby. Children thrive from having a parent or other adult in their life who loves them unconditionally. Begin bonding by cradling your baby and gently stroking him or her in different patterns. Both you and your partner can also take the opportunity to be \"skin-to-skin,\" holding your newborn against your own skin while feeding or cradling. Babies, especially premature babies and those with medical problems, may respond to infant massage. Massage may enhance bonding and help with infant growth and development. Many books and videos cover infant massage \u2014 ask your doctor for recommendations. Be careful, however \u2014 babies are not as strong as adults, so massage your baby gently. Babies usually love vocal sounds, such as talking, babbling, singing, and cooing. Your baby will probably also love listening to music. Baby rattles and musical mobiles are other good ways to stimulate your infant's hearing. If your little one is being fussy, try singing, reciting poetry and nursery rhymes, or reading aloud as you sway or rock your baby gently in a chair. Some babies can be unusually sensitive to touch, light, or sound, and might startle and cry easily, sleep less than you might expect, or turn their faces away when you speak or sing to them. Keep noise and light levels moderate. Swaddling is another soothing technique first-time parents should learn. Swaddling keeps a baby's arms close to the body and legs snuggled together. Not only does this keep a baby warm, but the surrounding pressure seems to give most newborns a sense of security and comfort. Swaddling works well for some babies during their first few weeks. Here's how to swaddle a baby: Spread out the receiving blanket, with one corner folded over slightly. Lay the baby face-up on the blanket with his or her head above the folded corner.  Wrap the left corner over the body and tuck it beneath the back of the baby, going under the right arm. Bring the bottom corner up over the baby's feet and pull it toward the head, folding the fabric down if it gets close to the face.  Wrap the right corner around the baby, and tuck it under the baby's back on the left side, leaving only the neck and head exposed. Diapering Dos and Don'ts  You'll probably decide before you bring your baby home whether you'll use cloth or disposable diapers. Whichever you use, the baby will dirty diapers about 10 times a day, or about 70 times a week. Before diapering a baby, make sure you have all supplies within reach so you won't have to leave your baby unattended on the changing table. You'll need: a clean diaper  a fastener (if cloth is used)  diaper ointment if the baby has a rash  a container of warm water  clean washcloth, diaper wipes, or cotton balls After each bowel movement or if the diaper is wet, lay your baby on his or her back and remove the dirty diaper. Use the water, cotton balls, and washcloth or the wipes to gently wipe your baby's genital area clean. When removing a boy's diaper, do so carefully because exposure to the air may make him urinate. When wiping a girl, wipe her bottom from front to back to avoid a urinary tract infection. To prevent or heal a rash, apply ointment. Always remember to wash your hands thoroughly after changing a diaper. Diaper rash is a common concern. Typically the rash is red and bumpy and will go away in a few days with warm baths, some diaper cream, and a little time out of the diaper. Most rashes occur because the baby's skin is sensitive and becomes irritated by the wet or poopy diaper. To prevent or heal diaper rash, try these tips: Change your baby's diaper frequently, and as soon as possible after bowel movements.  After cleaning the area with mild soap and water or a wipe, apply a diaper rash or \"barrier\" cream. Creams with zinc oxide are preferable because they form a barrier against moisture.  If you use cloth diapers, wash them in dye- and fragrance-free detergents. Let the baby go undiapered for part of the day. This gives the skin a chance to air out. If the diaper rash continues for more than 3 days or seems to be getting worse, call your doctor \u2014 it may be caused by a fungal infection that requires a prescription. Bathing basics  You should give your baby a sponge bath until: the umbilical cord falls off (1\u20134 weeks)  the circumcision heals (1\u20132 weeks)  the navel heals completely (1\u20134 weeks) A bath two or three times a week in the first year is sufficient. More frequent bathing may be drying to the skin. You'll need the following items before bathing your baby: a soft, clean washcloth  mild, unscented baby soap and shampoo  a soft brush to stimulate the baby's scalp  towels or blankets  an infant tub with 2 to 3 inches of warm \u2014 not hot! \u2014 water (to test the water temperature, feel the water with the inside of your elbow or wrist). An infant tub is a plastic tub that can fit in the bathtub and is better fitted for the infant and makes bath time easier to manage.  a clean diaper  clean clothes Sponge baths.  For a sponge bath, pick a warm room and a flat surface, such as a changing table or floor. Undress your baby. Wipe your infant's eyes with a washcloth dampened with water only, starting with one eye and wiping from the inner corner to the outer corner. Use a clean corner of the washcloth to wash the other eye. Clean your baby's nose and ears with the washcloth. Then wet the cloth again, and using a little soap, wash his or her face gently and pat it dry. Next, using baby shampoo, create a lather and gently wash your baby's head. Using a wet cloth and soap, gently wash the rest of the baby, paying special attention to creases under the arms, behind the ears, around the neck, and the genital area. Once you have washed those areas, make sure they are dry and then diaper and dress your baby. Tub baths.  When your baby is ready for tub baths, the first baths should be gentle and brief. If he or she becomes upset, go back to sponge baths for a week or two, then try the bath again. Undress your baby and then place him or her in the water immediately, in a warm room, to prevent chills. Make sure the water in the tub is no more than 2 to 3 inches deep. Use one of your hands to support the head and the other hand to guide the baby in feet-first. Speaking gently, slowly lower your baby up to the chest into the tub. Use a washcloth to wash his or her face and hair. Gently massage your baby's scalp with the pads of your fingers or a soft baby hairbrush, including the area over the fontanelles (soft spots) on the top of the head. When you rinse the soap or shampoo from your baby's head, cup your hand across the forehead so the suds run toward the sides and soap doesn't get into the eyes. Gently wash the rest of your baby's body with water and a small amount of soap. Throughout the bath, regularly pour water gently over your baby's body so he or she doesn't get cold. After the bath, wrap your baby in a towel immediately, making sure to cover his or her head. Baby towels with hoods are great for keeping a freshly washed baby warm. While bathing your infant, never leave the baby alone. If you need to leave the bathroom, wrap the baby in a towel and take him or her with you. Circumcision and umbilical cord care  Immediately after circumcision, the tip of the penis is usually covered with gauze coated with petroleum jelly to keep the wound from sticking to the diaper. Gently wipe the tip clean with warm water after a diaper change, then apply petroleum jelly to the tip so it doesn't stick to the diaper. Redness or irritation of the penis should heal within a few days, but if the redness or swelling increases or if pus-filled blisters form, infection may be present and you should call your baby's doctor immediately. Umbilical cord care in newborns is also important. Some doctors suggest swabbing the area with rubbing alcohol until the cord stump dries up and falls off, usually in 10 days to 3 weeks, but others recommend leaving the area alone. Talk to your child's doctor to see what he or she prefers. The infant's navel area shouldn't be submerged in water until the cord stump falls off and the area is healed. Until it falls off, the cord stump will change color from yellow to brown or black \u2014 this is normal. Consult your doctor if the navel area becomes <em>reddened</em> or if a foul odor or discharge develops. Feeding and burping your baby  Whether feeding your newborn by breast or a bottle, you may be stumped as to how often to do so. Generally, it's recommended that babies be fed on demand \u2014 whenever they seem hungry. Your baby may cue you by crying, putting fingers in his or her mouth, or making sucking noises. A newborn baby needs to be fed every 2 to 3 hours. If you're breastfeeding, give your baby the chance to nurse about 10\u201315 minutes at each breast. If you're formula-feeding, your baby will most likely take about 2\u20133 ounces (60\u201390 milliliters) at each feeding. Some newborns may need to be awakened every few hours to make sure they get enough to eat. Call your baby's doctor if you need to awaken your newborn frequently or if your baby doesn't seem interested in eating or sucking. If you're formula-feeding, you can easily monitor if your baby is getting enough to eat, but if you're breastfeeding, it can be a little trickier. If your baby seems satisfied, produces about six wet diapers and several stools a day, sleeps well, and is gaining weight regularly, then he or she is probably eating enough. Talk to your doctor if you have concerns about your child's growth or feeding schedule. Babies often swallow air during feedings, which can make them fussy. You can prevent this by burping your baby frequently. Try burping your baby every 2 to 3 ounces (60\u201390 milliliters) if you bottle-feed, and each time you switch breasts if you breastfeed. If your baby tends to be gassy, has gastroesophageal reflux, or seems fussy during feeding, try burping your baby every ounce during bottle-feeding or every 5 minutes during breastfeeding. The following are burping strategies: Hold your baby upright with his or her head on your shoulder. Support your baby's head and back while gently patting the back with your other hand.  Sit your baby on your lap. Support your baby's chest and head with one hand by cradling your baby's chin in the palm of your hand and resting the heel of your hand on your baby's chest (be careful to grip your baby's chin - not throat). Use the other hand to gently pat your baby's back.  Lay your baby face-down on your lap. Support your baby's head, making sure it's higher than his or her chest, and gently pat or rub his or her back. If your baby doesn't burp after a few minutes, change the baby's position and try burping for another few minutes before feeding again. Always burp your baby when feeding time is over, then keep him or her in an upright position for at least 10\u201315 minutes to avoid spitting up. Sleeping basics  As a new parent, you may be surprised to learn that your newborn, who seems to need you every minute of the day, actually sleeps about 16 hours or more! Newborns typically sleep for periods of 3\u20134 hours. Don't expect yours to sleep through the night \u2014 the digestive system of babies is so small that they need nourishment every few hours and should be awakened if they haven't been fed for 5 hours (or more frequently). When can you expect your baby to sleep through the night? Many babies sleep through the night (between 6\u20138 hours) at 3 months of age, but if yours doesn't, it's not a cause for concern. Like adults, babies must develop their own sleep patterns and cycles, so if your newborn is gaining weight and appears healthy, don't despair if he or she hasn't slept through the night at 3 months. It's important to place babies on their backs to sleep to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). In addition, remove all fluffy bedding, quilts, sheepskins, stuffed animals, and pillows from the crib to ensure that your baby doesn't get tangled in them or suffocate. Also be sure to alternate the position of your baby's head from night to night (first right, then left, and so on) to prevent being flat on one side of the head.  Even though you may feel anxious about handling a newborn, in a few short weeks you'll develop a routine and be parenting like a pro! If you have any questions or concerns, ask your doctor to recommend resources that can help you and your baby grow together.",

            "en": "11        11. COMPLICATIONS Everyone watched us as we walked together to our lab table. I noticed that he no longer angled the chair to sit as far from me as the desk would allow. Instead, he sat quite close beside me, our arms almost touching. Mr. Banner backed into the room then \u2014 what superb timing the man had \u2014 pulling a tall metal frame on wheels that held a heavy-looking, outdated TV and VCR. A movie day \u2014 the lift in the class atmosphere was almost tangible. Mr. Banner shoved the tape into the reluctant VCR and walked to the wall to turn off the lights. And then, as the room went black, I was suddenly hyperaware that Edward was sitting less than an inch from me. I was stunned by the unexpected electricity that flowed through me, amazed that it was possible to be more aware of him than I already was. A crazy impulse to reach over and touch him, to stroke his perfect face just once in the darkness, nearly overwhelmed me. I crossed my arms tightly across my chest, my hands balling into fists. I was losing my mind. The opening credits began, lighting the room by a token amount. My eyes, of their own accord, flickered to him. I smiled sheepishly as I realized his posture was identical to mine, fists clenched under his arms, right down to the eyes, peering sideways at me. He grinned back, his eyes somehow managing to smolder, even in the dark. I looked away before I could start hyperventilating. It was absolutely ridiculous that I should feel dizzy. The hour seemed very long. I couldn't concentrate on the movie \u2014 I didn't even know what subject it was on. I tried unsuccessfully to relax, but the electric current that seemed to be originating from somewhere in his body never slackened. Occasionally I would permit myself a quick glance in his direction, but he never seemed to relax, either. The overpowering craving to touch him also refused to fade, and I crushed my fists safely against my ribs until my fingers were aching with the effort. I breathed a sigh of relief when Mr. Banner flicked the lights back on at the end of class, and stretched my arms out in front of me, flexing my stiff fingers. Edward \u00a0chuckled beside me. \"Well, that was interesting,\" he murmured. His voice was dark and his eyes were cautious. \"Umm,\" was all I was able to respond. \"Shall we?\" he asked, rising fluidly. I almost groaned. Time for Gym. I stood with care, worried my balance might have been affected by the strange new intensity between us. He walked me to my next class in silence and paused at the door; I turned to say goodbye. His face startled me \u2014 his expression was torn, almost pained, and so fiercely beautiful that the ache to touch him flared as strong as before. My goodbye stuck in my throat. He raised his hand, hesitant, conflict raging in his eyes, and then swiftly brushed the length of my cheekbone with his fingertips. His skin was as icy as ever, but the trail his fingers left on my skin was alarmingly warm \u2014 like I'd been burned, but didn't feel the pain of it yet. He turned without a word and strode quickly away from me. I walked into the gym, lightheaded and wobbly. I drifted to the locker room, changing in a trance like state, only vaguely aware that there were other people surrounding me. Reality didn't fully set in until I was handed a racket. It wasn't heavy, yet it felt very unsafe in my hand. I could see a few of the other kids in class eyeing me furtively. Coach Clapp ordered us to pair up into teams. Mercifully, some vestiges of Mike's chivalry still survived; he came to stand beside me. \"Do you want to be a team?\" \"Thanks, Mike \u2014 you don't have to do this, you know.\" I grimaced apologetically. \"Don't worry, I'll keep out of your way.\" He grinned. Sometimes it was so easy to like Mike. It didn't go smoothly. I somehow managed to hit myself in the head with my racket and clip Mike's shoulder on the same swing. I spent the rest of the hour in the back corner of the court, the racket held safely behind my back. Despite being handicapped by me, Mike was pretty good; he won three games out of four single handedly. He gave me an unearned high five when the coach finally blew the whistle ending class. \"So,\" he said as we walked off the court. \"So what?\" \"You and Cullen, huh?\" he asked, his tone rebellious. My previous feeling of affection disappeared. \"That's none of your business, Mike,\" I warned, internally cursing Jessica straight to the fiery pits of Hades. \"I don't like it,\" he muttered anyway. \"You don't have to,\" I snapped. \"He looks at you like\u2026 like you're something to eat,\" he continued, ignoring me. I choked back the hysteria that threatened to explode, but a small giggle managed to get out despite my efforts. He glowered at me. I waved and fled to the locker room. I dressed quickly, something stronger than butterflies battering recklessly against the walls of my stomach, my argument with Mike already a distant memory. I was wondering if Edward would be waiting, or if I should meet him at his car. What if his family was there? I felt a wave of real terror. Did they know that I knew? Was I supposed to know that they knew that I knew, or not? By the time I walked out of the gym, I had just about decided to walk straight home without even looking toward the parking lot. But my worries were unnecessary. Edward was waiting, leaning casually against the side of the gym, his breathtaking face untroubled now. As I walked to his side, I felt a peculiar sense of release. \"Hi,\" I breathed, smiling hugely. \"Hello.\" His answering smile was brilliant. \"How was Gym?\" My face fell a tiny bit. \"Fine,\" I lied. \"Really?\" He was unconvinced. His eyes shifted their focus slightly, looking over my shoulder and narrowing. I glanced behind me to see Mike's back as he walked away. \"What?\" I demanded. His eyes slid back to mine, still tight. \"Newton's getting on my nerves.\" \"You weren't listening again?\" I was horror-struck. All traces of my sudden good humor vanished. \"How's your head?\" he asked innocently. \"You're unbelievable!\" I turned, stomping away in the general direction of the parking lot, though I hadn't ruled out walking at this point. He kept up with me easily. \"You were the one who mentioned how I'd never seen you in Gym \u2014 it made me curious.\" He didn't sound repentant, so I ignored him. We walked in silence \u2014 a furious, embarrassed silence on my part \u2014 to his car. But I had to stop a few steps away \u2014 a crowd of people, all boys, were surrounding it. Then I realized they weren't surrounding the Volvo, they were actually circled around Rosalie's red convertible, unmistakable lust in their eyes. None of them even looked up as Edward slid between them to open his door. I climbed quickly in the passenger side, also unnoticed. \"Ostentatious,\" he muttered. \"What kind of car is that?\" I asked. \"An M3.\" \"I don't speak Car and Driver.\" \"It's a BMW.\" He rolled his eyes, not looking at me, trying to back out without running over the car enthusiasts. I nodded \u2014 I'd heard of that one. \"Are you still angry?\" he asked as he carefully maneuvered his way out. \"Definitely.\" He sighed. \"Will you forgive me if I apologize?\" \"Maybe\u2026 if you mean it. And if you promise not to do it again,\" I insisted. His eyes were suddenly shrewd. \"How about if I mean it, and I agree to let you drive Saturday?\" he countered my conditions. I considered, and decided it was probably the best offer I would get. \"Deal,\" I agreed. \"Then I'm very sorry I upset you.\" His eyes burned with sincerity for a protracted moment \u2014 playing havoc with the rhythm of my heart \u2014 and then turned playful. \"And I'll be on your doorstep bright and early Saturday morning.\" \"Um, it doesn't help with the Charlie situation if an unexplained Volvo is left in the driveway.\" His smile was condescending now. \"I wasn't intending to bring a car.\" \"How \u2014\" He cut me off. \"Don't worry about it. I'll be there, no car.\" I let it go. I had a more pressing question. \"Is it later yet?\" I asked significantly. He frowned. \"I supposed it is later.\" I kept my expression polite as I waited. He stopped the car. I looked up, surprised \u2014 of course we were already at Charlie's house, parked behind the truck. It was easier to ride with him if I only looked when it was over. When I looked back at him, he was staring at me, measuring with his eyes.  \"And you still want to know why you can't see me hunt?\" He seemed solemn, but I thought I saw a trace of humor deep in his eyes. \"Well,\" I clarified, \"I was mostly wondering about your reaction.\" \"Did I frighten you?\" Yes, there was definitely humor there. \"No,\" I lied. He didn't buy it. \"I apologize for scaring you,\" he persisted with a slight smile, but then all evidence of teasing disappeared. \"It was just the very thought of you being there\u2026 while we hunted.\" His jaw tightened. \"That would be bad?\" He spoke from between clenched teeth. \"Extremely.\" \"Because\u2026 ?\" He took a deep breath and stared through the windshield at the thick, rolling clouds that seemed to press down, almost within reach. \"When we hunt,\" he spoke slowly, unwillingly, \"we give ourselves over to our senses\u2026 govern less with our minds. Especially our sense of smell. If you were anywhere near me when I lost control that way\u2026\" He shook his head, still gazing morosely at the heavy clouds. I kept my expression firmly under control, expecting the swift flash of his eyes to judge my reaction that soon followed. My face gave nothing away. But our eyes held, and the silence deepened \u2014 and changed. Flickers of the electricity I'd felt this afternoon began to charge the atmosphere as he gazed unrelentingly into my eyes. It wasn't until my head started to swim that I realized I wasn't breathing. When I drew in a jagged breath, breaking the stillness, he closed his eyes. \"Bella, I think you should go inside now.\" His low voice was rough, his eyes on the clouds again. I opened the door, and the arctic draft that burst into the car helped clear my head. Afraid I might stumble in my woozy state, I stepped carefully out of the car and shut the door behind me without looking back. The whir of the automatic window unrolling made me turn. \"Oh, Bella?\" he called after me, his voice more even. He leaned toward the open window with a faint smile on his lips. \"Yes?\" \"Tomorrow it's my turn.\" \"Your turn to what?\" He smiled wider, flashing his gleaming teeth. \"Ask the questions.\" And then he was gone, the car speeding down the street and disappearing around the corner before I could even collect my thoughts. I smiled as I walked to the house. It was clear he was planning to see me tomorrow, if nothing else. That night Edward starred in my dreams, as usual. However, the climate of my unconsciousness had changed. It thrilled with the same electricity that had charged the afternoon, and I tossed and turned restlessly, waking often. It was only in the early hours of the morning that I finally sank into an exhausted, dreamless sleep. When I woke I was still tired, but edgy as well. I pulled on my brown turtleneck and the inescapable jeans, sighing as I daydreamed of spaghetti straps and shorts. Breakfast was the usual, quiet event I expected. Charlie fried eggs for himself; I had my bowl of cereal. I wondered if he had forgotten about this Saturday. He answered my unspoken question as he stood up to take his plate to the sink. \"About this Saturday\u2026\" he began, walking across the kitchen and turning on the faucet. I cringed. \"Yes, Dad?\" \"Are you still set on going to Seattle?\" he asked. \"That was the plan.\" I grimaced, wishing he hadn't brought it up so I wouldn't have to compose careful half-truths. He squeezed some dish soap onto his plate and swirled it around with the brush. \"And you're sure you can't make it back in time for the dance?\" \"I'm not going to the dance, Dad.\" I glared. \"Didn't anyone ask you?\" he asked, trying to hide his concern by focusing on rinsing the plate. I sidestepped the minefield. \"It's a girl's choice.\" \"Oh.\" He frowned as he dried his plate. I sympathized with him. It must be a hard thing, to be a father; living in fear that your daughter would meet a boy she liked, but also having to worry if she didn't. How ghastly it would be, I thought, shuddering, if Charlie had even the slightest inkling of exactly what I did like. Charlie left then, with a goodbye wave, and I went upstairs to brush my teeth and gather my books. When I heard the cruiser pull away, I could only wait a few seconds before I had to peek out of my window. The silver car was already there, waiting in Charlie's spot on the driveway. I bounded down the stairs and out the front door, wondering how long this bizarre routine would continue. I never wanted it to end.  He waited in the car, not appearing to watch as I shut the door behind me without bothering to lock the dead-bolt. I walked to the car, pausing shyly before opening the door and stepping in. He was smiling, relaxed \u2014 and, as usual, perfect and beautiful to an excruciating degree. \"Good morning.\" His voice was silky. \"How are you today?\" His eyes roamed over my face, as if his question was something more than simple courtesy. \"Good, thank you.\" I was always good \u2014 much more than good \u2014 when I was near him. His gaze lingered on the circles under my eyes. \"You look tired.\" \"I couldn't sleep,\" I confessed, automatically swinging my hair around my shoulder to provide some measure of cover. \"Neither could I,\" he teased as he started the engine. I was becoming used to the quiet purr. I was sure the roar of my truck would scare me, whenever I got to drive it again. I laughed. \"I guess that's right. I suppose I slept just a little bit more than you did.\" \"I'd wager you did.\" \"So what did you do last night?\" I asked. He chuckled. \"Not a chance. It's my day to ask questions.\" \"Oh, that's right. What do you want to know?\" My forehead creased. I couldn't imagine anything about me that could be in any way interesting to him. \"What's your favorite color?\" he asked, his face grave. I rolled my eyes. \"It changes from day to day.\" \"What's your favorite color today?\" He was still solemn. \"Probably brown.\" I tended to dress according to my mood. He snorted, dropping his serious expression. \"Brown?\" he asked skeptically. \"Sure. Brown is warm. I miss brown. Everything that's supposed to be brown \u2014 tree trunks, rocks, dirt \u2014 is all covered up with squashy green stuff here,\" I complained. He seemed fascinated by my little rant. He considered for a moment, staring into my eyes. \"You're right,\" he decided, serious again. \"Brown is warm.\" He reached over, swiftly, but somehow still hesitantly, to sweep my hair back behind my shoulder. We were at the school by now. He turned back to me as he pulled into a parking space. \"What music is in your CD player right now?\" he asked, his face as somber as if he'd asked for a murder confession. I realized I'd never removed the CD Phil had given me. When I said the name of the band, he smiled crookedly, a peculiar expression in his eyes. He flipped open a compartment under his car's CD player, pulled out one of thirty or so CDs that were jammed into the small space, and handed it to me, \"Debussy to this?\" He raised an eyebrow. It was the same CD. I examined the familiar cover art, keeping my eyes down. It continued like that for the rest of the day. While he walked me to English, when he met me after Spanish, all through the lunch hour, he questioned me relentlessly about every insignificant detail of my existence. Movies I'd liked and hated, the few places I'd been and the many places I wanted to go, and books \u2014 endlessly books. I couldn't remember the last time I'd talked so much. More often than not, I felt self-conscious, certain I must be boring him. But the absolute absorption of his face, and his never-ending stream of questions, compelled me to continue. Mostly his questions were easy, only a very few triggering my easy blushes. But when I did flush, it brought on a whole new round of questions. Such as the time he asked my favorite gemstone, and I blurted out topaz before thinking. He'd been flinging questions at me with such speed that I felt like I was taking one of those psychiatric tests where you answer with the first word that comes to mind. I was sure he would have continued down whatever mental list he was following, except for the blush. My face <em>reddened</em> because, until very recently, my favorite gemstone was garnet. It was impossible, while staring back into his topaz eyes, not to remember the reason for the switch. And, naturally, he wouldn't rest until I'd admitted why I was embarrassed. \"Tell me,\" he finally commanded after persuasion failed \u2014 failed only because I kept my eyes safely away from his face. \"It's the color of your eyes today,\" I sighed, surrendering, staring down at my hands as I fiddled with a piece of my hair. \"I suppose if you asked me in two weeks I'd say onyx.\" I'd given more information than necessary in my unwilling honesty, and I worried it would provoke the strange anger that flared whenever I slipped and revealed too clearly how obsessed I was. But his pause was very short. \"What kinds of flowers do you prefer?\" he fired off. I sighed in relief, and continued with the psychoanalysis. Biology was a complication again. Edward had continued with his quizzing up until Mr. Banner entered the room, dragging the audiovisual frame again. As the teacher approached the light switch, I noticed Edward slide his chair slightly farther away from mine. It didn't help. As soon as the room was dark, there was the same electric spark, the same restless craving to stretch my hand across the short space and touch his cold skin, as yesterday. I leaned forward on the table, resting my chin on my folded arms, my hidden fingers gripping the table's edge as I fought to ignore the irrational longing that unsettled me. I didn't look at him, afraid that if he was looking at me, it would only make self-control that much harder. I sincerely tried to watch the movie, but at the end of the hour I had no idea what I'd just seen. I sighed in relief again when Mr. Banner turned the lights on, finally glancing at Edward; he was looking at me, his eyes ambivalent. He rose in silence and then stood still, waiting for me. We walked toward the gym in silence, like yesterday. And, also like yesterday, he touched my face wordlessly \u2014 this time with the back of his cool hand, stroking once from my temple to my jaw \u2014 before he turned and walked away. Gym passed quickly as I watched Mike's one-man badminton show. He didn't speak to me today, either in response to my vacant expression or because he was still angry about our squabble yesterday. Somewhere, in a corner of my mind, I felt bad about that. But I couldn't concentrate on him. I hurried to change afterward, ill at ease, knowing the faster I moved, the sooner I would be with Edward. The pressure made me more clumsy than usual, but eventually I made it out the door, feeling the same release when I saw him standing there, a wide smile automatically spreading across my face. He smiled in reaction before launching into more cross-examination. His questions were different now, though, not as easily answered. He wanted to know what I missed about home, insisting on descriptions of anything he wasn't familiar with. We sat in front of Charlie's house for hours, as the sky darkened and rain plummeted around us in a sudden deluge. I tried to describe impossible things like the scent of creosote \u2014 bitter, slightly resinous, but still pleasant \u2014 the high, keening sound of the cicadas in July, the feathery barrenness of the trees, the very size of the sky, extending white-blue from horizon to horizon, barely interrupted by the low mountains covered with purple volcanic rock. The hardest thing to explain was why it was so beautiful to me \u2014 to justify a beauty that didn't depend on the sparse, spiny vegetation that often looked half dead, a beauty that had more to do with the exposed shape of the land, with the shallow bowls of valleys between the craggy hills, and the way they held on to the sun. I found myself using my hands as I tried to describe it to him. His quiet, probing questions kept me talking freely, forgetting, in the dim light of the storm, to be embarrassed for monopolizing the conversation. Finally, when I had finished detailing my cluttered room at home, he paused instead of responding with another question.  \"Are you finished?\" I asked in relief. \"Not even close \u2014 but your father will be home soon.\" \"Charlie!\" I suddenly recalled his existence, and sighed. I looked out at the rain-darkened sky, but it gave nothing away. \"How late is it?\" I wondered out loud as I glanced at the clock. I was surprised by the time \u2014 Charlie would be driving home now. \"It's twilight,\" Edward murmured, looking at the western horizon, obscured as it was with clouds. His voice was thoughtful, as if his mind were somewhere far away. I stared at him as he gazed unseeingly out the windshield. I was still staring when his eyes suddenly shifted back to mine. \"It's the safest time of day for us,\" he said, answering the unspoken question in my eyes. \"The easiest time. But also the saddest, in a way\u2026 the end of another day, the return of the night. Darkness is so predictable, don't you think?\" He smiled wistfully. \"I like the night. Without the dark, we'd never see the stars.\" I frowned. \"Not that you see them here much.\" He laughed, and the mood abruptly lightened. \"Charlie will be here in a few minutes. So, unless you want to tell him that you'll be with me Saturday\u2026\" He raised one eyebrow. \"Thanks, but no thanks.\" I gathered my books, realizing I was stiff from sitting still so long. \"So is it my turn tomorrow, then?\" \"Certainly not!\" His face was teasingly outraged. \"I told you I wasn't done, didn't I?\" \"What more is there?\" \"You'll find out tomorrow.\" He reached across to open my door for me, and his sudden proximity sent my heart into frenzied palpitations. But his hand froze on the handle. \"Not good,\" he muttered. \"What is it?\" I was surprised to see that his jaw was clenched, his eyes disturbed. He glanced at me for a brief second. \"Another complication,\" he said glumly. He flung the door open in one swift movement, and then moved, almost cringed, swiftly away from me. The flash of headlights through the rain caught my attention as a dark car pulled up to the curb just a few feet away, facing us. \"Charlie's around the corner,\" he warned, staring through the downpour at the other vehicle. I hopped out at once, despite my confusion and curiosity. The rain was louder as it glanced off my jacket. I tried to make out the shapes in the front seat of the other car, but it was too dark. I could see Edward illuminated in the glare of the new car's headlights; he was still staring ahead, his gaze locked on something or someone I couldn't see. His expression was a strange mix of frustration and defiance. Then he revved the engine, and the tires squealed against the wet pavement. The Volvo was out of sight in seconds. \"Hey, Bella,\" called a familiar, husky voice from the driver's side of the little black car. \"Jacob?\" I asked, squinting through the rain. Just then, Charlie's cruiser swung around the corner, his lights shining on the occupants of the car in front of me. Jacob was already climbing out, his wide grin visible even through the darkness. In the passenger seat was a much older man, a heavyset man with a memorable face \u2014 a face that overflowed, the cheeks resting against his shoulders, with creases running through the russet skin like an old leather jacket. And the surprisingly familiar eyes, black eyes that seemed at the same time both too young and too ancient for the broad face they were set in. Jacob's father, Billy Black. I knew him immediately, though in the more than five years since I'd seen him last I'd managed to forget his name when Charlie had spoken of him my first day here. He was staring at me, scrutinizing my face, so I smiled tentatively at him. His eyes were wide, as if in shock or fear, his nostrils flared. My smile faded. Another complication, Edward had said. Billy still stared at me with intense, anxious eyes. I groaned internally. Had Billy recognized Edward so easily? Could he really believe the impossible legends his son had scoffed at? The answer was clear in Billy's eyes. Yes. Yes, he could.",
