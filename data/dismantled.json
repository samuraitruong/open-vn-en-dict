The issue of Roma (Gypsy) deportations from France has dominated an EU summit. Mr Sarkozy told a news conference that Chancellor Merkel had said to him that she intended to follow France's example in dismantling Roma camps. Mrs Merkel's spokesman denied she had discussed the issue with Mr Sarkozy. Fresh from a blazing row with the president of the European Commission, President Sarkozy has managed to fall out with his closest ally in Europe, says the BBC's Oana Lungescu, who was at the summit in Brussels.  Heated exchange Mr Sarkozy told reporters at the summit that Chancellor Merkel had said she intended to dismantle Roma camps in the coming weeks. He predicted the action could unsettle German politics. But promptly after landing in Berlin, the Chancellor's spokesman firmly denied that Mrs Merkel had discussed any so-called Roma camps with the French president during the summit or on the margins, let alone their evacuation.  During the summit, Mr Sarkozy clashed with the European Commission over the matter of Roma deportations. Since August, France has <em>dismantled</em> about 200 Roma settlements and deported about 1,000 of their inhabitants to Romania and Bulgaria. It has also evicted French nationals from illegal traveller settlements.  Earlier this week, the EU justice commissioner Viviane Reding had appeared to compare France's actions to persecutions in Nazi-occupied France. \"The disgusting and shameful words that were used - World War II, the evocation of the Jews - was something that shocked us deeply,\" Mr Sarkozy said. He then went on to have a heated exchange with the EU Commission President, Jose Manuel Barroso.  This is an unprecedented row between Brussels and Paris, our correspondent says. Mr Barroso recognised that some excessive comments had been made, but insisted that discrimination against ethnic minorities was unacceptable.  \"It is true that in the past few weeks, some things have been said that are out of order,\" Mr Barroso admitted. \"But I think we need to leave that on one side now.\" Ms Reding, the EU commissioner from Luxembourg, said on Tuesday: \"This is a situation I had thought Europe would not have to witness again after the Second World War.\" She also urged the European Commission to take legal action against France over the deportations. Ms Reding later said she regretted interpretations of her statement. Although France has deported thousands of Romanian and Bulgarian Roma over the past few years, it began accelerating the process last month, as part of a high-profile crackdown on illegal camps in the country. On Monday, Euro MPs accused the commission of failing to protect the Roma deported from France. In all, Mr Sarkozy said around 500 camps were <em>dismantled</em> in August, of which 199 were Roma settlements. About 5,400 people were evicted from the Roma camps, but the majority of those living in the camps were French nationals, the president said. The president's assertions appeared to contradict a leaked memo from the French interior ministry which surfaced on Monday. It showed the authorities had been instructed to target Roma camps, rather than deal with migrants on a case-by-case basis, as the French migration minister and the minister for Europe had assured the European Commission.  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11338112",

            "en": "Shanghai Expo Closes, China Calls it Splendid Success         A record number of visitors went to the Shanghai Expo, which officially closed Sunday. With a few words, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao declared the end of the Shanghai Expo. Jean Pierre Lafon, the President of the International Exhibitions Bureau, the organization that oversees the world expos, called the Shanghai Expo a complete success. He delighted the audience at the closing ceremony by making his comments in Chinese. Lafon says the Expo is also China's success. The Chinese government says 73 million visitors came to the Shanghai Expo, a record-breaking number. six-month public exhibition included pavilions showcasing different countries and international organizations. The variety of cultures and technologies on display were aimed at illustrating different ideas for urban sustainability. Most of the visitors were Chinese, many from the countryside, and for many it was a once-in-a-lifetime chance to directly encounter foreign places and people. At a ceremony earlier in the day, Premier Wen praised the fair as a \"splendid event.\" Wen called the Expo a \"severe test\" for China and for Shanghai. He pointed out that this is the first Expo held by a developing country, and that it took place under the shadow of the international financial crisis. U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon, who also spoke at the Expo event, praised it for promoting international understanding. China spent billions of dollars on the event, and many billions more to improve transportation and other public facilities in Shanghai. Some residents were forced out of their old housing to make way for the expo, which took up a nearly six-square-kilometer area along Shanghai's Huangpu River. All but a few of the more than 200 structures built for the Shanghai Expo will be <em>dismantled</em> and recycled or disposed of otherwise. Some pavilions will be moved elsewhere to serve as museums or landmarks. The first World Exposition was in London in 1851, which marked the coming Industrial Revolution. The next two upcoming expos are in the South Korean port city of Yeosu in 2012, and the Italian city of Milan, in 2015.",
