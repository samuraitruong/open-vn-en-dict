            "en": "Tech innovator had been battling pancreatic cancer for years Oct. 5, 2011 -- Steve Jobs, the visionary co-founder of Apple Inc. who revolutionized the way we use technology, died today after fighting advanced pancreatic cancer since 2004. The death was announced by the company he helped found. \"Apple has lost a visionary and creative genius, and the world has lost an amazing human being,\" Apple stated in a note on its web site. \"Those of us who have been fortunate enough to know and work with Steve have lost a dear friend and an inspiring mentor. Steve leaves behind a company that only he could have built, and his spirit will forever be the foundation of Apple.\" Unlike many famous people diagnosed with cancer or other fatal illnesses, Jobs revealed few details about his health after he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. That was also true when he resigned from the company in August 2011.\u00a0 Jobs\u2019 shed little insight on his condition in this excerpt from his letter to the Apple Board of Directors: \u201cI have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple\u2019s CEO, I would be the first to let you know. Unfortunately, that day has come. I hereby resign as CEO of Apple. I would like to serve, if the Board sees fit, as Chairman of the Board, director and Apple employee.\u201d He was, however, willing to talk about death, as he did in 2005 commencement speech at Stanford University. He shared his relief at the time that he was diagnosed with a rare form of pancreatic cancer -- one did not mean an immediate death sentence.\u00a0 Yet he was realistic about his future: \u201cRemembering that I\u2019ll be dead soon is the most important tool I\u2019ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything -- all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure -- these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.\u201d Legendary career In his nearly four-decade career, Jobs oversaw the development of some of the most iconic tech products of the past half century. He co-founded Apple Computer Inc. in 1976. Based in Cupertino, Calif., the company developed one of the first commercially successful personal computers, the Apple II. Less than 10 years after its founding, though, Apple\u2019s business had lost its momentum, and, in 1985, Jobs was forced to resign. A year later, Jobs helped found Pixar, the independent animation studio that produced Toy Story and its two sequels, Monsters Inc., Ratatouille, and a host of others Academy Award-winning computer-animated films. Jobs returned to Apple in 1996. The following year he was named CEO, a position he resigned in August 2011. Back to Apple During his second tenure at Apple, the company introduced the iPod, the iPhone, and, most recently, the iPad. The popularity of each propelled Apple into its current position as one of the world\u2019s most valuable technology companies. Meanwhile, its Macintosh line of personal computers has, over the past several years, transformed the company from an also-ran to a top seller in the PC market. But as Jobs was reviving Apple, his own health was suffering. Jobs' pancreatic cancer In 2004, Jobs was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer when a <em>neuroendocrine</em> tumor was discovered in his pancreas. This type of tumor accounts for 3% of all pancreatic tumors.  The distinction between types of pancreatic cancer is an important one. Whereas the most common form of pancreatic cancer is quite aggressive and deadly, <em>neuroendocrine</em> pancreatic cancer typically progresses slowly and is often treatable. \u201c<em>Neuroendocrine</em> cancer has a much better prognosis,\u201d says Rodney Pommier, MD, a surgeon at Oregon Health and Sciences University and an expert in <em>neuroendocrine</em> cancer. Pommier did not participate in Jobs\u2019s care. Jobs had surgery in 2004 to remove the tumor, after which he returned to work. Five years later, though, he took another medical leave of absence from Apple. This time, he underwent a liver transplant at Methodist University Hospital in Memphis. Throughout his illness, Jobs preferred privacy over public disclosure of the details of his condition, and the reason for the liver transplant was never disclosed. There was speculation at the time that it was done because his cancer had spread to his liver. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0",

The certificate, filed in Santa Clara County, California listed his occupation as \"high-tech entrepreneur\". The Apple co-founder died on 5 October at the age of 56 at his home in Palo Alto. No post-mortem examination was performed, and Jobs was buried on Friday. The death certificate was released by the Santa Clara County Public Health Department on Monday the Associated Press news agency reports. According to the document, Jobs had a \"metastatic pancreas <em>neuroendocrine</em> tumour\" for the past five years.  In 2004, he announced that he was suffering from pancreatic cancer. He had a liver transplant five years later. In January 2011 he took medical leave, before formally resigning as CEO in August and handing over his duties to Tim Cook.  A statement from Jobs' family said they were with him when he died peacefully. Jobs died the day after Apple announced its latest iPhone, the 4S. On Monday Apple said it received more than one million pre-orders on Friday for the device, breaking a record set by the iPhone 4 when it was released in 2010.",

            "en": "Pancreatic cancer in the limelight Pancreatic cancer has gained attention from the diagnoses of several prominent figures, including Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, who was diagnosed in 2003 and died Oct. 5, 2011. Jobs had an islet cell <em>neuroendocrine</em> tumor, a rare form of the disease. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and actor Patrick Swayze have also faced pancreatic cancer. Swayze died in 2009. The lifetime risk of pancreatic cancer is about 1 in 71. What is the pancreas? The pancreas is a 6-inch-long spongy, tube-shaped organ located in the back of the abdomen, behind the stomach. It has two major jobs in the body: to make digestive juices (enzymes) that help the intestines break down food, and to produce hormones \u2014 including insulin \u2014 that regulate the body's use of sugars and starches. Pancreatic cancer occurs when malignant (cancerous) cells grow, divide, and spread in the tissues of the pancreas. Symptoms of pancreatic cancer Pancreatic cancer is called a \"silent\" disease because symptoms typically do not present in the early stages. But as the cancer grows and spreads, pain often develops in the upper abdomen and sometimes spreads to the back. The pain may become worse after the person eats or lies down. Other symptoms may include jaundice, nausea, loss of appetite, weight loss, fatigue, weakness, and depression. Causes of pancreatic cancer Although the exact cause of pancreatic cancer is not known, smoking is the main risk factor, with smokers 2-3 times more likely to have the disease than nonsmokers. Age is also related, with the disease usually striking after age 45.\u00a0 Diabetes is also linked to pancreatic cancer, with about 10-20% of those diagnosed with the cancer having diabetes. Other risks include chronic pancreatitis and cirrhosis of the liver. And family history of pancreatic cancer, high fat diet, obesity, and lack of exercise can also play a part. Diagnosing pancreatic cancer The challenge of this disease is finding it early. A doctor cannot see or feel a tumor during a routine exam. To help make the diagnosis (and determine the most appropriate treatment), imaging tests are performed (such as an ultrasound or CT scan) to view pictures of the abdomen and determine the extent of the problem. The green region shown in this colorized CT scan indicates cancer in the pancreas and liver. The diagnosis comes from a biopsy \u2014 taking a tissue sample from the tumor \u2014 performed either with a needle through the skin or during an operation. Treatment: Surgery Surgery can cure the cancer if it has not spread past the pancreas. Since side effects depend on the extent of the surgery, the tumor is removed leaving as much of the normal pancreas intact as possible. Unfortunately, with pancreatic cancer, the malignant cells usually have spread past the pancreas at the point of diagnosis. Surgery still may be performed, even if the tumor is too large to remove. The surgery would involve procedures to help lessen some of the symptoms and prevent certain problems related to the size of the cancerous mass. Treatment: Radiation therapy Radiation therapy uses high-powered radiation to kill cancer cells. Radiation is usually given five days a week for several weeks or months. This schedule helps to protect normal tissue by spreading out the total dose of radiation. Radiation is also being studied as a way to kill cancer cells that remain in the area after surgery. Radiation therapy can help relieve pain or digestive problems caused by large cancerous masses. Treatment: Chemotherapy Chemotherapy uses drugs to destroy cancer cells and stop them from growing or multiplying. Treatment may consist of just one drug or a combination of drugs. It may be given by mouth or by injection. The drugs enter the bloodstream and travel through the body, making chemotherapy a good choice for cancer that has spread. It is also useful after surgery to kill any cancer cells left behind. Treatment: Targeted therapy Newer drugs on the market have the ability to attack specific parts of the cancer cells. Targeted therapies appear to have fewer side effects than chemotherapy and are less harmful to normal cells. Targeted therapy is currently being studied for treatment of pancreatic cancer. New anticancer treatment: Immunotherapy Also called biological therapy, immunotherapy aims to boost a person's immune system to fight disease. Immunotherapy is not yet available for pancreatic cancer, but is being actively researched, along with the investigation into vaccines that arm the immune system to attack cancer cell. Treatment: Palliative therapy Palliative therapy is used to ease symptoms and manage pain regardless of the stage of the disease or the need for other therapies. The goal of palliative care is to improve quality of life not just in the body, but in the mind and spirit. While palliative therapies are clearly appropriate at the very advanced stages of the disease, they are also helpful when given in tandem with other cancer treatments still working to fight the disease. Getting support Living with pancreatic cancer isn't easy; a support system is critical to help cope with the emotional and practical aspects of this aggressive disease.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Pancreatic cancer action network: 877-272-6226 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * American Cancer Society: 800-ACS-2345 Is prevention possible? Although there's no one definite action you can take to prevent pancreatic cancer, start by avoiding the risk factors you can control. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * If you smoke, quit now. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * If your diet is high in fat, work to eat more healthfully. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Adopt a regular exercise routine, since exercise has been shown to lower the risk of pancreatic cancer. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0",
