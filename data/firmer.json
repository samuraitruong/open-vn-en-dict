Since its acquisition of Perot, Dell is moving deeper into the IT services field, especially in the health care and government markets. Dell is looking to offer state governments a health care check-up.  On June 9, Dell officially launched its latest IT services initiative, called Dell State Health Services. Spending on IT health care is expected to increase about 4 percent in 2010, according to Gartner, and Dell and other service vendors are looking to expand their offerings in the wake of federal health care reform. In this case, Dell is targeting state governments that have to deal with an onslaught of new federal health care regulations, such as changes to Medicaid and electronic health care records. With Dell State Health Services, Dell is looking to offer IT consulting, as well as a host of hardware and software products, call center integration and data center services. While Dell has been pushing IT services and consulting for many years, its 2009 acquisition of Perot Systems for $3.9 billion gave Dell a <em>firmer</em> foothold in this market to better compete against the likes of IBM, Hewlett-Packard and IT outsourcing firms such as Infosys. With Perot, Dell also bought a company with deep ties to a number of specific vertical markets, including health care, local and state government and manufacturing. The federal health care bill allows Dell, as well as other IT companies, a way to tie in their health care and government consulting services. When it announced the State Health Services program, Dell also pointed to its own example of helping Massachusetts implement its Massachusetts Commonwealth Care Health Plan, which looked to reduce the number of uninsured in the state, while offering small businesses a way to buy health care coverage for their employees. The type of health care exchanges Massachusetts created at the state level are similar to the types of federal health care exchanges that are part of the government\u2019s health care overhaul.  For Massachusetts, Dell created hardware and software systems that addressed issues with medical billing, financial data, patient data and call center integration to make the exchange in that state work.  \"Dell is already providing consulting services to several states, and we look forward to putting our expertise in providing solutions to the nation\u2019s only state insurance exchange, as well as our experience supporting the health care and government industries, to work for other states,\" Melissa Boudreault, the director of Dell State Health Services, wrote in a statement.  Earlier in June, Dell announced a partnership with Practice Fusion to deliver new types of electronic health records to small medical practices.",

            "en": "Brown rice    health benefits of brown rice What is brown rice? Brown rice is also called 'unpolished rice' and is brown in color. It is actually how all rice would look before it goes through the entire process of polishing. Every rice grain has an outer layer of a slightly stiff cover called the 'hull' or husk. The husk is always removed from the seed for both white and brown rice. Under this layer is a thin brownish layer called the 'bran' layer. This brownish layer on the rice seed clings to the seed and is removed through a polishing process. In the case of brown rice, the brownish bran layer is left intact and only the top stiff cover is removed.  Brown rice is believed to be more nutritious as compared to white rice as, there are many nutrients in the brown layer that normally get taken off in the polishing process. When you cook brown rice, you would need to soak it in water for around 25 minutes to 30 minutes before doing the normal cooking process. If you thought that brown rice would be cheaper than white rice as it is only partially processed, you are wrong. You will find that in most shops and grocery stores, brown rice costs much more than white rice. What are the health benefits of brown rice? There are some proven reasons regarding the nutrition benefits of brown rice. The news that brown rice brings positive health benefits is fast spreading and people in many countries have started eating brown rice or at least, a combination of white rice and brown rice. The most important thing about brown rice is that it is rich in fiber which is present in the brown bran layer of the grains. The health benefits of a high fiber diet are being stressed by medical experts and this alone is a very good reason why you should eat brown rice instead of the regular white rice. The health benefits of high fiber content foods are numerous, it reduces the possibility of heart diseases, helps avoid abrupt spikes in sugar levels, helps digestion and reduces constipation etc. Some medical tests have indicated that the health benefits of brown rice could include controlling high blood pressure. Besides high fiber content, brown rice also contains other nutrients like, B vitamins, manganese, selenium and iron. By eating brown rice, you will also get the health benefits that such nutrients give the human body. Cooking brown rice. Most of us are quite used to cooking white rice and the basic concept remains the same when cooking brown rice too. However, when you make brown rice make sure that you allow the rice to soak in the water for around 25 to 30 minutes before turning on the heat. This is the right way to cook brown rice as the grains are a bit more tough and stiff. Soaking in water before cooking the brown rice helps to soften the grains. Cooking the brown rice with too much of water makes the grains stick together and feel like a paste. On the other hand using too little water to cook brown rice will, make the grains too stiff and will also not bring out the full flavour of brown rice. Many cooks would offer advise on how to cook brown rice, but it is best for you to learn the basics and then do the fine tuning to suit your taste. Brown rice storing tips. If you look at the brown rice grains, you will notice the brownish bran layer that clings to the grain. In the normal process used to get white rice, this bran layer would be taken off in a polishing process. It is this bran layer that can be affected by prolonged storage and give the brown rice a rancid flavour if stored for more than four to five months. The rancid flavour of brown rice when stored for long periods, is due the natural oils in the bran layer of the rice grains becoming stale. You can increase the shelf life of brown rice by refrigerating the (uncooked) rice. However if you make a direct comparison, white rice has a longer shelf life as compared to brown rice. When you shop for your brown rice, check the manufacturing date on the packet and choose a store that has a high customer turnaround. brown rice and white rice, a comparison. Starting off with the external appearance, white rice is white because of the full polish that is given to the rice. Brown rice can be either fully brown or be a lighter shade of brown depending on the extent to which it has been polished or whether it has been polished at all. White rice has the husk and the bran layer removed from the seed whereas, brown rice retains the bran (fully or partially), the husk is ofcourse removed for brown rice as well. Cooking white rice involves washing the rice and then cooking it, there is no need to soak the rice before cooking. Brown rice on the other hand, should be washed and then soaked in water for around 25 to 30 minutes before being cooked. Soaking is required for brown rice before cooking because, of the bran layer on top of the seed. The soaking process before cooking brown rice is meant to soften the bran layer on the seed. If you compare the texture of brown rice and white rice after cooking, the brown rice will have a much <em>firmer</em> texture than white rice. It is this nutty kind of flavour that makes people love brown rice once they have tried it. White rice on the other hand gets a little softer when cooked. Brown rice has an appetising flavour of it's own, on the other hand white rice is often enhanced with other flavours. Some Asian countries have become experts in adding flavour and fragrance to white rice. This is very rarely done in the case of brown rice and the natural flavour of this rice is one of the reasons for it's growing popularity. White rice has a longer shelf life as compared to brown rice. Brown rice develops a rancid flavour if stored unrefrigerated for more than 5 to 6 months. This is due to the natural oils in the bran layer becoming stale with time. It is something that you should remember especially if you are used to buying and eating white rice and have made a recent switch to brown rice. Coming to the economics between brown and white rice, one would expect brown rice to be cheaper than white rice as it is rice that has not been completely polished. However, the truth is that brown rice is more expensive than white rice. The reason is possibly because brown rice despite it's growing popularity, has a total consumption that is less than white rice.  Much coverage has been given in this report to the health benefits of brown rice. If you had to compare brown rice and white rice on the basis of nutrition and health benefits, brown rice would surely come out the winner. For the health consciousnes, brown rice would be the obvious choice as many health benefits of brown rice have been medically proved. Suggestions for eating brown rice. If you have never eaten brown rice before and would like to make a start, a good idea would be to mix one portion of white rice and one portion of brown rice when cooking. Gradually reduce the proportion of white rice and allow the brown rice to be the major portion in your rice consumption. You will soon start liking the rich nut like flavour and texture of brown rice. Continue with your brown rice diet and if you ever try white rice again, you will immediately feel that it has a bland and starchy flavour that does not impress you. Few people change back to eating white rice after having eaten brown rice for a couple of months. You might find that some brown rice seeds are very brown while others look like they have been partly stripped of the bran (brown layer). This is because the polish process may be completely left off (fully brown seeds) or partially done. In cases where the brown rice is partially polished, the seeds could appear to have a lighter shade of brown or even appear a bit patchy with brown and white patches. The cooking time and soaking time for the rice might differ based on the extent to which the rice is polished.

            "en": "Carry me out in your arms     On my wedding day, I carried my wife in my arms. The bridal car stopped in front of our one-room flat. My buddies insisted that I carry her out of the car in my arms. So I carried her into our home. She was then plump and shy. I was a strong and happy bridegroom. This was the scene of ten years ago. The following days were as simple as a cup of pure water: we had a kid, I went into business and tried to make more money. When the assets were steadily increasing, the affections between us seemed to ebb. She was a civil servant. Every morning we left home together and got home almost at the same time. Our kid was studying in a boarding school. Our marriage life seemed to be enviably happy. But the calm life was more likely to be affected by unpredictable changes. Dew came into my life. It was a sunny day. I stood on a spacious balcony. Dew hugged me from behind. My heart once again was immersed in her stream of love. This was the apartment I bought for her. Dew said, \u201cYou are the kind of man who best draws girls\u2019 eyeballs.\u201d Her words suddenly reminded me of my wife. When we just married, my wife said, \u201cMen like you, once successful, will be very attractive to girls.\u201d Thinking of this, I became somewhat hesitant. I knew I had betrayed my wife. But I couldn't help doing so. I moved Dew's hands aside and said, \u201cYou go to select some furniture, O.K.? I've got something to do in the company.\u201d Obviously she was unhappy, because I had promised her to go and see with her. At the moment, the idea of divorce became clearer in my mind although it used to be something impossible to me. However, I found it rather difficult to tell my wife about it. No matter how mildly I mentioned it to her, she would be deeply hurt. Honestly, she was a good wife. Every evening she was busy preparing dinner. I was sitting in front of the TV. The dinner was ready soon. Then we watched TV together. Or, I was lounging before the computer, visualizing Dew's body. This was the means of my entertainment. One day I said to her in a slight joking way, suppose we divorce, what will you do? She stared at me for a few seconds without a word. Apparently she believed that divorce was something too far away from her. I couldn't imagine how she would react once she got to know I was serious. When my wife went to my office, Dew had just stepped out. Almost all the staff looked at my wife with a sympathetic eye and tried to hide something while talking with her. She seemed to have got some hint. She gently smiled at my subordinates. But I read some hurt in her eyes. Once again, Dew said to me, \u201cNing, divorce her, O.K.? Then we live together.\u201d I nodded. I knew I could not hesitate any more. When my wife served the last dish, I held her hand. \u201cI've got something to tell you,\u201d I said. She sat down and ate quietly. Again I observed the hurt in her eyes. Suddenly I didn't know how to open my mouth. But I had to let her know what I was thinking. \u201cI want to divorce.\u201d I raised a serious topic calmly. She didn't seem to be much annoyed by my words, instead she asked me softly, \u201cwhy?\u201d \u201cI'm serious.\u201d I avoided her question. This so-called answer turned her angry. She threw away the chopsticks and shouted at me, \u201cyou are not a man!\u201d At that night, we didn't talk to each other. She was weeping. I knew she wanted to find out what had happened to our marriage. But I could hardly give her a satisfactory answer, because my heart had gone to Dew. With a deep sense of guilt, I drafted a divorce agreement which stated that she could own our house, our car, and 30% stake of my company. She glanced at it and then tore it into pieces. I felt a pain in my heart. The woman who had been living ten years with me would become a stranger one day. But I could not take back what I had said. Finally she cried loudly in front of me, which was what I had expected to see. To me her cry was actually a kind of release. The idea of divorce which had obsessed me for several weeks seemed to be <em>firmer</em> and clearer. A late night, I came back home after entertaining my clients. I saw her writing something at the table. I fell asleep fast. When I woke up, I found she was still there. I turned over and was asleep again. She brought up her divorce conditions: she didn't want anything from me, but I was supposed to give her one month's time before divorce, and in the month's time we must live as normal life as possible. Her reason was simple: our son would finish his summer vacation a month later and she didn't want him to see our marriage was broken. She passed me the agreement she drafted, and then asked me, \u201cDo you still remember how I entered our bridal room on the wedding day?\u201d This question suddenly brought back all those wonderful memories to me. I nodded and said, \u201cI remember\u201d. \u201cYou carried me in your arms\u201d, she continued, so, \u201cI have a requirement, that is, you carry me out in your arms on the day when we divorce. From now to the end of this month, you must carry me out from the bedroom to the door every morning.\u201d I accepted with a smile. I knew she missed those sweet days and wished to end her marriage with a romantic form. I told Dew about my wife's divorce conditions. She laughed loudly and thought it was absurd. \u201cNo matter what tricks she does, she has to face the result of divorce,\u201d she said scornfully. Her words more or less made me feel uncomfortable. My wife and I hadn't had any body contact since my divorce intention was explicitly expressed. We even treated each other as a stranger. So when I carried her out for the first day, we both appeared clumsy. Our son clapped behind us, \u201cdaddy is holding mummy in his arms.\u201d His words brought me a sense of pain. From the bedroom to the sitting room, then to the door, I walked over ten meters with her in my arms. She closed her eyes and said softly, \u201cLet us start from today, don't tell our son.\u201d I nodded, feeling somewhat upset. I put her down outside the door. She went to wait for bus, I drove to office. On the second day, both of us \u201cacted\u201d much more easily. She leaned on my chest. We were so close that I could smell the fragrance of her blouse. I realized that I hadn't looked at this intimate woman carefully for a long time. I found she was not young any more. There were some fine wrinkles on her face. On the third day, she whispered to me, \u201cThe outside garden is being demolished. \u201cBe careful when you pass there.\u201d On the fourth day, when I lifted her up, I seemed to feel that we were still an intimate couple and I was holding my sweetheart in my arms. The visualization of Dew became vaguer. On the fifth and sixth day, she kept reminding me something, such as, where she put the ironed shirts, I should be careful while cooking, etc. I nodded. The sense of intimacy was even stronger. I didn't tell Dew about this. I felt it was easier to carry her. Perhaps the everyday workout made me stronger. I said to her, \u201cIt seems not difficult to carry you now.\u201d She was picking her dresses. I was waiting to carry her out. She tried quite a few but could not find a suitable one. Then she sighed, \u201cAll my dresses have grown fatter.\u201d I smiled. But I suddenly realized that it was because she was thinner that I could carry her more easily, not because I was stronger. I knew she had buried all the bitterness in her heart. Again, I felt a sense of pain. Subconsciously I reached out a hand to touch her head. Our son came in at the moment. \u201cDad, it's time to carry mum out.\u201d he said. To him, seeing his father carrying his mother out had been an essential part of his life. She gestured our son to come closer and hugged him tightly. I turned my face because I was afraid I would change my mind at the last minute. I held her in my arms, walking from the bedroom, through the sitting room, to the hallway. Her hand surrounded my neck softly and naturally. I held her body tightly, as if we came back to our wedding day. But her much lighter weight made me sad. On the last day, when I held her in my arms I could hardly move a step. Our son had gone to school. She said, \u201cActually I hope you will hold me in your arms until we are old.\u201d I held her tightly and said, \u201cBoth you and I didn't notice that our life was lack of such intimacy.\u201d I jumped out of the car swiftly without locking the door. I was afraid any delay would make me change my decision. I walked upstairs. Dew opened the door. I said to her, \u201cSorry, Dew, I won't divorce. I'm serious.\u201d She looked at me, astonished. The she touched my forehead. \u201cYou got no fever.\u201d She said. I moved her hand off my head. \u201cSorry, Dew, I said, I can only say sorry to you, I won\u2019t divorce. My marriage life was boring probably because she and I didn't value the details of life, not because we didn't love each other any more. Now I understand that since I carried her into the home, she gave birth to our child, I am supposed to hold her until I am old. So I have to say sorry to you.\u201d Dew seemed to suddenly wake up. She gave me a loud slap and then slammed the door and burst into cry. I walked downstairs and drove to the office. When I passed the floral shop on the way, I ordered a bouquet for my wife which was her favorite. The salesgirl asked me to write the greeting words on the card. I smiled and wrote, \"I'll carry you out every morning until we are old.\"",
