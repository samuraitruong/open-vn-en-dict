            "en": "7 REPETITION        EPILOGUE  TREATY ALMOST EVERYTHING WAS BACK TO NORMAL\u2014THE GOOD, pre-zombie normal\u2014in less time than I would have believed possible. The hospital welcomed Carlisle back with eager arms, not even bothering to conceal their delight that Esme had found life in L.A. so little to her liking. Thanks to the Calculus test I'd missed while abroad, Alice and Edward were in better shape to graduate than I was at the moment. Suddenly, college was a priority (college was still plan B, on the off chance that Edward's offer swayed me from the post-graduation Carlisle option). Many deadlines had passed me by, but Edward had a new stack of applications for me to fill out every day. He'd already done the Harvard route, so it didn't bother him that, thanks to my procrastination, we might both end up at Peninsula Community College next year. Charlie was not happy with me, or speaking to Edward. But at least Edward was allowed\u2014during my designated visiting hours\u2014inside the house again. I just wasn't allowed out of it. School and work were the only exceptions, and the dreary, dull yellow walls of my classrooms had become oddly inviting to me of late. That had a lot to do with the person who sat in the desk beside me. Edward had resumed his schedule from the beginning of the year, which put him in most of my classes again. My behavior had been such last fall, after the Cullens' supposed move to L.A., that the seat beside me had never been filled. Even Mike, always eager to take any advantage, had kept a safe distance. With Edward back in place, it was almost as if the last eight months were just a disturbing nightmare.  Almost, but not quite. There was the house arrest situation, for one thing. And for another, before the fall, I hadn't been best friends with Jacob Black. So, of course, I hadn't missed him then. I wasn't at liberty to go to La Push, and Jacob wasn't coming to see me. He wouldn't even answer my phone calls. I made these calls mostly at night, after Edward had been kicked out\u2014promptly at nine by a grimly gleeful Charlie\u2014and before Edward snuck back through my window when Charlie was asleep. I chose that time to make my fruitless calls because I'd noticed that Edward made a certain face every time I mentioned Jacob's name. Sort of disapproving and wary\u2026 maybe even angry. I guessed that he had some reciprocal prejudice against the werewolves, though he wasn't as vocal as Jacob had been about the \"bloodsuckers.\" So, I didn't mention Jacob much. With Edward near me, it was hard to think about unhappy things\u2014even my former best friend, who was probably very unhappy right now, due to me. When I did think of Jake, I always felt guilty for not thinking of him more. The fairy tale was back on. Prince returned, bad spell broken. I wasn't sure exactly what to do about the leftover, unresolved character. Where was his happily ever after? Weeks passed, and Jacob still wouldn't answer my calls. It started to become a constant worry. Like a dripping faucet in the back of my head that I couldn't shut off or ignore. Drip, drip, drip. Jacob, Jacob, Jacob. So, though I didn't mention Jacob much, sometimes my frustration and anxiety boiled over. \"It's just plain rude!\" I vented one Saturday afternoon when Edward picked me up from work. Being angry about things was easier than feeling guilty. \"Downright insulting!\" I'd varied my pattern, in hopes of a different response. I'd called Jake from work this time, only to get an unhelpful Billy. Again. \"Billy said he didn't want to talk to me,\" I fumed, glaring at the rain oozing down the passenger window. \"That he was there, and wouldn't walk three steps to get to the phone! Usually Billy just says he's out or busy or sleeping or something. I mean, it's not like I didn't know he was lying to me, but at least it was a polite way to handle it. I guess Billy hates me now, too. It's not fair!\" \"It's not you, Bella,\" Edward said quietly. \"Nobody hates you.\" \"Feels that way,\" I muttered, folding my arms across my chest. It was no more than a stubborn gesture. There was no hole there now\u2014I could barely remember the empty feeling anymore. \"Jacob knows we're back, and I'm sure that he's ascertained that I'm with you,\" Edward said. \"He won't come anywhere near me. The enmity is rooted too deeply.\" \"That's stupid. He knows you're not\u2026 like other vampires.\" \"There's still good reason to keep a safe distance.\" I glared blindly out the windshield, seeing only Jacob's face, set in the bitter mask I hated. \"Bella, we are what we are,\" Edward said quietly. \"I can control myself, but I doubt he can. He's very young. It would most likely turn into a fight, and I don't know if I could stop it before I k\u2014\" he broke off, and then quickly continued. \"Before I hurt him. You would be unhappy. I don't want that to happen.\" I remembered what Jacob had said in the kitchen, hearing the words with perfect recall in his husky voice. I'm not sure that I'm even-tempered enough to handle that\u2026 You probably wouldn't like it so much if I killed your friend. But he'd been able to handle it, that time\u2026 \"Edward Cullen,\" I whispered. \"Were you about to say 'killed him? Were you?\" He looked away from me, staring into the rain. In front of us, the red light I hadn't noticed turned green and he started forward again, driving very slowly. Not his usual way of driving. \"I would try\u2026 very hard\u2026 not to do that,\" Edward finally said. I stared at him with my mouth hanging open, but he continued to look straight ahead. We were paused at the corner stop sign. Abruptly, I remembered what had happened to Paris when Romeo came back. The stage directions were simple: They fight. Paris falls. But that was ridiculous. Impossible. \"Well,\" I said, and took a deep breath, shaking my head to dispel the words in my head. \"Nothing like that is ever going to happen, so there's no reason to worry about it. And you know Charlie's staring at the clock right now. You'd better get me home before I get in more trouble for being late.\" I turned my face up toward him, to smile halfheartedly. Every time I looked at his face, that impossibly perfect face, my heart pounded strong and healthy and very there in my chest. This time, the pounding raced ahead of its usual besotted pace. I recognized the expression on his statue-still face. \"You're already in more trouble, Bella,\" he whispered through unmoving lips. I slid closer, clutching his arm as I followed his gaze to see what he was seeing. I don't know what I expected\u2014maybe Victoria standing in the middle of the street, her flaming red hair blowing in the wind, or a line of tall black cloaks\u2026 or a pack of angry \u00a0werewolves. But I didn't see anything at all. \"What? What is it?\" He took a deep breath. \"Charlie\u2026\" \"My dad?\" I screeched. He looked down at me then, and his expression was calm enough to ease some of my panic. \"Charlie\u2026 is probably not going to kill you, but he's thinking about it,\" he told me. He started to drive forward again, down my street, but he passed the house and parked by the edge of the trees. \"What did I do?\" I gasped. Edward glanced back at Charlie's house. I followed his gaze, and noticed for the first time what was parked in the driveway next to the cruiser. Shiny, bright red, impossible to miss. My motorcycle, flaunting itself in the driveway. Edward had said that Charlie was ready to kill me, so he must know that\u2014that it was mine. There was only one person who could be behind this treachery. \"No!\" I gasped. \"Why? Why would Jacob do this to me?\" The sting of betrayal washed through me. I had trusted Jacob implicitly\u2014trusted him with every single secret I had. He was supposed to be my safe harbor\u2014the person I could always rely on. Of course things were strained right now, but I didn't think any of the underlying foundation had changed. I didn't think that was changeable! What had I done to deserve this? Charlie was going to be so mad\u2014and worse than that, he was going to be hurt and worried. Didn't he have enough to deal with already? I would have never imagined that Jake could be so petty and just plain mean. Tears sprang, smarting, into my eyes, but they were not tears of sadness. I had been betrayed. I was suddenly so angry that my head throbbed like it was going to explode. \"Is he still here?\" I hissed. \"Yes. He's waiting for us there.\" Edward told me, nodding toward the slender path that divided the dark fringe of the forest in two. I jumped out of the car, launching myself toward the trees with my hands already balled into fists for the first punch. Why did Edward have to be so much faster than me? He caught me around the waist before I made the path. \"Let me go! I'm going to murder him! Traitor!\" I shouted the epithet toward the trees. \"Charlie will hear you,\" Edward warned me. \"And once he gets you inside, he may brick over the doorway.\" I glanced back at the house instinctively, and it seemed like the glossy red bike was all I could see. I was seeing red. My head throbbed again. \"Just give me one round with Jacob, and then I'll deal with Charlie.\" I struggled futilely to break free.  \"Jacob Black wants to see me. That's why he's still here.\" That stopped me cold\u2014took the fight right out of me. My hands went limp. They fight; Paris falls. I was furious, but not that furious. \"Talk?\" I asked. \"More or less.\" \"How much more?\" My voice shook. Edward smoothed my hair back from my face. \"Don't worry, he's not here to fight me. He's acting as\u2026 spokesperson for the pack.\" \"Oh.\" Edward looked at the house again, then tightened his arm around my waist and pulled me toward the woods. \"We should hurry. Charlie's getting impatient.\" We didn't have to go far; Jacob waited just a short ways up the path. He lounged against a mossy tree trunk as he waited, his face hard and bitter, exactly the way I knew it would be. He looked at me, and then at Edward. Jacob's mouth stretched into a humorless sneer, and he shrugged away from the tree. He stood on the balls of his bare feet, leaning slightly forward, with his trembling hands clenched into fists. He looked bigger than the last time I'd seen him. Somehow, impossibly, he was still growing. He would tower over Edward, if they stood next to each other. But Edward stopped as soon as we saw him, leaving a wide space between us and Jacob. Edward turned his body, shifting me so that I was behind him. I leaned around him to stare at Jacob\u2014to accuse him with my eyes. I would have thought that seeing his resentful, cynical expression would only make me angrier. Instead, it reminded me of the last time I'd seen him, with tears in his eyes. My fury weakened, faltered, as I stared at Jacob. It had been so long since I'd seen him\u2014I hated that our reunion had to be like this. \"Bella,\" Jacob said as a greeting, nodding once toward me without looking away from Edward.  \"Why?\" I whispered, trying to hide the sound of the lump in my throat. \"How could you do this to me, Jacob?\" The sneer vanished, but his face stayed hard and rigid. \"It's for the best.\" \"What is that supposed to mean? Do you want Charlie to strangle me? Or did you want him to have a heart attack, like Harry? No matter how mad you are at me, how could you do this to him?\" Jacob winced, and his eyebrows pulled together, but he didn't answer. \"He didn't want to hurt anyone\u2014he just wanted to get you grounded, so that you wouldn't be allowed to spend time with me,\" Edward murmured, explaining the thoughts Jacob wouldn't say. Jacob's eyes sparked with hate as he glowered at Edward again. \"Aw, Jake!\" I groaned. \"I'm already grounded! Why do you think I haven't been down to La Push to kick your butt for avoiding my phone calls?\" Jacob's eyes flashed back to me, confused for the first time. \"That's why?\" he asked, and then locked his jaw, like he was sorry he'd said anything. \"He thought I wouldn't let you, not Charlie,\" Edward explained again. \"Stop that,\" Jacob snapped. Edward didn't answer. Jacob shuddered once, and then gritted his teeth as hard as his fists. \"Bella wasn't exaggerating about your\u2026 abilities,\" he said through his teeth. \"So you must already know why I'm here.\" \"Yes,\" Edward agreed in a soft voice. \"But, before you begin, I need to say something.\" Jacob waited, clenching and unclenching his hands as he tried to control the shivers rolling down his arms. \"Thank you,\" Edward said, and his voice throbbed with the depth of his sincerity. \"I will never be able to tell you how grateful I am. I will owe you for the rest of my\u2026 existence.\" Jacob stared at him blankly, his shudders stilled by surprise. He exchanged a quick glance with me, but my face was just as mystified. \"For keeping Bella alive,\" Edward clarified, his voice rough and fervent. \"When I\u2026 didn't.\" \"Edward\u2014,\" I started to say, but he held one hand up, his eyes on Jacob. Understanding washed over Jacob's face before the hard mask returned. \"I didn't do it for your benefit.\" \"I know. But that doesn't erase the gratitude I feel. I thought you should know. If there's ever anything in my power to do for you\u2026\" Jacob raised one black brow. Edward shook his head. \"That's not in my power.\" \"Whose, then?\" Jacob growled. Edward looked down at me. \"Hers. I'm a quick learner, Jacob Black, and I don't make the same mistake twice. I'm here until she orders me away.\" I was immersed momentarily in his golden gaze. It wasn't hard to understand what I'd missed in the conversation. The only thing that Jacob would want from Edward would be his absence. \"Never,\" I whispered, still locked in Edward's eyes. Jacob made a gagging sound. I unwillingly broke free from Edward's gaze to frown at Jacob. \"Was there something else you needed, Jacob? You wanted me in trouble\u2014mission accomplished. Charlie might just send me to military school. But that won't keep me away from Edward. There's nothing that can do that. What more do you want?\" Jacob kept his eyes on Edward \"I just needed to remind your bloodsucking friends of a few key points in the treaty they agreed to. The treaty chat is the only thing stopping me from ripping his throat out right this minute.\" \"We haven't forgotten,\" Edward said at the same time that I demanded, \"What key points?\" Jacob still glowered at Edward, but he answered me. \"The treaty is quite specific. If any of them bite a human, the truce is over. Bite, not kill,\" he emphasized. Finally, he looked at me. His eyes were cold. It only took me a second to grasp the distinction, and then my face was as cold as his. \"That's none of your business.\" \"The hell it\u2014\" was all he managed to choke out. I didn't expect my hasty words to bring on such a strong response. Despite the warning he'd come to give, he must not have known. He must have thought the warning was just a precaution. He hadn't realized\u2014or didn't want to believe\u2014that I had already made my choice. That I was really intending to become a member of the Cullen family. My answer sent Jacob into near convulsions. He pressed his fists hard against his temples, closing his eyes tight and curling in on himself as he tried to control the spasms. His face turned sallow green under the russet skin. \"Jake? You okay?\" I asked anxiously. I took a half-step toward him, then Edward caught me and yanked me back behind his own body. \"Careful! He's not under control,\" he warned me. But Jacob was already somewhat himself again; only his arms were shaking now. He scowled at Edward with pure hate. \"Ugh. I would never hurt her.\" Neither Edward or I missed the inflection, or the accusation it contained. A low <em>hiss</em> escaped Edward's lips. Jacob clenched his fists reflexively. \"BELLA!\" Charlie's roar echoed from the direction of the house. \"YOU GET IN THIS HOUSE THIS INSTANT!\" All of us froze, listening to the silence that followed. I was the first to speak; my voice trembled. \"Crap.\" Jacob's furious expression faltered. \"I am sorry about that,\" he muttered. \"I had to do what I could\u2014I had to try\u2026\" \"Thanks.\" The tremor in my voice ruined the sarcasm. I stared up the path, half-expecting Charlie to come barreling through the wet ferns like an enraged bull. I would be the red flag in that scenario. \"Just one more thing,\" Edward said to me, and then he looked at Jacob. \"We've found no trace of Victoria on our side of the line\u2014have you?\" He knew the answer as soon as Jacob thought it, but Jacob spoke the answer anyway. \"The last time was while Bella was\u2026 away. We let her think she was slipping through\u2014we were tightening the circle, getting ready to ambush her\u2014\" Ice shot down my spine. \"But then she took off like a bat out of hell. Near as we can tell, she caught your little female's scent and bailed. She hasn't come near our lands since.\" Edward nodded. \"When she comes back, she's not your problem anymore. We'll\u2014\" \"She killed on our turf,\" Jacob hissed. \"She's ours!\" \"No\u2014,\" I began to protest both declarations. \"BELLA! I SEE HIS CAR AND I KNOW YOU'RE OUT THERE! IF YOU AREN'T INSIDE THIS HOUSE IN ONE MINUTE\u2026 !\" Charlie didn't bother to finish his threat. \"Let's go,\" Edward said. I looked back at Jacob, torn. Would I see him again? \"Sorry,\" he whispered so low that I had to read his lips to understand. '\"Bye, Bells.\" \"You promised,\" I reminded him desperately. \"Still friends, right?\" Jacob shook his head slowly, and the lump in my throat nearly strangled me. \"You know how hard I've tried to keep that promise, but\u2026 I can't see how to keep trying. Not now\u2026\" He struggled to keep his hard mask in place, but it wavered, and then disappeared. \"Miss you,\" he mouthed. One of his hands reached toward me, his fingers outstretched, like he wished they were long enough to cross the distance between us. \"Me, too,\" I choked out. My hand reached toward his across the wide space. Like we were connected, the echo of his pain twisted inside me. His pain, my pain. \"Jake\u2026\" I took a step toward him. I wanted to wrap my arms around his waist and erase the expression of misery on his face.  Edward pulled me back again, his arms restraining instead of defending. \"It's okay,\" I promised him, looking up to read his face with trust in my eyes. He would understand. His eyes were unreadable, his face expressionless. Cold. \"No, it's not.\" \"Let her go,\" Jacob snarled, furious again. \"She wants to!\" He took two long strides forward. A glint of anticipation flashed in his eyes. His chest seemed to swell as it shuddered. Edward pushed me behind himself, wheeling to face Jacob. \"No! Edward\u2014!\" \"ISABELLA SWAN!\" \"Come on! Charlie's mad!\" My voice was panicked, but not because of Charlie now. \"Hurry!\" I tugged on him and he relaxed a little. He pulled me back slowly, always keeping his eyes on Jacob as we retreated. Jacob watched us with a dark scowl on his bitter face. The anticipation drained from his eyes, and then, just before the forest came between us, his face suddenly crumpled in pain. I knew that last glimpse of his face would haunt me until I saw him smile again. And right there I vowed that I would see him smile, and soon. I would find a way to keep my friend. Edward kept his arm tight around my waist, holding me close. That was the only thing that held the tears inside my eyes. I had some serious problems. My best friend counted me with his enemies. Victoria was still on the loose, putting everyone I loved in danger. If I didn't become a vampire soon, the Volturi would kill me. And now it seemed that if I did, the Quileute werewolves would try to do the job \u00a0themselves\u2014along with trying to kill my future family. I didn't think they had any chance really, but would my best friend get himself killed in the attempt? Very serious problems. So why did they all suddenly seem insignificant when we broke through the last of the trees and I caught sight of the expression on Charlie's purple face? Edward squeezed me gently. \"I'm here.\" I drew in a deep breath. That was true. Edward was here, with his arms around me. I could face anything as long as that was true. I squared my shoulders and walked forward to meet my fate, with my destiny solidly at my side.",

            "en": "7 REPETITION          20. VOLTERRA WE BEGAN THE STEEP CLIMB, AND THE ROAD GREW CONGESTED. As we wound higher, the cars became too close together for Alice to weave insanely between them anymore. We slowed to a crawl behind a little tan Peugeot. \"Alice,\" I moaned. The clock on the dash seemed to be speeding up. \"It's the only way in,\" she tried soothe me. But her voice was too strained to comfort. The cars continued to edge forward, one car length at a time. The sun beamed down brilliantly, seeming already overhead. The cars crept one by one toward the city. As we got closer, I could see cars parked by the side of the road with people getting out to walk the test of the way. At first I thought it was just impatience\u2014something I could easily understand. But then we came around a switchback, and I could see the filled parking lot outside the city wall, the crowds of people walking through the gates. No one was being allowed to drive through. \"Alice,\" I whispered urgently. \"I know,\" she said. Her face was chiseled from ice. Now that I was looking, and we were crawling slowly enough to see, I could tell that it was very windy. The people crowding toward the gate gripped their hats and tugged their hair out of their faces. Their clothes billowed around them. I also noticed that the color red was everywhere. Red shirts, red hats, red flags dripping like long ribbons beside the gate, whipping in the wind\u2014as I watched, the brilliant crimson scarf one woman had tied around her hair was caught in a sudden gust. It twisted up into the air above her, writhing like it was alive. She reached for it, jumping in the air, but it continued to flutter higher, a patch of bloody color against the dull, ancient walls. \"Bella.\" Alice spoke quickly in a fierce, low voice. \"I can't see what the guard here will decide now\u2014if this doesn't work, you're going to have to go in alone. You're going to have to run. Just keep asking for the Palazzo dei Priori, and running in the direction they tell you. Don't get lost.\" \"Palazzo dei Priori, Palazzo dei Priori,\" I repeated the name over and over again, trying to get it down. \"Or 'the clock tower,' if they speak English. I'll go around and try to find a secluded spot somewhere behind the city where I can go over the wall.\" I nodded. \"Palazzo dei Priori.\" \"Edward will be under the clock tower, to the north of the square. There's a narrow alleyway on the right, and he'll be in the shadow there. You have to get his attention before he can move into the sun.\" I nodded furiously. Alice was near the front of the line. A man in a navy blue uniform was directing the flow of traffic, turning the cars away from the full lot. They U-turned and headed back to find a place beside the road. Then it was Alice's turn. The uniformed man motioned lazily, not paying attention. Alice accelerated, edging around him and heading for the gate. He shouted something at us, but held his ground, waving frantically to keep the next car from following our bad example. The man at the gate wore a matching uniform. As we approached him, the throngs of tourists passed, crowding the sidewalks, staring curiously at the pushy, flashy Porsche. The guard stepped into the middle of the street. Alice angled the car carefully before she came to a full stop. The sun beat against my window, and she was in shadow. She swiftly reached behind the seat and grabbed something from her bag. The guard came around the car with an irritated expression, and tapped on her window angrily.  She rolled the window down halfway, and I watched him do a double take when he saw the face behind the dark glass. \"I'm sorry, only tour buses allowed in the city today, miss,\" he said in English, with a heavy accent. He was apologetic, now, as if he wished he had better news for the strikingly beautiful woman. \"It's a private tour,\" Alice said, flashing an alluring smile. She reached her hand out of the window, into the sunlight. I froze, until I realized she was wearing an elbow-length, tan glove. She took his hand, still raised from tapping her window, and pulled it into the car. She put something into his palm, and folded his fingers around it. His face was dazed as he retrieved his hand and stared at the thick roll of money he now held. The outside bill was a thousand dollar bill. \"Is this a joke?\" he mumbled. Alice's smile was blinding. \"Only if you think it's funny.\" He looked at her, his eyes staring wide. I glanced nervously at the clock on the dash. If Edward stuck to his plan, we had only five minutes left. \"I'm in a wee bit of a hurry,\" she hinted, still smiling. The guard blinked twice, and then shoved the money inside his vest. He took a step away from the window and waved us on. None of the passing people seemed to notice the quiet exchange. Alice drove into the city, and we both sighed in relief. The street was very narrow, cobbled with the same color stones as the faded cinnamon brown buildings that darkened the street with their shade. It had the feel of an alleyway. Red flags decorated the walls, spaced only a few yards apart, flapping in the wind that whistled through the narrow lane. It was crowded, and the foot traffic slowed our progress. \"Just a little farther,\" Alice encouraged me; I was gripping the door handle, ready to throw myself into the street as soon as she spoke the word. She drove in quick spurts and sudden stops, and the people in the crowd shook their fists at us and said angry words that I was glad I couldn't understand. She turned onto a little path that couldn't have been meant for cars; shocked people had to squeeze into doorways as we scraped by. We found another street at the end. The buildings were taller here; they leaned together overhead so that no sunlight touched the pavement\u2014the thrashing red flags on either side nearly met. The crowd was thicker here than anywhere else. Alice stopped the car. I had the door open before we were at a standstill. She pointed to where the street widened into a patch of bright openness. \"There\u2014we're at the southern end of the square. Run straight across, to the right of the clock tower. I'll find a way around\u2014\" Her breath caught suddenly, and when she spoke again, her voice was a <em>hiss</em>. \"They're everywhere?\" I froze in place, but she pushed me out of the car. \"Forget about them. You have two minutes. Go, Bella, go!\" she shouted, climbing out of the car as she spoke. I didn't pause to watch Alice melt into the shadows. I didn't stop to close my door behind me. I shoved a heavy woman out of my way and ran flat out, head down, paying little attention to anything but the uneven stones beneath my feet. Coming out of the dark lane, I was blinded by the brilliant sunlight beating down into the principal plaza.  The wind whooshed into me, flinging my hair into my eyes and blinding me further. It was no wonder that I didn't see the wall of flesh until I'd smacked into it. There was no pathway, no crevice between the close pressed bodies. I pushed against them furiously, fighting the hands that shoved back. I heard exclamations of irritation and even pain as I battled my way through, but none were in a language I understood. The faces were a blur of anger and surprise, surrounded by the ever-present red. A blond woman scowled at me, and the red scarf coiled around her neck looked like a gruesome wound. A child, lifted on a man's shoulders to see over the crowd, grinned down at me, his lips distended over a set of plastic vampire fangs. The throng jostled around me, spinning me the wrong direction. I was glad the clock was so visible, or I'd never keep my course straight. But both hands on the clock pointed up toward the pitiless sun, and, though I shoved viciously against the crowd, I knew I was too late. I wasn't halfway across. I wasn't going to make it. I was stupid and slow and human, and we were all going to die because of it. I hoped Alice would get out. I hoped that she would see me from some dark shadow and know that I had failed, so she could go home to Jasper. I listened, above the angry exclamations, trying to hear the sound of discovery: the gasp, maybe the scream, as Edward came into someone's view. But there was a break in the crowd\u2014I could see a bubble of space ahead. I pushed urgently toward it, not realizing till I bruised my shins against the bricks that there was a wide, square fountain set into the center of the plaza. I was nearly crying with relief as I flung my leg over the edge and ran through the knee-deep water. It sprayed all around me as I thrashed my way across the pool. Even in the sun, the wind was glacial, and the wet made the cold actually painful. But the fountain was very wide; it let me cross the center of the square and then some in mere seconds. I didn't pause when I hit the far edge\u2014I used the low wall as a springboard, throwing myself into the crowd. They moved more readily for me now, avoiding the icy water that splattered from my dripping clothes as I ran. I glanced up at the clock again. A deep, booming chime echoed through the square. It throbbed in the stones under my feet. Children cried, covering their ears. And I started screaming as I ran. \"Edward!\" I screamed, knowing it was useless. The crowd was too loud, and my voice was breathless with exertion. But I couldn't stop screaming. The clock tolled again. I ran past a child in his mother's arms\u2014his hair was almost white in the dazzling sunlight. A circle of tall men, all wearing red blazers, called out warnings as I barreled through them. The clock tolled again. On the other side of the men in blazers, there was a break in the throng, space between the sightseers who milled aimlessly around me. My eyes searched the dark narrow passage to the right of the wide square edifice under the tower. I couldn't see the street level\u2014there were still too many people in the way. The clock tolled again. It was hard to see now. Without the crowd to break the wind, it whipped at my face and burned my eyes. I couldn't be sure if that was the reason behind my tears, or if I was crying in defeat as the clock tolled again. A little family of four stood nearest to the alley's mouth. The two girls wore crimson dresses, with matching ribbons tying their dark hair back. The father wasn't tall. It seemed like I could see something bright in the shadows, just over his shoulder. I hurtled toward them, trying to see past the stinging tears. The clock tolled, and the littlest girl clamped her hands over her ears. The older girl, just waist high on her mother, hugged her mother's leg and stared into the shadows behind them. As I watched, she tugged on her mother's elbow and pointed toward the darkness. The clock tolled, and I was so close now. I was close enough to hear her high-pitched voice. Her father stared at me in surprise as I bore down on them, rasping out Edward's name over and over again. The older girl giggled and said something to her mother, gesturing toward the shadows again impatiently. I swerved around the father\u2014he clutched the baby out of my way\u2014and sprinted for the gloomy breach behind them as the clock tolled over my head. \"Edward, no!\" I screamed, but my voice was lost in the roar of the chime. I could see him now. And I could see that he could not see me. It was really him, no hallucination this time. And I realized that my delusions were more flawed than I'd realized; they'd never done him justice. Edward stood, motionless as a statue, just a few feet from the mouth of the alley. His eyes were closed, the rings underneath them deep purple, his arms relaxed at his sides, his palms turned forward. His expression was very peaceful, like he was dreaming pleasant things. The marble skin of his chest was bare\u2014there was a small pile of white fabric at his feet. The light reflecting from the pavement of the square gleamed dimly from his skin. I'd never seen anything more beautiful\u2014even as I ran, gasping and screaming, I could appreciate that. And the last seven months meant nothing. And his words in the forest meant nothing. And it did not matter if he did not want me. I would never want anything but him, no matter how long I lived. The clock tolled, and he took a large stride toward the light. \"No!\" I screamed. \"Edward, look at me!\" He wasn't listening. He smiled very slightly. He raised his foot to take the step that would put him directly in the path of the sun. I slammed into him so hard that the force would have hurled me to the ground if his arms hadn't caught me and held me up. It knocked my breath out of me and snapped my head back. His dark eyes opened slowly as the clock tolled again. He looked down at me with quiet surprise. \"Amazing,\" he said, his exquisite voice full of wonder, slightly amused. \"Carlisle was right.\" \"Edward,\" I tried to gasp, but my voice had no sound. \"You've got to get back into the shadows. You have to move!\" He seemed bemused. His hand brushed softly against my cheek. He didn't appear to notice that I was trying to force him back. I could have been pushing against the alley walls for all the progress I was making. The clock tolled, but he didn't react. It was very strange, for I knew we were both in mortal danger. Still, in that instant, I felt well. Whole. I could feel my heart racing in my chest, the blood pulsing hot and fast through my veins again. My lungs filled deep with the sweet scent that came off his skin. It was like there had never been any hole in my chest. I was perfect\u2014not healed, but as if there had been no wound in the first place. d\u1ec5 ch\u1ecbu \"I can't believe how quick it was. I didn't feel a thing\u2014they're very good,\" he mused, closing his eyes again and pressing his lips against my hair. His voice was like honey and velvet. \"Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath, hath had no power yet upon thy beauty,\" he murmured, and I recognized the line spoken by Romeo in the tomb. The clock boomed out its final chime \"You smell just exactly the same as always,\" he went on. \"So maybe this is hell. I don't care. I'll take it.\" \"I'm not dead,\" I interrupted. \"And neither are you! Please Edward, we have to move. They can't be far away!\" I struggled in his arms, and his brow furrowed in confusion. \"What was that?\" he asked politely. \"We're not dead, not yet! But we have to get out of here before the Volturi\u2014\" Comprehension flickered on his face as I spoke. Before I could finish, he suddenly yanked me away from the edge of the shadows, spinning me effortlessly so that my back was tight against the brick wall, and his back was to me as he faced away into the alley. His arms spread wide, protectively, in front of me. I peeked under his arm to see two dark shapes detach themselves from the gloom. \"Greetings, gentlemen,\" Edward's voice was calm and pleasant, on the surface. \"I don't think I'll be requiring your services today. I would appreciate it very much, however, if you would send my thanks to your masters.\" \"Shall we take this conversation to a more appropriate venue?\" a smooth voice whispered menacingly. \"I don't believe that will be necessary.\" Edward's voice was harder now. \"I know your instructions, Felix.\u00a0 I haven't broken any rules.\" \"Felix merely meant to point out the proximity of the sun,\" the other shadow said in a soothing tone. They were both concealed within smoky gray cloaks that reached to the ground and undulated in the wind. \"Let us seek better cover.\" \"I'll be right behind you,\" Edward said dryly. \"Bella, why don't you go back to the square and enjoy the festival?\" \"No, bring the girl,\" the first shadow said, somehow injecting a leer into his whisper. \"I don't think so.\" The pretense of civility disappeared. Edward's voice was flat and icy. His weight shifted infinitesimally, and I could see that he was preparing to fight. \"No.\" I mouthed the word. \"Shh,\" he murmured, only for me. \"Felix,\" the second, more reasonable shadow cautioned. \"Not here.\" He turned to Edward. \"Aro would simply like to speak with you again, if you have decided not to force our hand after all.\" \"Certainly,\" Edward agreed. '\"But the girl goes free.\" \"I'm afraid that's not possible,\" the polite shadow said regretfully. \"We do have rules to obey.\" \"Then I'm afraid that I'll be unable to accept Aro's invitation, Demetri.\" \"That's just fine,\" Felix purred. My eyes were adjusting to the deep shade, and I could see that Felix was very big, tall and thick through the shoulders. His size reminded me of Emmett. \"Aro will be disappointed,\" Demetri sighed. \"I'm sure he'll survive the letdown,\" Edward replied. Felix and Demetri stole closer toward the mouth of the alley, spreading out slightly so they could come at Edward from two sides. They meant to force him deeper into the alley, to avoid a scene. No reflected light found access to their skin; they were safe inside their cloaks. Edward didn't move an inch. He was dooming himself by protecting me. Abruptly, Edward's head whipped around, toward the darkness of the winding alley, and Demetri and Felix did the same, in response to some sound or movement too subtle for my senses. \"Let's behave ourselves, shall we?\" a lilting voice suggested. \"There are ladies present.\" Alice tripped lightly to Edward's side, her stance casual. There was no hint of any underlying tension. She looked so tiny, so fragile. Her little arms swung like a child's. Yet Demetri and Felix both straightened up, their cloaks swirling slightly as a gust of wind funneled through the alley. Felix's face soured. Apparently, they didn't like even numbers. \"We're not alone,\" she reminded them. Demetri glanced over his shoulder. A few yards into the square, the little family, with the girls in their red dresses, was watching us. The mother was speaking urgently to her husband, her eyes on the five of us. She looked away when Demetri met her gaze. The man walked a few steps farther into the plaza, and tapped one of the red-blazered men on the shoulder. Demetri shook his head. \"Please, Edward, let's be reasonable,\" he said. \"Let's,\" Edward agreed. \"And we'll leave quietly now, with no one the wiser.\" Demetri sighed in frustration. \"At least let us discuss this more privately.\" Six men in red now joined the family as they watched us with anxious expressions. I was very conscious of Edward's protective stance in front of me\u2014sure that this was what caused their alarm. I wanted to scream to them to run. Edward's teeth came together audibly. \"No.\" Felix smiled. \"Enough.\" The voice was high, reedy, and n came from behind us. I peeked under Edward's other arm to see a small, dark shape coming toward us. By the way the edges billowed, I knew it would be another one of them. Who else? At first I thought it was a young boy. The newcomer was as tiny as Alice, with lank, pale brown hair trimmed short. The body under the cloak\u2014which was darker, almost black\u2014was slim and androgynous. But the face was too pretty for a boy. The wide-eyed, full-lipped face would make a Botticelli angel look like a gargoyle. Even allowing for the dull crimson irises. Her size was so insignificant that the reaction to her appearance confused me. Felix and Demetri relaxed immediately, stepping back from their offensive positions to blend again with the shadows of the overhanging walls. Edward dropped his arms and relaxed his position as well\u2014but in defeat. \"Jane,\" he sighed in recognition and resignation. Alice folded her arms across her chest, her expression impassive. \"Follow me,\" Jane spoke again, her childish voice a monotone. She turned her back on us and drifted silently into the dark. Felix gestured for us to go first, smirking. Alice walked after the little Jane at once. Edward wrapped his arm around my waist and pulled me along beside her. The alley angled slightly downward as it narrowed. I looked up at him with frantic questions in my eyes, but he just shook his head. Though I couldn't hear the others behind us, I was sure they were there. \"Well, Alice,\" Edward said conversationally as we walked. \"I suppose I shouldn't be surprised to see you here.\" \"It was my mistake,\" Alice answered in the same tone. \"It was my job to set it right.\" \"What happened?\" His voice was polite, as if he were barely interested. I imagined this was due to the listening ears behind us. \"It's a long story.\" Alice's eyes flickered toward me and away. \"In summary, she did jump off a cliff, but she wasn't trying to kill herself. Bella's all about the extreme sports these days.\" I flushed and turned my eyes straight ahead, looking after the dark shadow that I could no longer see. I could imagine what he was hearing in Alice's thoughts now. Near-drownings, stalking vampires, werewolf friends\u2026 \"Hm,\" Edward said curtly, and the casual tone of his voice was gone. There was a loose curve to the alley, still slanting downward, so I didn't see the squared-off dead end coming until we reached the flat, windowless, brick face. The little one called Jane was nowhere to be seen. Alice didn't hesitate, didn't break pace as she strode toward the wall. Then, with easy grace, she slid down an open hole in the street. It looked like a drain, sunk into the lowest point of the paving. I hadn't noticed it until Alice disappeared, but the grate was halfway pushed aside. The hole was small, and black. I balked. \"It's all right, Bella,\" Edward said in a low voice. \"Alice will catch you.\" I eyed the hole doubtfully. I imagine he would have gone first, if Demetri and Felix hadn't been waiting, smug and silent, behind us. I crouched down, swinging my legs into the narrow gap. \"Alice?\" I whispered, voice trembling. \"I'm right here, Bella,\" she reassured me. Her voice came from too far below to make me feel better. Edward took my wrists\u2014his hands felt like stones in winter\u2014and lowered me into the blackness. \"Ready?\" he asked. \"Drop her,\" Alice called. I closed my eyes so I couldn't see the darkness, scrunching them together in terror, clamping my mouth shut so I wouldn't scream. Edward let me fall. It was silent and short. The air whipped past me for just half a second, and then, with a huff as I exhaled, Alice's waiting arms caught me. I was going to have bruises; her arms were very hard. She stood me upright. It was dim, but not black at the bottom. The light from the hole above provided a faint glow, reflecting wetly from the stones under my feet. The light vanished for a second, and then Edward was a faint, white radiance beside me. He put his arm around me, holding me close to his side, and began to tow me swiftly forward. I wrapped both arms around his cold waist, and tripped and stumbled my way across the uneven stone surface.  The sound of the heavy grate sliding over the drain hole behind us rang with metallic finality. The dim light from the street was quickly lost in the gloom. The sound of my staggering footsteps echoed through the black space; it sounded very wide, but I couldn't be sure. There were no sounds other than my frantic heartbeat and my feet on the wet stones\u2014except for once, when an impatient sigh whispered from behind me. Edward held me tightly. He reached his free hand across his body to hold my face, too, his smooth thumb tracing across my lips. Now and then, I felt his face press into my hair. I realized that this was the only reunion we would get, and I clutched myself closer to him.  For now, it felt like he wanted me, and that was enough to offset the horror of the subterranean tunnel and the prowling vampires behind us. It was probably no more than guilt\u2014the same guilt that compelled him to come here to die when he'd believed that it was his fault that I'd killed myself. But I felt his lips press silently against my forehead, and I didn't care what the motivation was. At least I could be with him again before I died. That was better than a long life. I wished I could ask him exactly what was going to happen now. I wanted desperately to know how we were going to die\u2014as if that would somehow make it better, knowing in advance. But I couldn't speak, even in a whisper, surrounded as we were. The others could hear everything\u2014my every breath, my every heartbeat. The path beneath our feet continued to slant downward, taking us deeper into the ground, and it made me claustrophobic. Only Edward's hand, soothing against my face, kept me from screaming out loud. I couldn't tell where the light was coming from, but it slowly turned dark gray instead of black. We were in a low, arched tunnel. Long trails of ebony moisture seeped down the gray stones, like they were bleeding ink. I was shaking, and I thought it was from fear. It wasn't until my teeth started to chatter together that I realized I was cold. My clothes were still wet, and the temperature underneath the city was wintry. As was Edward's skin. He realized this at the same time I did, and let go of me, keeping only my hand. \"N-n-no,\" I chattered, throwing my arms around him. I didn't care if I froze. Who knew how long we had left? His cold hand chafed against my arm, trying to warm me with the friction. We hurried through the tunnel, or it felt like hurrying to me. My slow progress irritated someone\u2014I guessed Felix\u2014and I heard him heave a sigh now and then. At the end of the tunnel was a grate\u2014the iron bars were rusting, but thick as my arm. A small door made of thinner, interlaced bars was standing open. Edward ducked through and hurried on to a larger, brighter stone room. The grille slammed shut with a clang, followed by the snap of a lock. I was too afraid to look behind me. On the other side of the long room was a low, heavy wooden door. It was very thick\u2014as I could tell because it, too, stood open. We stepped through the door, and I glanced around me in surprise, relaxing automatically. Beside me, Edward tensed, his jaw clenched tight.",

            "en": "12        12. BALANCING \"Billy!\" Charlie called as soon as he got out of the car. I turned toward the house, beckoning to Jacob as I ducked under the porch. I heard Charlie greeting them loudly behind me. \"I'm going to pretend I didn't see you behind the wheel, Jake,\" he said disapprovingly. \"We get permits early on the rez,\" Jacob said while I unlocked the door and flicked on the porch light. \"Sure you do,\" Charlie laughed. \"I have to get around somehow.\" I recognized Billy's resonant voice easily, despite the years. The sound of it made me feel suddenly younger, a child. I went inside, leaving the door open behind me and turning on lights before I hung up my jacket. Then I stood in the door, watching anxiously as Charlie and Jacob helped Billy out of the car and into his wheelchair. I backed out of the way as the three of them hurried in, shaking off the rain. \"This is a surprise,\" Charlie was saying. \"It's been too long,\" Billy answered. \"I hope it's not a bad time.\" His dark eyes flashed up to me again, their expression unreadable. \"No, it's great. I hope you can stay for the game.\" Jacob grinned. \"I think that's the plan \u2014 our TV broke last week.\" Billy made a face at his son. \"And, of course, Jacob was anxious to see Bella again,\" he added. Jacob scowled and ducked his head while I fought back a surge of remorse. Maybe I'd been too convincing on the beach. \"Are you hungry?\" I asked, turning toward the kitchen. I was eager to escape Billy's searching gaze. \"Naw, we ate just before we came,\" Jacob answered. \"How about you, Charlie?\" I called over my shoulder as I fled around the corner. \"Sure,\" he replied, his voice moving in the direction of the front room and the TV. I could hear Billy's chair follow. The grilled cheese sandwiches were in the frying pan and I was slicing up a tomato when I sensed someone behind me. \"So, how are things?\" Jacob asked. \"Pretty good.\" I smiled. His enthusiasm was hard to resist. \"How about you? Did you finish your car?\" \"No.\" He frowned. \"I still need parts. We borrowed that one.\" He pointed with his thumb in the direction of the front yard. \"Sorry. I haven't seen any\u2026 what was it you were looking for?\" \"Master cylinder.\" He grinned. \"Is something wrong with the truck?\" he added suddenly. \"No.\" \"Oh. I just wondered because you weren't driving it.\" I stared down at the pan, pulling up the edge of a sandwich to check the bottom side. \"I got a ride with a friend.\" \"Nice ride.\" Jacob's voice was admiring. \"I didn't recognize the driver, though. I thought I knew most of the kids around here.\" I nodded noncommittally, keeping my eyes down as I flipped sandwiches. \"My dad seemed to know him from somewhere.\" \"Jacob, could you hand me some plates? They're in the cupboard over the sink.\" \"Sure.\" He got the plates in silence. I hoped he would let it drop now. \"So who was it?\" he asked, setting two plates on the counter next to me. I sighed in defeat. \"Edward Cullen.\" To my surprise, he laughed. I glanced up at him. He looked a little embarrassed. \"Guess that explains it, then,\" he said. \"I wondered why my dad was acting so strange.\" \"That's right.\" I faked an innocent expression. \"He doesn't like the Cullens.\" \"Superstitious old man,\" Jacob muttered under his breath. \"You don't think he'd say anything to Charlie?\" I couldn't help asking, the words coming out in a low rush.  Jacob stared at me for a moment, and I couldn't read the expression in his dark eyes. \"I doubt it,\" he finally answered. \"I think Charlie chewed him out pretty good last time. They haven't spoken much since \u2014 tonight is sort of a reunion, I think. I don't think he'd bring it up again.\" \"Oh,\" I said, trying to sound indifferent. I stayed in the front room after I carried the food out to Charlie, pretending to watch the game while Jacob chattered at me. I was really listening to the men's conversation, watching for any sign that Billy was about to rat me out, trying to think of ways to stop him if he began. It was a long night. I had a lot of homework that was going undone, but I was afraid to leave Billy alone with Charlie. Finally, the game ended. \"Are you and your friends coming back to the beach soon?\" Jacob asked as he pushed his father over the lip of the threshold. \"I'm not sure,\" I hedged. \"That was fun, Charlie,\" Billy said. \"Come up for the next game,\" Charlie encouraged. \"Sure, sure,\" Billy said. \"We'll be here. Have a good night.\" His eyes shifted to mine, and his smile disappeared. \"You take care, Bella,\" he added seriously. \"Thanks,\" I muttered, looking away. I headed for the stairs while Charlie waved from the doorway. \"Wait, Bella,\" he said. I cringed. Had Billy gotten something in before I'd joined them in the living room? But Charlie was relaxed, still grinning from the unexpected visit. \"I didn't get a chance to talk to you tonight. How was your day?\" \"Good.\" I hesitated with one foot on the first stair, searching for details I could safely share. \"My badminton team won all four games.\" \"Wow, I didn't know you could play badminton.\" \"Well, actually I can't, but my partner is really good,\" I admitted . \"Who is it?\" he asked with token interest. \"Um\u2026 Mike Newton,\" I told him reluctantly. \"Oh yeah \u2014 you said you were friends with the Newton kid.\" He perked up. \"Nice family.\" He mused for a minute. \"Why didn't you ask him to the dance this weekend?\" \"Dad!\" I groaned. \"He's kind of dating my friend Jessica. Besides, you know I can't dance.\" \"Oh yeah,\" he muttered. Then he smiled at me apologetically. \"So I guess it's good you'll be gone Saturday\u2026 I've made plans to go fishing with the guys from the station. The weather's supposed to be real warm. But if you wanted to put your trip off till someone could go with you, I'd stay home. I know I leave you here alone too much.\" \"Dad, you're doing a great job.\" I smiled, hoping my relief didn't show. \"I've never minded being alone \u2014 I'm too much like you.\" I winked at him, and he smiled his crinkly-eyed smile. I slept better that night, too tired to dream again. When I woke to the pearl gray morning, my mood was blissful. The tense evening with Billy and Jacob seemed harmless enough now; I decided to forget it completely.  I caught myself whistling while I was pulling the front part of my hair back into a barrette, and later again as I skipped down the stairs. Charlie noticed. \"You're cheerful this morning,\" he commented over breakfast. I shrugged. \"It's Friday.\" I hurried so I would be ready to go the second Charlie left. I had my bag ready, shoes on, teeth brushed, but even though I rushed to the door as soon as I was sure Charlie would be out of sight, Edward was faster. He was waiting in his shiny car, windows down, engine off. I didn't hesitate this time, climbing in the passenger side quickly, the sooner to see his face. He grinned his crooked smile at me, stopping my breath and my heart. I couldn't imagine how an angel could be any more glorious. There was nothing about him that could be improved upon. \"How did you sleep?\" he asked. I wondered if he had any idea how appealing his voice was. \"Fine. How was your night?\" \"Pleasant.\" His smile was amused; I felt like I was missing an inside joke. \"Can I ask what you did?\" I asked. \"No.\" He grinned. \"Today is still mine.\" He wanted to know about people today: more about Ren\u00e9e, her hobbies, what we'd done in our free time together. And then the one grandmother I'd known, my few school friends \u2014 embarrassing me when he asked about boys I'd dated. I was relieved that I'd never really dated anyone, so that particular conversation couldn't last long. He seemed as surprised as Jessica and Angela by my lack of romantic history. \"So you never met anyone you wanted?\" he asked in a serious tone that made me wonder what he was thinking about. I was grudgingly honest. \"Not in Phoenix.\" His lips pressed together into a hard line. We were in the cafeteria at this point. The day had sped by in the blur that was rapidly becoming routine. I took advantage of his brief pause to take a bite of my bagel. \"I should have let you drive yourself today,\" he announced, apropos of nothing, while I chewed. \"Why?\" I demanded. \"I'm leaving with Alice after lunch.\" \"Oh.\" I blinked, bewildered and disappointed. \"That's okay, it's not that far of a walk.\" He frowned at me impatiently. \"I'm not going to make you walk home. We'll go get your truck and leave it here for you.\" \"I don't have my key with me,\" I sighed. \"I really don't mind walking.\" What I minded was losing my time with him. He shook his head. \"Your truck will be here, and the key will be in the ignition \u2014 unless you're afraid someone might steal it.\" He laughed at the thought. \"All right,\" I agreed, pursing my lips. I was pretty sure my key was in the pocket of a pair of jeans I wore Wednesday, under a pile of clothes in the laundry room. Even if he broke into my house, or whatever he was planning, he'd never find it. He seemed to feel the challenge in my consent. He smirked, overconfident. \"So where are you going?\" I asked as casually as I could manage. \"Hunting,\" he answered grimly. \"If I'm going to be alone with you tomorrow, I'm going to take whatever precautions I can.\" His face grew morose\u2026 and pleading. \"You can always cancel, you know.\" I looked down, afraid of the persuasive power of his eyes. I refused to be convinced to fear him, no matter how real the danger might be. It doesn't matter, I repeated in my head.  \"No,\" I whispered, glancing back at his face. \"I can't.\" \"Perhaps you're right,\" he murmured bleakly. His eyes seemed to darken in color as I watched. I changed the subject. \"What time will I see you tomorrow?\" I asked, already depressed by the thought of him leaving now. \"That depends\u2026 it's a Saturday, don't you want to sleep in?\" he offered. \"No,\" I answered too fast. He restrained a smile.  \"The same time as usual, then,\" he decided. \"Will Charlie be there?\" \"No, he's fishing tomorrow.\" I beamed at the memory of how conveniently things had worked out. His voice turned sharp. \"And if you don't come home, what will he think?\" \"I have no idea,\" I answered coolly. \"He knows I've been meaning to do the laundry. Maybe he'll think I fell in the washer.\" He scowled at me and I scowled back. His anger was much more impressive than mine. \"What are you hunting tonight?\" I asked when I was sure I had lost the glowering contest. \"Whatever we find in the park. We aren't going far.\" He seemed bemused by my casual reference to his secret realities. \"Why are you going with Alice?\" I wondered. \"Alice is the most\u2026 supportive.\" He frowned as he spoke. \"And the others?\" I asked timidly. \"What are they?\" His brow puckered for a brief moment. \"Incredulous, for the most part.\" I peeked quickly behind me at his family. They sat staring off in different directions, exactly the same as the first time I'd seen them. Only now they were four; their beautiful, bronze-haired brother sat across from me, his golden eyes troubled. \"They don't like me,\" I guessed. \"That's not it,\" he disagreed, but his eyes were too innocent. \"They don't understand why I can't leave you alone.\" I grimaced. \"Neither do I, for that matter.\" Edward shook his head slowly, rolling his eyes toward the ceiling before he met my gaze again. \"I told you \u2014 you don't see yourself clearly at all. You're not like anyone I've ever known. You fascinate me.\" I glared at him, sure he was teasing now. He smiled as he deciphered my expression. \"Having the advantages I do,\" he murmured, touching his forehead discreetly, \"I have a better than average grasp of human nature. People are predictable. But you\u2026 you never do what I expect. You always take me by surprise.\" I looked away, my eyes wandering back to his family, embarrassed and dissatisfied. His words made me feel like a science experiment. I wanted to laugh at myself for expecting anything else. \"That part is easy enough to explain,\" he continued. I felt his eyes on my face but I couldn't look at him yet, afraid he might read the chagrin in my eyes. \"But there's more\u2026 and it's not so easy to put into words \u2014\" I was still staring at the Cullens while he spoke. Suddenly Rosalie, his blond and breathtaking sister, turned to look at me. No, not to look \u2014 to glare, with dark, cold eyes. I wanted to look away, but her gaze held me until Edward broke off mid-sentence and made an angry noise under his breath. It was almost a <em>hiss</em>. Rosalie turned her head, and I was relieved to be free. I looked back at Edward \u2014 and I knew he could see the confusion and fear that widened my eyes. His face was tight as he explained. \"I'm sorry about that. She's just worried. You see\u2026 it's dangerous for more than just me if, after spending so much time with you so publicly\u2026\" He looked down. \"If?\" \"If this ends\u2026 badly.\" He dropped his head into his hands, as he had that night in Port Angeles. His anguish was plain; I yearned to comfort him, but I was at a loss to know how.  My hand reached toward him involuntarily; quickly, though, I dropped it to the table, fearing that my touch would only make things worse. I realized slowly that his words should frighten me. I waited for that fear to come, but all I could seem to feel was an ache for his pain. And frustration \u2014 frustration that Rosalie had interrupted whatever he was about to say. I didn't know how to bring it up again. He still had his head in his hands. I tried to speak in a normal voice. \"And you have to leave now?\" \"Yes.\" He raised his face; it was serious for a moment, and then his mood shifted and he smiled. \"It's probably for the best. We still have fifteen minutes of that wretched movie left to endure in Biology \u2014 I don't think I could take any more.\" I started. Alice \u2014 her short, inky hair in a halo of spiky disarray around her exquisite, elfin face \u2014 was suddenly standing behind his shoulder. Her slight frame was willowy, graceful even in absolute stillness. He greeted her without looking away from me. \"Alice.\" \"Edward,\" she answered, her high soprano voice almost as attractive as his. \"Alice, Bella \u2014 Bella, Alice,\" he introduced us, gesturing casually with his hand, a wry smile on his face. \"Hello, Bella.\" Her brilliant obsidian eyes were unreadable, but her smile was friendly. \"It's nice to finally meet you.\" Edward flashed a dark look at her. \"Hi, Alice,\" I murmured shyly. \"Are you ready?\" she asked him. His voice was aloof. \"Nearly. I'll meet you at the car.\" She left without another word; her walk was so fluid, so sinuous that I felt a sharp pang of jealousy. \"Should I say 'have fun,' or is that the wrong sentiment?\" I asked, turning back to him. \"No, 'have fun' works as well as anything.\" He grinned. \"Have fun, then.\" I worked to sound wholehearted. Of course I didn't fool him. \"I'll try.\" He still grinned. \"And you try to be safe, please.\" \"Safe in Forks \u2014 what a challenge.\" \"For you it is a challenge.\" His jaw hardened. \"Promise.\" \"I promise to try to be safe,\" I recited. \"I'll do the laundry tonight \u2014 that ought to be fraught with peril.\" \"Don't fall in,\" he mocked. \"I'll do my best.\" He stood then, and I rose, too. \"I'll see you tomorrow,\" I sighed. \"It seems like a long time to you, doesn't it?\" he mused. I nodded glumly.  \"I'll be there in the morning,\" he promised, smiling his crooked smile. He reached across the table to touch my face, lightly brushing along my cheekbone again. Then he turned and walked away. I stared after him until he was gone. I was sorely tempted to ditch the rest of the day, at the very least Gym, but a warning instinct stopped me. I knew that if I disappeared now, Mike and others would assume I was with Edward. And Edward was worried about the time we'd spent together publicly\u2026 if things went wrong. I refused to dwell on the last thought, concentrating instead on making things safer for him. I intuitively knew \u2014 and sensed he did, too \u2014 that tomorrow would be pivotal. Our relationship couldn't continue to balance, as it did, on the point of a knife. We would fall off one edge or the other, depending entirely upon his decision, or his instincts. My decision was made, made before I'd ever consciously chosen, and I was committed to seeing it through. Because there was nothing more terrifying to me, more excruciating, than the thought of turning away from him. It was an impossibility. I went to class, feeling dutiful. I couldn't honestly say what happened in Biology; my mind was too preoccupied with thoughts of tomorrow. In Gym, Mike was speaking to me again; he wished me a good time in Seattle. I carefully explained that I'd canceled my trip, worried about my truck.  \"Are you going to the dance with Cullen?\" he asked, suddenly sulky. \"No, I'm not going to the dance at all.\" \"What are you doing, then?\" he asked, too interested. My natural urge was to tell him to butt out. Instead, I lied brightly. \"Laundry, and then I have to study for the Trig test or I'm going to fail.\" \"Is Cullen helping you study?\" \"Edward,\" I emphasized, \"is not going to help me study. He's gone away somewhere for the weekend.\" The lies came more naturally than usual, I noted with surprise. \"Oh.\" He perked up. \"You know, you could come to the dance with our group anyway \u2014 that would be cool. We'd all dance with you,\" he promised. The mental image of Jessica's face made my tone sharper than necessary. \"I'm not going to the dance, Mike, okay?\" \"Fine.\" He sulked again. \"I was just offering.\" When the school day had finally ended, I walked to the parking lot without enthusiasm. I did not especially want to walk home, but I couldn't see how he would have retrieved my truck.  Then again, I was starting to believe that nothing was impossible for him. The latter instinct proved correct \u2014 my truck sat in the same space he'd parked his Volvo in this morning. I shook my head, incredulous, as I opened the unlocked door and saw the key in the ignition. There was a piece of white paper folded on my seat. I got in and closed the door before I unfolded it. Two words were written in his elegant script. Be safe. The sound of the truck roaring to life frightened me. I laughed at myself. When I got home, the handle of the door was locked, the dead bolt unlocked, just as I'd left it this morning. Inside, I went straight to the laundry room. It looked just the same as I'd left it, too. I dug for my jeans and, after finding them, checked the pockets. Empty. Maybe I'd hung my key up after all, I thought, shaking my head. Following the same instinct that had prompted me to lie to Mike, I called Jessica on the pretense of wishing her luck at the dance. When she offered the same wish for my day with Edward, I told her about the cancellation. She was more disappointed than really necessary for a third-party observer to be. I said goodbye quickly after that. Charlie was absentminded at dinner, worried over something at work, I guessed, or maybe a basketball game, or maybe he was just really enjoying the lasagna \u2014 it was hard to tell with Charlie. \"You know, Dad\u2026\" I began, breaking into his reverie. \"What's that, Bell?\" \"I think you're right about Seattle. I think I'll wait until Jessica or someone else can go with me.\" \"Oh,\" he said, surprised. \"Oh, okay. So, do you want me to stay home?\" \"No, Dad, don't change your plans. I've got a million things to do\u2026 homework, laundry\u2026 I need to go to the library and the grocery store. I'll be in and out all day\u2026 you go and have fun.\" \"Are you sure?\" \"Absolutely, Dad. Besides, the freezer is getting dangerously low on fish \u2014 we're down to a two, maybe three years' supply.\" \"You're sure easy to live with, Bella.\" He smiled. \"I could say the same thing about you,\" I said, laughing. The sound of my laughter was off, but he didn't seem to notice. I felt so guilty for deceiving him that I almost took Edward's advice and told him where I would be. Almost. After dinner, I folded clothes and moved another load through the dryer. Unfortunately it was the kind of job that only keeps hands busy. My mind definitely had too much free time, and it was getting out of control. I fluctuated between anticipation so intense that it was very nearly pain, and an insidious fear that picked at my resolve. I had to keep reminding myself that I'd made my choice, and I wasn't going back on it. I pulled his note out of my pocket much more often than necessary to absorb the two small words he'd written. He wants me to be safe, I told myself again and again. I would just hold on to the faith that, in the end, that desire would win out over the others. And what was my other choice \u2014 to cut him out of my life? Intolerable. Besides, since I'd come to Forks, it really seemed like my life was about him. But a tiny voice in the back of my mind worried, wondering if it would hurt very much\u2026 if it ended badly. I was relieved when it was late enough to be acceptable for bedtime. I knew I was far too stressed to sleep, so I did something I'd never done before. I deliberately took unnecessary cold medicine \u2014 the kind that knocked me out for a good eight hours. I normally wouldn't condone that type of behavior in myself, but tomorrow would be complicated enough without me being loopy from sleep deprivation on top of everything else. While I waited for the drugs to kick in, I dried my clean hair till it was impeccably straight, and fussed over what I would wear tomorrow. With everything ready for the morning, I finally lay in my bed. I felt hyper; I couldn't stop twitching. I got up and rifled through my shoebox of CDs until I found a collection of Chopin's nocturnes. I put that on very quietly and then lay down again, concentrating on relaxing individual parts of my body. Somewhere in the middle of that exercise, the cold pills took effect, and I gladly sank into unconsciousness.  I woke early, having slept soundly and dreamlessly thanks to my gratuitous drug use. Though I was well rested, I slipped right back into the same hectic frenzy from the night before. I dressed in a rush, smoothing my collar against my neck, fidgeting with the tan sweater till it hung right over my jeans. I sneaked a swift look out the window to see that Charlie was already gone. A thin, cottony layer of clouds veiled the sky. They didn't look very lasting. I ate breakfast without tasting the food, hurrying to clean up when I was done. I peeked out the window again, but nothing had changed. I had just finished brushing my teeth and was heading back downstairs when a quiet knock sent my heart thudding against my rib cage. I flew to the door; I had a little trouble with the simple dead bolt, but I yanked the door open at last, and there he was. All the agitation dissolved as soon as I looked at his face, calm taking its place. I breathed a sigh of relief \u2014 yesterday's fears seemed very foolish with him here. He wasn't smiling at first \u2014 his face was somber. But then his expression lightened as he looked me over, and he laughed.  \"Good morning,\" he chuckled. \"What's wrong?\" I glanced down to make sure I hadn't forgotten anything important, like shoes, or pants. \"We match.\" He laughed again. I realized he had a long, light tan sweater on, with a white collar showing underneath, and blue jeans. I laughed with him, hiding a secret twinge of regret \u2014 why did he have to look like a runway model when I couldn't? I locked the door behind me while he walked to the truck. He waited by the passenger door with a martyred expression that was easy to understand. \"We made a deal,\" I reminded him smugly, climbing into the driver's seat, and reaching over to unlock his door. \"Where to?\" I asked. \"Put your seat belt on \u2014 I'm nervous already.\" I gave him a dirty look as I complied. \"Where to?\" I repeated with a sigh. \"Take the one-on-one north,\" he ordered. It was surprisingly difficult to concentrate on the road while feeling his gaze on my face. I compensated by driving more carefully than usual through the still-sleeping town. \"Were you planning to make it out of Forks before nightfall?\" \"This truck is old enough to be your car's grandfather \u2014 have some respect,\" I retorted. We were soon out of the town limits, despite his negativity. Thick underbrush and green-swathed trunks replaced the lawns and houses. \"Turn right on the one-ten,\" he instructed just as I was about to ask. I obeyed silently. \"Now we drive until the pavement ends.\" I could hear a smile in his voice, but I was too afraid of driving off the road and proving him right to look over and be sure. \"And what's there, at the pavement's end?\" I wondered. \"A trail.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \"We're hiking?\" Thank goodness I'd worn tennis shoes. \"Is that a problem?\" He sounded as if he'd expected as much. \"No.\" I tried to make the lie sound confident. But if he thought my truck was slow\u2026 \"Don't worry, it's only five miles or so, and we're in no hurry.\" Five miles. I didn't answer, so that he wouldn't hear my voice crack in panic. Five miles of treacherous roots and loose stones, trying to twist my ankles or otherwise incapacitate me. This was going to be humiliating. We drove in silence for a while as I contemplated the coming horror. \"What are you thinking?\" he asked impatiently after a few moments. I lied again. \"Just wondering where we're going.\" \"It's a place I like to go when the weather is nice.\" We both glanced out the windows at the thinning clouds after he spoke. \"Charlie said it would be warm today.\" \"And did you tell Charlie what you were up to?\" he asked. \"Nope.\" \"But Jessica thinks we're going to Seattle together?\" He seemed cheered by the idea. \"No, I told her you canceled on me \u2014 which is true.\" \"No one knows you're with me?\" Angrily, now. \"That depends\u2026 I assume you told Alice?\" \"That's very helpful, Bella,\" he snapped. I pretended I didn't hear that. \"Are you so depressed by Forks that it's made you suicidal?\" he demanded when I ignored him. \"You said it might cause trouble for you\u2026 us being together publicly,\" I reminded him. \"So you're worried about the trouble it might cause me\u2014 if you don't come home?\" His voice was still angry, and bitingly sarcastic. I nodded, keeping my eyes on the road. He muttered something under his breath, speaking so quickly that I couldn't understand. We were silent for the rest of the drive. I could feel the waves of infuriated disapproval rolling off of him, and I could think of nothing to say. And then the road ended, constricting to a thin foot trail with a small wooden marker. I parked on the narrow shoulder and stepped out, afraid because he was angry with me and I didn't have driving as an excuse not to look at him. It was warm now, warmer than it had been in Forks since the day I'd arrived, almost muggy under the clouds. I pulled off my sweater and knotted it around my waist, glad that I'd worn the light, sleeveless shirt \u2014 especially if I had five miles of hiking ahead of me. I heard his door slam, and looked over to see that he'd removed his sweater, too. He was facing away from me, into the unbroken forest beside my truck. \"This way,\" he said, glancing over his shoulder at me, eyes still annoyed. He started into the dark forest. \"The trail?\" Panic was clear in my voice as I hurried around the truck to catch up to him. \"I said there was a trail at the end of the road, not that we were taking it.\" \"No trail?\" I asked desperately. \"I won't let you get lost.\" He turned then, with a mocking smile, and I stifled a gasp. His white shirt was sleeveless, and he wore it unbuttoned, so that the smooth white skin of his throat flowed uninterrupted over the marble contours of his chest, his perfect musculature no longer merely hinted at behind concealing clothes. He was too perfect, I realized with a piercing stab of despair. There was no way this godlike creature could be meant for me. He stared at me, bewildered by my tortured expression. \"Do you want to go home?\" he said quietly, a different pain than mine saturating his voice. \"No.\" I walked forward till I was close beside him, anxious not to waste one second of whatever time I might have with him. \"What's wrong?\" he asked, his voice gentle. \"I'm not a good hiker,\" I answered dully. \"You'll have to be very patient.\" \"I can be patient \u2014 if I make a great effort.\" He smiled, holding my glance, trying to lift me out of my sudden, unexplained dejection. I tried to smile back, but the smile was unconvincing. He scrutinized my face. \"I'll take you home,\" he promised. I couldn't tell if the promise was unconditional, or restricted to an immediate departure. I knew he thought it was fear that upset me, and I was grateful again that I was the one person whose mind he couldn't hear. \"If you want me to hack five miles through the jungle before sundown, you'd better start leading the way,\" I said acidly. He frowned at me, struggling to understand my tone and expression. He gave up after a moment and led the way into the forest. It wasn't as hard as I had feared. The way was mostly flat, and he held the damp ferns and webs of moss aside for me. When his straight path took us over fallen trees or boulders, he would help me, lifting me by the elbow, and then releasing me instantly when I was clear. His cold touch on my skin never failed to make my heart thud erratically. Twice, when that happened, I caught a look on his face that made me sure he could somehow hear it. I tried to keep my eyes away from his perfection as much as possible, but I slipped often. Each time, his beauty pierced me through with sadness. For the most part, we walked in silence. Occasionally he would ask a random question that he hadn't gotten to in the past two days of interrogation. He asked about my birthdays, my grade school teachers, my childhood pets \u2014 and I had to admit that after killing three fish in a row, I'd given up on the whole institution. He laughed at that, louder than I was used to \u2014 bell-like echoes bouncing back to us from the empty woods. The hike took me most of the morning, but he never showed any sign of impatience. The forest spread out around us in a boundless labyrinth of ancient trees, and I began to be nervous that we would never find our way out again. He was perfectly at ease, comfortable in the green maze, never seeming to feel any doubt about our direction. After several hours, the light that filtered through the canopy transformed, the murky olive tone shifting to a brighter jade. The day had turned sunny, just as he'd foretold. For the first time since we'd entered the woods, I felt a thrill of excitement \u2014 which quickly turned to impatience. \"Are we there yet?\" I teased, pretending to scowl. \"Nearly.\" He smiled at the change in my mood. \"Do you see the brightness ahead?\" I peered into the thick forest. \"Um, should I?\" He smirked. \"Maybe it's a bit soon for your eyes.\" \"Time to visit the optometrist,\" I muttered. His smirk grew more pronounced. But then, after another hundred yards, I could definitely see a lightening in the trees ahead, a glow that was yellow instead of green. I picked up the pace, my eagerness growing with every step. He let me lead now, following noiselessly. I reached the edge of the pool of light and stepped through the last fringe of ferns into the loveliest place I had ever seen. The meadow was small, perfectly round, and filled with wildflowers \u2014 violet, yellow, and soft white. Somewhere nearby, I could hear the bubbling music of a stream. The sun was directly overhead, filling the circle with a haze of buttery sunshine. I walked slowly, awestruck, through the soft grass, swaying flowers, and warm, gilded air. I halfway turned, wanting to share this with him, but he wasn't behind me where I thought he'd be. I spun around, searching for him with sudden alarm. Finally I spotted him, still under the dense shade of the canopy at the edge of the hollow, watching me with cautious eyes. Only then did I remember what the beauty of the meadow had driven from my mind \u2014 the enigma of Edward and the sun, which he'd promised to illustrate for me today. I took a step back toward him, my eyes alight with curiosity. His eyes were wary, reluctant. I smiled encouragingly and beckoned to him with my hand, taking another step back to him. He held up a hand in warning, and I hesitated, rocking back onto my heels. Edward seemed to take a deep breath, and then he stepped out into the bright glow of the midday sun.",

            "en": "3. MOTIVES THE SUN WAS SO DEEPLY BURIED BEHIND THE CLOUDS that there was no way to tell if it had set or not. After the long flight \u2014 chasing the sun westward so that it seemed unmoving in the sky \u2014 it was especially disorienting; time seemed oddly variable. It took me by surprise when the forest gave way to the first buildings, signaling that we were nearly home. \u201cYou\u2019ve been very quiet,\u201d Edward observed. \u201cDid the plane make you sick?\u201d \u201cNo, I\u2019m okay.\u201d \u201cAre you sad to leave?\u201d \u201cMore relieved than sad, I think.\u201d He raised one eyebrow at me. I knew it was useless and \u2014 much as I hated to admit it \u2014 unnecessary to ask him to keep his eyes on the road. \u201cRen\u00e9e is so much more . . .perceptive than Charlie in some ways. It was making me jumpy.\u201d Edward laughed. \u201cYour mother has a very interesting mind. Almost childlike, but very insightful. She sees things differently than other people.\u201d Insightful. It was a good description of my mother \u2014 when she was paying attention. Most of the time Ren\u00e9e was so bewildered by her own life that she didn\u2019t notice much else. But this weekend she\u2019d been paying plenty of attention to me. Phil was busy \u2014 the high school baseball team he coached was in the playoffs \u2014 and being alone with Edward and me had only sharpened Ren\u00e9e\u2019s focus. As soon as the hugs and squeals of delight were out of the way, Ren\u00e9e began to watch. And as she\u2019d watched, her wide blue eyes had become first confused and then concerned. This morning we\u2019d gone for a walk along the beach. She wanted to show off all the beauties of her new home, still hoping, I think, that the sun might lure me away from Forks. She\u2019d also wanted to talk with me alone, and that was easily arranged. Edward had fabricated a term paper to give himself an excuse to stay indoors during the day. In my head, I went through the conversation again. . . . Ren\u00e9e and I ambled along the sidewalk, trying to stay in the range of the infrequent palm tree shadows. Though it was early, the heat was smothering. The air was so heavy with moisture that just breathing in and out was giving my lungs a workout. \u201cBella?\u201d my mother asked, looking out past the sand to the lightly crashing waves as she spoke. \u201cWhat is it, Mom?\u201d She sighed, not meeting my gaze. \u201cI\u2019m worried. . . .\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked, anxious at once. \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not me.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m worried about you . . . and Edward.\u201d Ren\u00e9e finally looked at me when she said his name, her face apologetic. \u201cOh,\u201d I mumbled, fixing my eyes on a pair of joggers as they passed us, drenched with sweat. \u201cYou two are more serious than I\u2019d been thinking,\u201d she went on. I frowned, quickly reviewing the last two days in my head. Edward and I had barely touched \u2014 in front of her, at least. I wondered if Ren\u00e9e was about to give me a lecture on responsibility, too. I didn\u2019t mind that the way I had with Charlie. It wasn\u2019t embarrassing with my mom. After all, I\u2019d been the one giving her that lecture time and time again in the last ten years. \u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s something . . . strange about the way you two are together,\u201d she murmured, her forehead creasing over her troubled eyes. \u201cThe way he watches you \u2014 it\u2019s so . . . protective. Like he\u2019s about to throw himself in front of a bullet to save you or something.\u201d I laughed, though I was still not able to meet her gaze. \u201cThat\u2019s a bad thing?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d She frowned as she struggled for the words. \u201cIt\u2019s just different . He\u2019s very intense about you . . . and very careful. I feel like I don\u2019t really understand your relationship. Like there\u2019s some secret I\u2019m missing. . . .\u201d \u201cI think you\u2019re imagining things, Mom,\u201d I said quickly, struggling to keep my voice light. There was a flutter in my stomach. I\u2019d forgotten how much my mother saw . Something about her simple view of the world cut through all the distractions and pierced right to the truth of things. This had never been a problem before. Until now, there had never been a secret I couldn\u2019t tell her. \u201cIt\u2019s not just him.\u201d She set her lips defensively. \u201cI wish you could see how you move around him.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u00a0\u201cThe way you move \u2014 you orient yourself around him without even thinking about it. When he moves, even a little bit, you adjust your position at the same time. Like magnets . . . or gravity. You\u2019re like a . . . satellite, or something. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d She pursed her lips and stared down. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me,\u201d I teased, forcing a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re reading mysteries again, aren\u2019t you? Or is it sci-fi this time?\u201d Ren\u00e9e flushed a delicate pink. \u201cThat\u2019s beside the point.\u201d \u201cFound anything good?\u201d \u201cWell, there was one \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t matter. We\u2019re talking about you right now.\u201d \u201cYou should stick to romance, Mom. You know how you freak yourself out.\u201d Her lips turned up at the corners. \u201cI\u2019m being silly, aren\u2019t I?\u201d For half a second I couldn\u2019t answer. Ren\u00e9e was so easily swayed. Sometimes it was a good thing, because not all of her ideas were practical. But it pained me to see how quickly she caved in to my trivializing, especially since she was dead right this time. She looked up, and I controlled my expression. \u201cNot silly \u2014 just being a mom.\u201d She laughed and then gestured grandly toward the white sands stretching to the blue water. \u201cAnd all this isn\u2019t enough to get you to move back in with your silly mom?\u201d I wiped my hand dramatically across my forehead, and then pretended to wring my hair out. \u201cYou get used to the humidity,\u201d she promised. \u201cYou can get used to rain, too,\u201d I countered. She elbowed me playfully and then took my hand as we walked back to her car. Other than her worries about me, she seemed happy enough. Content. She still looked at Phil with goo-goo eyes, and that was comforting. Surely her life was full and satisfying. Surely she didn\u2019t miss me that much, even now. . . . Edward\u2019s icy fingers brushed my cheek. I looked up, blinking, coming back to the present. He leaned down and kissed my forehead. \u201cWe\u2019re home, Sleeping Beauty. Time to awake.\u201d We were stopped in front of Charlie\u2019s house. The porch light was on and the cruiser was parked in the driveway. As I examined the house, I saw the curtain twitch in the living room window, flashing a line of yellow light across the dark lawn. I sighed. Of course Charlie was waiting to pounce. Edward must have been thinking the same thing, because his expression was stiff and his eyes remote as he came to get my door for me. \u201cHow bad?\u201d I asked. \u201cCharlie\u2019s not going to be difficult,\u201d Edward promised, his voice level with no hint of humor. \u201cHe missed you.\u201d My eyes narrowed in doubt. If that was the case, then why was Edward tensed as if for a battle? My bag was small, but he insisted on carrying it into the house. Charlie held the door open for us. \u201cWelcome home, kid!\u201d Charlie shouted like he really meant it. \u201cHow was Jacksonville?\u201d \u201cMoist. And buggy.\u201d \u201cSo Ren\u00e9e didn\u2019t sell you on the University of Florida?\u201d \u201cShe tried. But I\u2019d rather drink water than inhale it.\u201d Charlie\u2019s eyes flickered unwillingly to Edward. \u201cDid you have a nice time?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d Edward answered in a serene voice. \u201cRen\u00e9e was very hospitable.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s . . . um, good. Glad you had fun.\u201d Charlie turned away from Edward and pulled me in for an unexpected hug. \u201cImpressive,\u201d I whispered in his ear. He rumbled a laugh. \u201cI really missed you, Bells. The food around here sucks when you\u2019re gone.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll get on it,\u201d I said as he let me go. \u201cWould you call Jacob first? He\u2019s been bugging me every five minutes since six o\u2019clock this morning. I promised I\u2019d have you call him before you even unpacked.\u201d I didn\u2019t have to look at Edward to feel that he was too still, too cold beside me. So this was the cause of his tension. \u201cJacob wants to talk to me?\u201d \u201cPretty bad, I\u2019d say. He wouldn\u2019t tell me what it was about \u2014 just said it was important.\u201d The phone rang then, shrill and demanding. \u201cThat\u2019s him again, I\u2019d bet my next paycheck,\u201d Charlie muttered. \u201cI got it.\u201d I hurried to the kitchen. Edward followed after me while Charlie disappeared into the living room. I grabbed the phone mid-ring, and twisted around so that I was facing the wall. \u201cHello?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re back,\u201d Jacob said. His familiar husky voice sent a wave of wistfulness through me. A thousand memories spun in my head, tangling together \u2014 a rocky beach strewn with driftwood trees, a garage made of plastic sheds, warm sodas in a paper bag, a tiny room with one too-small shabby loveseat. The laughter in his deep-set black eyes, the feverish heat of his big hand around mine, the flash of his white teeth against his dark skin, his face stretching into the wide smile that had always been like a key to a secret door where only kindred spirits could enter. It felt sort of like homesickness, this longing for the place and person who had sheltered me through my darkest night. I cleared the lump from my throat. \u201cYes,\u201d I answered. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call me?\u201d Jacob demanded. His angry tone instantly got my back up. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve been in the house for exactly four seconds and your call interrupted Charlie telling me that you\u2019d called.\u201d \u201cOh. Sorry.\u201d \u201cSure. Now, why are you harassing Charlie?\u201d \u201cI need to talk to you.\u201d \u201cYeah, I figured out that part all by myself. Go ahead.\u201d There was a short pause. \u201cYou going to school tomorrow?\u201d I frowned to myself, unable to make sense of this question. \u201cOf course I am. Why wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d \u201cI dunno. Just curious.\u201d Another pause. \u201cSo what did you want to talk about, Jake?\u201d He hesitated. \u201cNothing really, I guess. I . . . wanted to hear your voice.\u201d \u201cYeah, I know. I\u2019m so glad you called me, Jake. I . . .\u201d But I didn\u2019t know what more to say. I wanted to tell him I was on my way to La Push right now. And I couldn\u2019t tell him that. \u201cI have to go,\u201d he said abruptly. \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you soon, okay?\u201d \u201cBut Jake \u2014\u201d He was already gone. I listened to the dial tone with disbelief. \u201cThat was short,\u201d I muttered. \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d Edward asked. His voice was low and careful. I turned slowly to face him. His expression was perfectly smooth \u2014 impossible to read. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I wonder what that was about.\u201d It didn\u2019t make sense that Jacob had been hounding Charlie all day just to ask me if I was going to school. And if he\u2019d wanted to hear my voice, then why did he hang up so quickly? \u201cYour guess is probably better than mine,\u201d Edward said, the hint of a smile tugging at the corner of his mouth. \u201cMmm,\u201d I murmured. That was true. I knew Jake inside and out. It shouldn\u2019t be that complicated to figure out his motivations. With my thoughts miles away \u2014 about fifteen miles away, up the road to La Push \u2014 I started combing through the fridge, assembling ingredients for Charlie\u2019s dinner. Edward leaned against the counter, and I was distantly aware that his eyes were on my face, but too preoccupied to worry about what he saw there. The school thing seemed like the key to me. That was the only real question Jake had asked. And he had to be after an answer to something, or he wouldn\u2019t have been bugging Charlie so persistently. Why would my attendance record matter to him, though? I tried to think about it in a logical way. So, if I hadn\u2019t been going to school tomorrow, what would be the problem with that, from Jacob\u2019s perspective? Charlie had given me a little grief about missing a day of school so close to finals, but I\u2019d convinced him that one Friday wasn\u2019t going to derail my studies. Jake would hardly care about that. My brain refused to come up with any brilliant insights. Maybe I was missing some vital piece of information. What could have changed in the past three days that was so important that Jacob would break his long streak of refusing to answer my phone calls and contact me? What difference could three days make? I froze in the middle of the kitchen. The package of icy hamburger in my hands slipped through my numb fingers. It took me a slow second to miss the thud it should have made against the floor. Edward had caught it and thrown it onto the counter. His arms were already around me, his lips at my ear. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I shook my head, dazed. Three days could change everything. Hadn\u2019t I just been thinking about how impossible college was? How I couldn\u2019t be anywhere near people after I\u2019d gone through the painful three-day conversion that would set me free from mortality, so that I could spend eternity with Edward? The conversion that would make me forever a prisoner to my own thirst. . . . Had Charlie told Billy that I\u2019d vanished for three days? Had Billy jumped to conclusions? Had Jacob really been asking me if I was still human? Making sure that the werewolves\u2019 treaty was unbroken \u2014 that none of the Cullens had dared to bite a human . . . bite, not kill . . . ? But did he honestly think I would come home to Charlie if that was the case? Edward shook me. \u201cBella?\u201d he asked, truly anxious now. \u201cI think . . . I think he was checking,\u201d I mumbled. \u201cChecking to make sure. That I\u2019m human, I mean.\u201d Edward stiffened, and a low <em>hiss</em> sounded in my ear. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to leave,\u201d I whispered. \u201cBefore. So that it doesn\u2019t break the treaty. We won\u2019t ever be able to come back.\u201d His arms tightened around me. \u201cI know.\u201d \u201cAhem.\u201d Charlie cleared his voice loudly behind us. I jumped, and then pulled free of Edward\u2019s arms, my face getting hot. Edward leaned back against the counter. His eyes were tight. I could see worry in them, and anger. \u00a0\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to make dinner, I can call for a pizza,\u201d Charlie hinted. \u201cNo, that\u2019s okay, I\u2019m already started.\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d Charlie said. He propped himself against the doorframe, folding his arms. I sighed and got to work, trying to ignore my audience. \u201cIf I asked you to do something, would you trust me?\u201d Edward asked, an edge to his soft voice. We were almost to school. Edward had been relaxed and joking just a moment ago, and now suddenly his hands were clenched tight on the steering wheel, his knuckles straining in an effort not to snap it into pieces. I stared at his anxious expression \u2014 his eyes were far away, like he was listening to distant voices. My pulse sped in response to his stress, but I answered carefully. \u201cThat depends.\u201d We pulled into the school lot. \u201cI was afraid you would say that.\u201d \u201cWhat do you want me to do, Edward?\u201d \u201cI want you to stay in the car.\u201d He pulled into his usual spot and turned the engine off as he spoke. \u201cI want you to wait here until I come back for you.\u201d \u201cBut . . .why ?\u201d That was when I saw him. He would have been hard to miss, towering over the students the way he did, even if he hadn\u2019t been leaning against his black motorcycle, parked illegally on the sidewalk. \u201cOh.\u201d Jacob\u2019s face was a calm mask that I recognized well. It was the face he used when he was determined to keep his emotions in check, to keep himself under control. It made him look like Sam, the oldest of the wolves, the leader of the Quileute pack. But Jacob could never quite manage the perfect serenity Sam always exuded. I\u2019d forgotten how much this face bothered me. Though I\u2019d gotten to know Sam pretty well before the Cullens had come back \u2014 to like him, even \u2014 I\u2019d never been able to completely shake the resentment I felt when Jacob mimicked Sam\u2019s expression. It was a stranger\u2019s face. He wasn\u2019t my Jacob when he wore it. \u201cYou jumped to the wrong conclusion last night,\u201d Edward murmured. \u201cHe asked about school because he knew that I would be where you were. He was looking for a safe place to talk to me. A place with witnesses.\u201d So I\u2019d misinterpreted Jacob\u2019s motives last night. Missing information, that was the problem. Information like why in the world Jacob would want to talk to Edward. \u201cI\u2019m not staying in the car,\u201d I said. Edward groaned quietly. \u201cOf course not. Well, let\u2019s get this over with.\u201d Jacob\u2019s face hardened as we walked toward him, hand in hand. I noticed other faces, too \u2014 the faces of my classmates. I noticed how their eyes widened as they took in all six foot seven inches of Jacob\u2019s long body, muscled up the way no normal sixteen-and-a-half-year-old ever had been. I saw those eyes rake over his tight black t-shirt \u2014 short-sleeved, though the day was unseasonably cool \u2014 his ragged, grease-smeared jeans, and the glossy black bike he leaned against. Their eyes didn\u2019t linger on his face \u2014 something about his expression had them glancing quickly away. And I noticed the wide berth everyone gave him, the bubble of space that no one dared to encroach on. With a sense of astonishment, I realized that Jacob looked dangerous to them. How odd. Edward stopped a few yards away from Jacob, and I could tell that he was uncomfortable having me so close to a werewolf. He drew his hand back slightly, pulling me halfway behind his body. \u201cYou could have called us,\u201d Edward said in a steel-hard voice. \u201cSorry,\u201d Jacob answered, his face twisting into a sneer. \u201cI don\u2019t have any leeches on my speed dial.\u201d \u201cYou could have reached me at Bella\u2019s house, of course.\u201d Jacob\u2019s jaw flexed, and his brows pulled together. He didn\u2019t answer. \u201cThis is hardly the place, Jacob. Could we discuss this later?\u201d \u201cSure, sure. I\u2019ll stop by your crypt after school.\u201d Jacob snorted. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with now?\u201d Edward looked around pointedly, his eyes resting on the witnesses who were just barely out of hearing range. A few people were hesitating on the sidewalk, their eyes bright with expectation. Like they were hoping a fight might break out to alleviate the tedium of another Monday morning. I saw Tyler Crowley nudge Austin Marks, and they both paused on their way to class. \u201cI already know what you came to say,\u201d Edward reminded Jacob in voice so low that I could barely make it out. \u201cMessage delivered. Consider us warned.\u201d Edward glanced down at me for a fleeting second with worried eyes. \u201cWarned?\u201d I asked blankly. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell her?\u201d Jacob asked, his eyes widening with disbelief. \u201cWhat, were you afraid she\u2019d take our side?\u201d \u201cPlease drop it, Jacob,\u201d Edward said in an even voice. \u201cWhy?\u201d Jacob challenged. I frowned in confusion. \u201cWhat don\u2019t I know? Edward?\u201d Edward just glared at Jacob as if he hadn\u2019t heard me. \u201cJake?\u201d Jacob raised his eyebrow at me. \u201cHe didn\u2019t tell you that his big . . .brother crossed the line Saturday night?\u201d he asked, his tone thickly layered with sarcasm. Then his eyes flickered back to Edward. \u201cPaul was totally justified in \u2014\u201d \u201cIt was no-man\u2019s land!\u201d Edward hissed. \u201cWas not!\u201d Jacob was fuming visibly. His hands trembled. He shook his head and sucked in two deep lungfuls of air. \u201cEmmett and Paul?\u201d I whispered. Paul was Jacob\u2019s most volatile pack brother. He was the one who\u2019d lost control that day in the woods \u2014 the memory of the snarling gray wolf was suddenly vivid in my head. \u201cWhat happened? Were they fighting?\u201d My voice strained higher in panic. \u201cWhy? Did Paul get hurt?\u201d \u201cNo one fought,\u201d Edward said quietly, only to me. \u201cNo one got hurt. Don\u2019t be anxious.\u201d Jacob was staring at us with incredulous eyes. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell her anything at all, did you? Is that why you took her away? So she wouldn\u2019t know that \u2014?\u201d \u201cLeave now.\u201d Edward cut him off mid-sentence, and his face was abruptly frightening \u2014 truly frightening. For a second, he looked like . . . like a vampire . He glared at Jacob with vicious, unveiled loathing. Jacob raised his eyebrows, but made no other move. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you told her?\u201d They faced each other in silence for a long moment. More students gathered behind Tyler and Austin. I saw Mike next to Ben \u2014 Mike had one hand on Ben\u2019s shoulder, like he was holding him in place. In the dead silence, all the details suddenly fell into place for me with a burst of intuition. Something Edward didn\u2019t want me to know. Something that Jacob wouldn\u2019t have kept from me. Something that had the Cullens and the wolves both in the woods, moving in hazardous proximity to each other. Something that would cause Edward to insist that I fly across the country. Something that Alice had seen in a vision last week \u2014 a vision Edward had lied to me about. Something I\u2019d been waiting for anyway. Something I knew would happen again, as much as I might wish it never would. It was never going to end, was it? I heard the quick gasp, gasp, gasp, gasp of the air dragging through my lips, but I couldn\u2019t stop it. It looked like the school was shaking, like there was an earthquake, but I knew it was my own trembling that caused the illusion. \u201cShe came back for me,\u201d I choked out. Victoria was never going to give up till I was dead. She would keep repeating the same pattern \u2014 feint and run, feint and run \u2014 until she found a hole through my defenders. Maybe I\u2019d get lucky. Maybe the Volturi would come for me first \u2014 they\u2019d kill me quicker, at least. Edward held me tight to his side, angling his body so that he was still between me and Jacob, and stroked my face with anxious hands. \u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he whispered to me. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll never let her get close to you, it\u2019s fine.\u201d Then he glared at Jacob. \u201cDoes that answer your question, mongrel?\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t think Bella has a right to know?\u201d Jacob challenged. \u201cIt\u2019s her life.\u201d Edward kept his voice muted; even Tyler, edging forward by inches, would be unable to hear. \u201cWhy should she be frightened when she was never in danger?\u201d \u201cBetter frightened than lied to.\u201d I tried to pull myself together, but my eyes were swimming in moisture. I could see it behind my lids \u2014 I could see Victoria\u2019s face, her lips pulled back over her teeth, her crimson eyes glowing with the obsession of her vendetta; she held Edward responsible for the demise of her love, James. She wouldn\u2019t stop until his love was taken from him, too. Edward wiped the tears from my cheek with his fingertips. \u201cDo you really think hurting her is better than protecting her?\u201d he murmured. \u201cShe\u2019s tougher than you think,\u201d Jacob said. \u201cAnd she\u2019s been through worse.\u201d Abruptly, Jacob\u2019s expression shifted, and he was staring at Edward with an odd, speculative expression. His eyes narrowed like he was trying to do a difficult math problem in his head. I felt Edward cringe. I glanced up at him, and his face was contorted in what could only be pain. For one ghastly moment, I was reminded of our afternoon in Italy, in the macabre tower room of the Volturi, where Jane had tortured Edward with her malignant gift, burning him with her thoughts alone. . . . The memory snapped me out of my near hysteria and put everything in perspective. Because I\u2019d rather Victoria killed me a hundred times over than watch Edward suffer that way again. \u201cThat\u2019s funny,\u201d Jacob said, laughing as he watched Edward\u2019s face. Edward winced, but smoothed his expression with a little effort. He couldn\u2019t quite hide the agony in his eyes. I glanced, wide-eyed, from Edward\u2019s grimace to Jacob\u2019s sneer. \u201cWhat are you doing to him?\u201d I demanded. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, Bella,\u201d Edward told me quietly. \u201cJacob just has a good memory, that\u2019s all.\u201d Jacob grinned, and Edward winced again. \u201cStop it! Whatever you\u2019re doing.\u201d \u201cSure, if you want.\u201d Jacob shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s his own fault if he doesn\u2019t like the things I remember, though.\u201d I glared at him, and he smiled back impishly \u2014 like a kid caught doing something he knows he shouldn\u2019t by someone who he knows won\u2019t punish him. \u201cThe principal\u2019s on his way to discourage loitering on school property,\u201d Edward murmured to me. \u201cLet\u2019s get to English, Bella, so you\u2019re not involved.\u201d \u201cOverprotective, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Jacob said, talking just to me. \u201cA little trouble makes life fun. Let me guess, you\u2019re not allowed to have fun, are you?\u201d Edward glowered, and his lips pulled back from his teeth ever so slightly. \u201cShut up, Jake,\u201d I said. Jacob laughed. \u201cThat sounds like a no . Hey, if you ever feel like having a life again, you could come see me. I\u2019ve still got your motorcycle in my garage.\u201d \u1eea  This news distracted me. \u201cYou were supposed to sell that. You promised Charlie you would.\u201d If I hadn\u2019t begged on Jake\u2019s behalf \u2014 after all, he\u2019d put weeks of labor into both motorcycles, and he deserved some kind of payback \u2014 Charlie would have thrown my bike in a Dumpster. And possibly set that Dumpster on fire. \u201cYeah, right. Like I would do that. It belongs to you, not me. Anyway, I\u2019ll hold on to it until you want it back.\u201d A tiny hint of the smile I remembered was suddenly playing around the edges of his lips. \u201cJake . . .\u201d He leaned forward, his face earnest now, the bitter sarcasm fading. \u201cI think I might have been wrong before, you know, about not being able to be friends. Maybe we could manage it, on my side of the line.\u00a0 Come see me.\u201d I was vividly conscious of Edward, his arms still wrapped protectively around me, motionless as a stone. I shot a look at his face \u2014 it was calm, patient. \u201cI, er, don\u2019t know about that, Jake.\u201d Jacob dropped the antagonistic fa\u00e7ade completely. It was like he\u2019d forgotten Edward was there, or at least he was determined to act that way. \u201cI miss you every day, Bella. It\u2019s not the same without you.\u201d \u201cI know and I\u2019m sorry, Jake, I just . . .\u201d He shook his head, and sighed. \u201cI know. Doesn\u2019t matter, right? I guess I\u2019ll survive or something. Who needs friends?\u201d He grimaced, trying to cover the pain with a thin attempt at bravado. Jacob\u2019s suffering had always triggered my protective side. It was not entirely rational \u2014 Jacob was hardly in need of any physical protection I could offer. But my arms, pinned beneath Edward\u2019s, yearned to reach out to him. To wrap around his big, warm waist in a silent promise of acceptance and comfort. Edward\u2019s shielding arms had become restraints. \u201cOkay, get to class,\u201d a stern voice sounded behind us. \u201cMove along, Mr. Crowley.\u201d \u201cGet to school, Jake,\u201d I whispered, anxious as soon as I recognized the principal\u2019s voice. Jacob went to the Quileute school, but he might still get in trouble for trespassing or the equivalent. Edward released me, taking just my hand and pulling me behind his body again. Mr. Greene pushed through the circle of spectators, his brows pressing down like ominous storm clouds over his small eyes. \u201cI mean it,\u201d he was threatening. \u201cDetention for anyone who\u2019s still standing here when I turn around again.\u201d The audience melted away before he was finished with his sentence. \u201cAh, Mr. Cullen. Do we have a problem here?\u201d \u201cNot at all, Mr. Greene. We were just on our way to class.\u201d \u201cExcellent. I don\u2019t seem to recognize your friend.\u201d Mr. Greene turned his glower on Jacob. \u201cAre you a new student here?\u201d Mr. Greene\u2019s eyes scrutinized Jacob, and I could see that he\u2019d come to the same conclusion everyone else had: dangerous. A troublemaker. \u201cNope,\u201d Jacob answered, half a smirk on his broad lips. \u201cThen I suggest you remove yourself from school property at once, young man, before I call the police.\u201d Jacob\u2019s little smirk became a full-blown grin, and I knew he was picturing Charlie showing up to arrest him. This grin was too bitter, too full of mocking to satisfy me. This wasn\u2019t the smile I\u2019d been waiting to see. Jacob said, \u201cYes, sir,\u201d and snapped a military salute before he climbed on his bike and kicked it to a start right there on the sidewalk. The engine snarled and then the tires squealed as he spun it sharply around. In a matter of seconds, Jacob raced out of sight. Mr. Greene gnashed his teeth together while he watched the performance. \u201cMr. Cullen, I expect you to ask your friend to refrain from trespassing again.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s no friend of mine, Mr. Greene, but I\u2019ll pass along the warning.\u201d Mr. Greene pursed his lips. Edward\u2019s perfect grades and spotless record were clearly a factor in Mr. Greene\u2019s assessment of the incident. \u201cI see. If you\u2019re worried about any trouble, I\u2019d be happy to \u2014\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to worry about, Mr. Greene. There won\u2019t be any trouble.\u201d \u201cI hope that\u2019s correct. Well, then. On to class. You, too, Miss Swan.\u201d Edward nodded, and pulled me quickly along toward the English building. \u201cDo you feel well enough to go to class?\u201d he whispered when we were past the principal. \u201cYes,\u201d I whispered back, not quite sure if this was a lie. Whether I felt well or not was hardly the most important consideration. I needed to talk to Edward right away, and English class wasn\u2019t the ideal place for the conversation I had in mind. But with Mr. Greene right behind us, there weren\u2019t a lot of other options. We got to class a little late and took our seats quickly. Mr. Berty was reciting a Frost poem. He ignored our entrance, refusing to let us break his rhythm. I yanked a blank page out of my notebook and started writing, my handwriting more illegible than normal thanks to my agitation. What happened? Tell me everything . And screw the protecting me crap, please. I shoved the note at Edward. He sighed, and then began writing. It took him less time than me, though he wrote an entire paragraph in his own personal calligraphy before he slipped the paper back. Alice saw that Victoria was coming back. I took you out of town merely as a precaution \u2014 there was never a chance that she would have gotten anywhere close to you. Emmett and Jasper very nearly had her, but Victoria seems to have some instinct for evasion. She escaped right down the Quileute boundary line as if she were reading it from a map. It didn\u2019t help that Alice\u2019s abilities were nullified by the Quileutes\u2019 involvement. To be fair, the Quileutes might have had her, too, if we hadn\u2019t gotten in the way. The big gray one thought Emmett was over the line, and he got defensive. Of course Rosalie reacted to that, and everyone left the chase to protect their companions. Carlisle and Jasper got things calmed down before it got out of hand. But by then, Victoria had slipped away. That\u2019s everything.  I frowned at the letters on the page. All of them had been in on it \u2014 Emmett, Jasper, Alice, Rosalie, and Carlisle. Maybe even Esme, though he hadn\u2019t mentioned her. And then Paul and the rest of the Quileute pack. It might so easily have turned into a fight, pitting my future family and my old friends against each other. Any one of them could have been hurt. I imagined the wolves would be in the most danger, but picturing tiny Alice next to one of the huge werewolves, fighting . . . I shuddered. Carefully, I scrubbed out the entire paragraph with my eraser and then I wrote over the top:\u00a0  What about Charlie? She could have been after him. Edward was shaking his head before I finished, obviously going to downplay any danger on Charlie\u2019s behalf. He held a hand out, but I ignored that and started again. You can\u2019t know that she wasn\u2019t thinking that, because you weren\u2019t here. Florida was a bad idea. He took the paper from underneath my hand. I wasn\u2019t about to send you off alone. With your luck, not even the black box would survive. That wasn\u2019t what I\u2019d meant at all; I hadn\u2019t thought of going without him. I\u2019d meant that we should have stayed here together. But I was sidetracked by his response, and a little miffed. Like I couldn\u2019t fly cross country without bringing the plane down. Very funny. So let\u2019s say my bad luck did crash the plane. What exactly were you going to do about it? Why is the plane crashing? He was trying to hide a smile now. The pilots are passed out drunk. Easy. I\u2019d fly the plane. Of course. I pursed my lips and tried again. Both engines have exploded and we\u2019re falling in a death spiral toward the earth. I\u2019d wait till we were close enough to the ground, get a good grip on you, kick out the wall, and jump. Then I\u2019d run you back to the scene of the accident, and we\u2019d stumble around like the two luckiest survivors in history. I stared at him wordlessly. \u201cWhat?\u201d he whispered. I shook my head in awe. \u201cNothing,\u201d I mouthed. I scrubbed out the disconcerting conversation and wrote one more line. You will tell me next time. I knew there would be a next time. The pattern would continue until someone lost. Edward stared into my eyes for a long moment. I wondered what my face looked like \u2014 it felt cold, so the blood hadn\u2019t returned to my cheeks. My eyelashes were still wet. He sighed and then nodded once. Thanks. The paper disappeared from under my hand. I looked up, blinking in surprise, just as Mr. Berty came down the aisle. \u201cIs that something you\u2019d like to share there, Mr. Cullen?\u201d Edward looked up innocently and held out the sheet of paper on top of his folder. \u201cMy notes?\u201d he asked, sounding confused. Mr. Berty scanned the notes \u2014 no doubt a perfect transcription of his lecture \u2014 and then walked away frowning. It was later, in Calculus \u2014 my one class without Edward \u2014 that I heard the gossip. \u201cMy money\u2019s on the big Indian,\u201d someone was saying. I peeked up to see that Tyler, Mike, Austin, and Ben had their heads bent together, deep in conversation. \u201cYeah,\u201d Mike whispered. \u201cDid you see the size of that Jacob kid? I think he could take Cullen down.\u201d Mike sounded pleased by the idea. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Ben disagreed. \u201cThere\u2019s something about Edward. He\u2019s always so . . . confident. I have a feeling he can take care of himself.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m with Ben,\u201d Tyler agreed. \u201cBesides, if that other kid messed Edward up, you know those big brothers of his would get involved.\u201d \u201cHave you been down to La Push lately?\u201d Mike asked. \u201cLauren and I went to the beach a couple of weeks ago, and believe me, Jacob\u2019s friends are all just as big as he is.\u201d \u201cHuh,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cToo bad it didn\u2019t turn into anything. Guess we\u2019ll never know how it would have turned out.\u201d \u201cIt didn\u2019t look over to me,\u201d Austin said. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll get to see.\u201d Mike grinned. \u201cAnyone in the mood for a bet?\u201d \u201cTen on Jacob,\u201d Austin said at once. \u201cTen on Cullen,\u201d Tyler chimed in. \u201cTen on Edward,\u201d Ben agreed. \u201cJacob,\u201d Mike said. \u201cHey, do you guys know what it was about?\u201d Austin wondered. \u201cThat might affect the odds.\u201d \u201cI can guess,\u201d Mike said, and then he shot a glance at me at the same time that Ben and Tyler did. From their expressions, none of them had realized I was in easy hearing distance. They all looked away quickly, shuffling the papers on their desks. \u201cI still say Jacob,\u201d Mike muttered under his breath.",
