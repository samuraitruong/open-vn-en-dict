            "en": "13        13. CONFESSIONS Edward in the sunlight was shocking. I couldn't get used to it, though I'd been staring at him all afternoon. His skin, white despite the faint flush from yesterday's hunting trip, literally sparkled, like thousands of tiny diamonds were embedded in the surface. He lay perfectly still in the grass, his shirt open over his sculpted, incandescent chest, his scintillating arms bare. His glistening, pale lavender lids were shut, though of course he didn't sleep. A perfect statue, carved in some unknown stone, smooth like marble, glittering like crystal. Now and then, his lips would move, so fast it looked like they were trembling. But, when I asked, he told me he was singing to himself; it was too low for me to hear. I enjoyed the sun, too, though the air wasn't quite dry enough for my taste. I would have liked to lie back, as he did, and let the sun warm my face. But I stayed curled up, my chin resting on my knees, unwilling to take my eyes off him. The wind was gentle; it tangled my hair and ruffled the grass that swayed around his motionless form. The meadow, so spectacular to me at first, paled next to his magnificence. Hesitantly, always afraid, even now, that he would disappear like a mirage, too beautiful to be real\u2026 hesitantly, I reached out one finger and stroked the back of his shimmering hand, where it lay within my reach. I marveled again at the perfect texture, satin smooth, cool as stone. When I looked up again, his eyes were open, watching me. Butterscotch today, lighter, warmer after hunting. His quick smile turned up the corners of his flawless lips. \"I don't scare you?\" he asked playfully, but I could hear the real curiosity in his soft voice. \"No more than usual.\" He smiled wider; his teeth flashed in the sun. I inched closer, stretched out my whole hand now to trace the contours of his forearm with my fingertips. I saw that my fingers trembled, and knew it wouldn't escape his notice. \"Do you mind?\" I asked, for he had closed his eyes again. \"No,\" he said without opening his eyes. \"You can't imagine how that feels.\" He sighed. I lightly trailed my hand over the perfect muscles of his arm, followed\u00a0 the faint pattern of bluish veins inside the crease at his elbow. With my other hand, I reached to turn his hand over. Realizing what I wished, he flipped his palm up in one of those blindingly fast, disconcerting movements of his. It startled me; my fingers froze on his arm for a brief second. \"Sorry,\" he murmured. I looked up in time to see his golden eyes close again. \"It's too easy to be myself with you.\" I lifted his hand, turning it this way and that as I watched the sun glitter on his palm. I held it closer to my face, trying to see the hidden facets in his skin. \"Tell me what you're thinking,\" he whispered. I looked to see his eyes watching me, suddenly intent. \"It's still so strange for me, not knowing.\" \"You know, the rest of us feel that way all the time.\" \"It's a hard life.\" Did I imagine the hint of regret in his tone? \"But you didn't tell me.\" \"I was wishing I could know what you were thinking\u2026\" I hesitated. \"And?\" \"I was wishing that I could believe that you were real. And I was wishing that I wasn't afraid.\" \"I don't want you to be afraid.\" His voice was just a soft murmur. I heard what he couldn't truthfully say, that I didn't need to be afraid, that there was nothing to fear. \"Well, that's not exactly the fear I meant, though that's certainly something to think about.\" So quickly that I missed his movement, he was half sitting, propped up on his right arm, his left palm still in my hands. His angel's face was only a few inches from mine. I might have \u2014 should have \u2014 flinched away from his unexpected closeness, but I was unable to move.  His golden eyes mesmerized me. \"What are you afraid of, then?\" he whispered intently. But I couldn't answer. As I had just that once before, I smelled his cool breath in my face. Sweet, delicious, the scent made my mouth water. It was unlike anything else. Instinctively, unthinkingly, I leaned closer, inhaling. And he was gone, his hand ripped from mine. In the time it took my eyes to focus, he was twenty feet away, standing at the edge of the small meadow, in the deep shade of a huge fir tree. He stared at me, his eyes dark in the shadows, his expression unreadable. I could feel the hurt and shock on my face. My empty hands stung. \"I'm\u2026 sorry\u2026 Edward,\" I whispered. I knew he could hear. \"Give me a moment,\" he called, just loud enough for my less sensitive ears. I sat very still. After ten incredibly long seconds, he walked back, slowly for him. He stopped, still several feet away, and sank gracefully to the ground, crossing his legs. His eyes never left mine.  He took two deep breaths, and then smiled in apology. \"I am so very sorry.\" He hesitated. \"Would you understand what I meant if I said I was only human?\" I nodded once, not quite able to smile at his joke. Adrenaline pulsed through my veins as the realization of danger slowly sank in. He could smell that from where he sat. His smile turned mocking. \"I'm the world's best predator, aren't I? Everything about me invites you in \u2014 my voice, my face, even my smell. As if I need any of that!\" Unexpectedly, he was on his feet, bounding away, instantly out of sight, only to appear beneath the same tree as before, having circled the meadow in half a second. \"As if you could outrun me,\" he laughed bitterly. He reached up with one hand and, with a deafening crack, effortlessly ripped a two-foot-thick branch from the trunk of the spruce. He balanced it in that hand for a moment, and then threw it with blinding speed, shattering it against another huge tree, which shook and trembled at the blow. And he was in front of me again, standing two feet away, still as a stone. \"As if you could fight me off,\" he said gently. I sat without moving, more frightened of him than I had ever been. I'd never seen him so completely freed of that carefully cultivated facade. He'd never been less human\u2026 or more beautiful. Face ashen, eyes wide, I sat like a bird locked in the eyes of a snake. His lovely eyes seem to glow with rash excitement. Then, as the seconds passed, they dimmed. His expression slowly folded into a mask of ancient sadness. \"Don't be afraid,\" he murmured, his velvet voice unintentionally seductive. \"I promise\u2026\" He hesitated. \"I swear not to hurt you.\" He seemed more concerned with convincing himself than me. \"Don't be afraid,\" he whispered again as he stepped closer, with exaggerated slowness. He sat sinuously, with deliberately unhurried movements, till our faces were on the same level, just a foot apart. \"Please forgive me,\" he said formally. \"I can control myself. You caught me off guard. But I'm on my best behavior now.\" He waited, but I still couldn't speak. \"I'm not thirsty today, honestly.\" He winked. At that I had to laugh, though the sound was shaky and breathless. \"Are you all right?\" he asked tenderly, reaching out slowly, carefully, to place his marble hand back in mine. I looked at his smooth, cold hand, and then at his eyes. They were soft, repentant. I looked back at his hand, and then deliberately returned to tracing the lines in his hand with my fingertip. I looked up and smiled timidly. His answering smile was dazzling. \"So where were we, before I behaved so rudely?\" he asked in the gentle cadences of an earlier century. \"I honestly can't remember.\" He smiled, but his face was ashamed. \"I think we were talking about why you were afraid, besides the obvious reason.\" \"Oh, right.\" \"Well?\" I looked down at his hand and doodled aimlessly across his smooth, iridescent palm. The seconds ticked by. \"How easily frustrated I am,\" he sighed. I looked into his eyes, abruptly grasping that this was every bit as new to him as it was to me. As many years of unfathomable experience as he had, this was hard for him, too. I took courage from that thought. \"I was afraid\u2026 because, for, well, obvious reasons, I can't stay with you. And I'm afraid that I'd like to stay with you, much more than I should.\" I looked down at his hands as I spoke. It was difficult for me to say this aloud. \"Yes,\" he agreed slowly. \"That is something to be afraid of, indeed. Wanting to be with me. That's really not in your best interest.\" I frowned. \"I should have left long ago,\" he sighed. \"I should leave now. But I don't know if I can.\" \"I don't want you to leave,\" I mumbled pathetically, staring down again. \"Which is exactly why I should. But don't worry. I'm essentially a selfish creature. I crave your company too much to do what I should.\" \"I'm glad.\" \"Don't be!\" He withdrew his hand, more gently this time; his voice was harsher than usual. Harsh for him, still more beautiful than any human voice. It was hard to keep up \u2014 his sudden mood changes left me always a step behind, dazed. \"It's not only your company I crave! Never forget that. Never forget I am more dangerous to you than I am to anyone else.\" He stopped, and I looked to see him gazing unseeingly into the forest. I thought for a moment. \"I don't think I understand exactly what you mean \u2014 by that last part anyway,\" I said. He looked back at me and smiled, his mood shifting yet again. \"How do I explain?\" he mused. \"And without frightening you again\u2026 hmmmm.\" Without seeming to think about it, he placed his hand back in mine; I held it tightly in both of mine. He looked at our hands. \"That's amazingly pleasant, the warmth.\" He sighed. A moment passed as he assembled his thoughts. \"You know how everyone enjoys different flavors?\" he began. \"Some people love chocolate ice cream, others prefer strawberry?\" I nodded. \"Sorry about the food analogy \u2014 I couldn't think of another way to explain.\" I smiled. He smiled ruefully back. \"You see, every person smells different, has a different essence. If you locked an alcoholic in a room full of stale beer, he'd gladly drink it. But he could resist, if he wished to, if he were a recovering alcoholic. Now let's say you placed in that room a glass of hundred-year-old brandy, the rarest, finest cognac \u2014 and filled the room with its warm aroma \u2014 how do you think he would fare then?\" We sat silently, looking into each other's eyes \u2014 trying to read each other's thoughts. He broke the silence first. \"Maybe that's not the right comparison. Maybe it would be too easy to turn down the brandy. Perhaps I should have made our alcoholic a heroin addict instead.\" \"So what you're saying is, I'm your brand of heroin?\" I teased, trying to lighten the mood. He smiled swiftly, seeming to appreciate my effort. \"Yes, you are exactly my brand of heroin.\" \"Does that happen often?\" I asked. He looked across the treetops, thinking through his response. \"I spoke to my brothers about it.\" He still stared into the distance. \"To Jasper, every one of you is much the same. He's the most recent to join our family. It's a struggle for him to abstain at all. He hasn't had time to grow sensitive to the differences in smell, in flavor.\" He glanced swiftly at me, his expression apologetic. \"Sorry,\" he said. \"I don't mind. Please don't worry about offending me, or frightening me, or whichever. That's the way you think. I can understand, or I can try to at least. Just explain however you can.\" He took a deep breath and gazed at the sky again. \"So Jasper wasn't sure if he'd ever come across someone who was as\" \u2014 he hesitated, looking for the right word \u2014 \"appealing as you are to me.\u00a0 Which makes me think not. Emmett has been on the wagon longer, so to speak, and he understood what I meant. He says twice, for him, once stronger than the other.\" \"And for you?\" \"Never.\" The word hung there for a moment in the warm breeze. \"What did Emmett do?\" I asked to break the silence. It was the wrong question to ask. His face grew dark, his hand clenched into a fist inside mine. He looked away. I waited, but he wasn't going to answer. \"I guess I know,\" I finally said. He lifted his eyes; his expression was wistful, pleading. \"Even the strongest of us fall off the wagon, don't we?\" \"What are you asking? My permission?\" My voice was sharper than I'd intended. I tried to make my tone kinder \u2014 I could guess what his honesty must cost him. \"I mean, is there no hope, then?\" How calmly I could discuss my own death! \"No, no!\" He was instantly contrite. \"Of course there's hope! I mean, of course I won't\u2026\" He left the sentence hanging. His eyes burned into mine. \"It's different for us. Emmett\u2026 these were strangers he happened across. It was a long time ago, and he wasn't as\u2026 practiced, as careful, as he is now.\" He fell silent and watched me intently as I thought it through. \"So if we'd met\u2026 oh, in a dark alley or something\u2026\" I trailed off. \"It took everything I had not to jump up in the middle of that class full of children and \u2014\" He stopped abruptly, looking away. \"When you walked past me, I could have ruined everything Carlisle has built for us, right then and there. If I hadn't been denying my thirst for the last, well, too many years, I wouldn't have been able to stop myself.\" He paused, scowling at the trees. He glanced at me grimly, both of us remembering. \"You must have thought I was possessed.\" \"I couldn't understand why. How you could hate me so quickly\u2026\" \"To me, it was like you were some kind of demon, summoned straight from my own personal hell to ruin me. The fragrance coming off your skin\u2026 I thought it would make me deranged that first day. In that one hour, I thought of a hundred different ways to lure you from the room with me, to get you alone. And I fought them each back, thinking of my family, what I could do to them. I had to run out, to get away before I could speak the words that would make you follow\u2026\" He looked up then at my staggered expression as I tried to absorb his bitter memories. His golden eyes scorched from under his lashes, hypnotic and deadly. \"You would have come,\" he promised. I tried to speak calmly. \"Without a doubt.\" He frowned down at my hands, releasing me from the force of his stare. \"And then, as I tried to rearrange my schedule in a pointless attempt to avoid you, you were there \u2014 in that close, warm little room, the scent was maddening. I so very nearly took you then. There was only one other frail human there \u2014 so easily dealt with.\" I shivered in the warm sun, seeing my memories anew through his eyes, only now grasping the danger. Poor Ms. Cope; I shivered again at how close I'd come to being inadvertently responsible for her death. \"But I resisted. I don't know how. I forced myself not to wait for you, not to follow you from the school. It was easier outside, when I couldn't smell you anymore, to think clearly, to make the right decision. I left the others near home \u2014 I was too ashamed to tell them how weak I was, they only knew something was very wrong \u2014 and then I went straight to Carlisle, at the hospital, to tell him I was leaving.\" I stared in surprise.  \"I traded cars with him \u2014 he had a full tank of gas and I didn't want to stop. I didn't dare to go home, to face Esme. She wouldn't have let me go without a scene. She would have tried to convince me that it wasn't necessary\u2026 \"By the next morning I was in Alaska.\" He sounded ashamed, as if admitting a great cowardice. \"I spent two days there, with some old acquaintances\u2026 but I was homesick. I hated knowing I'd upset Esme, and the rest of them, my adopted family. In the pure air of the mountains it was hard to believe you were so irresistible. I convinced myself it was weak to run away. I'd dealt with temptation before, not of this magnitude, not even close, but I was strong. Who were you, an insignificant little girl\" \u2014 he grinned suddenly \u2014 \"to chase me from the place I wanted to be? So I came back\u2026\" He stared off into space. I couldn't speak. \"I took precautions, hunting, feeding more than usual before seeing you again. I was sure that I was strong enough to treat you like any other human. I was arrogant about it. \"It was unquestionably a complication that I couldn't simply read your thoughts to know what your reaction was to me. I wasn't used to having to go to such circuitous measures, listening to your words in Jessica's mind\u2026 her mind isn't very original, and it was annoying to have to stoop to that. And then I couldn't know if you really meant what you said. It was all extremely irritating.\" He frowned at the memory. \"I wanted you to forget my behavior that first day, if possible, so I tried to talk with you like I would with any person. I was eager actually, hoping to decipher some of your thoughts. But you were too interesting, I found myself caught up in your expressions\u2026 and every now and then you would stir the air with your hand or your hair, and the scent would stun me again\u2026 \"Of course, then you were nearly crushed to death in front of my eyes. Later I thought of a perfectly good excuse for why I acted at that moment \u2014 because if I hadn't saved you, if your blood had been spilled there in front of me, I don't think I could have stopped myself from exposing us for what we are. But I only thought of that excuse later. At the time, all I could think was, 'Not her.'\" He closed his eyes, lost in his agonized confession. I listened, more eager than rational. Common sense told me I should be terrified. Instead, I was relieved to finally understand. And I was filled with compassion for his suffering, even now, as he confessed his craving to take my life. I finally was able to speak, though my voice was faint. \"In the hospital?\" His eyes flashed up to mine. \"I was appalled. I couldn't believe I had put us in danger after all, put myself in your power \u2014 you of all people. As if I needed another motive to kill you.\"  We both flinched as that word slipped out. \"But it had the opposite effect,\" he continued quickly. \"I fought with Rosalie, Emmett, and Jasper when they suggested that now was the time\u2026 the worst fight we've ever had. Carlisle sided with me, and Alice.\" He grimaced when he said her name. I couldn't imagine why. \"Esme told me to do whatever I had to in order to stay.\" He shook his head indulgently. \"All that next day I eavesdropped on the minds of everyone you spoke to, shocked that you kept your word. I didn't understand you at all. But I knew that I couldn't become more involved with you. I did my very best to stay as far from you as possible. And every day the perfume of your skin, your breath, your hair\u2026 it hit me as hard as the very first day.\" He met my eyes again, and they were surprisingly tender. \"And for all that,\" he continued, \"I'd have fared better if I had exposed us all at that first moment, than if now, here \u2014 with no witnesses and nothing to stop me \u2014 I were to hurt you.\" I was human enough to have to ask. \"Why?\" \"Isabella.\" He pronounced my full name carefully, then playfully ruffled my hair with his free hand. A shock ran through my body at his casual touch. \"Bella, I couldn't live with myself if I ever hurt you. You don't know how it's tortured me.\" He looked down, ashamed again. \"The thought of you, still, white, cold\u2026 to never see you blush scarlet again, to never see that flash of intuition in your eyes when you see through my pretenses\u2026 it would be unendurable.\" He lifted his glorious, agonized eyes to mine. \"You are the most important thing to me now. The most important thing to me ever.\" My head was spinning at the rapid change in direction our conversation had taken. From the cheerful topic of my impending demise, we were suddenly declaring ourselves. He waited, and even though I looked down to study our hands between us, I knew his golden eyes were on me.  \"You already know how I feel, of course,\" I finally said. \"I'm here\u2026 which, roughly translated, means I would rather die than stay away from you.\" I frowned. \"I'm an idiot.\" \"You are an idiot,\" he agreed with a laugh. Our eyes met, and I laughed, too. We laughed together at the idiocy and sheer impossibility of such a moment. \"And so the lion fell in love with the lamb\u2026\" he murmured. I looked away, hiding my eyes as I thrilled to the word. \"What a stupid lamb,\" I sighed. \"What a sick, masochistic lion.\" He stared into the shadowy forest for a long moment, and I wondered where his thoughts had taken him. \"Why\u2026 ?\" I began, and then paused, not sure how to continue. He looked at me and smiled; sunlight glinted off his face, his teeth.  \"Yes?\" \"Tell me why you ran from me before.\" His smile faded. \"You know why.\" \"No, I mean, exactly what did I do wrong? I'll have to be on my guard, you see, so I better start learning what I shouldn't do. This, for example\" \u2014 I stroked the back of his hand \u2014 \"seems to be all right.\" He smiled again. \"You didn't do anything wrong, Bella. It was my fault.\" \"But I want to help, if I can, to not make this harder for you.\" \"Well\u2026\" He contemplated for a moment. \"It was just how close you were. Most humans instinctively shy away from us, are repelled by our alienness\u2026 I wasn't expecting you to come so close. And the smell of your throat.\" He stopped short, looking to see if he'd upset me. \"Okay, then,\" I said flippantly, trying to alleviate the suddenly tense atmosphere. I tucked my chin. \"No throat exposure.\" It worked; he laughed. \"No, really, it was more the surprise than anything else.\" He raised his free hand and placed it gently on the side of my neck. I sat very still, the chill of his touch a natural warning \u2014 a warning telling me to be terrified. But there was no feeling of fear in me. There were, however, other feelings\u2026 \"You see,\" he said. \"Perfectly fine.\" My blood was racing, and I wished I could slow it, sensing that this must make everything so much more difficult \u2014 the thudding of my pulse in my veins. Surely he could hear it. \"The blush on your cheeks is lovely,\" he murmured. He gently freed his other hand. My hands fell limply into my lap. Softly he brushed my cheek, then held my face between his marble hands. \"Be very still,\" he whispered, as if I wasn't already frozen. Slowly, never moving his eyes from mine, he leaned toward me. Then abruptly, but very gently, he rested his cold cheek against the hollow at the base of my throat. I was quite unable to move, even if I'd wanted to. I listened to the sound of his even breathing, watching the sun and wind play in his bronze hair, more human than any other part of him. With deliberate slowness, his hands slid down the sides of my neck. I shivered, and I heard him catch his breath. But his hands didn't pause as they softly moved to my shoulders, and then stopped. His face drifted to the side, his nose skimming across my <em>collarbone</em>. He came to rest with the side of his face pressed tenderly against my chest. Listening to my heart. \"Ah,\" he sighed. I don't know how long we sat without moving. It could have been hours.  Eventually the throb of my pulse quieted, but he didn't move or speak again as he held me. I knew at any moment it could be too much, and my life could end \u2014 so quickly that I might not even notice. And I couldn't make myself be afraid. I couldn't think of anything, except that he was touching me. And then, too soon, he released me.  His eyes were peaceful. \"It won't be so hard again,\" he said with satisfaction. \"Was that very hard for you?\" \"Not nearly as bad as I imagined it would be. And you?\" \"No, it wasn't bad\u2026 for me.\" He smiled at my inflection. \"You know what I mean.\" I smiled. \"Here.\" He took my hand and placed it against his cheek. \"Do you feel how warm it is?\" And it was almost warm, his usually icy skin. But I barely noticed, for I was touching his face, something I'd dreamed of constantly since the first day I'd seen him. \"Don't move,\" I whispered. No one could be still like Edward. He closed his eyes and became as immobile as stone, a carving under my hand. I moved even more slowly than he had, careful not to make one unexpected move. I caressed his cheek, delicately stroked his eyelid, the purple shadow in the hollow under his eye. I traced the shape of his perfect nose, and then, so carefully, his flawless lips. His lips parted under my hand, and I could feel his cool breath on my fingertips. I wanted to lean in, to inhale the scent of him. So I dropped my hand and leaned away, not wanting to push him too far. He opened his eyes, and they were hungry. Not in a way to make me fear, but rather to tighten the muscles in the pit of my stomach and send my pulse hammering through my veins again. \"I wish,\" he whispered, \"I wish you could feel the\u2026 complexity\u2026 the confusion\u2026 I feel. That you could understand.\" He raised his hand to my hair, then carefully brushed it across my face. \"Tell me,\" I breathed. \"I don't think I can. I've told you, on the one hand, the hunger \u2014 the thirst \u2014 that, deplorable creature that I am, I feel for you. And I think you can understand that, to an extent. Though\" \u2014 he half-smiled \u2014 \"as you are not addicted to any illegal substances, you probably can't empathize completely. \"But\u2026\" His fingers touched my lips lightly, making me shiver again. \"There are other hungers. Hungers I don't even understand, that are foreign to me.\" \"I may understand that better than you think.\" \"I'm not used to feeling so human. Is it always like this?\" \"For me?\" I paused. \"No, never. Never before this.\" He held my hands between his. They felt so feeble in his iron strength. \"I don't know how to be close to you,\" he admitted. \"I don't know if I can.\" I leaned forward very slowly, cautioning him with my eyes. I placed my cheek against his stone chest. I could hear his breath, and nothing else. \"This is enough,\" I sighed, closing my eyes. In a very human gesture, he put his arms around me and pressed his face against my hair. \"You're better at this than you give yourself credit for,\" I noted. \"I have human instincts \u2014 they may be buried deep, but they're there.\" We sat like that for another immeasurable moment; I wondered if he could be as unwilling to move as I was. But I could see the light was fading, the shadows of the forest beginning to touch us, and I sighed. \"You have to go.\" \"I thought you couldn't read my mind.\" \"It's getting clearer.\" I could hear a smile in his voice. He took my shoulders and I looked into his face. \"Can I show you something?\" he asked, sudden excitement flaring in his eyes. \"Show me what?\" \"I'll show you how I travel in the forest.\" He saw my expression. \"Don't worry, you'll be very safe, and we'll get to your truck much faster.\" His mouth twitched up into that crooked smile so beautiful my heart nearly stopped. \"Will you turn into a bat?\" I asked warily. He laughed, louder than I'd ever heard. \"Like I haven't heard that one before!\" \"Right, I'm sure you get that all the time.\" \"Come on, little coward, climb on my back.\" I waited to see if he was kidding, but, apparently, he meant it. He smiled as he read my hesitation, and reached for me. My heart reacted; even though he couldn't hear my thoughts, my pulse always gave me away. He then proceeded to sling me onto his back, with very little effort on my part, besides, when in place, clamping my legs and arms so tightly around him that it would choke a normal person. It was like clinging to a stone. \"I'm a bit heavier than your average backpack,\" I warned.  \"Hah!\" he snorted. I could almost hear his eyes rolling. I'd never seen him in such high spirits before. He startled me, suddenly grabbing my hand, pressing my palm to his face, and inhaling deeply. \"Easier all the time,\" he muttered. And then he was running. If I'd ever feared death before in his presence, it was nothing compared to how I felt now. He streaked through the dark, thick underbrush of the forest like a bullet, like a ghost. There was no sound, no evidence that his feet touched the earth. His breathing never changed, never indicated any effort. But the trees flew by at deadly speeds, always missing us by inches. I was too terrified to close my eyes, though the cool forest air whipped against my face and burned them. I felt as if I were stupidly sticking my head out the window of an airplane in flight. And, for the first time in my life, I felt the dizzy faintness of motion sickness. Then it was over. We'd hiked hours this morning to reach Edward's meadow, and now, in a matter of minutes, we were back to the truck. \"Exhilarating, isn't it?\" His voice was high, excited. He stood motionless, waiting for me to climb down. I tried, but my muscles wouldn't respond. My arms and legs stayed locked around him while my head spun uncomfortably. \"Bella?\" he asked, anxious now. \"I think I need to lie down,\" I gasped. \"Oh, sorry.\" He waited for me, but I still couldn't move. \"I think I need help,\" I admitted. He laughed quietly, and gently unloosened my stranglehold on his neck. There was no resisting the iron strength of his hands. Then he pulled me around to face him, cradling me in his arms like a small child. He held me for a moment, then carefully placed me on the springy ferns. \"How do you feel?\" he asked. I couldn't be sure how I felt when my head was spinning so crazily. \"Dizzy, I think.\" \"Put your head between your knees.\" I tried that, and it helped a little. I breathed in and out slowly, keeping my head very still. I felt him sitting beside me. The moments passed, and eventually I found that I could raise my head. There was a hollow ringing sound in my ears. \"I guess that wasn't the best idea,\" he mused. I tried to be positive, but my voice was weak. \"No, it was very interesting.\" \"Hah! You're as white as a ghost \u2014 no, you're as white as me!\" \"I think I should have closed my eyes.\" \"Remember that next time.\" \"Next time!\" I groaned. He laughed, his mood still radiant. \"Show-off,\" I muttered. \"Open your eyes, Bella,\" he said quietly. And he was right there, his face so close to mine. His beauty stunned my mind \u2014 it was too much, an excess I couldn't grow accustomed to. \"I was thinking, while I was running\u2026\" He paused. \"About not hitting the trees, I hope.\" \"Silly Bella,\" he chuckled. \"Running is second nature to me, it's not something I have to think about.\" \"Show-off,\" I muttered again. He smiled. \"No,\" he continued, \"I was thinking there was something I wanted to try.\" And he took my face in his hands again. I couldn't breathe. He hesitated \u2014 not in the normal way, the human way. Not the way a man might hesitate before he kissed a woman, to gauge her reaction, to see how he would be received. Perhaps he would hesitate to prolong the moment, that ideal moment of anticipation, sometimes better than the kiss itself. Edward hesitated to test himself, to see if this was safe, to make sure he was still in control of his need. And then his cold, marble lips pressed very softly against mine. What neither of us was prepared for was my response. Blood boiled under my skin, burned in my lips. My breath came in a wild gasp. My fingers knotted in his hair, clutching him to me. My lips parted as I breathed in his heady scent. Immediately I felt him turn to unresponsive stone beneath my lips. His hands gently, but with irresistible force, pushed my face back. I opened my eyes and saw his guarded expression. \"Oops,\" I breathed. \"That's an understatement.\" His eyes were wild, his jaw clenched in acute restraint, yet he didn't lapse from his perfect articulation. He held my face just inches from his. He dazzled my eyes. \"Should I\u2026 ?\" I tried to disengage myself, to give him some room. His hands refused to let me move so much as an inch. \"No, it's tolerable. Wait for a moment, please.\" His voice was polite, controlled. I kept my eyes on his, watched as the excitement in them faded and gentled. Then he smiled a surprisingly impish grin. \"There,\" he said, obviously pleased with himself. \"Tolerable?\" I asked. He laughed aloud. \"I'm stronger than I thought. It's nice to know.\" \"I wish I could say the same. I'm sorry.\" \"You are only human, after all.\" \"Thanks so much,\" I said, my voice acerbic. He was on his feet in one of his lithe, almost invisibly quick movements. He held out his hand to me, an unexpected gesture. I was so used to our standard of careful non-contact. I took his icy hand, needing the support more than I thought. My balance had not yet returned. \"Are you still faint from the run? Or was it my kissing expertise?\" How lighthearted, how human he seemed as he laughed now, his seraphic face untroubled. He was a different Edward than the one I had known. And I felt all the more besotted by him. It would cause me physical pain to be separated from him now. \"I can't be sure, I'm still woozy,\" I managed to respond. \"I think it's some of both, though.\" \"Maybe you should let me drive.\" \"Are you insane?\" I protested. \"I can drive better than you on your best day,\" he teased. \"You have much slower reflexes.\" \"I'm sure that's true, but I don't think my nerves, or my truck, could take it.\" \"Some trust, please, Bella.\" My hand was in my pocket, curled tightly around the key. I pursed my lips, deliberated, then shook my head with a tight grin. \"Nope. Not a chance.\" He raised his eyebrows in disbelief. I started to step around him, heading for the driver's side. He might have let me pass if I hadn't wobbled slightly. Then again, he might not have. His arm created an inescapable snare around my waist. \"Bella, I've already expended a great deal of personal effort at this point to keep you alive. I'm not about to let you behind the wheel of a vehicle when you can't even walk straight. Besides, friends don't let friends drive drunk,\" he quoted with a chuckle. I could smell the unbearably sweet fragrance coming off his chest. \"Drunk?\" I objected. \"You're intoxicated by my very presence.\" He was grinning that playful smirk again. \"I can't argue with that,\" I sighed.; I couldn't resist him in anything. I held the key high and dropped it, watching his hand flash like lightning to catch it soundlessly. \"Take it easy \u2014 my truck is a senior citizen.\" \"Very sensible,\" he approved. \"And are you not affected at all?\" I asked, irked. \"By my presence?\" Again his mobile features transformed, his expression became soft, warm. He didn't answer at first; he simply bent his face to mine, and brushed his lips slowly along my jaw, from my ear to my chin, back and forth. I trembled. \"Regardless,\" he finally murmured, \"I have better reflexes.\"",

Jacob was still full of himself for engineering my escape. \u201cDo you think they\u2019ll come looking for you?\u201d he asked, sounding hopeful. \u201cNo.\u201d I was certain about that. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be furious with me tonight, though.\u201d He picked up a rock and chucked it into the waves. \u201cDon\u2019t go back, then,\u201d he suggested again. \u00a0\u201cCharlie would love that,\u201d I said sarcastically. \u201cI bet he wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d I didn\u2019t answer. Jacob was probably right, and that made me grind my teeth together. Charlie\u2019s blatant preference for my Quileute friends was so unfair. I wondered if he would feel the same if he knew the choice was really between vampires and werewolves. \u201cSo what\u2019s the latest pack scandal?\u201d I asked lightly. Jacob skidded to a halt, and he stared down at me with shocked eyes. \u201cWhat? That was a joke.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d He looked away. I waited for him to start walking again, but he seemed lost in thought.  \u201cIs there a scandal?\u201d I wondered. Jacob chuckled once. \u201cI forget what it\u2019s like, not having everyone know everything all the time. Having a quiet, private place inside my head.\u201d We walked along the stony beach quietly for a few minutes. \u00a0\u201cSo what is it?\u201d I finally asked. \u201cThat everyone in your head already knows?\u201d He hesitated for a moment, as if he weren\u2019t sure how much he was going to tell me. Then he sighed and said, \u201cQuil imprinted. That\u2019s three now. The rest of us are starting to get worried. Maybe it\u2019s more common than the stories say. . . .\u201d He frowned, and then turned to stare at me. He gazed into my eyes without speaking, his eyebrows furrowed in concentration. \u201cWhat are you staring at?\u201d I asked, feeling self-conscious. He sighed. \u201cNothing.\u201d Jacob started walking again. Without seeming to think about it, he reached out and took my hand. We paced silently across the rocks. I thought of how we must look walking hand and hand down the beach \u2014 like a couple, certainly \u2014 and wondered if I should object. But this was the way it had always been with Jacob. . . . No reason to get worked up about it now. \u201cWhy is Quil\u2019s imprinting such a scandal?\u201d I asked when it didn\u2019t look like he was going to go on. \u201cIs it because he\u2019s the newest one?\u201d  \u201cThat doesn\u2019t have anything to do with it.\u201d \u201cThen what\u2019s the problem?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s another one of those legend things. I wonder when we\u2019re going to stop being surprised that they\u2019re all true?\u201d he muttered to himself. \u00a0\u201cAre you going to tell me? Or do I have to guess?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d never get it right. See, Quil hasn\u2019t been hanging out with us, you know, until just recently. So he hadn\u2019t been around Emily\u2019s place much.\u201d \u201cQuil imprinted on Emily, too?\u201d I gasped. \u201cNo! I told you not to guess. Emily had her two nieces down for a visit . . . and Quil met Claire.\u201d He didn\u2019t continue. I thought about that for a moment. \u201cEmily doesn\u2019t want her niece with a werewolf? That\u2019s a little hypocritical,\u201d I said. But I could understand why she of all people might feel that way. I thought again of the long scars that marred her face and extended all the way down her right arm. Sam had lost control just once when he was standing too close to her. Once was all it took. . . . I\u2019d seen the pain in Sam\u2019s eyes when he looked at what he\u2019d done to Emily. I could understand why Emily might want to protect her niece from that. \u00a0\u201cWould you please stop guessing? You\u2019re way off. Emily doesn\u2019t mind that part, it\u2019s just, well, a little early.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean early?\u201d Jacob appraised me with narrowed eyes. \u201cTry not to be judgmental, okay?\u201d I nodded cautiously. \u201cClaire is two,\u201d Jacob told me. Rain started to fall. I blinked furiously as the drops pelted my face. Jacob waited in silence. He wore no jacket, as usual; the rain left a spatter of dark spots on his black T-shirt, and dripped through his shaggy hair. His face was expressionless as he watched mine. \u201cQuil . . . imprinted . . . with a two-year-old?\u201d I was finally able to ask. \u201cIt happens.\u201d Jacob shrugged. He bent to grab another rock and sent it flying out into the bay. \u201cOr so the stories say.\u201d \u201cBut she\u2019s a baby,\u201d I protested. He looked at me with dark amusement. \u201cQuil\u2019s not getting any older,\u201d he reminded me, a bit of acid in his tone. \u201cHe\u2019ll just have to be patient for a few decades.\u201d \u201cI . . . don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d I was trying my hardest not to be critical, but, in truth, I was horrified. Until now, nothing about the werewolves had bothered me since the day I\u2019d found out they weren\u2019t committing the murders I\u2019d suspected them of. \u201cYou\u2019re making judgments,\u201d he accused. \u201cI can see it on your face.\u201d \u201cSorry,\u201d I muttered. \u201cBut it sounds really creepy.\u201d \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not like that; you\u2019ve got it all wrong,\u201d Jacob defended his friend, suddenly vehement. \u201cI\u2019ve seen what it\u2019s like, through his eyes. There\u2019s nothing romantic about it at all, not for Quil, not now.\u201d He took a deep breath, frustrated. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard to describe. It\u2019s not like love at first sight, really. It\u2019s more like . . .gravity moves. When you see her, suddenly it\u2019s not the earth holding you here anymore. She does. And nothing matters more than her. And you would do anything for her, be anything for her. . . . You become whatever she needs you to be, whether that\u2019s a protector, or a lover, or a friend, or a brother.   \u201cQuil will be the best, kindest big brother any kid ever had. There isn\u2019t a toddler on the planet that will be more carefully looked after than that little girl will be. And then, when she\u2019s older and needs a friend, he\u2019ll be more understanding, trustworthy, and reliable than anyone else she knows. And then, when she\u2019s grown up, they\u2019ll be as happy as Emily and Sam.\u201d A strange, bitter edge sharpened his tone at the very end, when he spoke of Sam. \u00a0\u201cDoesn\u2019t Claire get a choice here?\u201d \u201cOf course. But why wouldn\u2019t she choose him, in the end? He\u2019ll be her perfect match. Like he was designed for her alone.\u201d We walked in silence for a moment, till I paused to toss a rock toward the ocean. It fell to the beach several meters short. Jacob laughed at me. \u201cWe can\u2019t all be freakishly strong,\u201d I muttered. He sighed. \u201cWhen do you think it will happen for you?\u201d I asked quietly. His answer was flat and immediate. \u201cNever.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not something you can control, is it?\u201d He was silent for a few minutes. Unconsciously, we both walked slower, barely moving at all. \u201cIt\u2019s not supposed to be,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut you have to see her \u2014 the one that\u2019s supposedly meant for you.\u201d \u201cAnd you think that if you haven\u2019t seen her yet, then she\u2019s not out there?\u201d I asked skeptically. \u201cJacob, you haven\u2019t really seen much of the world \u2014 less than me, even.\u201d \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t,\u201d he said in a low voice. He looked at my face with suddenly piercing eyes. \u201cBut I\u2019ll never see anyone else, Bella. I only see you. Even when I close my eyes and try to see something else. Ask Quil or Embry. It drives them all crazy.\u201d I dropped my eyes to the rocks. We weren\u2019t walking anymore. The only sound was of the waves beating against the shore. I couldn\u2019t hear the rain over their roar. \u201cMaybe I\u2019d better go home,\u201d I whispered. \u201cNo!\u201d he protested, surprised by this conclusion. I looked up at him again, and his eyes were anxious now. \u201cYou have the whole day off, right? The bloodsucker won\u2019t be home yet.\u201d I glared at him. \u201cNo offense intended,\u201d he said quickly. \u201cYes, I have the whole day. But, Jake . . .\u201d He held up his hands. \u201cSorry,\u201d he apologized. \u201cI won\u2019t be like that anymore. I\u2019ll just be Jacob.\u201d I sighed. \u201cBut if that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking . . .\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me,\u201d he insisted, smiling with deliberate cheer, too brightly. \u201cI know what I\u2019m doing. Just tell me if I\u2019m upsetting you.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. . . .\u201d \u201cC\u2019mon, Bella. Let\u2019s go back to the house and get our bikes. You\u2019ve got to ride a motorcycle regularly to keep it in tune.\u201d  \u201cI really don\u2019t think I\u2019m allowed.\u201d \u201cBy who? Charlie or the blood \u2014 or him?\u201d \u201cBoth.\u201d Jacob grinned my grin, and he was suddenly the Jacob I missed the most, sunny and warm. I couldn\u2019t help grinning back. The rain softened, turned to mist. \u201cI won\u2019t tell anyone,\u201d he promised. \u201cExcept every one of your friends.\u201d He shook his head soberly and raised his right hand. \u201cI promise not to think about it.\u201d I laughed. \u201cIf I get hurt, it was because I tripped.\u201d \u201cWhatever you say.\u201d We rode our motorcycles on the back roads around La Push until the rain made them too muddy and Jacob insisted that he was going to pass out if he didn\u2019t eat soon. Billy greeted me easily when we got to the house, as if my sudden reappearance meant nothing more complicated than that I\u2019d wanted to spend the day with my friend. After we ate the sandwiches Jacob made, we went out to the garage and I helped him clean up the bikes. I hadn\u2019t been here in months \u2014 since Edward had returned \u2014 but there was no sense of import to it. It was just another afternoon in the garage.  \u201cThis is nice,\u201d I commented when he pulled the warm sodas from the grocery bag. \u201cI\u2019ve missed this place.\u201d He smiled, looking around at the plastic sheds bolted together over our heads. \u201cYeah, I can understand that. All the splendor of the Taj Mahal, without the inconvenience and expense of traveling to India.\u201d \u201cTo Washington\u2019s little Taj Mahal,\u201d I toasted, holding up my can. He touched his can to mine.  \u201cDo you remember last Valentine\u2019s Day? I think that was the last time you were here \u2014 the last time when things were still . . . normal, I mean.\u201d I laughed. \u201cOf course I remember. I traded a lifetime of servitude for a box of conversation hearts. That\u2019s not something I\u2019m likely to forget.\u201d He laughed with me. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Hmm, servitude. I\u2019ll have to think of something good.\u201d Then he sighed. \u201cIt feels like it was years ago. Another era. A happier one.\u201d I couldn\u2019t agree with him. This was my happy era now. But I was surprised to realize how many things I missed from my own personal dark ages. I stared through the opening at the murky forest. The rain had picked up again, but it was warm in the little garage, sitting next to Jacob. He was as good as a furnace. His fingers brushed my hand. \u201cThings have really changed.\u201d \u00a0\u201cYeah,\u201d I said, and then I reached out and patted the back tire of my bike. \u201cCharlie used to like me. I hope Billy doesn\u2019t say anything about today. . . .\u201d I bit my lip. \u201cHe won\u2019t. He doesn\u2019t get worked up about things the way Charlie does. Hey, I never did apologize officially for that stupid move with the bike. I\u2019m real sorry about ratting you out to Charlie. I wish I hadn\u2019t.\u201d I rolled my eyes. \u201cMe, too.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m really, really sorry.\u201d He looked at me hopefully, his wet, tangled black hair sticking up in every direction around his pleading face. \u201cOh, fine! You\u2019re forgiven.\u201d \u201cThanks, Bells!\u201d We grinned at each other for a second, and then his face clouded over. \u201cYou know that day, when I brought the bike over . . . I\u2019ve been wanting to ask you something,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cBut also . . . not wanting to.\u201d I held very still \u2014 a reaction to stress. It was a habit I\u2019d picked up from Edward. \u201cWere you just being stubborn because you were mad at me, or were you really serious?\u201d he whispered. \u00a0\u201cAbout what?\u201d I whispered back, though I was sure I knew what he meant. He glared at me. \u201cYou know. When you said it was none of my business . . . if \u2014 if he bit you.\u201d He cringed visibly at the end. \u201cJake . . .\u201d My throat felt swollen. I couldn\u2019t finish. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. \u201cWere you serious?\u201d He was trembling just slightly. His eyes stayed closed.  \u201cYes,\u201d I whispered. Jacob inhaled, slow and deep. \u201cI guess I knew that.\u201d I stared at his face, waiting for his eyes to open. \u201cYou know what this will mean?\u201d He demanded suddenly. \u201cYou do understand that, don\u2019t you? What will happen if they break the treaty?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll leave first,\u201d I said in a small voice. His eyes flashed open, their black depths full of anger and pain. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a geographic limit to the treaty, Bella. Our great-grandfathers only agreed to keep the peace because the Cullens swore that they were different, that humans weren\u2019t in danger from them. They promised they would never kill or change anyone ever again. If they go back on their word, the treaty is meaningless, and they are no different than any other vampires. Once that\u2019s established, when we find them again \u2014\u201d.  \u00a0\u201cBut, Jake, didn\u2019t you break the treaty already?\u201d I asked, grasping at straws. \u201cWasn\u2019t part of it that you not tell people about the vampires? And you told me. So isn\u2019t the treaty sort of moot, anyhow?\u201d Jacob didn\u2019t like the reminder; the pain in his eyes hardened into animosity. \u201cYeah, I broke the treaty \u2014 back before I believed any of it. And I\u2019m sure they were informed of that.\u201d He glared sourly at my forehead, not meeting my shamed gaze. \u201cBut it\u2019s not like that gives them a freebie or anything. There\u2019s no fault for a fault. They have only one option if they object to what I did. The same option we\u2019ll have when they break the treaty: to attack. To start the war.\u201d He made it sound so inevitable. I shuddered. \u201cJake, it doesn\u2019t have to be that way.\u201d His teeth ground together. \u201cIt is that way.\u201d The silence after his declaration felt very loud. \u201cWill you never forgive me, Jacob?\u201d I whispered. As soon as I said the words, I wished I hadn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t want to hear his answer. \u201cYou won\u2019t be Bella anymore,\u201d he told me. \u201cMy friend won\u2019t exist. There\u2019ll be no one to forgive.\u201d \u201cThat sounds like a no, \u201d I whispered. We faced each other for an endless moment. \u201cIs this goodbye then, Jake?\u201d He blinked rapidly, his fierce expression melting in surprise. \u201cWhy? We still have a few years. Can\u2019t we be friends until we\u2019re out of time?\u201d \u201cYears? No, Jake, not years.\u201d I shook my head, and laughed once without humor. \u201cWeeks is more accurate.\u201d I was not expecting his reaction. He was suddenly on his feet, and there was a loud pop as the soda can exploded in his hand. Soda flew everywhere, soaking me, like it was spraying from a hose. \u201cJake!\u201d I started to complain, but I fell silent when I realized that his whole body was quivering with anger. He glared at me wildly, a growling sound building in his chest. I froze in place, too shocked to remember how to move. The shaking rolled through him, getting faster, until it looked like he was vibrating. His shape blurred. . . . And then Jacob gritted his teeth together, and the growling stopped. He squeezed his eyes tight in concentration; the quivering slowed until only his hands were shaking.  \u201cWeeks,\u201d Jacob said in a flat monotone. I couldn\u2019t respond; I was still frozen. He opened his eyes. They were beyond fury now. \u201cHe\u2019s going to change you into a filthy bloodsucker in just a few weeks!\u201d Jacob hissed through his teeth. Too stunned to take offense at his words, I just nodded mutely. His face turned green under the russet skin.  \u201cOf course, Jake,\u201d I whispered after a long minute of silence. \u201cHe\u2019s seventeen, Jacob. And I get closer to nineteen every day. Besides, what\u2019s the point in waiting? He\u2019s all I want. What else can I do?\u201d I\u2019d meant that as a rhetorical question. His words cracked like snaps of a whip. \u201cAnything. Anything else. You\u2019d be better off dead. I\u2019d rather you were.\u201d I recoiled like he\u2019d slapped me. It hurt worse than if he had. And then, as the pain shot through me, my own temper burst into flame. \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll get lucky,\u201d I said bleakly, lurching to my feet. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll get hit by a truck on my way back.\u201d I grabbed my motorcycle and pushed it out into the rain. He didn\u2019t move as I passed him. As soon as I was on the small, muddy path, I climbed on and kicked the bike to life. The rear tire spit a fountain of mud toward the garage, and I hoped that it hit him. I got absolutely soaked as I sped across the slick highway toward the Cullens\u2019 house. The wind felt like it was freezing the rain against my skin, and my teeth were chattering before I was halfway there. Motorcycles were too impractical for Washington. I would sell the stupid thing first chance I got. I walked the bike into the Cullens\u2019 cavernous garage and was unsurprised to find Alice waiting for me, perched lightly on the hood of her Porsche. Alice stroked the glossy yellow paint. \u00a0\u201cI haven\u2019t even had a chance to drive it.\u201d She sighed. \u201cSorry,\u201d I spit through my rattling teeth. \u201cYou look like you could use a hot shower,\u201d she said, offhand, as she sprang lightly to her feet. \u201cYep.\u201d She pursed her lips, taking in my expression carefully. \u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d \u201cNope.\u201d She nodded in assent, but her eyes were raging with curiosity. \u201cDo you want to go to Olympia tonight?\u201d \u201cNot really. Can\u2019t I go home?\u201d She grimaced. \u201cNever mind, Alice,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll stay if it makes things easier for you.\u201d \u201cThanks,\u201d she sighed in relief. I went to bed early that night, curling up on his sofa again. It was still dark when I woke. I was groggy, but I knew it wasn\u2019t near morning yet. My eyes closed, and I stretched, rolling over. It took me a second before I realized that the movement should have dumped me onto the floor. And that I was much too comfortable. I rolled back over, trying to see. It was darker than last night \u2014 the clouds were too thick for the moon to shine through. \u201cSorry,\u201d he murmured so softly that his voice was part of the darkness. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to wake you.\u201d I tensed, waiting for the fury \u2014 both his and mine \u2014 but it was only quiet and calm in the darkness of his room. I could almost taste the sweetness of reunion in the air, a separate fragrance from the perfume of his breath; the emptiness when we were apart left its own bitter aftertaste, something I didn\u2019t consciously notice until it was removed. There was no friction in the space between us. The stillness was peaceful \u2014 not like the calm before the tempest, but like a clear night untouched by even the dream of a storm. And I didn\u2019t care that I was supposed to be angry with him. I didn\u2019t care that I was supposed to be angry with everyone. I reached out for him, found his hands in the darkness, and pulled myself closer to him. His arms encircled me, cradling me to his chest. My lips searched, hunting along his throat, to his chin, till I finally found his lips. Edward kissed me softly for a moment, and then he chuckled. \u201cI was all braced for the wrath that was going to put grizzlies to shame, and this is what I get? I should infuriate you more often.\u201d \u00a0\u201cGive me a minute to work up to it,\u201d I teased, kissing him again. \u201cI\u2019ll wait as long as you want,\u201d he whispered against my lips. His fingers knotted in my hair. My breath was becoming uneven. \u201cMaybe in the morning.\u201d \u201cWhatever you prefer.\u201d \u201cWelcome home,\u201d I said while his cold lips pressed under my jaw. \u201cI\u2019m glad you came back.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a very good thing.\u201d \u201cMmm,\u201d I agreed, tightening my arms around his neck. His hand curved around my elbow, moving slowly down my arm, across my ribs and over my waist, tracing along my hip and down my leg, around my knee. He paused there, his hand curling around my calf. He pulled my leg up suddenly, hitching it around his hip. I stopped breathing. This wasn\u2019t the kind of thing he usually allowed. Despite his cold hands, I felt suddenly warm. His lips moved in the hollow at the base of my throat. \u201cNot to bring on the ire prematurely,\u201d he whispered, \u201cbut do you mind telling me what it is about this bed that you object to?\u201d Before I could answer, before I could even concentrate enough to make sense of his words, he rolled to the side, pulling me on top of him. He held my face in his hands, angling it up so that his mouth could reach my throat. My breathing was too loud \u2014 it was almost embarrassing, but I couldn\u2019t care quite enough to be ashamed. \u201cThe bed?\u201d he asked again. \u201cI think it\u2019s nice.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s unnecessary,\u201d I managed to gasp. He pulled my face back to his, and my lips shaped themselves around his. Slowly this time, he rolled till he hovered over me. He held himself carefully so that I felt none of his weight, but I could feel the cool marble of his body press against mine. My heart was hammering so loudly that it was hard to hear his quiet laughter. \u201cThat\u2019s debatable,\u201d he disagreed. \u201cThis would be difficult on a couch.\u201d Cold as ice, his tongue lightly traced the shape of my lips. My head was spinning \u2014 the air was coming too fast and shallow.  \u201cDid you change your mind?\u201d I asked breathlessly. Maybe he\u2019d rethought all his careful rules. Maybe there was more significance to this bed than I\u2019d originally guessed. My heart pounded almost painfully as I waited for his answer. Edward sighed, rolling back so that we were on our sides again. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous, Bella,\u201d he said, disapproval strong in his voice \u2014 clearly, he understood what I meant. \u201cI was just trying to illustrate the benefits of the bed you don\u2019t seem to like. Don\u2019t get carried away.\u201d \u201cToo late,\u201d I muttered. \u201cAnd I like the bed,\u201d I added. \u00a0\u201cGood.\u201d I could hear the smile in his voice as he kissed my forehead. \u201cI do, too.\u201d \u201cBut I still think it\u2019s unnecessary,\u201d I continued. \u201cIf we\u2019re not going to get carried away, what\u2019s the point?\u201d He sighed again. \u201cFor the hundredth time, Bella \u2014 it\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d \u201cI like danger,\u201d I insisted. \u201cI know.\u201d There was a sour edge to his voice, and I realized that he would have seen the motorcycle in the garage. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s dangerous,\u201d I said quickly, before he could move to a new topic of discussion. \u201cI\u2019m going to spontaneously combust one of these days \u2014 and you\u2019ll have no one but yourself to blame.\u201d He started to push me away. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I objected, clinging to him. \u201cProtecting you from combustion. If this too much for you. . . .\u201d \u201cI can handle it,\u201d I insisted. He let me worm myself back into the circle of his arms. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I gave you the wrong impression,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to make you unhappy. That wasn\u2019t nice.\u201d \u201cActually, it was very, very nice.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cAren\u2019t you tired? I should let you sleep.\u201d \u201cNo, I\u2019m not. I don\u2019t mind if you want to give me the wrong impression again.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s probably a bad idea. You\u2019re not the only one who gets carried away.\u201d \u201cYes, I am,\u201d I grumbled. He chuckled. \u201cYou have no idea, Bella. It doesn\u2019t help that you are so eager to undermine my self-control, either.\u201d  \u201cI\u2019m not going to apologize for that.\u201d \u201cCan I apologize?\u201d \u201cFor what?\u201d \u201cYou were angry with me, remember?\u201d \u201cOh, that.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was wrong. It\u2019s much easier to have the proper perspective when I have you safely here.\u201d His arms tightened around me. \u201cI go a little berserk when I try to leave you. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll go so far again. It\u2019s not worth it.\u201d I smiled. \u201cDidn\u2019t you find any mountain lions?\u201d \u201cYes, I did, actually. Still not worth the anxiety. I\u2019m sorry I had Alice hold you hostage, though. That was a bad idea.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d I agreed. \u201cI won\u2019t do it again.\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d I said easily. He was already forgiven. \u201cBut slumber parties do have their advantages. . . .\u201d I curled myself closer to him, pressing my lips into the indentation over his <em>collarbone</em>. \u201cYou can hold me hostage any time you want.\u201d \u201cMmm,\u201d he sighed. \u201cI may take you up on that.\u201d \u201cSo is it my turn now?\u201d \u201cYour turn?\u201d his voice was confused. \u201cTo apologize.\u201d \u201cWhat do you have to apologize for?\u201d \u201cAren\u2019t you mad at me?\u201d I asked blankly. \u201cNo.\u201d It sounded like he really meant it. I felt my eyebrows pull together. \u201cDidn\u2019t you see Alice when you got home?\u201d \u201cYes \u2014 why?\u201d \u201cAre you going to take her Porsche back?\u201d \u201cOf course not. It was a gift.\u201d I wished I could see his expression. His voice sounded as if I\u2019d insulted him. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to know what I did?\u201d I asked, starting to be puzzled by his apparent lack of concern. I felt him shrug. \u201cI\u2019m always interested in everything you do \u2014 but you don\u2019t have to tell me unless you want to.\u201d \u201cBut I went to La Push.\u201d \u201cI know.\u201d \u201cAnd I ditched school.\u201d \u201cSo did I.\u201d I stared toward the sound of his voice, tracing his features with my fingers, trying to understand his mood. \u201cWhere did all this tolerance come from?\u201d I demanded. He sighed. \u201cI decided that you were right. My problem before was more about my . . . prejudice against werewolves than anything else. I\u2019m going to try to be more reasonable and trust your judgment. If you say it\u2019s safe, then I\u2019ll believe you.\u201d \u201cWow.\u201d  \u201cAnd . . . most importantly . . . I\u2019m not willing to let this drive a wedge between us.\u201d I rested my head against his chest and closed my eyes, totally content. \u201cSo,\u201d he murmured in a casual tone. \u201cDid you make plans to go back to La Push again soon?\u201d I didn\u2019t answer. His question brought back the memory of Jacob\u2019s words, and my throat was suddenly tight. He misread my silence and the tension in my body. \u201cJust so that I can make my own plans,\u201d he explained quickly. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to feel like you have to hurry back because I\u2019m sitting around waiting for you.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I said in a voice that sounded strange to me. \u201cI don\u2019t have plans go back.\u201d \u201cOh. You don\u2019t have to do that for me.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m welcome anymore,\u201d I whispered.  \u201cDid you run over someone\u2019s cat?\u201d he asked lightly. I knew he didn\u2019t want to force the story out of me, but I could hear the curiosity burning behind his words. \u201cNo.\u201d I took a deep breath, and then mumbled quickly through the explanation. \u201cI thought Jacob would have realized . . . I didn\u2019t think it would surprise him.\u201d Edward waited while I hesitated. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t expecting . . . that it was so soon.\u201d \u201cAh,\u201d Edward said quietly. \u201cHe said he\u2019d rather see me dead.\u201d My voice broke on the last word. Edward was too still for a moment, controlling whatever reaction he didn\u2019t want me to see. Then he crushed me gently to his chest. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d \u201cI thought you\u2019d be glad,\u201d I whispered. \u201cGlad over something that\u2019s hurt you?\u201d he murmured into my hair. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, Bella.\u201d I sighed and relaxed, fitting myself to the stone shape of him. But he was motionless again, tense. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d \u201cYou can tell me.\u201d He paused for a minute. \u201cIt might make you angry.\u201d \u201cI still want to know.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI could quite literally kill him for saying that to you. I want to.\u201d I laughed halfheartedly. \u201cI guess it\u2019s a good thing you\u2019ve got so much self-control.\u201d \u201cI could slip.\u201d His tone was thoughtful. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to have a lapse in control, I can think of a better place for it.\u201d I reached for his face, trying to pull myself up to kiss him. His arms held me tighter, restraining. He sighed. \u201cMust I always be the responsible one?\u201d I grinned in the darkness. \u201cNo. Let me be in charge of responsibility for a few minutes . . . or hours.\u201d \u201cGoodnight, Bella.\u201d \u201cWait \u2014 there was something else I wanted to ask you about.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cI was talking to Rosalie last night. . . .\u201d His body tensed again. \u201cYes. She was thinking about that when I got in. She gave you quite a lot to consider, didn\u2019t she?\u201d His voice was anxious, and I realized that he thought I wanted to talk about the reasons Rosalie\u2019d given me for staying human. But I was interested in something much more pressing. \u201cShe told me a little bit . . . about the time your family lived in Denali.\u201d There was a short pause; this beginning took him by surprise. \u201cYes?\u201d \u201cShe mentioned something about a bunch of female vampires . . . and you.\u201d He didn\u2019t answer, though I waited for a long moment.  \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I said, after the silence had grown uncomfortable. \u201cShe told me you didn\u2019t . . . show any preference. But I was just wondering, you know, if any of them had. Shown a preference for you, I mean.\u201d Again he said nothing. \u201cWhich one?\u201d I asked, trying to keep my voice casual, and not quite managing. \u201cOr was there more than one?\u201d No answer. I wished I could see his face, so I could try to guess what this silence meant. \u201cAlice will tell me,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll go ask her right now.\u201d His arms tightened; I was unable to squirm even an inch away. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s late,\u201d he said. His voice had a little edge to it that was something new. Sort of nervous, maybe a little embarrassed. \u201cBesides, I think Alice stepped out. . . .\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s bad,\u201d I guessed. \u201cIt\u2019s really bad, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I started to panic, my heart accelerating as I imagined the gorgeous immortal rival I\u2019d never realized I had. \u201cCalm down, Bella,\u201d he said, kissing the tip of my nose. \u201cYou\u2019re being absurd.\u201d \u201cAm I? Then why won\u2019t you tell me?\u201d  \u201cBecause there\u2019s nothing to tell. You\u2019re blowing this wildly out of proportion.\u201d \u201cWhich one?\u201d I insisted. He sighed. \u201cTanya expressed a little interest. I let her know, in a very courteous, gentlemanly fashion, that I did not return that interest. End of story.\u201d I kept my voice as even as possible. \u201cTell me something \u2014 what does Tanya look like?\u201d \u201cJust like the rest of us \u2014 white skin, gold eyes,\u201d he answered too quickly. \u201cAnd, of course, extraordinarily beautiful.\u201d I felt him shrug.  \u201cI suppose, to human eyes,\u201d he said, indifferent. \u201cYou know what, though?\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d My voice was petulant. He put his lips right to my ear; his cold breath tickled. \u201cI prefer brunettes.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s a blonde. That figures.\u201d \u201cStrawberry blonde \u2014 not at all my type.\u201d I thought about that for a while, trying to concentrate as his lips moved slowly along my cheek, down my throat, and back up again. He made the circuit three times before I spoke. \u201cI guess that\u2019s okay, then,\u201d I decided. \u201cHmm,\u201d he whispered against my skin. \u201cYou\u2019re quite adorable when you\u2019re jealous. It\u2019s surprisingly enjoyable.\u201d I scowled into the darkness. \u201cIt\u2019s late,\u201d he said again, murmuring, almost crooning now, his voice smoother than silk. \u201cSleep, my Bella. Dream happy dreams. You are the only one who has ever touched my heart. It will always be yours. Sleep, my only love.\u201d He started to hum my lullaby, and I knew it was only a matter of time till I succumbed, so I closed my eyes and snuggled closer into his chest.",

            "en": "14         714. MIND OVER MATTER He could drive well, when he kept the speed reasonable, I had to admit.  Like so many things, it seemed to be effortless to him. He barely looked at the road, yet the tires never deviated so much as a centimeter from the center of the lane. He drove one-handed, holding my hand on the seat. Sometimes he gazed into the setting sun, sometimes he glanced at me \u2014 my face, my hair blowing out the open window, our hands twined together. He had turned the radio to an oldies station, and he sang along with a song I'd never heard. He knew every line. \"You like fifties music?\" I asked.  \"Music in the fifties was good. Much better than the sixties, or the seventies, ugh!\" He shuddered. \"The eighties were bearable.\" \"Are you ever going to tell me how old you are?\" I asked, tentative, not wanting to upset his buoyant humor. \"Does it matter much?\" His smile, to my relief, remained unclouded. \"No, but I still wonder\u2026\" I grimaced. \"There's nothing like an unsolved mystery to keep you up at night.\" \"I wonder if it will upset you,\" he reflected to himself. He gazed into the sun; the minutes passed. \"Try me,\" I finally said. He sighed, and then looked into my eyes, seeming to forget the road completely for a time. Whatever he saw there must have encouraged him. He looked into the sun \u2014 the light of the setting orb glittered off his skin in ruby-tinged sparkles \u2014 and spoke.  \"I was born in Chicago in 1901.\" He paused and glanced at me from the corner of his eyes. My face was carefully unsurprised, patient for the rest. He smiled a tiny smile and continued. \"Carlisle found me in a hospital in the summer of 1918. I was seventeen, and dying of the Spanish influenza.\" He heard my intake of breath, though it was barely audible to my own ears. He looked down into my eyes again. \"I don't remember it well \u2014 it was a very long time ago, and human memories fade.\" He was lost in his thoughts for a short time before he went on. \"I do remember how it felt, when Carlisle saved me. It's not an easy thing, not something you could forget.\" \"Your parents?\" \"They had already died from the disease. I was alone. That was why he chose me. In all the chaos of the epidemic, no one would ever realize I was gone.\" \"How did he\u2026 save you?\" A few seconds passed before he answered. He seemed to choose his words carefully. \"It was difficult. Not many of us have the restraint necessary to accomplish it. But Carlisle has always been the most humane, the most compassionate of us\u2026 I don't think you could find his equal throughout all of history.\" He paused. \"For me, it was merely very, very painful.\" I could tell from the set of his lips, he would say no more on this subject. I suppressed my curiosity, though it was far from idle. There were many things I needed to think through on this particular issue, things that were only beginning to occur to me. No doubt his quick mind had already comprehended every aspect that eluded me.  His soft voice interrupted my thoughts. \"He acted from loneliness. That's usually the reason behind the choice. I was the first in Carlisle's family, though he found Esme soon after. She fell from a cliff. They brought her straight to the hospital morgue, though, somehow, her heart was still beating.\" \"So you must be dying, then, to become\u2026\" We never said the word, and I couldn't frame it now. \"No, that's just Carlisle. He would never do that to someone who had another choice.\" The respect in his voice was profound whenever he spoke of his father figure. \"It is easier he says, though,\" he continued, \"if the blood is weak.\" He looked at the now-dark road, and I could feel the subject closing again. \"And Emmett and Rosalie?\" \"Carlisle brought Rosalie to our family next. I didn't realize till much later that he was hoping she would be to me what Esme was to him \u2014 he was careful with his thoughts around me.\" He rolled his eyes. \"But she was never more than a sister. It was only two years later that she found Emmett. She was hunting \u2014 we were in Appalachia at the time \u2014 and found a bear about to finish him off. She carried him back to Carlisle, more than a hundred miles, afraid she wouldn't be able to do it herself. I'm only beginning to guess how difficult that journey was for her.\" He threw a pointed glance in my direction, and raised our hands, still folded together, to brush my cheek with the back of his hand. \"But she made it,\" I encouraged, looking away from the unbearable beauty of his eyes. \"Yes,\" he murmured. \"She saw something in his face that made her strong enough. And they've been together ever since. Sometimes they live separately from us, as a married couple. But the younger we pretend to be, the longer we can stay in any given place. Forks seemed perfect, so we all enrolled in high school.\" He laughed. \"I suppose we'll have to go to their wedding in a few years, again.\" \"Alice and Jasper?\" \"Alice and Jasper are two very rare creatures. They both developed a conscience, as we refer to it, with no outside guidance. Jasper belonged to another\u2026 family, a very different kind of family. He became depressed, and he wandered on his own. Alice found him. Like me, she has certain gifts above and beyond the norm for our kind.\" \"Really?\" I interrupted, fascinated. \"But you said you were the only one who could hear people's thoughts.\" \"That's true. She knows other things. She sees things \u2014 things that might happen, things that are coming. But it's very subjective. The future isn't set in stone. Things change.\" His jaw set when he said that, and his eyes darted to my face and away so quickly that I wasn't sure if I only imagined it. \"What kinds of things does she see?\" \"She saw Jasper and knew that he was looking for her before he knew it himself. She saw Carlisle and our family, and they came together to find us. She's most sensitive to non-humans. She always sees, for example, when another group of our kind is coming near. And any threat they may pose.\" \"Are there a lot of\u2026 your kind?\" I was surprised. How many of them could walk among us undetected? \"No, not many. But most won't settle in any one place. Only those like us, who've given up hunting you people\" \u2014 a sly glance in my direction \u2014 \"can live together with humans for any length of time. We've only found one other family like ours, in a small village in Alaska. We lived together for a time, but there were so many of us that we became too noticeable. Those of us who live\u2026 differently tend to band together.\"  \"And the others?\" \"Nomads, for the most part. We've all lived that way at times. It gets tedious, like anything else. But we run across the others now and then, because most of us prefer the North.\" \"Why is that?\" We were parked in front of my house now, and he'd turned off the truck.  It was very quiet and dark; there was no moon. The porch light was off so I knew my father wasn't home yet.  \"Did you have your eyes open this afternoon?\" he teased. \"Do you think I could walk down the street in the sunlight without causing traffic accidents? There's a reason why we chose the Olympic Peninsula, one of the most sunless places in the world. It's nice to be able to go outside in the day. You wouldn't believe how tired you can get of nighttime in eighty-odd years.\" \"So that's where the legends came from?\" \"Probably.\" \"And Alice came from another family, like Jasper?\" \"No, and that is a mystery. Alice doesn't remember her human life at all.  And she doesn't know who created her. She awoke alone. Whoever made her walked away, and none of us understand why, or how, he could. If she hadn't had that other sense, if she hadn't seen Jasper and Carlisle and known that she would someday become one of us, she probably would have turned into a total savage.\" There was so much to think through, so much I still wanted to ask. But, to my great embarrassment, my stomach growled. I'd been so intrigued, I hadn't even noticed I was hungry. I realized now that I was ravenous.  \"I'm sorry, I'm keeping you from dinner.\" \"I'm fine, really.\" \"I've never spent much time around anyone who eats food. I forget.\" \"I want to stay with you.\" It was easier to say in the darkness, knowing as I spoke how my voice would betray me, my hopeless addiction to him.  \"Can't I come in?\" he asked. \"Would you like to?\" I couldn't picture it, this godlike creature sitting in my father's shabby kitchen chair. \"Yes, if it's all right.\" I heard the door close quietly, and almost simultaneously he was outside my door, opening it for me. \"Very human,\" I complimented him. \"It's definitely resurfacing.\" He walked beside me in the night, so quietly I had to peek at him constantly to be sure he was still there. In the darkness he looked much more normal. Still pale, still dreamlike in his beauty, but no longer the fantastic sparkling creature of our sunlit afternoon. He reached the door ahead of me and opened it for me. I paused halfway through the frame. \"The door was unlocked?\" \"No, I used the key from under the eave.\" I stepped inside, flicked on the porch light, and turned to look at him with my eyebrows raised. I was sure I'd never used that key in front of him. \"I was curious about you.\" \"You spied on me?\" But somehow I couldn't infuse my voice with the proper outrage. I was flattered. He was unrepentant. \"What else is there to do at night?\" I let it go for the moment and went down the hall to the kitchen. He was there before me, needing no guide. He sat in the very chair I'd tried to picture him in. His beauty lit up the kitchen. It was a moment before I could look away. I concentrated on getting my dinner, taking last night's lasagna from the fridge, placing a square on a plate, heating it in the microwave. It revolved, filling the kitchen with the smell of tomatoes and oregano. I didn't take my eyes from the plate of food as I spoke. \"How often?\" I asked casually. \"Hmmm?\" He sounded as if I had pulled him from some other train of thought. I still didn't turn around. \"How often did you come here?\" \"I come here almost every night.\" I whirled, stunned. \"Why?\" \"You're interesting when you sleep.\" He spoke matter-of-factly. \"You talk.\" \"No!\" I gasped, heat flooding my face all the way to my hairline. I gripped the kitchen counter for support. I knew I talked in my sleep, of course; my mother teased me about it. I hadn't thought it was something I needed to worry about here, though. His expression shifted instantly to chagrin. \"Are you very angry with me?\" \"That depends!\" I felt and sounded like I'd had the breath knocked out of me. He waited. \"On?\" he urged. \"What you heard!\" I wailed. Instantly, silently, he was at my side, taking my hands carefully in his.  \"Don't be upset!\" he pleaded. He dropped his face to the level of my eyes, holding my gaze. I was embarrassed. I tried to look away.  \"You miss your mother,\" he whispered. \"You worry about her. And when it rains, the sound makes you restless. You used to talk about home a lot, but it's less often now. Once you said, 'It's too green.'\" He laughed softly, hoping, I could see, not to offend me further. \"Anything else?\" I demanded. He knew what I was getting at. \"You did say my name,\" he admitted. I sighed in defeat. \"A lot?\" \"How much do you mean by 'a lot,' exactly?\" \"Oh no!\" I hung my head. He pulled me against his chest, softly, naturally. \"Don't be self-conscious,\" he whispered in my ear. \"If I could dream at all, it would be about you. And I'm not ashamed of it.\" Then we both heard the sound of tires on the brick driveway, saw the headlights flash through the front windows, down the hall to us. I stiffened in his arms. \"Should your father know I'm here?\" he asked. \"I'm not sure\u2026\" I tried to think it through quickly. \"Another time then\u2026\" And I was alone. \"Edward!\" I hissed. I heard a ghostly chuckle, then nothing else. My father's key turned in the door. \"Bella?\" he called. It had bothered me before; who else would it be? Suddenly he didn't seem so far off base. \"In here.\" I hoped he couldn't hear the hysterical edge to my voice. I grabbed my dinner from the microwave and sat at the table as he walked in. His footsteps sounded so noisy after my day with Edward.  \"Can you get me some of that? I'm bushed.\" He stepped on the heels of his boots to take them off, holding the back of Edward's chair for support. I took my food with me, scarfing it down as I got his dinner. It burned my tongue. I filled two glasses with milk while his lasagna was heating, and gulped mine to put out the fire. As I set the glass down, I noticed the milk trembling and realized my hand was shaking. Charlie sat in the chair, and the contrast between him and its former occupant was comical. \"Thanks,\" he said as I placed his food on the table. \"How was your day?\" I asked. The words were rushed; I was dying to escape to my room. \"Good. The fish were biting\u2026 how about you? Did you get everything done that you wanted to?\" \"Not really \u2014 it was too nice out to stay indoors.\" I took another big bite. \"It was a nice day,\" he agreed. What an understatement, I thought to myself. Finished with the last bite of lasagna, I lifted my glass and chugged the remains of my milk. Charlie surprised me by being observant. \"In a hurry?\" \"Yeah, I'm tired. I'm going to bed early.\" \"You look kinda keyed up,\" he noted. Why, oh why, did this have to be his night to pay attention? \"Do I?\" was all I could manage in response. I quickly scrubbed my dishes clean in the sink, and placed them upside down on a dish towel to dry. \"It's Saturday,\" he mused. I didn't respond. \"No plans tonight?\" he asked suddenly. \"No, Dad, I just want to get some sleep.\" \"None of the boys in town your type, eh?\" He was suspicious, but trying to play it cool. \"No, none of the boys have caught my eye yet.\" I was careful not to over-emphasize the word boys in my quest to be truthful with Charlie. \"I thought maybe that Mike Newton\u2026 you said he was friendly.\" \"He's Just a friend, Dad.\" \"Well, you're too good for them all, anyway. Wait till you get to college to start looking.\" Every father's dream, that his daughter will be out of the house before the hormones kick in. \"Sounds like a good idea to me,\" I agreed as I headed up the stairs. \"'Night, honey,\" he called after me. No doubt he would be listening carefully all evening, waiting for me to try to sneak out. \"See you in the morning, Dad.\" See you creeping into my room tonight at midnight to check on me. I worked to make my tread sound slow and tired as I walked up the stairs to my room. I shut the door loud enough for him to hear, and then sprinted on my tiptoes to the window. I threw it open and leaned out into the night. My eyes scanned the darkness, the impenetrable shadows of the trees. \"Edward?\" I whispered, feeling completely idiotic. The quiet, laughing response came from behind me. \"Yes?\" I whirled, one hand flying to my throat in surprise. He lay, smiling hugely, across my bed, his hands behind his head, his feet dangling off the end, the picture of ease. \"Oh!\" I breathed, sinking unsteadily to the floor.  \"I'm sorry.\" He pressed his lips together, trying to hide his amusement. \"Just give me a minute to restart my heart.\" He sat up slowly, so as not to startle me again. Then he leaned forward and reached out with his long arms to pick me up, gripping the tops of my arms like I was a toddler. He sat me on the bed beside him. \"Why don't you sit with me,\" he suggested, putting a cold hand on mine. \"How's the heart?\" \"You tell me \u2014 I'm sure you hear it better than I do.\" I felt his quiet laughter shake the bed. We sat there for a moment in silence, both listening to my heartbeat slow. I thought about having Edward in my room, with my father in the house. \"Can I have a minute to be human?\" I asked. \"Certainly.\" He gestured with one hand that I should proceed. \"Stay,\" I said, trying to look severe. \"Yes, ma'am.\" And he made a show of becoming a statue on the edge of my bed. I hopped up, grabbing my pajamas from off the floor, my bag of toiletries off the desk. I left the light off and slipped out, closing the door. I could hear the sound from the TV rising up the stairs. I banged the bathroom door loudly, so Charlie wouldn't come up to bother me. I meant to hurry. I brushed my teeth fiercely, trying to be thorough and speedy, removing all traces of lasagna. But the hot water of the shower couldn't be rushed. It unknotted the muscles in my back, calmed my pulse. The familiar smell of my shampoo made me feel like I might be the same person I had been this morning. I tried not to think of Edward, sitting in my room, waiting, because then I had to start all over with the calming process. Finally, I couldn't delay anymore. I shut off the water, toweling hastily, rushing again. I pulled on my holey t-shirt and gray sweatpants. Too late to regret not packing the Victoria's Secret silk pajamas my mother got me two birthdays ago, which still had the tags on them in a drawer somewhere back home. I rubbed the towel through my hair again, and then yanked the brush through it quickly. I threw the towel in the hamper, flung my brush and toothpaste into my bag. Then I dashed down the stairs so Charlie could see that I was in my pajamas, with wet hair. \"'Night, Dad.\" \"'Night, Bella.\" He did look startled by my appearance. Maybe that would keep him from checking on me tonight. I took the stairs two at a time, trying to be quiet, and flew into my room, closing the door tightly behind me. Edward hadn't moved a fraction of an inch, a carving of Adonis perched on my faded quilt. I smiled, and his lips twitched, the statue coming to life. His eyes appraised me, taking in the damp hair, the tattered shirt. He raised one eyebrow. \"Nice.\" I grimaced. \"No, it looks good on you.\" \"Thanks,\" I whispered. I went back to his side, sitting cross-legged beside him. I looked at the lines in the wooden floor. \"What was all that for?\" \"Charlie thinks I'm sneaking out.\" \"Oh.\" He contemplated that. \"Why?\" As if he couldn't know Charlie's mind much more clearly than I could guess. \"Apparently, I look a little overexcited.\" He lifted my chin, examining my face. \"You look very warm, actually.\" He bent his face slowly to mine, laying his cool cheek against my skin. I held perfectly still. \"Mmmmmm\u2026\" he breathed. It was very difficult, while he was touching me, to frame a coherent question. It took me a minute of scattered concentration to begin. \"It seems to be\u2026 much easier for you, now, to be close to me.\" \"Does it seem that way to you?\" he murmured, his nose gliding to the corner of my jaw. I felt his hand, lighter than a moth's wing, brushing my damp hair back, so that his lips could touch the hollow beneath my ear. \"Much, much easier,\" I said, trying to exhale. \"Hmm.\" \"So I was wondering\u2026\" I began again, but his fingers were slowly tracing my <em>collarbone</em>, and I lost my train of thought. \"Yes?\" he breathed. \"Why is that,\" my voice shook, embarrassing me, \"do you think?\" I felt the tremor of his breath on my neck as he laughed. \"Mind over matter.\" I pulled back; as I moved, he froze \u2014 and I could no longer hear the sound of his breathing. We stared cautiously at each other for a moment, and then, as his clenched jaw gradually relaxed, his expression became puzzled. \"Did I do something wrong?\" \"No \u2014 the opposite. You're driving me crazy,\" I explained.  He considered that briefly, and when he spoke, he sounded pleased. \"Really?\" A triumphant smile slowly lit his face. \"Would you like a round of applause?\" I asked sarcastically. He grinned. \"I'm just pleasantly surprised,\" he clarified. \"In the last hundred years or so,\" his voice was teasing, \"I never imagined anything like this. I didn't believe I would ever find someone I wanted to be with\u2026 in another way than my brothers and sisters. And then to find, even though it's all new to me, that I'm good at it\u2026 at being with you\u2026\" \"You're good at everything,\" I pointed out. He shrugged, allowing that, and we both laughed in whispers. \"But how can it be so easy now?\" I pressed. \"This afternoon\u2026\" \"It's not easy,\" he sighed. \"But this afternoon, I was still\u2026 undecided. I am sorry about that, it was unforgivable for me to behave so.\" \"Not unforgivable,\" I disagreed. \"Thank you.\" He smiled. \"You see,\" he continued, looking down now, \"I wasn't sure if I was strong enough\u2026\" He picked up one of my hands and pressed it lightly to his face. \"And while there was still that possibility that I might be\u2026 overcome\" \u2014 he breathed in the scent at my wrist \u2014 \"I was\u2026 susceptible. Until I made up my mind that I was strong enough, that there was no possibility at all that I would\u2026 that I ever could\u2026\" I'd never seen him struggle so hard for words. It was so\u2026 human. \"So there's no possibility now?\" \"Mind over matter,\" he repeated, smiling, his teeth bright even in the darkness. \"Wow, that was easy,\" I said. He threw back his head and laughed, quietly as a whisper, but still exuberantly. \"Easy for you!\" he amended, touching my nose with his fingertip. And then his face was abruptly serious. \"I'm trying,\" he whispered, his voice pained. \"If it gets to be\u2026 too much, I'm fairly sure I'll be able to leave.\" I scowled. I didn't like the talk of leaving. \"And it will be harder tomorrow,\" he continued. \"I've had the scent of you in my head all day, and I've grown amazingly desensitized. If I'm away from you for any length of time, I'll have to start over again. Not quite from scratch, though, I think.\" \"Don't go away, then,\" I responded, unable to hide the longing in my voice. \"That suits me,\" he replied, his face relaxing into a gentle smile. \"Bring on the shackles \u2014 I'm your prisoner.\" But his long hands formed manacles around my wrists as he spoke. He laughed his quiet, musical laugh. He'd laughed more tonight than I'd ever heard in all the time I'd spent with him. \"You seem more\u2026 optimistic than usual,\" I observed. \"I haven't seen you like this before.\" \"Isn't it supposed to be like this?\" He smiled. \"The glory of first love, and all that. It's incredible, isn't it, the difference between reading about something, seeing it in the pictures, and experiencing it?\" \"Very different,\" I agreed. \"More forceful than I'd imagined.\" \"For example\" \u2014 his words flowed swiftly now, I had to concentrate to catch it all \u2014 \"the emotion of jealousy. I've read about it a hundred thousand times, seen actors portray it in a thousand different plays and movies. I believed I understood that one pretty clearly. But it shocked me\u2026\" He grimaced. \"Do you remember the day that Mike asked you to the dance?\" I nodded, though I remembered that day for a different reason. \"The day you started talking to me again.\" \"I was surprised by the flare of resentment, almost fury, that I felt \u2014 I didn't recognize what it was at first. I was even more aggravated than usual that I couldn't know what you were thinking, why you refused him. Was it simply for your friend's sake? Was there someone else? I knew I had no right to care either way. I tried not to care. \"And then the line started forming,\" he chuckled. I scowled in the darkness. \"I waited, unreasonably anxious to hear what you would say to them, to watch your expressions. I couldn't deny the relief I felt, watching the annoyance on your face. But I couldn't be sure. \"That was the first night I came here. I wrestled all night, while watching you sleep, with the chasm between what I knew was right, moral, ethical, and what I wanted. I knew that if I continued to ignore you as I should, or if I left for a few years, till you were gone, that someday you would say yes to Mike, or someone like him. It made me angry. \"And then,\" he whispered, \"as you were sleeping, you said my name. You spoke so clearly, at first I thought you'd woken. But you rolled over restlessly and mumbled my name once more, and sighed. The feeling that coursed through me then was unnerving, staggering. And I knew I couldn't ignore you any longer.\" He was silent for a moment, probably listening to the suddenly uneven pounding of my heart. \"But jealousy\u2026 it's a strange thing. So much more powerful than I would have thought. And irrational! Just now, when Charlie asked you about that vile Mike Newton\u2026\" He shook his head angrily. \"I should have known you'd be listening,\" I groaned. \"Of course.\" \"That made you feel jealous, though, really?\" \"I'm new at this; you're resurrecting the human in me, and everything feels stronger because it's fresh.\" \"But honestly,\" I teased, \"for that to bother you, after I have to hear that Rosalie \u2014 Rosalie, the incarnation of pure beauty, Rosalie \u2014 was meant for you. Emmett or no Emmett, how can I compete with that?\" \"There's no competition.\" His teeth gleamed. He drew my trapped hands around his back, holding me to his chest. I kept as still as I could, even breathing with caution. \"I know there's no competition,\" I mumbled into his cold skin. \"That's the problem.\" \"Of course Rosalie is beautiful in her way, but even if she wasn't like a sister to me, even if Emmett didn't belong with her, she could never have one tenth, no, one hundredth of the attraction you hold for me.\" He was serious now, thoughtful. \"For almost ninety years I've walked among my kind, and yours\u2026 all the time thinking I was complete in myself, not realizing what I was seeking. And not finding anything, because you weren't alive yet.\" \"It hardly seems fair,\" I whispered, my face still resting on his chest, listening to his breath come and go. \"I haven't had to wait at all. Why should I get off so easily?\" \"You're right,\" he agreed with amusement. \"I should make this harder for you, definitely.\" He freed one of his hands, released my wrist, only to gather it carefully into his other hand. He stroked my wet hair softly, from the top of my head to my waist. \"You only have to risk your life every second you spend with me, that's surely not much. You only have to turn your back on nature, on humanity\u2026 what's that worth?\" \"Very little \u2014 I don't feel deprived of anything.\" \"Not yet.\" And his voice was abruptly full of ancient grief. I tried to pull back, to look in his face, but his hand locked my wrists in an unbreakable hold. \"What \u2014\" I started to ask, when his body became alert. I froze, but he suddenly released my hands, and disappeared. I narrowly avoided falling on my face. \"Lie down!\" he hissed. I couldn't tell where he spoke from in the darkness. I rolled under my quilt, balling up on my side, the way I usually slept. I heard the door crack open, as Charlie peeked in to make sure I was where I was supposed to be. I breathed evenly, exaggerating the movement. A long minute passed. I listened, not sure if I'd heard the door close. Then Edward's cool arm was around me, under the covers, his lips at my ear. \"You are a terrible actress \u2014 I'd say that career path is out for you.\" \"Darn it,\" I muttered. My heart was crashing in my chest. He hummed a melody I didn't recognize; it sounded like a lullaby. He paused. \"Should I sing you to sleep?\" \"Right,\" I laughed. \"Like I could sleep with you here!\" \"You do it all the time,\" he reminded me. \"But I didn't know you were here,\" I replied icily. \"So if you don't want to sleep\u2026\" he suggested, ignoring my tone. My breath caught. \"If I don't want to sleep\u2026 ?\" He chuckled. \"What do you want to do then?\" I couldn't answer at first. \"I'm not sure,\" I finally said. \"Tell me when you decide.\" I could feel his cool breath on my neck, feel his nose sliding along my jaw, inhaling. \"I thought you were desensitized.\" \"Just because I'm resisting the wine doesn't mean I can't appreciate the bouquet,\" he whispered. \"You have a very floral smell, like lavender\u2026 or freesia,\" he noted. \"It's mouthwatering.\" \"Yeah, it's an off day when I don't get somebody telling me how edible I smell.\" He chuckled, and then sighed. \"I've decided what I want to do,\" I told him. \"I want to hear more about you.\" \"Ask me anything.\" I sifted through my questions for the most vital. \"Why do you do it?\" I said. \"I still don't understand how you can work so hard to resist what you\u2026 are. Please don't misunderstand, of course I'm glad that you do. I just don't see why you would bother in the first place.\" He hesitated before answering. \"That's a good question, and you are not the first one to ask it. The others \u2014 the majority of our kind who are quite content with our lot \u2014 they, too, wonder at how we live. But you see, just because we've been\u2026 dealt a certain hand\u2026 it doesn't mean that we can't choose to rise above \u2014 to conquer the boundaries of a destiny that none of us wanted. To try to retain whatever essential humanity we can.\" I lay unmoving, locked in awed silence. \"Did you fall asleep?\" he whispered after a few minutes. \"No.\" \"Is that all you were curious about?\" I rolled my eyes. \"Not quite.\" \"What else do you want to know?\" \"Why can you read minds \u2014 why only you? And Alice, seeing the future\u2026 why does that happen?\" I felt him shrug in the darkness. \"We don't really know. Carlisle has a theory\u2026 he believes that we all bring something of our strongest human traits with us into the next life, where they are intensified \u2014 like our minds, and our senses. He thinks that I must have already been very sensitive to the thoughts of those around me. And that Alice had some precognition, wherever she was.\" \"What did he bring into the next life, and the others?\" \"Carlisle brought his compassion. Esme brought her ability to love passionately. Emmett brought his strength, Rosalie her\u2026 tenacity. Or you could call it pigheadedness.\" he chuckled. \"Jasper is very interesting. He was quite charismatic in his first life, able to influence those around him to see things his way. Now he is able to manipulate the emotions of those around him \u2014 calm down a room of angry people, for example, or excite a lethargic crowd, conversely. It's a very subtle gift.\" I considered the impossibilities he described, trying to take it in. He waited patiently while I thought. \"So where did it all start? I mean, Carlisle changed you, and then someone must have changed him, and so on\u2026\" \"Well, where did you come from? Evolution? Creation? Couldn't we have evolved in the same way as other species, predator and prey? Or, if you don't believe that all this world could have just happened on its own, which is hard for me to accept myself, is it so hard to believe that the same force that created the delicate angelfish with the shark, the baby seal and the killer whale, could create both our kinds together?\" \"Let me get this straight \u2014 I'm the baby seal, right?\" \"Right.\" He laughed, and something touched my hair \u2014 his lips? I wanted to turn toward him, to see if it was really his lips against my hair. But I had to be good; I didn't want to make this any harder for him than it already was. \"Are you ready to sleep?\" he asked, interrupting the short silence. \"Or do you have any more questions?\" \"Only a million or two.\" \"We have tomorrow, and the next day, and the next\u2026\" he reminded me. I smiled, euphoric at the thought.  \"Are you sure you won't vanish in the morning?\" I wanted this to be certain. \"You are mythical, after all.\" \"I won't leave you.\" His voice had the seal of a promise in it. \"One more, then, tonight\u2026\" And I blushed. The darkness was no help \u2014 I'm sure he could feel the sudden warmth under my skin. \"What is it?\" \"No, forget it. I changed my mind.\" \"Bella, you can ask me anything.\" I didn't answer, and he groaned. \"I keep thinking it will get less frustrating, not hearing your thoughts. But it just gets worse and worse.\" \"I'm glad you can't read my thoughts. It's bad enough that you eavesdrop on my sleep-talking.\" \"Please?\" His voice was so persuasive, so impossible to resist. I shook my head. \"If you don't tell me, I'll just assume it's something much worse than it is,\" he threatened darkly. \"Please?\" Again, that pleading voice. \"Well,\" I began, glad that he couldn't see my face. \"Yes?\" \"You said that Rosalie and Emmett will get married soon\u2026 Is that\u2026 marriage\u2026 the same as it is for humans?\" He laughed in earnest now, understanding. \"Is that what you're getting at?\" I fidgeted, unable to answer. \"Yes, I suppose it is much the same,\" he said. \"I told you, most of those human desires are there, just hidden behind more powerful desires.\" \"Oh,\" was all I could say. \"Was there a purpose behind your curiosity?\" \"Well, I did wonder\u2026 about you and me\u2026 someday\u2026\" He was instantly serious, I could tell by the sudden stillness of his body. I froze, too, reacting automatically. \"I don't think that\u2026 that\u2026 would be possible for us.\" \"Because it would be too hard for you, if I were that\u2026 close?\" \"That's certainly a problem. But that's not what I was thinking of. It's just that you are so soft, so fragile. I have to mind my actions every moment that we're together so that I don't hurt you. I could kill you quite easily, Bella, simply by accident.\" His voice had become just a soft murmur. He moved his icy palm to rest it against my cheek. \"If I was too hasty\u2026 if for one second I wasn't paying enough attention, I could reach out, meaning to touch your face, and crush your skull by mistake. You don't realize how incredibly breakable you are. I can never, never afford to lose any kind of control when I'm with you.\" He waited for me to respond, growing anxious when I didn't. \"Are you scared?\" he asked. I waited for a minute to answer, so the words would be true. \"No. I'm fine.\" He seemed to deliberate for a moment. \"I'm curious now, though,\" he said, his voice light again. \"Have you ever\u2026 ?\" He trailed off suggestively. \"Of course not.\" I flushed. \"I told you I've never felt like this about anyone before, not even close.\" \"I know. It's just that I know other people's thoughts. I know love and lust don't always keep the same company.\" \"They do for me. Now, anyway, that they exist for me at all,\" I sighed. \"That's nice. We have that one thing in common, at least.\" He sounded satisfied. \"Your human instincts\u2026\" I began. He waited. \"Well, do you find me attractive, in that way, at all?\" He laughed and lightly rumpled my nearly dry hair.  \"I may not be a human, but I am a man,\" he assured me. I yawned involuntarily. \"I've answered your questions, now you should sleep,\" he insisted. \"I'm not sure if I can.\" \"Do you want me to leave?\" \"No!\" I said too loudly. He laughed, and then began to hum that same, unfamiliar lullaby; the voice of an archangel, soft in my ear. More tired than I realized, exhausted from the long day of mental and emotional stress like I'd never felt before, I drifted to sleep in his cold arms.",
