            "en": "AAA, Ba3, Ca, CCC... they look like some kind of hyper-active school report. \u00a0 They are, indeed, a marking system, and one that is designed to inform interested parties. \u00a0 The letter formations are given to large-scale borrowers, whether companies or governments, and tell the buyers of this debt how likely they are to be able to get it back. \u00a0\n The score card also affects the amount that should be charged by way of return on that borrowing.  \u00a0 These letters have been all over the coverage of the financial impact of the crisis besetting the eurozone. \u00a0\n A change to the score means a change to the amount a borrower must pay its debt-holders, something that can make it more expensive to borrow as investors demand a higher rate of return for taking on more risky debt. \u00a0\n But while the borrowers in the news - the governments of Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and now even the mighty US - are household names, the ones that have such an impact on their fortunes are not. \u00a0 \n\nThey are credit-rating agencies, which exist to assess the credit-worthiness of bond issuers - companies or, as in this case, countries who borrow money by issuing IOUs known as bonds. \u00a0\n But who are they? Do we need them and how do they work out whether to give the top-of-the-class AAA or a lower grade, such as CCC, which - sticking with the schools analogy - means the issuer is probably planning on bunking off? \u00a0\n Poor and Moody  \u00a0 Standard & Poor's (S&P), as the oldest, comes first. It was begun in 1860 by Henry Poor, who wrote a history of the finances of railroads and canals in the United States as a guide for investors. \u00a0 \nThe 'Standard' part came into being in 1906, when the Standard Statistics Bureau was set up to examine finances of non-railroad companies.  \u00a0 The two businesses joined forces in the 1940s.  \u00a0 Moody's was started in 1909 by John Moody, who published an analysis of the tangled and uncertain world of railway finances, grading the value of its stocks and bonds. \u00a0 These are now mighty concerns - Moody's operating income was $688m in 2010 and Standard & Poor's made $762m. \u00a0 They each have 40% apiece of the business of rating major companies and countries. \u00a0 Fitch, with another eponymous founder, John Fitch, was set up in 1913 and is a smaller version of the other two.  \u00a0 There are hosts of other ratings agencies, whose names rarely appear even within the darker corners of the financial pages - so why are these three businesses the ones everyone watches? \u00a0\n Track Record  \u00a0 Part of the answer lies with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the US financial watchdog. \u00a0 In 1975, it acknowledged these three as Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSRO). \u00a0\n An endorsement from an NRSRO makes life quicker and easier for countries and financial institutions wishing to issue bonds - it basically tells investors a firm has a track record and how likely it is to be able to pay back the money. \u00a0 Further impetus for NRSROs comes from the fact that certain regulated investment funds are required by the SEC to hold only those bonds that have a very high rating from accredited agencies. \u00a0 An insurance company's strength is also judged by the ratings applied to the investment reserves it holds.  \u00a0 A downgrade of an issuers' rating pushes down the value of a bond and raises its interest rate. \u00a0 It can mean regulated funds must now sell these bonds.  \u00a0 But this can cause a vicious cycle. \u00a0 A big sell-off adds in market forces - more sellers than buyers - reducing the price further. That means a yet higher interest rate must be paid - and that puts an even bigger strain on the borrower. \u00a0 Although the SEC has 10 NRSROs on its approved list, including a Canadian agency and two Japanese ones, the big three - Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch - remain the industry standard-<em>bearers</em>. \u00a0 This is partly because they make their ratings available freely to investors - making their money from charging the organisations who want their bonds rated. \u00a0 Heavy criticism \u00a0 So much for their size. What of their actual methods? \u00a0 Standard & Poor's said it based its judgments on a range of financial and business attributes that might influence the repayment, some of which may depend on the issuer of the bond (ie the borrower). \u00a0 In a statement, S&P gave a long list of indicators it may use, including \"economic, regulatory and geopolitical influences, management and corporate governance attributes, and competitive position\".  \u00a0 That seems to cover everything. But since the credit crisis that began in 2007, these agencies have come in for heavy criticism - and even hostility.  \u00a0 After all, stacks of mortgage-backed securities - the investments that were backed by mortgages that were either never going to be paid back or were even fraudulent - were given the very best grade by the three supposed experts in rating the likelihood of the money being paid back. \u00a0 Similar dramatic swings have been taking place in the ratings applied to government-backed - rather than private property-supported debt. One day a country's bond is graded a safe top rating and the next given a mark that suggests investors' money is not safe. \u00a0 Many observers believe that if the rating on the UK's government bonds - or gilts - was downgraded by just one notch from AAA to AA it would put up the cost of official borrowing by around half of one per cent. \u00a0 That would mean a big rise in the annual interest bill which has to be met by taxpayers. \u00a0 When asked why it changes ratings, S&P responded: \"The reasons for ratings adjustments vary, and may be broadly related to overall shifts in the economy or business environment - or more narrowly focused on circumstances affecting a specific industry, entity, or individual debt issue.\" \u00a0 It indeed appears a dark art - but one whose influence has a more measurable effect.",

            "en": "It\u2019s Not Always Women and Children First          MONDAY, March 1 (HealthDay News) \u2014 In a life-and-death situation, how much time people have to react has a lot to do with whether they behave selfishly or selflessly, if a new critique of the infamous Titanic and Lusitania ocean liner disasters is any indication. The comparative look at who survived two of the 20th century\u2019s most infamous shipping calamities suggests that the so-called \u201ceconomic theory\u201d of human behavior \u2014 namely, that in the face of disaster, rational self-preservation trumps social norms and rules \u2014 does not always hold water.  \u201cWhat would you do?\u201d asked study co-author Benno Torgler, a professor of economics and finance at the Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia. \u201cWould you attempt to save your own life at whatever cost to others, or would you help others and put your life at stake for others? One would think that selfish and self-preserving behavior predominates. However, we provide evidence \u2026 that this is not always the case.\u201d To discern what makes threatened people tick, the researchers compared data on passenger and crew members and their reactions to the two maritime disasters. Manifests indicate that passenger composition was similar on the ships, with 62 percent to 65 percent of the passengers male. In both instances, Torgler and his team noted, the ship captains ordered their crew to save female passengers and children first \u2014 because of a scarcity of lifeboats on the Titanic and because of too little time to launch lifeboats on the Lusitania. Younger, stronger and more agile passengers would have been expected to have a better chance of surviving both sinkings, the researchers noted. That\u2019s not, however, what they found. On the Titanic, survival more closely tracked the crew\u2019s directive, which reflected accepted social norms: females 16 to 35 years of age had a much higher probability of surviving the disaster than did men of a similar age. In terms of economic class and social power, first-class passengers were found to have better survival rates than their poorer shipmates. On the Lusitania, on the other hand, both men and women aged 16 to 35 had a greater chance of survival than did younger or older passengers. And <em>bearers</em> of first-class passage actually were less likely to survive than third-class passengers. The researchers concluded that, on the Lusitania, a \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d pattern was in play, whereas prevailing social protocols and captain orders were enforced on the Titanic and respected by crew and passengers alike. A report on their findings is published in this week\u2019s online issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. What accounts for the differences in behavior? Torgler and his colleagues think it was mainly a question of timing. The Lusitania, they pointed out, sank just 18 minutes after it was torpedoed by a German U-boat on May 7, 1915, killing more than 1,198 people from a manifest of 1,258 passengers and 691 crew members. By contrast, the Titanic stayed afloat for two hours and 40 minutes after striking ice on the night of April 14, 1912. Although 1,512 people died in that disaster \u2014 from among 1,300 passengers and 886 crew onboard \u2014 the extra coping time afforded the Titanic\u2019s crew and passengers a sort of psychological buffer against selfishness, according to the researchers. People on the Titanic were better able to resist the powerful instinct to save oneself by using superior physical prowess to flee \u2014 a mindset that seemed to prevail on the much more quickly doomed Lusitania, the researchers said. On the Titanic, time appeared to favor adoption of respect for social norms, which favored women, while fostering a better of exchange of lifesaving advice that probably favored those in the upper class with the best access to such information, they said. What\u2019s more, the added time also would have allowed for the dissipation of adrenaline, which triggers a fight-or-flight reaction that, by contrast, would have been in play throughout the entire Lusitania sinking.  \u201cTime seems to be a crucial element,\u201d noted Torgler. \u201cIf people have time to interact and communicate, social norms and helping behavior emerges. Children, families with children and women in general have then a higher probability of surviving, while men have a higher willingness to surrender a seat on a lifeboat.\u201d Other factors, however, might also have influenced behavior on the two ships, the researchers acknowledged. For example, the fact that Lusitania passengers already knew of the gruesome fate of the Titanic just three years earlier could have contributed to a less restrained reaction. Differing ship structures and the fact that the Lusitania incident occurred in a wartime context also might have affected passenger thinking, they said. Yet Torgler and his colleagues suggest that, in general, their observations could help planners devise more effective disaster-reaction strategies by broadening the understanding of how people juggle survival instincts with social pressures when confronting extreme situations. For his part, Robert J. Gatchel, a professor of clinical health psychology at the University of Texas at Arlington, agreed that timing does affect behavior during a disaster, while noting that other issues of perception are almost certainly also at play.  \u201cOn the Titanic, there was clearly a predetermined perception that it was unsinkable,\u201d he remarked. \u201cThere was all the pre-travel publicity about that. So the passengers probably had a feeling that \u2018Yeah, we\u2019re evacuating the ship but it\u2019s not really going to go down, and we\u2019re doing it for a precautionary reason.\u2019 There was probably a perception that this wasn\u2019t really a disaster, at least at first. So instead of an immediate fight-or-flight response, there was a perception of control, for better or worse. And we know that that perception will reduce stress and affect behavior,\u201d Gatchel said.  \u201cOn the other hand, people on the Lusitania were no longer under the illusion that these big ships could not go down. They knew of the great publicity of the Titanic, and they didn\u2019t want to be part of another incident like that. So they lost their sense of control, which increased stress levels. And then it became a free-for-all in terms of survival of the fittest. And I\u2019m also sure just in terms of the cadence of the voice of the officers the urgency to get off was greater, if for no other reason than because another torpedo could be fired.
