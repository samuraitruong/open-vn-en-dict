If your answer doesn't include how incredibly crowded the streets are at least to some degree contributing to it, then you're really missing an important point. It might be that children are raised to care only about their immediate family, but then you get into a question of the fact that family is also often out on the streets too. Also, driving safely can reflect well on the family. What we perceive as being <em>asshole</em> behavior isn't necessarily so. I think most people would agree that someone who cuts you off because they don't care about you and someone who cuts you off because they think you aren't important are two different things.\u00a0",
