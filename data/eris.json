            "en": "A supposed planet discovered by the Sumerian, the theory of the Earth being destroyed in 2012 began with the prophecy the planet Nibiru clashing with the earth. Although initially predicted for May 2003, the doomsday date was postponed to December 2012 as nothing obviously happened. Ironically, both tales were linked to one of the cycles in the Ancient Mayan calendar that ends in 2012. This is an internet hoax! Amongst many other fibs; if a planet, asteroid or comet was heading towards the earth, astronomers would be definitely keeping track of them. Astronomers have found a dwarf planet similar to the siz\u200be of Pluto known as <em>Eris</em>; however, this planet will remain in the outer solar system. The closest <em>Eris</em> can come in proximity with the Earth is 4 billion miles, which I believe is quite a lot of distance.",
