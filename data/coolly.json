Many crossed the porous border on foot, trekking through the jungle. Most continued onward overland to Thailand in hope of finding passage to America, Australia, or Europe. A few stayed and established new lives in Cambodia. More came by small fishing boats, some accidentally washed ashore by storms, others intentionally beached on Cambodian shores to avoid the vicious Thai and Malay pirates who plundered, raped, and murdered thousands of Vietnamese with impunity in the Gulf of Thailand. My own family embarked on this same voyage, thirty-seven years ago with full knowledge of the terrors awaiting us at sea. For three days, the stormy winds of Fate blew us off course, away from the Gulf of Thailand, and sank us in the shipping lane in the South China Sea. In our direst hours, a Russian ship followed us, and a French ship <em>coolly</em> passed by without offering assistance or supplies. An Indonesian freighter under the command of Captain Samalan, saved my family, plucking us from the tossing sea as our fishing vessel disintegrated beneath our feet.",

            "en": "10        10. INTERROGATIONS It was very hard, in the morning, to argue with the part of me that was sure last night was a dream. Logic wasn't on my side, or common sense. I clung to the parts I couldn't have imagined \u2014 like his smell. I was sure I could never have dreamed that up on my own. It was foggy and dark outside my window, absolutely perfect. He had no reason not to be in school today. I dressed in my heavy clothes, remembering I didn't have a jacket. Further proof that my memory was real. When I got downstairs, Charlie was gone again \u2014 I was running later than I'd realized. I swallowed a granola bar in three bites, chased it down with milk straight from the carton, and then hurried out the door. Hopefully the rain would hold off until I could find Jessica. It was unusually foggy; the air was almost smoky with it. The mist was ice cold where it clung to the exposed skin on my face and neck. I couldn't wait to get the heat going in my truck. It was such a thick fog that I was a few feet down the driveway before I realized there was a car in it: a silver car. My heart thudded, stuttered, and then picked up again in double time. I didn't see where he came from, but suddenly he was there, pulling the door open for me. \"Do you want to ride with me today?\" he asked, amused by my expression as he caught me by surprise yet again. There was uncertainty in his voice. He was really giving me a choice \u2014 I was free to refuse, and part of him hoped for that. It was a vain hope. \"Yes, thank you,\" I said, trying to keep my voice calm. As I stepped into the warm car, I noticed his tan jacket was slung over the headrest of the passenger seat. The door closed behind me, and, sooner than should be possible, he was sitting next to me, starting the car. \"I brought the jacket for you. I didn't want you to get sick or something.\" His voice was guarded. I noticed that he wore no jacket himself, just a light gray knit V-neck shirt with long sleeves. Again, the fabric clung to his perfectly muscled chest. It was a colossal tribute to his face that it kept my eyes away from his body. \"I'm not quite that delicate,\" I said, but I pulled the jacket onto my lap, pushing my arms through the too-long sleeves, curious to see if the scent could possibly be as good as I remembered. It was better. \"Aren't you?\" he contradicted in a voice so low I wasn't sure if he meant for me to hear. We drove through the fog-shrouded streets, always too fast, feeling awkward. I was, at least. Last night all the walls were down\u2026 almost all. I didn't know if we were still being as candid today. It left me tongue-tied. I waited for him to speak. He turned to smirk at me. \"What, no twenty questions today?\" \"Do my questions bother you?\" I asked, relieved. \"Not as much as your reactions do.\" He looked like he was joking, but I couldn't be sure. I frowned. \"Do I react badly?\" \"No, that's the problem. You take everything so <em>coolly</em> \u2014 it's unnatural.\u00a0 It makes me wonder what you're really thinking.\" \"I always tell you what I'm really thinking.\" \"You edit,\" he accused. \"Not very much.\" \"Enough to drive me insane.\" \"You don't want to hear it,\" I mumbled, almost whispered. As soon as the words were out, I regretted them. The pain in my voice was very faint; I could only hope he hadn't noticed it. He didn't respond, and I wondered if I had ruined the mood. His face was unreadable as we drove into the school parking lot. Something occurred to me belatedly. \"Where's the rest of your family?\" I asked \u2014 more than glad to be alone with him, but remembering that his car was usually full. \"They took Rosalie's car.\" He shrugged as he parked next to a glossy red convertible with the top up. \"Ostentatious, isn't it?\" \"Um, wow,\" I breathed. \"If she has that, why does she ride with you?\" \"Like I said, it's ostentatious. We try to blend in.\" \"You don't succeed.\" I laughed and shook my head as we got out of the car. I wasn't late anymore; his lunatic driving had gotten me to school in plenty of time. \"So why did Rosalie drive today if it's more conspicuous?\" \"Hadn't you noticed? I'm breaking all the rules now.\" He met me at the front of the car, staying very close to my side as we walked onto campus. I wanted to close that little distance, to reach out and touch him, but I was afraid he wouldn't like me to. \"Why do you have cars like that at all?\" I wondered aloud. \"If you're looking for privacy?\" \"An indulgence,\" he admitted with an impish smile. \"We all like to drive fast.\" \"Figures,\" I muttered under my breath. Under the shelter of the cafeteria roof's overhang, Jessica was waiting, her eyes about to bug out of their sockets. Over her arm, bless her, was my jacket. \"Hey, Jessica,\" I said when we were a few feet away. \"Thanks for remembering.\" She handed me my jacket without speaking. \"Good morning, Jessica,\" Edward said politely. It wasn't really his fault that his voice was so irresistible. Or what his eyes were capable of.  \"Er\u2026 hi.\" She shifted her wide eyes to me, trying to gather her jumbled thoughts. \"I guess I'll see you in Trig.\" She gave me a meaningful look, and I suppressed a sigh. What on earth was I going to tell her? \"Yeah, I'll see you then.\" She walked away, pausing twice to peek back over her shoulder at us. \"What are you going to tell her?\" Edward murmured. \"Hey, I thought you couldn't read my mind!\" I hissed. \"I can't,\" he said, startled. Then understanding brightened his eyes. \"However, I can read hers \u2014 she'll be waiting to ambush you in class.\" I groaned as I pulled off his jacket and handed it to him, replacing it with my own. He folded it over his arm. \"So what are you going to tell her?\" \"A little help?\" I pleaded. \"What does she want to know?\" He shook his head, grinning wickedly. \"That's not fair.\" \"No, you not sharing what you know \u2014 now that's not fair.\" He deliberated for a moment as we walked. We stopped outside the door to my first class. \"She wants to know if we're secretly dating. And she wants to know how you feel about me,\" he finally said. \"Yikes. What should I say?\" I tried to keep my expression very innocent. People were passing us on their way to class, probably staring, but I was barely aware of them. \"Hmmm.\" He paused to catch a stray lock of hair that was escaping the twist on my neck and wound it back into place. My heart spluttered hyperactively. \"I suppose you could say yes to the first\u2026 if you don't mind \u2014 it's easier than any other explanation.\" \"I don't mind,\" I said in a faint voice. \"And as for her other question\u2026 well, I'll be listening to hear the answer to that one myself.\" One side of his mouth pulled up into my favorite uneven smile. I couldn't catch my breath soon enough to respond to that remark. He turned and walked away. \"I'll see you at lunch,\" he called over his shoulder. Three people walking in the door stopped to stare at me. I hurried into class, flushed and irritated. He was such a cheater. Now I was even more worried about what I was going to say to Jessica. I sat in my usual seat, slamming my bag down in aggravation. \"Morning, Bella,\" Mike said from the seat next to me. I looked up to see an odd, almost resigned look on his face. \"How was Port Angeles?\" \"It was\u2026\" There was no honest way to sum it up. \"Great,\" I finished lamely. \"Jessica got a really cute dress.\" \"Did she say anything about Monday night?\" he asked, his eyes brightening. I smiled at the turn the conversation had taken. \"She said she had a really good time,\" I assured him. \"She did?\" he said eagerly. \"Most definitely.\" Mr. Mason called the class to order then, asking us to turn in our papers. English and then Government passed in a blur, while I worried about how to explain things to Jessica and agonized over whether Edward would really be listening to what I said through the medium of Jess's thoughts. How very inconvenient his little talent could be \u2014 when it wasn't saving my life. The fog had almost dissolved by the end of the second hour, but the day was still dark with low, oppressing clouds. I smiled up at the sky. Edward was right, of course. When I walked into Trig Jessica was sitting in the back row, nearly bouncing off her seat in agitation. I reluctantly went to sit by her, trying to convince myself it would be better to get it over with as soon as possible. \"Tell me everything!\" she commanded before I was in the seat. \"What do you want to know?\" I hedged. \"What happened last night?\" \"He bought me dinner, and then he drove me home.\" She glared at me, her expression stiff with skepticism. \"How did you get home so fast?\" \"He drives like a maniac. It was terrifying.\" I hoped he heard that. \"Was it like a date \u2014 did you tell him to meet you there?\" I hadn't thought of that. \"No \u2014 I was very surprised to see him there.\" Her lips puckered in disappointment at the transparent honesty in my voice. \"But he picked you up for school today?\" she probed. \"Yes \u2014 that was a surprise, too. He noticed I didn't have a jacket last night,\" I explained. \"So are you going out again?\" \"He offered to drive me to Seattle Saturday because he thinks toy truck isn't up to it \u2014 does that count?\" \"Yes.\" She nodded. \"Well, then, yes.\" \"W-o-w.\" She exaggerated the word into three syllables. \"Edward Cullen.\" \"I know,\" I agreed. \"Wow\" didn't even cover it. \"Wait!\" Her hands flew up, palms toward me like she was stopping traffic. \"Has he kissed you?\" \"No,\" I mumbled. \"It's not like that.\" She looked disappointed. I'm sure I did, too. \"Do you think Saturday\u2026 ?\" She raised her eyebrows. \"I really doubt it.\" The discontent in my voice was poorly disguised. \"What did you talk about?\" She pushed for more information in a whisper. Class had started but Mr. Varner wasn't paying close attention and we weren't the only ones still talking. \"I don't know, Jess, lots of stuff,\" I whispered back. \"We talked about the English essay a little.\" A very, very little. I think \u00a0he mentioned it in passing. \"Please, Bella,\" she begged. \"Give me some details.\" \"Well\u2026 okay, I've got one. You should have seen the waitress flirting with him \u2014 it was over the top. But he didn't pay any attention to her at all.\" Let him make what he could of that. \"That's a good sign,\" she nodded. \"Was she pretty?\" \"Very \u2014 and probably nineteen or twenty.\" \"Even better. He must like you.\" \"I think so, but it's hard to tell. He's always so cryptic,\" I threw in for his benefit, sighing. \"I don't know how you're brave enough to be alone with him,\" she breathed. \"Why?\" I was shocked, but she didn't understand my reaction. \"He's so\u2026 intimidating. I wouldn't know what to say to him.\" She made a face, probably remembering this morning or last night, when he'd turned the overwhelming force of his eyes on her. \"I do have some trouble with incoherency when I'm around him,\" I admitted. \"Oh well. He is unbelievably gorgeous.\" Jessica shrugged as if this excused any flaws. Which, in her book, it probably did. \"There's a lot more to him than that.\" \"Really? Like what?\" I wished I had let it go. Almost as much as I was hoping he'd been kidding about listening in. \"I can't explain it right\u2026 but he's even more unbelievable behind the face.\" The vampire who wanted to be good \u2014 who ran around saving people's lives so he wouldn't be a monster\u2026 I stared toward the front of the room. \"Is that possible?\" She giggled. I ignored her, trying to look like I was paying attention to Mr. Varner. \"So you like him, then?\" She wasn't about to give up. \"Yes,\" I said curtly. \"I mean, do you really like him?\" she urged. \"Yes,\" I said again, blushing. I hoped that detail wouldn't register in her thoughts. She'd had enough with the single syllable answers. \"How much do you like him?\" \"Too much,\" I whispered back. \"More than he likes me. But I don't see how I can help that.\" I sighed, one blush blending into the next. Then, thankfully, Mr. Varner called on Jessica for an answer. She didn't get a chance to start on the subject again during class, and as soon as the bell rang, I took evasive action. \"In English, Mike asked me if you said anything about Monday night,\" I told her. \"You're kidding! What did you say?!\" she gasped, completely sidetracked. \"I told him you said you had a lot of fun \u2014 he looked pleased.\" \"Tell me exactly what he said, and your exact answer!\" We spent the rest of the walk dissecting sentence structures and most of Spanish on a minute description of Mike's facial expressions. I wouldn't have helped draw it out for as long as I did if I wasn't worried about the subject returning to me. And then the bell rang for lunch. As I jumped up out of my seat, shoving my books roughly in my bag, my uplifted expression must have tipped Jessica off. \"You're not sitting with us today, are you?\" she guessed. \"I don't think so.\" I couldn't be sure that he wouldn't disappear inconveniently again. But outside the door to our Spanish class, leaning against the wall \u2014 looking more like a Greek god than anyone had a right to \u2014 Edward was waiting for me. Jessica took one look, rolled her eyes, and departed. \"See you later, Bella.\" Her voice was thick with implications. I might have to turn off the ringer on the phone. \"Hello.\" His voice was amused and irritated at the same time. He had been listening, it was obvious. \"Hi.\" I couldn't think of anything else to say, and he didn't speak \u2014 biding his time, I presumed \u2014 so it was a quiet walk to the cafeteria. Walking with Edward through the crowded lunchtime rush was a lot like my first day here; everyone stared. He led the way into the line, still not speaking, though his eyes returned to my face every few seconds, their expression speculative. It seemed to me that irritation was winning out over amusement as the dominant emotion in his face. I fidgeted nervously with the zipper on my jacket. He stepped up to the counter and filled a tray with food. \"What are you doing?\" I objected. \"You're not getting all that for me?\" He shook his head, stepping forward to buy the food. \"Half is for me, of course.\" I raised one eyebrow. He led the way to the same place we'd sat that one time before. From the other end of the long table, a group of seniors gazed at us in amazement as we sat across from each other. Edward seemed oblivious. \"Take whatever you want,\" he said, pushing the tray toward me. \"I'm curious,\" I said as I picked up an apple, turning it around in my hands, \"what would you do if someone dared you to eat food?\" \"You're always curious.\" He grimaced, shaking his head. He glared at me, holding my eyes as he lifted the slice of pizza off the tray, and deliberately bit off a mouthful, chewed quickly, and then swallowed. I watched, eyes wide. \"If someone dared you to eat dirt, you could, couldn't you?\" he asked condescendingly. I wrinkled my nose. \"I did once\u2026 on a dare,\" I admitted. \"It wasn't so bad.\" He laughed. \"I suppose I'm not surprised.\" Something over my shoulder seemed to catch his attention. \"Jessica's analyzing everything I do \u2014 she'll break it down for you later.\" He pushed the rest of the pizza toward me. The mention of Jessica brought a hint of his former irritation back to his features. I put down the apple and took a bite of the pizza, looking away, knowing he was about to start. \"So the waitress was pretty, was she?\" he asked casually. \"You really didn't notice?\" \"No. I wasn't paying attention. I had a lot on my mind.\" \"Poor girl.\" I could afford to be generous now. \"Something you said to Jessica\u2026 well, it bothers me.\" He refused to be distracted. His voice was husky, and he glanced up from under his lashes with troubled eyes. \"I'm not surprised you heard something you didn't like. You know what they say about eavesdropners,\" I reminded him. \"I warned you I would be listening.\" \"And I warned you that you didn't want to know everything I was thinking.\" \"You did,\" he agreed, but his voice was still rough. \"You aren't precisely right, though. I do want to know what you're thinking \u2014 everything. I just wish\u2026 that you wouldn't be thinking some things.\" I scowled. \"That's quite a distinction.\" \"But that's not really the point at the moment.\" \"Then what is?\" We were inclined toward each other across the table now. He had his large white hands folded under his chin; I leaned forward, my right hand cupped around my neck. I had to remind myself that we were in a crowded lunchroom, with probably many curious eyes on us. It was too easy to get wrapped up in our own private, tense little bubble. \"Do you truly believe that you care more for me than I do for you?\" he murmured, leaning closer to me as he spoke, his dark golden eyes piercing. I tried to remember how to exhale. I had to look away before it came back to me. \"You're doing it again,\" I muttered. His eyes opened wide with surprise. \"What?\" \"Dazzling me,\" I admitted, trying to concentrate as I looked back at him. \"Oh.\" He frowned. \"It's not your fault,\" I sighed. \"You can't help it.\" \"Are you going to answer the question?\" I looked down. \"Yes.\" \"Yes, you are going to answer, or yes, you really think that?\" He was irritated again. \"Yes, I really think that.\" I kept my eyes down on the table, my eyes tracing the pattern of the faux wood grains printed on the laminate. The silence dragged on. I stubbornly refused to be the first to break it this time, fighting hard against the temptation to peek at his expression. Finally he spoke, voice velvet soft. \"You're wrong.\" I glanced up to see that his eyes were gentle. \"You can't know that,\" I disagreed in a whisper. I shook my head in doubt, though my heart throbbed at his words and I wanted so badly to believe them. \"What makes you think so?\" His liquid topaz eyes were penetrating \u2014 trying futilely, I assumed, to lift the truth straight from my mind. I stared back, struggling to think clearly in spite of his face, to find some way to explain. As I searched for the words, I could see him getting impatient; frustrated by my silence, he started to scowl. I lifted my hand from my neck, and held up one finger. \"Let me think,\" I insisted. His expression cleared, now that he was satisfied that I was planning to answer. I dropped my hand to the table, moving my left hand so that my palms were pressed together. I stared at my hands, twisting and untwisting my fingers, as I finally spoke. \"Well, aside from the obvious, sometimes\u2026\" I hesitated. \"I can't be sure \u2014 I don't know how to read minds \u2014 but sometimes it seems like you're trying to say goodbye when you're saying something else.\" That was the best I could sum up the sensation of anguish that his words triggered in me at times. \"Perceptive,\" he whispered. And there was the anguish again, surfacing as he confirmed my fear. \"That's exactly why you're wrong, though,\" he began to explain, but then his eyes narrowed. \"What do you mean, 'the obvious'?\" \"Well, look at me,\" I said, unnecessarily as he was already staring. \"I'm absolutely ordinary \u2014 well, except for bad things like all the near-death experiences and being so clumsy that I'm almost disabled. And look at you.\" I waved my hand toward him and all his bewildering perfection. His brow creased angrily for a moment, then smoothed as his eyes took on a knowing look. \"You don't see yourself very clearly, you know. I'll admit you're dead-on about the bad things,\" he chuckled blackly, \"but you didn't hear what every human male in this school was thinking on your first day.\" I blinked, astonished. \"I don't believe it\u2026\" I mumbled to myself. \"Trust me just this once \u2014 you are the opposite of ordinary.\" My embarrassment was much stronger than my pleasure at the look that came into his eyes when he said this. I quickly reminded him of my original argument. \"But I'm not saying goodbye,\" I pointed out. \"Don't you see? That's what proves me right. I care the most, because if I can do it\" \u2014 he shook his head, seeming to struggle with the thought \u2014 \"if leaving is the right thing to do, then I'll hurt myself to keep from hurting you, to keep you safe.\" I glared. \"And you don't think I would do the same?\" \"You'd never have to make the choice.\" Abruptly, his unpredictable mood shifted again; a mischievous, devastating smile rearranged his features. \"Of course, keeping you safe is beginning to feel like a full-time occupation that requires my constant presence.\" \"No one has tried to do away with me today,\" I reminded him, grateful for the lighter subject. I didn't want him to talk about goodbyes anymore. If I had to, I supposed I could purposefully put myself in danger to keep him close\u2026 I banished that thought before his quick eyes read it on my face. That idea would definitely get me in trouble. \"Yet,\" he added. \"Yet,\" I agreed; I would have argued, but now I wanted him to be expecting disasters. \"I have another question for you.\" His face was still casual. \"Shoot.\" \"Do you really need to go to Seattle this Saturday, or was that just an excuse to get out of saying no to all your admirers?\" I made a face at the memory. \"You know, I haven't forgiven you for the Tyler thing yet,\" I warned him. \"It's your fault that he's deluded himself into thinking I'm going to prom with him.\" \"Oh, he would have found a chance to ask you without me \u2014 I just really wanted to watch your face,\" he chuckled, I would have been angrier if his laughter wasn't so fascinating. \"If I'd asked you, would you have turned me down?\" he asked, still laughing to himself. \"Probably not,\" I admitted. \"But I would have canceled later \u2014 faked an illness or a sprained ankle.\" He was puzzled. \"Why would you do that?\" I shook my head sadly. \"You've never seen me in Gym, I guess, but I would have thought you would understand.\" \"Are you referring to the fact that you can't walk across a flat, stable surface without finding something to trip over?\" \"Obviously.\" \"That wouldn't be a problem.\" He was very confident. \"It's all in the leading.\" He could see that I was about to protest, and he cut me off. \"But you never told me \u2014 are you resolved on going to Seattle, or do you mind if we do something different?\" As long as the \"we\" part was in, I didn't care about anything else. \"I'm open to alternatives,\" I allowed. \"But I do have a favor to ask.\" He looked wary, as he always did when I asked an open-ended question. \"What?\" \"Can I drive?\" He frowned. \"Why?\" \"Well, mostly because when I told Charlie I was going to Seattle, he specifically asked if I was going alone and, at the time, I was. If he asked again, I probably wouldn't lie, but I don't think he will ask again, and leaving my truck at home would just bring up the subject unnecessarily. And also, because your driving frightens me.\" He rolled his eyes. \"Of all the things about me that could frighten you, you worry about my driving.\" He shook his head in disgust, but then his eyes were serious again. \"Won't you want to tell your father that you're spending the day with me?\" There was an undercurrent to his question that I didn't understand. \"With Charlie, less is always more.\" I was definite about that. \"Where are we going, anyway?\" \"The weather will be nice, so I'll be staying out of the public eye\u2026 and you can stay with me, if you'd like to.\" Again, he was leaving the choice up to me. \"And you'll show me what you meant, about the sun?\" I asked, excited by the idea of unraveling another of the unknowns. \"Yes.\" He smiled, and then paused. \"But if you don't want to be\u2026 alone with me, I'd still rather you didn't go to Seattle by yourself. I shudder to think of the trouble you could find in a city that size.\" I was miffed. \"Phoenix is three times bigger than Seattle \u2014 just in population. In physical size \u2014\" \"But apparently,\" he interrupted me, \"your number wasn't up in Phoenix. So I'd rather you stayed near me.\" His eyes did that unfair smoldering thing again. I couldn't argue, with the eyes or the motivation, and it was a moot point anyway. \"As it happens, I don't mind being alone with you.\" \"I know,\" he sighed, brooding. \"You should tell Charlie, though.\" \"Why in the world would I do that?\" His eyes were suddenly fierce. \"To give me some small incentive to bring you back.\" I gulped. But, after a moment of thought, I was sure. \"I think I'll take my chances.\" He exhaled angrily, and looked away. \"Let's talk about something else,\" I suggested. \"What do you want to talk about?\" he asked. He was still annoyed. I glanced around us, making sure we were well out of anyone's hearing. As I cast my eyes around the room, I caught the eyes of his sister, Alice, staring at me. The others were looking at Edward. I looked away swiftly, back to him, and I asked the first thing that came to mind. \"Why did you go to that Goat Rocks place last weekend\u2026 to hunt? Charlie said it wasn't a good place to hike, because of bears.\" He stared at me as if I was missing something very obvious. \"Bears?\" I gasped, and he smirked. \"You know, bears are not in season,\" I added sternly, to hide my shock. \"If you read carefully, the laws only cover hunting with weapons,\" he informed me. He watched my face with enjoyment as that slowly sank in. \"Bears?\" I repeated with difficulty. \"Grizzly is Emmett's favorite.\" His voice was still offhand, but his eyes were scrutinizing my reaction. I tried to pull myself together. \"Hmmm,\" I said, taking another bite of pizza as an excuse to look down. I chewed slowly, and then took a long drink of Coke without looking up. \"So,\" I said after a moment, finally meeting his now-anxious gaze. \"What's your favorite?\" He raised an eyebrow and the corners of his mouth turned down in disapproval. \"Mountain lion.\" \"Ah,\" I said in a politely disinterested tone, looking for my soda again. \"Of course,\" he said, and his tone mirrored mine, \"we have to be careful not to impact the environment with injudicious hunting. We try to focus on areas with an overpopulation of predators \u2014 ranging as far away as we need. There's always plenty of deer and elk here, and they'll do, but where's the fun in that?\" He smiled teasingly. \"Where indeed,\" I murmured around another bite of pizza. \"Early spring is Emmett's favorite bear season \u2014 they're just coming out of hibernation, so they're more irritable.\" He smiled at some remembered joke. \"Nothing more fun than an irritated grizzly bear,\" I agreed, nodding. He snickered, shaking his head. \"Tell me what you're really thinking, please.\" \"I'm trying to picture it \u2014 but I can't,\" I admitted. \"How do you hunt a bear without weapons?\" \"Oh, we have weapons.\" He flashed his bright teeth in a brief, threatening smile. I fought back a shiver before it could expose me. \"Just not the kind they consider when writing hunting laws. If you've ever seen a bear attack on television, you should be able to visualize Emmett hunting.\" I couldn't stop the next shiver that flashed down my spine. I peeked across the cafeteria toward Emmett, grateful that he wasn't looking my way. The thick bands of muscle that wrapped his arms and torso were somehow even more menacing now. Edward followed my gaze and chuckled. I stared at him, unnerved. \"Are you like a bear, too?\" I asked in a low voice. \"More like the lion, or so they tell me,\" he said lightly. \"Perhaps our preferences are indicative.\" I tried to smile. \"Perhaps,\" I repeated. But my mind was filled with opposing images that I couldn't merge together. \"Is that something I might get to see?\" \"Absolutely not!\" His face turned even whiter than usual, and his eyes were suddenly furious. I leaned back, stunned and \u2014 though I'd never admit it to him \u2014 frightened by his reaction. He leaned back as well, folding his arms across his chest. \"Too scary for me?\" I asked when I could control my voice again. \"If that were it, I would take you out tonight,\" he said, his voice cutting. \"You need a healthy dose of fear. Nothing could be more beneficial for you.\" \"Then why?\" I pressed, trying to ignore his angry expression. He glared at me for a long minute. \"Later,\" he finally said. He was on his feet in one lithe movement. \"We're going to be late.\" I glanced around, startled to see that he was right and the cafeteria was nearly vacant. When I was with him, the time and the place were such a muddled blur that I completely lost track of both. I jumped up, grabbing my bag from the back of my chair. \"Later, then,\" I agreed. I wouldn't forget.",

            "en": "7 REPETITION        24. VOTE HE WAS NOT PLEASED, THAT MUCH WAS EASY TO READ in his face. But, without further argument, he took me in his arms and sprang lithely from my window, landing without the slightest jolt, like a cat. It was a little bit farther down than I'd imagined. \"All right then,\" he said, his voice seething with disapproval. \"Up you go.\" He helped me onto his back, and took off running. Even after all this time, it felt routine. Easy. Evidently this was something you never forgot, like riding a bicycle. It was so very quiet and dark as he ran through the forest, his breathing slow and even\u2014dark enough that the trees flying past us were nearly invisible, and only the rush of air in my face truly gave away our speed. The air was damp; it didn't burn my eyes the way the wind in the big plaza had, and that was comforting. As was the night, too, after that terrifying brightness. Like the thick quilt I'd played under as a child, the dark felt familiar and protecting. I remembered that running through the forest like this used to frighten me, that I used to have to close my eyes. It seemed a silly reaction to me now. I kept my eyes wide, my chin resting on his shoulder, my cheek against his neck. The speed was exhilarating. A hundred times better than the motorcycle. I turned my face toward him and pressed my lips into the cold stone skin of his neck. \"Thank you,\" he said, as the vague, black shapes of trees raced past us. \"Does that mean you've decided you're awake?\" I laughed. The sound was easy, natural, effortless. It sounded right. \"Not really. More that, either way, I'm not trying to wake up. Not tonight.\" \"I'll earn your trust back somehow,\" he murmured, mostly to himself. \"If it's my final act.\" \"I trust you,\" I assured him. \"It's me I don't trust.\" \"Explain that, please.\" He'd slowed to a walk\u2014I could only tell because the wind ceased\u2014and I guessed that we weren't far from the house. In fact, I thought I could make out the sound of the river rushing somewhere close by in the darkness. \"Well\u2014\" I struggled to find the right way to phrase it. \"I don't trust myself to be\u2026 enough. To deserve you. There's nothing about me that could hold you.\" He stopped and reached around to pull me from his back. His gentle hands did not release me; after he'd set me on my feet again, he wrapped his arms tightly around me, hugging me to his chest. \"Your hold is permanent and unbreakable,\" he whispered. \"Never doubt that.\" \u201cBut how could I not? \"You never did tell me\u2026\" he murmured. \"What?\" \"What your greatest problem is.\" \"I'll give you one guess.\" I sighed, and reached up to touch the tip of his nose with my index finger. He nodded. \"I'm worse than the Volturi,\" he said grimly. \"I guess I've earned that.\" I rolled my eyes. \"The worst the Volturi can do is kill me.\" He waited with tense eyes. \"You can leave me,\" I explained. \"The Volturi, Victoria\u2026 they're nothing compared to that.\" Even in the darkness, I could see the anguish twist his face\u2014it reminded me of his expression under Jane's torturing gaze; I felt sick, and regretted speaking the truth. \"Don't,\" I whispered, touching his face. \"Don't be sad.\" He pulled one corner of his mouth up halfheartedly, but the expression didn't touch his eyes. \"If there was only some way to make you see that I can't leave you,\" he whispered. \"Time, I suppose, will be the way to convince you.\" I liked the idea of time. \"Okay,\" I agreed. His face was still tormented. I tried to distract him with inconsequentials. \"So\u2014since you're staying. Can I have my stuff back?\" I asked, making my tone as light as I could manage. My attempt worked, to an extent: he laughed. But his eyes retained the misery. \"Your things were never gone,\" he told me. \"I knew it was wrong, since I promised you peace without reminders. It was stupid and childish, but I wanted to leave something of myself with you. The CD, the pictures, the tickets\u2014they're all under your floorboards.\" \"Really?\" He nodded, seeming slightly cheered by my obvious pleasure in this trivial fact. It wasn't enough to heal the pain in his face completely. \"I think,\" I said slowly, \"I'm not sure, but I wonder\u2026 I think maybe I knew it the whole time.\" \"What did you know?\" I only wanted to take away the agony in his eyes, but as I spoke the words, they sounded truer than I expected they would. \"Some part of me, my subconscious maybe, never stopped believing that you still cared whether I lived or died. That's probably why I was hearing the voices.\" There was a very deep silence for a moment. \"Voices?\" he asked flatly. \"Well, just one voice. Yours. It's a long story.\" The wary look on his face made me wish that I hadn't brought that up. Would he think I was crazy, like everyone else? Was everyone else right about that? But at least that expression\u2014the one that made him look like something was burning him\u2014faded. \"I've got time.\" His voice was unnaturally even. \"It's pretty pathetic.\" He waited. I wasn't sure how to explain. \"Do you remember what Alice said about extreme sports?\" He spoke the words without inflection or emphasis. \"You jumped off a cliff for fun.\" \"Er, right. And before that, with the motorcycle\u2014\" \"Motorcycle?\" he asked. I knew his voice well enough to hear something brewing behind the calm.  \"I guess I didn't tell Alice about that part.\" \"No.\" \"Well, about that\u2026 See, I found that\u2026 when I was doing something dangerous or stupid\u2026 I could remember you more clearly,\" I confessed, feeling completely mental. \"I could remember how your voice sounded when you were angry. I could hear it, like you were standing right there next to me. Mostly I tried not to think about you, but this didn't hurt so much\u2014it was like you were protecting me again. Like you didn't want me to be hurt. \"And, well, I wonder if the reason I could hear you so clearly was because, underneath it all. I always knew that you hadn't stopped loving me.\" Again, as I spoke, the words brought with them a sense of conviction. Of rightness. Some deep place inside me recognized truth. His words came out half-strangled. \"You\u2026 were\u2026 risking your life\u2026 to hear\u2014\" \"Shh,\" I interrupted him. \"Hold on a second. I think I'm having an epiphany here.\" I thought of that night in Port Angeles when I'd had my first delusion. I'd come up with two options. Insanity or wish fulfillment. I'd seen no third option. But what if\u2026 What if you sincerely believed something was true, but you were dead wrong? What if you were so stubbornly sure that you were right, that you wouldn't even consider the truth? Would the truth be silenced, or would it try to break through? Option three: Edward loved me. The bond forged between us was not one that could be broken by absence, distance, or time. And no matter how much more special or beautiful or brilliant or perfect than me he might be, he was as irreversibly altered as I was. As I would always belong to him, so would he always be mine. Was that what I'd been trying to tell myself? \"Oh!\" \"Bella?\" \"Oh. Okay. I see.\" \"Your epiphany?\" he asked, his voice uneven and strained. \"You love me,\" I marveled. The sense of conviction and Tightness washed through me again. Though his eyes were still anxious, the crooked smile I loved best flashed across his face. \"Truly, I do.\" My heart inflated like it was going to crack right through my ribs. It filled my chest and blocked my throat so that I could not speak. He really did want me the way I wanted him\u2014forever. It was only fear for my soul, for the human things he didn't want to take from me, that made him so desperate to leave me mortal. Compared to the fear that he didn't want me, this hurdle\u2014my soul\u2014seemed almost insignificant. He took my face tightly between his cool hands and kissed me until I was so dizzy the forest was spinning. Then he leaned his forehead against mine, and I was not the only one breathing harder than usual. \"You were better at it than I was, you know,\" he told me. \"Better at what?\" \"Surviving. You, at least, made an effort. You got up in the morning, tried to be normal for Charlie, followed the pattern of your life. When I wasn't actively tracking, I was\u2026 totally useless. I couldn't be around my family\u2014I couldn't be around anyone. I'm embarrassed to admit that I more or less curled up into a ball and let the misery have me.\" He grinned, sheepish. \"It was much more pathetic than hearing voices. And, of course, you know I do that, too.\" I was deeply relieved that he really seemed to understand\u2014comforted that this all made sense to him. At any rate, he wasn't looking at me like I was crazy. He was looking at me like\u2026 he loved me. \"I only heard one voice,\" I corrected him. He laughed and then pulled me tight against his right side and started to lead me forward. \"I'm just humoring you with this.\" He motioned broadly with his hand toward the \u00a0darkness in front of us as we walked. There was something pale and immense there\u2014the house, I realized. \"It doesn't matter in the slightest what they say.\" \"This affects them now, too.\" He shrugged indifferently. He led me through the open front door into the dark house and flipped the lights on. The room was just as I'd remembered it\u2014the piano and the white couches and the pale, massive staircase. No dust, no white sheets. Edward called out the names with no more volume than I'd use in regular conversation. \"Carlisle? Esme?\u00a0 Rosalie? Emmett? Jasper? Alice?\" They would hear. Carlisle was suddenly standing beside me, as if he'd been there all along. \"Welcome back, Bella.\" He smiled. \"What can we do for you this morning? I imagine, due to the hour, that this is not a purely social visit?\" I nodded. \"I'd like to talk to everyone at once, if that's okay. About something important.\" I couldn't help glancing up at Edward's face as I spoke. His expression was critical, but resigned. When I looked back to Carlisle, he was looking at Edward, too. \"Of course,\" Carlisle said. \"Why don't we talk in the other room?\" Carlisle led the way through the bright living room, around the corner to the dining room, turning on lights as he went. The walls were white, the ceilings high, like the living room. In the center of the room, under the low-hanging chandelier, was a large, polished oval table surrounded by eight chairs. Carlisle held out a chair for me at the head. I'd never seen the Cullens use the dining room table before\u2014it was just a prop. They didn't eat in the house. As soon as I turned to sit in the chair, I saw that we were not alone. Esme had followed Edward, and behind her the rest of the family filed in. Carlisle sat down on my right, and Edward on my left. Everyone else took their seats in silence. Alice was grinning at me, already in on the plot. Emmett and Jasper looked curious, and Rosalie smiled at me tentatively. My answering smile was just as timid. That was going to take some getting used to. Carlisle nodded toward me. \"The floor is yours.\" I swallowed. Their gazing eyes made me nervous. Edward took my hand under the table. I peeked at him, but he was watching the others, his face suddenly fierce. \"Well,\" I paused. \"I'm hoping Alice has already told you everything that happened in Volterra?\" \"Everything,\" Alice assured me. I threw her a meaningful look. \"And on the way?\" \"That, too,\" she nodded. \"Good,\" I sighed with relief. \"Then we're all on the same page.\" They waited patiently while I tried to order my thoughts. \"So, I have a problem,\" I began. \"Alice promised the Volturi that I would become one of you. They're going to send someone to check, and I'm sure that's a bad thing\u2014something to avoid. \"And so, now, this involves you all. I'm sorry about that.\" I looked at each one of their beautiful faces, saving the most beautiful for last. Edward's mouth was turned down into a grimace. \"But, if you don't want me, then I'm not going to force myself on you, whether Alice is willing or not.\" Esme opened her mouth to speak, but I held up one finger to stop her. \"Please, let me finish. You all know what I want. And I'm sure you know what Edward thinks, too. I think the only fair way to decide is for everyone to have a vote. If you decide you don't want me, then\u2026\u00a0 I guess I'll go back to Italy alone. I can't have them coming here.\" My forehead creased as I considered that. There was the faint rumble of a growl in Edward's chest. I ignored him. \"Taking into account, then, that I won't put any of you in danger either way, I want you to vote yes or no on the issue of me becoming a vampire.\" I half-smiled on the last word, and gestured toward Carlisle to begin. \"Just a minute,\" Edward interrupted. I glared at him through narrowed eyes. He raised his eyebrows at me, squeezing my hand. \"I have something to add before we vote.\" I sighed. \"About the danger Bella's referring to,\" he continued. \"I don't think we need to be overly anxious.\" His expression became more animated. He put his free hand on the shining table and leaned forward. \"You see,\" he explained, looking around the table while he spoke, \"there was more than one reason why I didn't want to shake Aro's hand there at the end. There's something they didn't think of, and I didn't want to cine them in.\" He grinned. \"Which was?\" Alice prodded. I was sure my expression was just as skeptical as hers. \"The Volturi are overconfident, and with good reason. When they decide to find someone, it's not really a problem. Do you remember Demetri?\" He glanced down at me. I shuddered. He took that as a yes. \"He finds people\u2014that's his talent, why they keep him. \"Now, the whole time we were with any of them, I was picking their brains for anything that might save us, getting as much information as possible. So I saw how Demetri's talent works. He's a tracker\u2014a tracker a thousand times more gifted than James was. His ability is loosely related to what I do, or what Aro does. He catches the\u2026 flavor? I don't know how to describe it\u2026 the tenor\u2026 of someone's mind, and then he follows that. It works over immense distances. \"But after Aro's little experiments, well\u2026\" Edward shrugged. \"You think he won't be able to find me,\" I said flatly. He was smug. \"I'm sure of it. He relies totally on that other sense. When it doesn't work with you, they'll all be blind.\" \"And how does that solve anything?\" \"Quite obviously, Alice will be able to tell when they're planning a visit, and I'll hide you. They'll be helpless,\" he said with fierce enjoyment. \"It will be like looking for a piece of straw in a haystack!\" He and Emmett exchanged a glance and a smirk. This made no sense. \"But they can find you,\" I reminded him. \"And I can take care of myself.\" Emmett laughed, and reached across the table toward his brother, extending a fist. \"Excellent plan, my brother,\" he said with enthusiasm. Edward stretched out his arm to smack Emmett's fist with his own. \"No,\" Rosalie hissed. \"Absolutely not,\" I agreed. \"Nice.\" Jasper's voice was appreciative. \"Idiots,\" Alice muttered. Esme just glared at Edward. I straightened up in my chair, focusing. This was my meeting. \"All right, then. Edward has offered an alternative for you to consider,\" I said <em>coolly</em>. \"Let's vote.\" I looked toward Edward this time; it would be better to get his opinion out of the way. \"Do you want me to join your family?\" His eyes were hard and black as flint. \"Not that way. You're staying human.\" I nodded once, keeping my face businesslike, and then moved on. \"Alice?\" \"Yes.\" \"Jasper?\" \"Yes,\" he said, voice grave. I was a little surprised\u2014I hadn't been at all sure of his vote\u2014but I suppressed my reaction and moved on. \"Rosalie?\" She hesitated, biting down on her full, perfect bottom lip. \"No.\" I kept my face blank and turned my head slightly to move on, but she held up both her hands, palms forward. \"Let me explain,\" she pleaded. \"I don't mean that I have any aversion to you as a sister. It's just that\u2026 this is not the life I would have chosen for myself. I wish there had been someone there to vote no for me.\" I nodded slowly, and then turned to Emmett. \"Hell, yes!\" He grinned. \"We can find some other way to pick a fight with this Demetri.\" I was still grimacing at that when I looked at Esme. \"Yes, of course, Bella. I already think of you as part of my family.\" \"Thank you, Esme,\" I murmured as I turned toward Carlisle. I was suddenly nervous, wishing I had asked for his vote first. I was sure that this was the vote that mattered most, the vote that counted more than any majority. Carlisle wasn't looking at me. \"Edward,\" he said. \"No,\" Edward growled. His jaw was strained tight, his lips curled back from his teeth. \"It's the only way that makes sense,\" Carlisle insisted. \"You've chosen not to live without her, and that doesn't leave me a choice.\" Edward dropped my hand, shoving away from the table. He stalked out of the room, snarling under his breath. \"I guess you know my vote.\" Carlisle sighed. I was still staring after Edward. \"Thanks,\" I mumbled. An earsplitting crash echoed from the other room. I flinched, and spoke quickly. \"That's all I needed. Thank you. For wanting to keep me. I feel exactly the same way about all of you, too.\" My voice was jagged with emotion by the end. Esme was at my side in a flash, her cold arms around me. \"Dearest Bella,\" she breathed. I hugged her back. Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed Rosalie looking down at the table, and I realized that my words could be construed in two ways. \"Well, Alice,\" I said when Esme released me. \"Where do you want to do this?\" Alice stared at me, her eyes widening with terror. \"No! No! NO!\" Edward roared, charging back into the room. He was in my face before I had time to blink, bending over me, his expression twisted in rage. \"Are you insane?\" he shouted. \"Have you utterly lost your mind?\" I cringed away, my hands over my ears. \"Um, Bella,\" Alice interjected in an anxious voice. \"I don't think I'm ready for that. I'll need to prepare\u2026\" \"You promised,\" I reminded her, glaring under Edward's arm. \"I know, but\u2026 Seriously, Bella! I don't have any idea how to not kill you.\" \"You can do it,\" I encouraged. \"I trust you.\" Edward snarled in fury. Alice shook her head quickly, looking panicked. \"Carlisle?\" I turned to look at him. Edward grabbed my face in his hand, forcing me to look at him. His other hand was out, palm toward Carlisle. Carlisle ignored that. \"I'm able to do it,\" he answered my question. I wished I could see his expression. \"You would be in no danger of me losing control.\" \"Sounds good.\" I hoped he could understand; it was hard to talk clearly the way Edward held my jaw. \"Hold on,\" Edward said between his teeth. \"It doesn't have to be now.\" \"There's no reason for it not to be now,\" I said, the words coming out distorted. \"I can think of a few.\" \"Of course you can,\" I said sourly. \"Now let go of me.\" He freed my face, and folded his arms across his chest. \"In about two hours, Charlie will be here looking for you. I wouldn't put it past him to involve the police.\" \"All three of them.\" But I frowned. This was always the hardest part. Charlie, Renee. Now Jacob, too. The people I would lose, the people I would hurt. I wished there was some way that I could be the only one to suffer, but I knew that was impossible. At the same time, I was hurting them more by staying human. Putting Charlie in constant danger through my proximity. Putting Jake in worse danger still by drawing his enemies across the land he felt bound to protect. And Renee\u2014I couldn't even risk a visit to see my own mother for fear of bringing my deadly problems along with me! I was a danger magnet; I'd accepted that about myself. Accepting this, I knew I needed to be able to take care of myself and protect the ones I loved, even if that meant that I couldn't be with them. I needed to be strong. \"In the interest of remaining inconspicuous,\" Edward said, still talking through his gritted teeth, but looking at Carlisle now, \"I suggest that we put this conversation off, at the very least until Bella finishes high school, and moves out of Charlie's house.\" \"That's a reasonable request, Bella,\" Carlisle pointed out. I thought about Charlie's reaction when he woke up this morning, if\u2014after all that life had put him through in the last week with Harry's loss, and then I had put him through with my unexplained disappearance\u2014he were to find my bed empty. Charlie deserved better than that. It was just a little more time; graduation wasn't so far away\u2026 I pursed my lips. \"I'll consider it.\" Edward relaxed. His jaw unclenched. \"I should probably take you home,\" he said, more calm now, but clearly in a hurry to get me out of here.  \"Just in case Charlie wakes up early.\" I looked at Carlisle. \"After graduation?\" \"You have my word.\" I took a deep breath, smiled, and turned back to Edward. \"Okay. You can take me home.\" Edward rushed me out of the house before Carlisle could promise me anything else. He took me out the back, so I didn't get to see what was broken in the living room. It was a quiet trip home. I was feeling triumphant, and a little smug. Scared stiff, too, of course, but I tried not to think about that part. It did me no good to worry about the \u00a0\u00a0pain\u2014the physical or the emotional\u2014so I wouldn't. Not until I absolutely had to. When we got to my house, Edward didn't pause. He dashed up the wall and through my window in half a second. Then he pulled my arms from around his neck and set me on the bed. I thought I had a pretty good idea of what he was thinking, but his expression surprised me. Instead of furious, it was calculating. He paced silently back and forth across my dark room while I watched with growing suspicion. \"Whatever you're planning, it's not going to work,\" I told him. \"Shh. I'm thinking.\" \"Ugh,\" I groaned, throwing myself back on the bed and pulling the quilt over my head. There was no sound, but suddenly he was there. He flipped the cover back so he could see me. He was lying next to me. His hand reached up to brush my hair from my cheek. \"If you don't mind, I'd much rather you didn't hide your face. I've lived without it for as long as I can stand. Now\u2026 tell me something.\" \"What?\" I asked, unwilling. \"If you could have anything in the world, anything at all, what would it be?\" I could feel the skepticism in my eyes. \"You.\" He shook his head impatiently. \"Something you don't already have.\" I wasn't sure where he was trying to lead me, so I thought carefully before I answered. I came up with something that was both true, and also probably impossible. \"I would want\u2026 Carlisle not to have to do it. I would want you to change me.\" I watched his reaction warily, expecting more of the fury I'd seen at his house. I was surprised that his expression didn't change. It was still calculating, thoughtful. \"What would you be willing to trade for that?\" I couldn't believe my ears. I gawked at his composed face and blurted out the answer before I could think about it. \"Anything.\" He smiled faintly, and then pursed his lips. \"Five years?\" My face twisted into an expression somewhere between chagrin and horror. \"You said anything,\" he reminded me. \"Yes, but\u2026 you'll use the time to find a way out of it. I have to strike while the iron is hot. Besides, it's just too dangerous to be human\u2014for me, at least. So, anything but that.\" He frowned. \"Three years?\" \"No!\" \"Isn't it worth anything to you at all? \" I thought about how much I wanted this. Better to keep a poker face, I decided, and not let him know how very much that was. It would give me more leverage. \"Six months?\" He rolled his eyes. \"Not good enough.\" \"One year, then,\" I said. \"That's my limit.\" \"At least give me two.\" \"No way. Nineteen I'll do. But I'm not going anywhere near twenty. If you're staying in your teens forever, then so am I.\" He thought for a minute. \"All right. Forget time limits. If you want me to be the one\u2014then you'll just have to meet one condition.\" \"Condition?\" My voice went flat. \"What condition?\" His eyes were cautious\u2014he spoke slowly. \"Marry me first.\" I stared at him, waiting\u2026 \"Okay. What's the punch line?\" He sighed. \"You're wounding my ego, Bella. I just proposed to you, and you think it's a joke.\" \"Edward, please be serious.\" \"I am one hundred percent serious.\" He gazed at me with no hint of humor in his face. \"Oh, c'mon,\" I said, an edge of hysteria in my voice. \"I'm only eighteen.\" \"Well, I'm nearly a hundred and ten. It's time I settled down.\" I looked away, out the dark window, trying to control the panic before it gave me away. \"Look, marriage isn't exactly that high on my list of priorities, you know? It was sort of the kiss of death for Renee and Charlie.\" \"Interesting choice of words.\" \"You know what I mean.\" He inhaled deeply. \"Please don't tell me that you're afraid of the commitment,\" his voice was disbelieving, and I understood what he meant. \"That's not it exactly,\" I hedged. \"I'm\u2026 afraid of Renee. She has some really intense opinions on getting married before you're thirty.\" \"Because she'd rather you became one of the eternal damned than get married.\" He laughed darkly. \"You think you're joking.\" \"Bella, if you compare the level of commitment between a marital union as opposed to bartering your soul in exchange for an eternity as a vampire\u2026\" He shook his head. \"If you're not brave enough to marry me, then\u2014\" \"Well,\" I interrupted. \"What if I did? What if I told you to take me to Vegas now? Would I be a vampire in three days?\" He smiled, his teeth flashing in the dark. \"Sure,\" he said, calling my bluff. \"I'll get my car.\" \"Dammit.\" I muttered. \"I'll give you eighteen months.\" \"No deal,\" he said, grinning. \"I like this condition.\" \"Fine. I'll have Carlisle do it when I graduate.\" \"If that's what you really want.\" He shrugged, and his smile became absolutely angelic. \"You're impossible,\" I groaned. \"A monster.\" He chuckled. \"Is that why you won't marry me?\" I groaned again. He leaned toward me; his night-dark eyes melted and smoldered and shattered my concentration. \" Please, Bella?\" he breathed. I forgot how to breathe for a moment. When I recovered, I shook my head quickly, trying to clear my suddenly clouded mind. \"Would this have gone better if I d had time to get a ring.'\" \"No! No rings!\" I very nearly shouted. \"Now you've done it,\" he whispered. \"Oops.\" \"Charlie's getting up; I'd better leave,\" Edward said with resignation. My heart stopped beating. He gauged my expression for a second. \"Would it be childish of me to hide in your closet, then?\" \"No,\" I whispered eagerly. \"Stay. Please.\" Edward smiled and disappeared. I seethed in the darkness as I waited for Charlie to check on me. Edward knew exactly what he was doing, and I was willing to bet that all the injured surprise was part of the ploy. Of course, I still had the Carlisle option, but now that I knew there was a chance that Edward would change me himself, I wanted it bad. He was such a cheater. My door cracked open. \"Morning, Dad.\" \"Oh, hey, Bella.\" He sounded embarrassed at getting caught. \"I didn't know you were awake.\" \"Yeah. I've just been waiting for you to wake up so I could take a shower.\" I started to get up. \"Hold on,\" Charlie said, flipping the light on. I blinked in the sudden brightness, and carefully kept my eyes away from the closet. \"Let's talk for a minute first.\" I couldn't control my grimace. I'd forgotten to ask Alice for a good excuse. \"You know you're in trouble.\" \"Yeah, I know.\" \"I just about went crazy these last three days. I come home from Harry's funeral, and you're gone.\u00a0 Jacob could only tell me that you'd run off with Alice Cullen, and that he thought you were in trouble.\u00a0 You didn't leave me a number, and you didn't call. I didn't know where you were or when\u2014or if\u2014you were coming back. Do you have any idea how\u2026 how\u2026\" He couldn't finish the sentence. He sucked in a sharp breath and moved on. \"Can you give me one reason why I shouldn't ship you off to Jacksonville this second?\" My eyes narrowed. So it was going to be threats, was it? Two could play at that game. I sat up, pulling the quilt around me. \"Because I won't go.\" \"Now just one minute, young lady\u2014\" \"Look, Dad, I accept complete responsibility for my actions, and you have the right to ground me for as long as you want. I will also do all the chores and laundry and dishes until you think I've learned my lesson. And I guess you're within your rights if you want to kick me out, too\u2014but that won't make me to go to Florida.\" His face turned bright red. He took a few deep breaths before he answered. \"Would you like to explain where you've been?\" Oh, crap. \"There was\u2026 an emergency.\" He raised his eyebrows in expectation of my brilliant explanation. I filled my cheeks with air and then blew it out noisily. \"I don't know what to tell you, Dad. It was mostly a misunderstanding. He said, she said. It got out of hand.\" He waited with a distrustful expression. \"See, Alice told Rosalie about me jumping off the cliff\u2026\" I was scrambling frantically to make this work, to keep it as close to the truth as possible so that my inability to lie convincingly would not undermine the excuse, but before I could go on, Charlie's expression reminded me that he didn't know anything about the cliff. Major oops. As if I wasn't already toast. \"I guess I didn't tell you about that,\" I choked out. \"It was nothing. Just messing around, swimming with Jake. Anyway, Rosalie told Edward, and he was upset. She sort of accidentally made it sound like I was trying to kill myself or something. He wouldn't answer his phone, so Alice dragged me to\u2026 L.A., to explain in person.\" I shrugged, desperately hoping that he would not be so distracted by my slip that he'd miss the brilliant explanation I'd provided. Charlie's face was frozen. \"Were you trying to kill yourself, Bella?\" \"No, of course not. Just having fun with Jake. Cliff diving. The La Push kids do it all the time. Like I said, nothing.\" Charlie's face heated up\u2014from frozen to hot with fury. \"What's it to Edward Cullen anyway?\" he barked. \"All this time, he's just left you dangling without a word\u2014\" I interrupted him. \"Another misunderstanding.\" His face flushed again. \"So is he back then?\" \"I'm not sure what the exact plan is. I think they all are.\" He shook his head, the vein in his forehead pulsing. \"I want you to stay away from him, Bella. I don't trust him. He's rotten for you. I won't let him mess you up like that again.\" \"Fine,\" I said curtly. Charlie rocked back onto his heels. \"Oh.\" He scrambled for a second, exhaling loudly in surprise. \"I thought you were going to be difficult.\" \"I am.\" I stared straight into his eyes. \"I meant, 'Fine, I'll move out.'\" His eyes bulged; his face turned puce. My resolve wavered as I started to worry about his health. He was no younger than Harry\u2026 \"Dad, I don't want to move out,\" I said in a softer tone. \"I love you. I know you're worried, but you need to trust me on this. And you're going to have to ease up on Edward if you want me to stay. Do you want me to live here or not?\" \"That's not fair, Bella. You know I want you to stay.\" \"Then be nice to Edward, because he's going to be where I am.\" I said it with confidence. The conviction of my epiphany was still strong. \"Not under my roof,\" Charlie stormed. I sighed a heavy sigh. \"Look, I'm not going to give you any more ultimatums tonight\u2014or I guess it's this morning. Just think about it for a few days, okay? But keep in mind that Edward and I are sort of a package deal.\" \"Bella\u2014\" \"Think it over,\" I insisted. \"And while you're doing that, could you give me some privacy? I really need a shower.\" Charlie's face was a strange shade of purple, but he left, slamming the door behind him. I heard him stomp furiously down the stairs. I threw off my quilt, and Edward was already there, sitting in the rocking chair as if he d been present through the whole conversation. \"Sorry about that,\" I whispered. \"It's not as if I don't deserve far worse,\" he murmured. \"Don't start anything with Charlie over me, please.\" \"Don't worry about it,\" I breathed as I gathered up my bathroom things and a set of clean clothes. \"I will start exactly as much as is necessary, and no more than that. Or are you trying to tell me I have nowhere to go?\" I widened my eyes with false alarm. \"You'd move in with a house full of vampires?\" \"That's probably the safest place for someone like me. Besides\u2026\" I grinned. \"If Charlie kicks me out, then there's no need for a graduation deadline, is there?\" His jaw tightened. \"So eager for eternal damnation,\" he muttered. \"You know you don't really believe that.\" \"Oh, don't I?\" he fumed. \"No. You don't.\" He glowered at me and started to speak, but I cut him off. \"If you really believed that you'd lost your soul, then when I found you in Volterra, you would have realized immediately what was happening, instead of thinking we were both dead together. But you didn't\u2014you said 'Amazing. Carlisle was right,'\" I reminded him, triumphant. \"There's hope in you, after all.\" For once, Edward was speechless. \"So let's both just be hopeful, all right?\" I suggested. \"Not that it matters. If you stay, I don't need heaven.\" He got up slowly, and came to put his hands on either side of my face as he stared into my eyes. \"Forever,\" he vowed, still a little staggered. \"That's all I'm asking for,\" I said, and stretched up on my toes so that I could press my lips to his.",

            "en": "12        12. BALANCING \"Billy!\" Charlie called as soon as he got out of the car. I turned toward the house, beckoning to Jacob as I ducked under the porch. I heard Charlie greeting them loudly behind me. \"I'm going to pretend I didn't see you behind the wheel, Jake,\" he said disapprovingly. \"We get permits early on the rez,\" Jacob said while I unlocked the door and flicked on the porch light. \"Sure you do,\" Charlie laughed. \"I have to get around somehow.\" I recognized Billy's resonant voice easily, despite the years. The sound of it made me feel suddenly younger, a child. I went inside, leaving the door open behind me and turning on lights before I hung up my jacket. Then I stood in the door, watching anxiously as Charlie and Jacob helped Billy out of the car and into his wheelchair. I backed out of the way as the three of them hurried in, shaking off the rain. \"This is a surprise,\" Charlie was saying. \"It's been too long,\" Billy answered. \"I hope it's not a bad time.\" His dark eyes flashed up to me again, their expression unreadable. \"No, it's great. I hope you can stay for the game.\" Jacob grinned. \"I think that's the plan \u2014 our TV broke last week.\" Billy made a face at his son. \"And, of course, Jacob was anxious to see Bella again,\" he added. Jacob scowled and ducked his head while I fought back a surge of remorse. Maybe I'd been too convincing on the beach. \"Are you hungry?\" I asked, turning toward the kitchen. I was eager to escape Billy's searching gaze. \"Naw, we ate just before we came,\" Jacob answered. \"How about you, Charlie?\" I called over my shoulder as I fled around the corner. \"Sure,\" he replied, his voice moving in the direction of the front room and the TV. I could hear Billy's chair follow. The grilled cheese sandwiches were in the frying pan and I was slicing up a tomato when I sensed someone behind me. \"So, how are things?\" Jacob asked. \"Pretty good.\" I smiled. His enthusiasm was hard to resist. \"How about you? Did you finish your car?\" \"No.\" He frowned. \"I still need parts. We borrowed that one.\" He pointed with his thumb in the direction of the front yard. \"Sorry. I haven't seen any\u2026 what was it you were looking for?\" \"Master cylinder.\" He grinned. \"Is something wrong with the truck?\" he added suddenly. \"No.\" \"Oh. I just wondered because you weren't driving it.\" I stared down at the pan, pulling up the edge of a sandwich to check the bottom side. \"I got a ride with a friend.\" \"Nice ride.\" Jacob's voice was admiring. \"I didn't recognize the driver, though. I thought I knew most of the kids around here.\" I nodded noncommittally, keeping my eyes down as I flipped sandwiches. \"My dad seemed to know him from somewhere.\" \"Jacob, could you hand me some plates? They're in the cupboard over the sink.\" \"Sure.\" He got the plates in silence. I hoped he would let it drop now. \"So who was it?\" he asked, setting two plates on the counter next to me. I sighed in defeat. \"Edward Cullen.\" To my surprise, he laughed. I glanced up at him. He looked a little embarrassed. \"Guess that explains it, then,\" he said. \"I wondered why my dad was acting so strange.\" \"That's right.\" I faked an innocent expression. \"He doesn't like the Cullens.\" \"Superstitious old man,\" Jacob muttered under his breath. \"You don't think he'd say anything to Charlie?\" I couldn't help asking, the words coming out in a low rush.  Jacob stared at me for a moment, and I couldn't read the expression in his dark eyes. \"I doubt it,\" he finally answered. \"I think Charlie chewed him out pretty good last time. They haven't spoken much since \u2014 tonight is sort of a reunion, I think. I don't think he'd bring it up again.\" \"Oh,\" I said, trying to sound indifferent. I stayed in the front room after I carried the food out to Charlie, pretending to watch the game while Jacob chattered at me. I was really listening to the men's conversation, watching for any sign that Billy was about to rat me out, trying to think of ways to stop him if he began. It was a long night. I had a lot of homework that was going undone, but I was afraid to leave Billy alone with Charlie. Finally, the game ended. \"Are you and your friends coming back to the beach soon?\" Jacob asked as he pushed his father over the lip of the threshold. \"I'm not sure,\" I hedged. \"That was fun, Charlie,\" Billy said. \"Come up for the next game,\" Charlie encouraged. \"Sure, sure,\" Billy said. \"We'll be here. Have a good night.\" His eyes shifted to mine, and his smile disappeared. \"You take care, Bella,\" he added seriously. \"Thanks,\" I muttered, looking away. I headed for the stairs while Charlie waved from the doorway. \"Wait, Bella,\" he said. I cringed. Had Billy gotten something in before I'd joined them in the living room? But Charlie was relaxed, still grinning from the unexpected visit. \"I didn't get a chance to talk to you tonight. How was your day?\" \"Good.\" I hesitated with one foot on the first stair, searching for details I could safely share. \"My badminton team won all four games.\" \"Wow, I didn't know you could play badminton.\" \"Well, actually I can't, but my partner is really good,\" I admitted . \"Who is it?\" he asked with token interest. \"Um\u2026 Mike Newton,\" I told him reluctantly. \"Oh yeah \u2014 you said you were friends with the Newton kid.\" He perked up. \"Nice family.\" He mused for a minute. \"Why didn't you ask him to the dance this weekend?\" \"Dad!\" I groaned. \"He's kind of dating my friend Jessica. Besides, you know I can't dance.\" \"Oh yeah,\" he muttered. Then he smiled at me apologetically. \"So I guess it's good you'll be gone Saturday\u2026 I've made plans to go fishing with the guys from the station. The weather's supposed to be real warm. But if you wanted to put your trip off till someone could go with you, I'd stay home. I know I leave you here alone too much.\" \"Dad, you're doing a great job.\" I smiled, hoping my relief didn't show. \"I've never minded being alone \u2014 I'm too much like you.\" I winked at him, and he smiled his crinkly-eyed smile. I slept better that night, too tired to dream again. When I woke to the pearl gray morning, my mood was blissful. The tense evening with Billy and Jacob seemed harmless enough now; I decided to forget it completely.  I caught myself whistling while I was pulling the front part of my hair back into a barrette, and later again as I skipped down the stairs. Charlie noticed. \"You're cheerful this morning,\" he commented over breakfast. I shrugged. \"It's Friday.\" I hurried so I would be ready to go the second Charlie left. I had my bag ready, shoes on, teeth brushed, but even though I rushed to the door as soon as I was sure Charlie would be out of sight, Edward was faster. He was waiting in his shiny car, windows down, engine off. I didn't hesitate this time, climbing in the passenger side quickly, the sooner to see his face. He grinned his crooked smile at me, stopping my breath and my heart. I couldn't imagine how an angel could be any more glorious. There was nothing about him that could be improved upon. \"How did you sleep?\" he asked. I wondered if he had any idea how appealing his voice was. \"Fine. How was your night?\" \"Pleasant.\" His smile was amused; I felt like I was missing an inside joke. \"Can I ask what you did?\" I asked. \"No.\" He grinned. \"Today is still mine.\" He wanted to know about people today: more about Ren\u00e9e, her hobbies, what we'd done in our free time together. And then the one grandmother I'd known, my few school friends \u2014 embarrassing me when he asked about boys I'd dated. I was relieved that I'd never really dated anyone, so that particular conversation couldn't last long. He seemed as surprised as Jessica and Angela by my lack of romantic history. \"So you never met anyone you wanted?\" he asked in a serious tone that made me wonder what he was thinking about. I was grudgingly honest. \"Not in Phoenix.\" His lips pressed together into a hard line. We were in the cafeteria at this point. The day had sped by in the blur that was rapidly becoming routine. I took advantage of his brief pause to take a bite of my bagel. \"I should have let you drive yourself today,\" he announced, apropos of nothing, while I chewed. \"Why?\" I demanded. \"I'm leaving with Alice after lunch.\" \"Oh.\" I blinked, bewildered and disappointed. \"That's okay, it's not that far of a walk.\" He frowned at me impatiently. \"I'm not going to make you walk home. We'll go get your truck and leave it here for you.\" \"I don't have my key with me,\" I sighed. \"I really don't mind walking.\" What I minded was losing my time with him. He shook his head. \"Your truck will be here, and the key will be in the ignition \u2014 unless you're afraid someone might steal it.\" He laughed at the thought. \"All right,\" I agreed, pursing my lips. I was pretty sure my key was in the pocket of a pair of jeans I wore Wednesday, under a pile of clothes in the laundry room. Even if he broke into my house, or whatever he was planning, he'd never find it. He seemed to feel the challenge in my consent. He smirked, overconfident. \"So where are you going?\" I asked as casually as I could manage. \"Hunting,\" he answered grimly. \"If I'm going to be alone with you tomorrow, I'm going to take whatever precautions I can.\" His face grew morose\u2026 and pleading. \"You can always cancel, you know.\" I looked down, afraid of the persuasive power of his eyes. I refused to be convinced to fear him, no matter how real the danger might be. It doesn't matter, I repeated in my head.  \"No,\" I whispered, glancing back at his face. \"I can't.\" \"Perhaps you're right,\" he murmured bleakly. His eyes seemed to darken in color as I watched. I changed the subject. \"What time will I see you tomorrow?\" I asked, already depressed by the thought of him leaving now. \"That depends\u2026 it's a Saturday, don't you want to sleep in?\" he offered. \"No,\" I answered too fast. He restrained a smile.  \"The same time as usual, then,\" he decided. \"Will Charlie be there?\" \"No, he's fishing tomorrow.\" I beamed at the memory of how conveniently things had worked out. His voice turned sharp. \"And if you don't come home, what will he think?\" \"I have no idea,\" I answered <em>coolly</em>. \"He knows I've been meaning to do the laundry. Maybe he'll think I fell in the washer.\" He scowled at me and I scowled back. His anger was much more impressive than mine. \"What are you hunting tonight?\" I asked when I was sure I had lost the glowering contest. \"Whatever we find in the park. We aren't going far.\" He seemed bemused by my casual reference to his secret realities. \"Why are you going with Alice?\" I wondered. \"Alice is the most\u2026 supportive.\" He frowned as he spoke. \"And the others?\" I asked timidly. \"What are they?\" His brow puckered for a brief moment. \"Incredulous, for the most part.\" I peeked quickly behind me at his family. They sat staring off in different directions, exactly the same as the first time I'd seen them. Only now they were four; their beautiful, bronze-haired brother sat across from me, his golden eyes troubled. \"They don't like me,\" I guessed. \"That's not it,\" he disagreed, but his eyes were too innocent. \"They don't understand why I can't leave you alone.\" I grimaced. \"Neither do I, for that matter.\" Edward shook his head slowly, rolling his eyes toward the ceiling before he met my gaze again. \"I told you \u2014 you don't see yourself clearly at all. You're not like anyone I've ever known. You fascinate me.\" I glared at him, sure he was teasing now. He smiled as he deciphered my expression. \"Having the advantages I do,\" he murmured, touching his forehead discreetly, \"I have a better than average grasp of human nature. People are predictable. But you\u2026 you never do what I expect. You always take me by surprise.\" I looked away, my eyes wandering back to his family, embarrassed and dissatisfied. His words made me feel like a science experiment. I wanted to laugh at myself for expecting anything else. \"That part is easy enough to explain,\" he continued. I felt his eyes on my face but I couldn't look at him yet, afraid he might read the chagrin in my eyes. \"But there's more\u2026 and it's not so easy to put into words \u2014\" I was still staring at the Cullens while he spoke. Suddenly Rosalie, his blond and breathtaking sister, turned to look at me. No, not to look \u2014 to glare, with dark, cold eyes. I wanted to look away, but her gaze held me until Edward broke off mid-sentence and made an angry noise under his breath. It was almost a hiss. Rosalie turned her head, and I was relieved to be free. I looked back at Edward \u2014 and I knew he could see the confusion and fear that widened my eyes. His face was tight as he explained. \"I'm sorry about that. She's just worried. You see\u2026 it's dangerous for more than just me if, after spending so much time with you so publicly\u2026\" He looked down. \"If?\" \"If this ends\u2026 badly.\" He dropped his head into his hands, as he had that night in Port Angeles. His anguish was plain; I yearned to comfort him, but I was at a loss to know how.  My hand reached toward him involuntarily; quickly, though, I dropped it to the table, fearing that my touch would only make things worse. I realized slowly that his words should frighten me. I waited for that fear to come, but all I could seem to feel was an ache for his pain. And frustration \u2014 frustration that Rosalie had interrupted whatever he was about to say. I didn't know how to bring it up again. He still had his head in his hands. I tried to speak in a normal voice. \"And you have to leave now?\" \"Yes.\" He raised his face; it was serious for a moment, and then his mood shifted and he smiled. \"It's probably for the best. We still have fifteen minutes of that wretched movie left to endure in Biology \u2014 I don't think I could take any more.\" I started. Alice \u2014 her short, inky hair in a halo of spiky disarray around her exquisite, elfin face \u2014 was suddenly standing behind his shoulder. Her slight frame was willowy, graceful even in absolute stillness. He greeted her without looking away from me. \"Alice.\" \"Edward,\" she answered, her high soprano voice almost as attractive as his. \"Alice, Bella \u2014 Bella, Alice,\" he introduced us, gesturing casually with his hand, a wry smile on his face. \"Hello, Bella.\" Her brilliant obsidian eyes were unreadable, but her smile was friendly. \"It's nice to finally meet you.\" Edward flashed a dark look at her. \"Hi, Alice,\" I murmured shyly. \"Are you ready?\" she asked him. His voice was aloof. \"Nearly. I'll meet you at the car.\" She left without another word; her walk was so fluid, so sinuous that I felt a sharp pang of jealousy. \"Should I say 'have fun,' or is that the wrong sentiment?\" I asked, turning back to him. \"No, 'have fun' works as well as anything.\" He grinned. \"Have fun, then.\" I worked to sound wholehearted. Of course I didn't fool him. \"I'll try.\" He still grinned. \"And you try to be safe, please.\" \"Safe in Forks \u2014 what a challenge.\" \"For you it is a challenge.\" His jaw hardened. \"Promise.\" \"I promise to try to be safe,\" I recited. \"I'll do the laundry tonight \u2014 that ought to be fraught with peril.\" \"Don't fall in,\" he mocked. \"I'll do my best.\" He stood then, and I rose, too. \"I'll see you tomorrow,\" I sighed. \"It seems like a long time to you, doesn't it?\" he mused. I nodded glumly.  \"I'll be there in the morning,\" he promised, smiling his crooked smile. He reached across the table to touch my face, lightly brushing along my cheekbone again. Then he turned and walked away. I stared after him until he was gone. I was sorely tempted to ditch the rest of the day, at the very least Gym, but a warning instinct stopped me. I knew that if I disappeared now, Mike and others would assume I was with Edward. And Edward was worried about the time we'd spent together publicly\u2026 if things went wrong. I refused to dwell on the last thought, concentrating instead on making things safer for him. I intuitively knew \u2014 and sensed he did, too \u2014 that tomorrow would be pivotal. Our relationship couldn't continue to balance, as it did, on the point of a knife. We would fall off one edge or the other, depending entirely upon his decision, or his instincts. My decision was made, made before I'd ever consciously chosen, and I was committed to seeing it through. Because there was nothing more terrifying to me, more excruciating, than the thought of turning away from him. It was an impossibility. I went to class, feeling dutiful. I couldn't honestly say what happened in Biology; my mind was too preoccupied with thoughts of tomorrow. In Gym, Mike was speaking to me again; he wished me a good time in Seattle. I carefully explained that I'd canceled my trip, worried about my truck.  \"Are you going to the dance with Cullen?\" he asked, suddenly sulky. \"No, I'm not going to the dance at all.\" \"What are you doing, then?\" he asked, too interested. My natural urge was to tell him to butt out. Instead, I lied brightly. \"Laundry, and then I have to study for the Trig test or I'm going to fail.\" \"Is Cullen helping you study?\" \"Edward,\" I emphasized, \"is not going to help me study. He's gone away somewhere for the weekend.\" The lies came more naturally than usual, I noted with surprise. \"Oh.\" He perked up. \"You know, you could come to the dance with our group anyway \u2014 that would be cool. We'd all dance with you,\" he promised. The mental image of Jessica's face made my tone sharper than necessary. \"I'm not going to the dance, Mike, okay?\" \"Fine.\" He sulked again. \"I was just offering.\" When the school day had finally ended, I walked to the parking lot without enthusiasm. I did not especially want to walk home, but I couldn't see how he would have retrieved my truck.  Then again, I was starting to believe that nothing was impossible for him. The latter instinct proved correct \u2014 my truck sat in the same space he'd parked his Volvo in this morning. I shook my head, incredulous, as I opened the unlocked door and saw the key in the ignition. There was a piece of white paper folded on my seat. I got in and closed the door before I unfolded it. Two words were written in his elegant script. Be safe. The sound of the truck roaring to life frightened me. I laughed at myself. When I got home, the handle of the door was locked, the dead bolt unlocked, just as I'd left it this morning. Inside, I went straight to the laundry room. It looked just the same as I'd left it, too. I dug for my jeans and, after finding them, checked the pockets. Empty. Maybe I'd hung my key up after all, I thought, shaking my head. Following the same instinct that had prompted me to lie to Mike, I called Jessica on the pretense of wishing her luck at the dance. When she offered the same wish for my day with Edward, I told her about the cancellation. She was more disappointed than really necessary for a third-party observer to be. I said goodbye quickly after that. Charlie was absentminded at dinner, worried over something at work, I guessed, or maybe a basketball game, or maybe he was just really enjoying the lasagna \u2014 it was hard to tell with Charlie. \"You know, Dad\u2026\" I began, breaking into his reverie. \"What's that, Bell?\" \"I think you're right about Seattle. I think I'll wait until Jessica or someone else can go with me.\" \"Oh,\" he said, surprised. \"Oh, okay. So, do you want me to stay home?\" \"No, Dad, don't change your plans. I've got a million things to do\u2026 homework, laundry\u2026 I need to go to the library and the grocery store. I'll be in and out all day\u2026 you go and have fun.\" \"Are you sure?\" \"Absolutely, Dad. Besides, the freezer is getting dangerously low on fish \u2014 we're down to a two, maybe three years' supply.\" \"You're sure easy to live with, Bella.\" He smiled. \"I could say the same thing about you,\" I said, laughing. The sound of my laughter was off, but he didn't seem to notice. I felt so guilty for deceiving him that I almost took Edward's advice and told him where I would be. Almost. After dinner, I folded clothes and moved another load through the dryer. Unfortunately it was the kind of job that only keeps hands busy. My mind definitely had too much free time, and it was getting out of control. I fluctuated between anticipation so intense that it was very nearly pain, and an insidious fear that picked at my resolve. I had to keep reminding myself that I'd made my choice, and I wasn't going back on it. I pulled his note out of my pocket much more often than necessary to absorb the two small words he'd written. He wants me to be safe, I told myself again and again. I would just hold on to the faith that, in the end, that desire would win out over the others. And what was my other choice \u2014 to cut him out of my life? Intolerable. Besides, since I'd come to Forks, it really seemed like my life was about him. But a tiny voice in the back of my mind worried, wondering if it would hurt very much\u2026 if it ended badly. I was relieved when it was late enough to be acceptable for bedtime. I knew I was far too stressed to sleep, so I did something I'd never done before. I deliberately took unnecessary cold medicine \u2014 the kind that knocked me out for a good eight hours. I normally wouldn't condone that type of behavior in myself, but tomorrow would be complicated enough without me being loopy from sleep deprivation on top of everything else. While I waited for the drugs to kick in, I dried my clean hair till it was impeccably straight, and fussed over what I would wear tomorrow. With everything ready for the morning, I finally lay in my bed. I felt hyper; I couldn't stop twitching. I got up and rifled through my shoebox of CDs until I found a collection of Chopin's nocturnes. I put that on very quietly and then lay down again, concentrating on relaxing individual parts of my body. Somewhere in the middle of that exercise, the cold pills took effect, and I gladly sank into unconsciousness.  I woke early, having slept soundly and dreamlessly thanks to my gratuitous drug use. Though I was well rested, I slipped right back into the same hectic frenzy from the night before. I dressed in a rush, smoothing my collar against my neck, fidgeting with the tan sweater till it hung right over my jeans. I sneaked a swift look out the window to see that Charlie was already gone. A thin, cottony layer of clouds veiled the sky. They didn't look very lasting. I ate breakfast without tasting the food, hurrying to clean up when I was done. I peeked out the window again, but nothing had changed. I had just finished brushing my teeth and was heading back downstairs when a quiet knock sent my heart thudding against my rib cage. I flew to the door; I had a little trouble with the simple dead bolt, but I yanked the door open at last, and there he was. All the agitation dissolved as soon as I looked at his face, calm taking its place. I breathed a sigh of relief \u2014 yesterday's fears seemed very foolish with him here. He wasn't smiling at first \u2014 his face was somber. But then his expression lightened as he looked me over, and he laughed.  \"Good morning,\" he chuckled. \"What's wrong?\" I glanced down to make sure I hadn't forgotten anything important, like shoes, or pants. \"We match.\" He laughed again. I realized he had a long, light tan sweater on, with a white collar showing underneath, and blue jeans. I laughed with him, hiding a secret twinge of regret \u2014 why did he have to look like a runway model when I couldn't? I locked the door behind me while he walked to the truck. He waited by the passenger door with a martyred expression that was easy to understand. \"We made a deal,\" I reminded him smugly, climbing into the driver's seat, and reaching over to unlock his door. \"Where to?\" I asked. \"Put your seat belt on \u2014 I'm nervous already.\" I gave him a dirty look as I complied. \"Where to?\" I repeated with a sigh. \"Take the one-on-one north,\" he ordered. It was surprisingly difficult to concentrate on the road while feeling his gaze on my face. I compensated by driving more carefully than usual through the still-sleeping town. \"Were you planning to make it out of Forks before nightfall?\" \"This truck is old enough to be your car's grandfather \u2014 have some respect,\" I retorted. We were soon out of the town limits, despite his negativity. Thick underbrush and green-swathed trunks replaced the lawns and houses. \"Turn right on the one-ten,\" he instructed just as I was about to ask. I obeyed silently. \"Now we drive until the pavement ends.\" I could hear a smile in his voice, but I was too afraid of driving off the road and proving him right to look over and be sure. \"And what's there, at the pavement's end?\" I wondered. \"A trail.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \"We're hiking?\" Thank goodness I'd worn tennis shoes. \"Is that a problem?\" He sounded as if he'd expected as much. \"No.\" I tried to make the lie sound confident. But if he thought my truck was slow\u2026 \"Don't worry, it's only five miles or so, and we're in no hurry.\" Five miles. I didn't answer, so that he wouldn't hear my voice crack in panic. Five miles of treacherous roots and loose stones, trying to twist my ankles or otherwise incapacitate me. This was going to be humiliating. We drove in silence for a while as I contemplated the coming horror. \"What are you thinking?\" he asked impatiently after a few moments. I lied again. \"Just wondering where we're going.\" \"It's a place I like to go when the weather is nice.\" We both glanced out the windows at the thinning clouds after he spoke. \"Charlie said it would be warm today.\" \"And did you tell Charlie what you were up to?\" he asked. \"Nope.\" \"But Jessica thinks we're going to Seattle together?\" He seemed cheered by the idea. \"No, I told her you canceled on me \u2014 which is true.\" \"No one knows you're with me?\" Angrily, now. \"That depends\u2026 I assume you told Alice?\" \"That's very helpful, Bella,\" he snapped. I pretended I didn't hear that. \"Are you so depressed by Forks that it's made you suicidal?\" he demanded when I ignored him. \"You said it might cause trouble for you\u2026 us being together publicly,\" I reminded him. \"So you're worried about the trouble it might cause me\u2014 if you don't come home?\" His voice was still angry, and bitingly sarcastic. I nodded, keeping my eyes on the road. He muttered something under his breath, speaking so quickly that I couldn't understand. We were silent for the rest of the drive. I could feel the waves of infuriated disapproval rolling off of him, and I could think of nothing to say. And then the road ended, constricting to a thin foot trail with a small wooden marker. I parked on the narrow shoulder and stepped out, afraid because he was angry with me and I didn't have driving as an excuse not to look at him. It was warm now, warmer than it had been in Forks since the day I'd arrived, almost muggy under the clouds. I pulled off my sweater and knotted it around my waist, glad that I'd worn the light, sleeveless shirt \u2014 especially if I had five miles of hiking ahead of me. I heard his door slam, and looked over to see that he'd removed his sweater, too. He was facing away from me, into the unbroken forest beside my truck. \"This way,\" he said, glancing over his shoulder at me, eyes still annoyed. He started into the dark forest. \"The trail?\" Panic was clear in my voice as I hurried around the truck to catch up to him. \"I said there was a trail at the end of the road, not that we were taking it.\" \"No trail?\" I asked desperately. \"I won't let you get lost.\" He turned then, with a mocking smile, and I stifled a gasp. His white shirt was sleeveless, and he wore it unbuttoned, so that the smooth white skin of his throat flowed uninterrupted over the marble contours of his chest, his perfect musculature no longer merely hinted at behind concealing clothes. He was too perfect, I realized with a piercing stab of despair. There was no way this godlike creature could be meant for me. He stared at me, bewildered by my tortured expression. \"Do you want to go home?\" he said quietly, a different pain than mine saturating his voice. \"No.\" I walked forward till I was close beside him, anxious not to waste one second of whatever time I might have with him. \"What's wrong?\" he asked, his voice gentle. \"I'm not a good hiker,\" I answered dully. \"You'll have to be very patient.\" \"I can be patient \u2014 if I make a great effort.\" He smiled, holding my glance, trying to lift me out of my sudden, unexplained dejection. I tried to smile back, but the smile was unconvincing. He scrutinized my face. \"I'll take you home,\" he promised. I couldn't tell if the promise was unconditional, or restricted to an immediate departure. I knew he thought it was fear that upset me, and I was grateful again that I was the one person whose mind he couldn't hear. \"If you want me to hack five miles through the jungle before sundown, you'd better start leading the way,\" I said acidly. He frowned at me, struggling to understand my tone and expression. He gave up after a moment and led the way into the forest. It wasn't as hard as I had feared. The way was mostly flat, and he held the damp ferns and webs of moss aside for me. When his straight path took us over fallen trees or boulders, he would help me, lifting me by the elbow, and then releasing me instantly when I was clear. His cold touch on my skin never failed to make my heart thud erratically. Twice, when that happened, I caught a look on his face that made me sure he could somehow hear it. I tried to keep my eyes away from his perfection as much as possible, but I slipped often. Each time, his beauty pierced me through with sadness. For the most part, we walked in silence. Occasionally he would ask a random question that he hadn't gotten to in the past two days of interrogation. He asked about my birthdays, my grade school teachers, my childhood pets \u2014 and I had to admit that after killing three fish in a row, I'd given up on the whole institution. He laughed at that, louder than I was used to \u2014 bell-like echoes bouncing back to us from the empty woods. The hike took me most of the morning, but he never showed any sign of impatience. The forest spread out around us in a boundless labyrinth of ancient trees, and I began to be nervous that we would never find our way out again. He was perfectly at ease, comfortable in the green maze, never seeming to feel any doubt about our direction. After several hours, the light that filtered through the canopy transformed, the murky olive tone shifting to a brighter jade. The day had turned sunny, just as he'd foretold. For the first time since we'd entered the woods, I felt a thrill of excitement \u2014 which quickly turned to impatience. \"Are we there yet?\" I teased, pretending to scowl. \"Nearly.\" He smiled at the change in my mood. \"Do you see the brightness ahead?\" I peered into the thick forest. \"Um, should I?\" He smirked. \"Maybe it's a bit soon for your eyes.\" \"Time to visit the optometrist,\" I muttered. His smirk grew more pronounced. But then, after another hundred yards, I could definitely see a lightening in the trees ahead, a glow that was yellow instead of green. I picked up the pace, my eagerness growing with every step. He let me lead now, following noiselessly. I reached the edge of the pool of light and stepped through the last fringe of ferns into the loveliest place I had ever seen. The meadow was small, perfectly round, and filled with wildflowers \u2014 violet, yellow, and soft white. Somewhere nearby, I could hear the bubbling music of a stream. The sun was directly overhead, filling the circle with a haze of buttery sunshine. I walked slowly, awestruck, through the soft grass, swaying flowers, and warm, gilded air. I halfway turned, wanting to share this with him, but he wasn't behind me where I thought he'd be. I spun around, searching for him with sudden alarm. Finally I spotted him, still under the dense shade of the canopy at the edge of the hollow, watching me with cautious eyes. Only then did I remember what the beauty of the meadow had driven from my mind \u2014 the enigma of Edward and the sun, which he'd promised to illustrate for me today. I took a step back toward him, my eyes alight with curiosity. His eyes were wary, reluctant. I smiled encouragingly and beckoned to him with my hand, taking another step back to him. He held up a hand in warning, and I hesitated, rocking back onto my heels. Edward seemed to take a deep breath, and then he stepped out into the bright glow of the midday sun.",
