            "en": "7 REPETITION        21 VERDICT WE WERE IN A BRIGHTLY LIT, UNREMARKABLE HALLWAY. The walls were off-white, the floor carpeted in industrial gray. Common rectangular fluorescent lights were spaced evenly along the ceiling. It was warmer here, for which I was grateful. This hall seemed very benign after the gloom of the ghoulish stone sewers. Edward didn't seem to agree with my assessment. He glowered darkly down the long hallway, toward the slight, black shrouded figure at the end, standing by an elevator. He pulled me along, and Alice walked on my other side. The heavy door creaked shut behind us, and then there was the thud of a bolt sliding home.\u00a0 Jane waited by the elevator, one hand holding the doors open for us. Her expression was apathetic. Once inside the elevator, the three vampires that belonged to the Volturi relaxed further. They threw back their cloaks, letting the hoods fall back on their shoulders. Felix and Demetri were both of a slightly olive complexion\u2014it looked odd combined with their chalky pallor. Felix's black hair was cropped short, but Demetri's waved to his shoulders. Their irises were deep crimson around the edges, darkening until they were black around the pupil. Under the shrouds, their clothes were modern, pale, and nondescript. I cowered in the corner, cringing against Edward. His hand still rubbed against my arm. He never took his eyes off Jane. The elevator ride was short; we stepped out into what looked like a posh office reception area. The walls were paneled in wood, the floors carpeted in thick, deep green. There were no windows, but large, brightly lit paintings of the Tuscan countryside hung everywhere as replacements. Pale leather couches were arranged in cozy groupings, and the glossy tables held crystal vases full of vibrantly colored bouquets. The flowers' smell reminded me of a funeral home.  In the middle of the room was a high, polished mahogany counter. I gawked in astonishment at the woman behind it. She was tall, with dark skin and green eyes. She would have been very pretty in any other company\u2014but not here. Because she was every bit as human as I was. I couldn't comprehend what this human woman was doing here, totally at ease, surrounded by vampires.  She smiled politely in welcome. \"Good afternoon, Jane,\" she said. There was no surprise in her face as she glanced at Jane's company. Not Edward, his bare chest glinting dimly in the white lights, or even me, disheveled and comparatively hideous. Jane nodded. \"Gianna.\" She continued toward a set of double doors in the back of the room, and we followed. As Felix passed the desk, he winked at Gianna, and she giggled. On the other side of the wooden doors was a different kind of reception. The pale boy in the pearl gray suit could have been Jane's twin. His hair was darker, and his lips were not as full, but he was just as lovely. He came forward to meet us. He smiled, reaching for her. \"Jane.\" \"Alec,\" she responded, embracing the boy. They kissed each other's cheeks on both sides. Then he looked at us. \"They send you out for one and you come back with two\u2026 and a half,\" he noted, looking at me. \"Nice work.\" She laughed\u2014the sound sparkled with delight like a baby's cooing. \"Welcome back, Edward,\" Alec greeted him. \"You seem in a better mood.\" \"Marginally,\" Edward agreed in a flat voice. I glanced at Edward's hard face, and wondered how his mood could have been darker before. Alec chuckled, and examined me as I clung to Edward's side. \"And this is the cause of all the trouble?\" he asked, skeptical. Edward only smiled, his expression contemptuous. Then he froze. \"Dibs,\" Felix called casually from behind. Edward turned, a low snarl building deep in his chest. Felix smiled\u2014his hand was raised, palm up; he curled his fingers twice, inviting Edward forward. Alice touched Edward's arm. \"Patience,\" she cautioned him. They exchanged a long glance, and I wished I could hear what she was telling him. I figured that it was something to do with not attacking Felix, because Edward took a deep breath and turned back to Alec. \"Aro will be so pleased to see you again,\" Alec said, as if nothing had passed. \"Let's not keep him waiting,\" Jane suggested. Edward nodded once. Alec and Jane, holding hands, led the way down yet another wide, ornate hall\u2014would there ever be an end? They ignored the doors at the end of the hall\u2014doors entirely sheathed in gold\u2014stopping halfway down the hall and sliding aside a piece of the paneling to expose a plain wooden door. It wasn't locked. Alec held it open for Jane. I wanted to groan when Edward pulled me through to the other side of the door. It was the same ancient stone as the square, the alley, and the sewers. And it was dark and cold again. The stone antechamber was not large. It opened quickly into a brighter, cavernous room, perfectly round like a huge castle turret\u2026 which was probably exactly what it was. Two stories up, long window slits threw thin rectangles of bright sunlight onto the stone floor below. There were no artificial lights. The only furniture in the room were several massive wooden chairs, like thrones, that were spaced <em>unevenly</em>, flush with the curving stone walls. In the very center of the circle, in a slight depression, was another drain. I wondered if they used it as an exit, like the hole in the street. The room was not empty. A handful of people were convened in seemingly relaxed conversation. The murmur of low, smooth voices was a gentle hum in the air. As I watched, a pair of pale women in summer dresses paused in a patch of light, and, like prisms, their skin threw the light in rainbow sparkles against the sienna walls. The exquisite faces all turned toward our party as we entered the room. Most of the immortals were dressed in inconspicuous pants and shirts\u2014things that wouldn't stick out at all on the streets below. But the man who spoke first wore one of the long robes. It was pitch-black, and brushed against the floor. For a moment, I thought his long, jet-black hair was the hood of his cloak. \"Jane, dear one, you've returned!\" he cried in evident delight. His voice was just a soft sighing. He drifted forward, and the movement flowed with such surreal grace that I gawked, my mouth hanging open. Even Alice, whose every motion looked like dancing, could not compare. I was only more astonished as he floated closer and I could see his face. It was not like the unnaturally attractive faces that surrounded him (for he did not approach us alone; the entire group converged around him, some following, and some walking ahead of him with the alert manner of bodyguards). I couldn't decide if his face was beautiful or not. I suppose the features were perfect.  But he was as different from the vampires beside him as they were from me. His skin was translucently white, like onionskin, and it looked just as delicate\u2014it stood in shocking contrast to the long black hair that framed his face. I felt a strange, horrifying urge to touch his cheek, to see if it was softer than Edward's or Alice's, or if it was powdery, like chalk. His eyes were red, the same as the others around him, but the color was clouded, milky; I wondered if his vision was affected by the haze. He glided to Jane, took her face in his papery hands, kissed her lightly on her full lips, and then floated back a step. \"Yes, Master.\" Jane smiled; the expression made her look like an angelic child. \"I brought him back alive, just as you wished.\" \"Ah, Jane.\" He smiled, too. \"You are such a comfort to me.\" He turned his misty eyes toward us, and the smile brightened\u2014became ecstatic. \"And Alice and Bella, too!\" he rejoiced, clapping his thin hands together. \"This is a happy surprise!  Wonderful!\" I stared in shock as he called our names informally, as if we were old friends dropping in for an unexpected visit. He turned to our hulking escort. \"Felix, be a dear and tell my brothers about our company. I'm sure they wouldn't want to miss this.\" \"Yes, Master.\" Felix nodded and disappeared back the way we had come. \"You see, Edward?\" The strange vampire turned and smiled at Edward like a fond but scolding grandfather. \"What did I tell you? Aren't you glad that I didn't give you what you wanted yesterday?\" \"Yes, Aro, I am,\" he agreed, tightening his arm around my waist. \"I love a happy ending.\" Aro sighed. \"They are so rare. But I want the whole story. How did this happen? Alice?\" He turned to gaze at Alice with curious, misty eyes. \"Your brother seemed to think you infallible, but apparently there was some mistake.\" \"Oh, I'm far from infallible.\" She flashed a dazzling smile. She looked perfectly at ease, except that her hands were balled into tight little fists. \"As you can see today, I cause problems as often as I cure them.\" \"You're too modest,\" Aro chided. \"I've seen some of your more amazing exploits, and I must admit I've never observed anything like your talent. Wonderful!\" Alice flickered a glance at Edward. Aro did not miss it. \"I'm sorry, we haven't been introduced properly at all, have we? It's just that I feel like I know you already, and I tend get ahead of myself. Your brother introduced us yesterday, in a peculiar way. You see, I share some of your brother's talent, only I am limited in a way that he is not.\" Aro shook his head; his tone was envious. \"And also exponentially more powerful,\" Edward added dryly. He looked at Alice as he swiftly explained. \"Aro needs physical contact to hear your thoughts, but he hears much more than I do. You know I can only hear what's passing through your head in the moment. Aro hears every thought your mind has ever had.\" Alice raised her delicate eyebrows, and Edward inclined his head. Aro didn't miss that either. \"But to be able to hear from a distance\u2026\" Aro sighed, gesturing toward the two of them, and the exchange that had just taken place. \"That would be so convenient.\" Aro looked over our shoulders. All the other heads turned in the same direction, including Jane, Alec, and Demetri, who stood silently beside us. I was the slowest to turn. Felix was back, and behind him floated two more black-robed men. Both looked very much like Aro, one even had the same flowing black hair. The other had a shock of snow-white hair\u2014the same shade as his face\u2014that brushed against his shoulders. Their faces had identical, paper-thin skin. The trio from Carlisle's painting was complete, unchanged by the last three hundred years since it was painted. \"Marcus, Caius, look!\" Aro crooned. \"Bella is alive after all, and Alice is here with her! Isn't that wonderful?\" Neither of the other two looked as if wonderful would be their first choice of words. The dark-haired man seemed utterly bored, like he'd seen too many millennia of Aro's enthusiasm. The other's face was sour under the snowy hair. Their lack of interest did not curb Aro's enjoyment. \"Let us have the story,\" Aro almost sang in his feathery voice. The white-haired ancient vampire drifted away, gliding toward one of the wooden thrones. The other paused beside Aro, and he reached his hand out, at first I thought to take Aro's hand. But he just touched Aro's palm briefly and then dropped his hand to his side. Aro raised one black brow. I wondered how his papery skin did not crumple in the effort. Edward snorted very quietly, and Alice looked at him, curious. \"Thank you, Marcus,\" Aro said. \"That's quite interesting.\" I realized, a second late, that Marcus was letting Aro know his thoughts. Marcus didn't look interested. He glided away from Aro to join the one who must be Caius, seated against the wall. Two of the attending vampires followed silently behind him\u2014bodyguards, like I'd thought before. I could see that the two women in the sundresses had gone to stand beside Caius in the same manner. The idea of any vampire needing a guard was faintly ridiculous to me, but maybe the ancient ones were as frail as their skin suggested. Aro was shaking his head. \"Amazing,\"' he said. \"Absolutely amazing.\" Alice's expression was frustrated. Edward turned to her and explained again in a swift, low voice.  \"Marcus sees relationships. He's surprised by the intensity of ours.\" Aro smiled. \"So convenient,\" he repeated to himself. Then he spoke to us. \"It takes quite a bit to surprise Marcus, I can assure you.\" I looked at Marcus's dead face, and I believed that. \"It's just so difficult to understand, even now,\" Aro mused, staring at Edward's arm wrapped around me. It was hard for me to follow Aro's chaotic train of thought. I struggled to keep up. \"How can you stand so close to her like that?\" \"It's not without effort,\" Edward answered calmly. \"But still\u2014la tua cantante! What a waste!\" Edward chuckled once without humor. \"I look at it more as a price.\" Aro was skeptical. \"A very high price.\" \"Opportunity cost.\" Aro laughed. \"If I hadn't smelled her through your memories, I wouldn't have believed the call of anyone's blood could be so strong. I've never felt anything like it myself. Most of us would trade much for such a gift, and yet you\u2026\" \"Waste it,\" Edward finished, his voice sarcastic now. Aro laughed again. \"Ah, how I miss my friend Carlisle! You remind me of him\u2014only he was not so angry.\" \"Carlisle outshines me in many other ways as well.\" \"I certainly never thought to see Carlisle bested for self-control of all things, but you put him to shame.\" \"Hardly.\" Edward sounded impatient. As if he were tired of the preliminaries. It made me more afraid; I couldn't help but try to imagine what he expected would follow. \"I am gratified by his success,\" Aro mused. \"Your memories of him are quite a gift for me, though they astonish me exceedingly. I am surprised by how it\u2026 pleases me, his success in this unorthodox path he's chosen. I expected that he would waste, weaken with time. I'd scoffed at his plan to find others who would share his peculiar vision. Yet, somehow, I'm happy to be wrong.\" Edward didn't reply. \"But your restraint!\" Aro sighed. \"I did not know such strength was possible. To inure yourself against such a siren call, not just once but again and again\u2014if I had not felt it myself, I would not have believed.\" Edward gazed back at Aro's admiration with no expression. I knew his face well enough\u2014time had not changed that\u2014to guess at something seething beneath the surface. I fought to keep my breathing even. \"Just remembering how she appeals to you\u2026\" Aro chuckled. \"It makes me thirsty.\" Edward tensed. \"Don't be disturbed,\" Aro reassured him. \"I mean her no harm. But I am so curious, about one thing in particular.\" He eyed me with bright interest. \"May I?\" he asked eagerly, lifting one hand. \"Ask her,\" Edward suggested in a flat voice. \"Of course, how rude of me!\" Aro exclaimed. \"Bella,\" he addressed me directly now. \"I'm fascinated that you are the one exception to Edward's impressive talent\u2014so very interesting that such a thing should occur! And I was wondering, since our talents are similar in many ways, if you would be so kind as to allow me to try\u2014to see if you are an exception for me, as well?\" My eyes flashed up to Edward's face in terror. Despite Aro's overt politeness, I didn't believe I really had a choice. I was horrified at the thought of allowing him to touch me, and yet also perversely intrigued by the chance to feel his strange skin. Edward nodded in encouragement\u2014whether because he was sure Aro would not hurt me, or because there was no choice, I couldn't tell. I turned back to Aro and raised my hand slowly in front of me. It was trembling. He glided closer, and I believe he meant his expression to be reassuring. But his papery features were too strange, too alien and frightening, to reassure. The look on his face was more confident than his words had been. Aro reached out, as if to shake my hand, and pressed his insubstantial-looking skin against mine. It was hard, but felt brittle\u2014shale rather than granite\u2014and even colder than I expected. His filmy eyes smiled down at mine, and it was impossible to look away. They were mesmerizing in an odd, unpleasant way. Aro's face altered as I watched. The confidence wavered and became first doubt, then incredulity before he calmed it into a friendly mask. \"So very interesting,\" he said as he released my hand and drifted back. My eyes flickered to Edward, and, though his face was composed, I thought he seemed a little smug. Aro continued to drift with a thoughtful expression. He was quiet for a moment, his eyes flickering between the three of us. Then, abruptly, he shook his head. \"A first,\" he said to himself \"I wonder if she is immune to our other talents\u2026 Jane, dear?\" \"No!\" Edward snarled the word. Alice grabbed his arm with a restraining hand. He shook her off. Little Jane smiled up happily at Aro. \"Yes, Master?\" Edward was truly snarling now, the sound ripping and tearing from him, glaring at Aro with baleful eyes. The room had gone still, everyone watching him with amazed disbelief, as if he were committing some embarrassing social faux pas. I saw Felix grin hopefully and move a step forward. Aro glanced at him once, and he froze in place, his grin turning to a sulky expression. Then he spoke to Jane. \"I was wondering, my dear one, if Bella is immune to you.\" I could barely hear Aro over Edward's furious growls. He let go of me, moving to hide me from their view. Caius ghosted in our direction, with his entourage, to watch. Jane turned toward us with a beatific smile. \"Don't!\" Alice cried as Edward launched himself at the little girl. Before I could react, before anyone could jump between them, before Aro's bodyguards could tense, Edward was on the ground. No one had touched him, but he was on the stone floor writhing in obvious agony, while I stared in horror. Jane was smiling only at him now, and it all clicked together. What Alice had said about formidable gifts , why everyone treated Jane with such deference, and why Edward had thrown himself in her path before she could do that to me. \"Stop!\" I shrieked, my voice echoing in the silence, jumping forward to put myself between them. But Alice threw her arms around me in an unbreakable grasp and ignored my struggles. No sound escaped Edward's lips as he cringed against the stones. It felt like my head would explode from the pain of watching this. \"Jane,\" Aro recalled her in a tranquil voice. She looked up quickly, still smiling with pleasure, her eyes questioning. As soon as Jane looked away, Edward was still. Aro inclined his head toward me. Jane turned her smile in my direction. I didn't even meet her gaze. I watched Edward from the prison of Alice's arms, still struggling pointlessly. \"He's fine,\" Alice whispered in a tight voice. As she spoke, he sat up, and then sprang lightly to his feet. His eyes met mine, and they were horror-struck. At first I thought the horror was for what he had just suffered. But then he looked quickly at Jane, and back to me\u2014and his face relaxed into relief. I looked at Jane, too, and she no longer smiled. She glared at me, her jaw clenched with the intensity of her focus. I shrank back, waiting for the pain. Nothing happened. Edward was by my side again. He touched Alice's arm, and she surrendered me to him. Aro started to laugh. \"Ha, ha. ha,\" he chuckled. \"This is wonderful!\" Jane hissed in frustration, leaning forward like she was preparing to spring. \"Don't be put out, dear one,\" Aro said in a comforting tone, placing a powder-light hand on her shoulder. \"She confounds us all.\" Jane's upper lip curled back ever her teeth as she continued to glare at me. \"Ha, ha, ha,\" Aro chortled again. \"You're very brave, Edward, to endure in silence. I asked Jane to do that to me once\u2014just out of curiosity.\" He shook his head in admiration. Edward glared, disgusted. \"So what do we do with you now?\" Aro sighed. Edward and Alice stiffened. This was the part they'd been waiting for. I began to tremble. \"I don't suppose there's any chance that you've changed your mind?\" Aro asked Edward hopefully. \"Your talent would be an excellent addition to our little company.\" Edward hesitated. From the corner of my eye, I saw both Felix and Jane grimace. Edward seemed to weigh each word before he spoke it. \"I'd\u2026 rather\u2026 not.\" \"Alice?\" Aro asked, still hopeful. \"Would you perhaps be interested in joining with us?\" \"No, thank you,\" Alice said. \"And you, Bella?\" Aro raised his eyebrows. Edward hissed, low in my ears. I stared at Aro blankly. Was he joking? Or was he really asking me if I wanted to stay for dinner? It was the white-haired Caius who broke the silence. \"What?\" he demanded of Aro; his voice, though no more than a whisper, was flat. \"Caius, surely you see the potential,\" Aro chided him affectionately. \"I haven't seen a prospective talent so promising since we found Jane and Alec. Can you imagine the possibilities when she is one of us?\" Caius looked away with a caustic expression. Jane's eyes sparked with indignation at the comparison. Edward fumed beside me. I could hear a rumble in his chest, building toward a growl. I couldn't let his temper get him hurt. \"No, thank you,\" I spoke up in barely more than a whisper, my voice breaking in fright. Aro sighed. \"That's unfortunate. Such a waste.\" Edward hissed. \"Join or die, is that it? I suspected as much when we were brought to this room. So much for your laws.\" The tone of his voice surprised me. He sounded irate, but there was something deliberate about his delivery\u2014as if he'd chosen his words with great care. \"Of course not.\" Aro blinked, astonished. \"We were already convened here, Edward, awaiting Heidi's return. Not for you.\" \"Aro,\" Caius hissed. \"The law claims them.\" Edward glared at Caius. \"How so?\" he demanded. He must have known what Caius was thinking, but he seemed determined to make him speak it aloud. Caius pointed a skeletal finger at me. \"She knows too much. You have exposed our secrets.\" His voice was papery thin, just like his skin. \"There are a few humans in on your charade here, as well,\" Edward reminded him, and I thought of the pretty receptionist below. Caius's face twisted into a new expression. Was it supposed to be a smiled. \"Yes,\" he agreed. \"But when they are no longer useful to us, they will serve to sustain us. That is not your plan for this one. If she betrays our secrets, are you prepared to destroy her? I think not,\" he scoffed. \"I wouldn't\u2014,\" I began, still whispering. Caius silenced me with an icy look. \"Nor do you intend to make her one of us,\" Caius continued. \"Therefore, she is a vulnerability. Though it is true, for this, only her life is forfeit. You may leave if you wish.\" Edward bared his teeth. \"That's what I thought,\" Caius said, with something akin to pleasure. Felix leaned forward, eager. \"Unless\u2026\" Aro interrupted. He looked unhappy with the way the conversation had gone. \"Unless you do intend to give her immortality?\" Edward pursed his lips, hesitating for a moment before he answered. \"And if I do?\" Aro smiled, happy again. \"Why, then you would be free to go home and give my regards to my friend Carlisle.\" His expression turned more hesitant. \"But I'm afraid you would have to mean it.\" Aro raised his hand in front of him. Caius, who had begun to scowl furiously, relaxed. Edward's lips tightened into a fierce line. He stared into my eyes, and I stared back. \"Mean it,\" I whispered. \"Please.\" Was it really such a loathsome idea? Would he rather die than change me? I felt like I'd been kicked in the stomach. Edward stared down at me with a tortured expression. And then Alice stepped away from us, forward toward Aro. We turned to watch her. Her hand was raised like his. She didn't say anything, and Aro waved off his anxious guard as they moved to block her approach. Aro met her halfway, and took her hand with an eager, acquisitive glint in his eyes. He bent his head over their touching hands, his eyes closing as he concentrated. Alice was motionless, her face blank. I heard Edward's teeth snap together. No one moved. Aro seemed frozen over Alice's hand. The seconds passed and I grew more and more stressed, wondering how much time would pass before it was too much time. Before it meant something was wrong\u2014more wrong than it already was. Another agonizing moment passed, and then Aro's voice broke the silence. \"Ha, ha, ha,\" he laughed, his head still bent forward. He looked up slowly, his eyes bright with excitement. \"That was fascinating!\" Alice smiled dryly. \"I'm glad you enjoyed it.\" \"To see the things you've seen\u2014especially the ones that haven't happened yet!\" He shook his head in wonder. \"But that will,\" she reminded him, voice calm. \"Yes, yes, it's quite determined. Certainly there's no problem.\" Caius looked bitterly disappointed\u2014a feeling he seemed to share with Felix and Jane. \"Aro,\" Caius complained. \"Dear Caius,\" Aro smiled. \"Do not fret. Think of the possibilities! They do not join us today, but we can always hope for the future. Imagine the joy young Alice alone would bring to our little household\u2026 Besides, I'm so terribly curious to see how Bella turns out!\" Aro seemed convinced. Did he not realize how subjective Alice's visions were.' That she could make up her mind to transform me today, and then change it tomorrow? A million tiny decisions, her decisions and so many others', too\u2014Edward's\u2014could alter her path, and with that, the future. And would it really matter that Alice was willing, would it make any difference if I did become a vampire, when the idea was so repulsive to Edward? If death was, to him, a better alternative than having me around forever, an immortal annoyance? Terrified as I was, I felt myself sinking down into depression, drowning in it\u2026 \"Then we are free to go now?\" Edward asked in an even voice. \"Yes, yes,\" Aro said pleasantly. \"But please visit again. It's been absolutely enthralling!\" \"And we will visit you as well,\" Caius promised, his eyes suddenly half-closed like the heavy-lidded gaze of a lizard. \"To be sure that you follow through on your side. Were I you, I would not delay too long. We do not offer second chances.\" Edward's jaw clenched tight, but he nodded once. Caius smirked and drifted back to where Marcus still sat, unmoving and uninterested. Felix groaned. \"Ah, Felix.\" Aro smiled, amused. \"Heidi will be here at any moment. Patience.\" \"Hmm.\" Edward's voice had a new edge to it. \"In that case, perhaps we'd better leave sooner rather than later.\" \"Yes,\" Aro agreed. \"That's a good idea. Accidents do happen. Please wait below until after dark, though, if you don't mind.\" \"Of course,\" Edward agreed, while I cringed at the thought of waiting out the day before we could escape. \"And here,\" Aro added, motioning to Felix with one finger. Felix came forward at once, and Aro unfastened the gray cloak the huge vampire wore, pulling from his shoulders. He tossed it to Edward. \"Take this. You're a little conspicuous.\" Edward put the long cloak on, leaving the hood down. Aro sighed. \"It suits you.\" Edward chuckled, but broke off suddenly, glancing over his shoulder. \"Thank you, Aro. We'll wait below.\" \"Goodbye, young friends,\" Aro said, his eyes bright as he stared in the same direction. \"Let's go,\" Edward said, urgent now. Demetri gestured that we should follow, and then set off the way we'd come in, the only exit by the look of things. Edward pulled me swiftly along beside him. Alice was close by my other side, her face hard. \"Not fast enough,\" she muttered. I stared up at her, frightened, but she only seemed chagrined. It was then that I first heard the babble of voices\u2014loud, rough voices\u2014coming from the antechamber. \"Well this is unusual,\" a man's coarse voice boomed. \"So medieval,\" an unpleasantly shrill, female voice gushed back. A large crowd was coming through the little door, filling the smaller stone chamber. Demetri motioned for us to make room. We pressed back against the cold wall to let them pass. The couple in front, Americans from the sound of them, glanced around themselves with appraising eyes. \"Welcome, guests! Welcome to Volterra!\" I could hear Aro sing from the big turret room. The rest of them, maybe forty or more, filed in after the couple. Some studied the setting like tourists. A few even snapped pictures. Others looked confused, as if the story that had led them to this room was not making sense anymore. I noticed one small, dark woman in particular. Around her neck was a rosary, and she gripped the cross tightly in one hand. She walked more slowly than the others, touching someone now and then and asking a question in an unfamiliar language. No one seemed to understand her, and her voice grew more panicked. Edward pulled my face against his chest, but it was too late. I already understood. As soon as the smallest break appeared, Edward pushed me quickly toward the door. I could feel the horrified expression on my face, and the tears beginning to pool in my eyes. The ornate golden hallway was quiet, empty except for one gorgeous, statuesque woman. She stared at us curiously, me in particular. \"Welcome home, Heidi,\" Demetri greeted her from behind us. Heidi smiled absently. She reminded me of Rosalie, though they looked nothing alike\u2014it was just that her beauty, too, was exceptional, unforgettable. I couldn't seem to look away. She was dressed to emphasize that beauty. Her amazingly long legs, darkened with tights, were exposed by the shortest of miniskirts. Her top was long-sleeved and high-necked, but extremely close-fitting, and constructed of red vinyl. Her long mahogany hair was lustrous, and her eyes were the strangest shade of violet\u2014a color that might result from blue-tinted contacts over red irises. \"Demetri,\" she responded in a silky voice, her eyes flickering between my face and Edward's gray cloak. \"Nice fishing,\" Demetri complimented her, and I suddenly understood the attention-grabbing outfit she wore\u2026 she was not only the fisherman, but also the bait. \"Thanks.\" She flashed a stunning smile. \"Aren't you coming?\" \"In a minute. Save a few for me.\" Heidi nodded and ducked through the door with one last curious look at me. Edward set a pace that had me running to keep up. But we still couldn't get through the ornate door at the end of the hallway before the screaming started.",

            "en": "4. NATURE I WAS HAVING A BAD WEEK. I knew that essentially nothing had changed. Okay, so Victoria had not given up, but had I ever dreamed for one moment that she had? Her reappearance had only confirmed what I\u2019d already known. No reason for fresh panic. In theory. Not panicking was easier said than done. Graduation was only a few weeks away, but I wondered if it wasn\u2019t a little foolish to sit around, weak and tasty, waiting for the next disaster. It seemed too dangerous to be human \u2014 just begging for trouble. Someone like me shouldn\u2019t be human. Someone with my luck ought to be a little less helpless. But no one would listen to me. Carlisle had said, \u201cThere are seven of us, Bella. And with Alice on our side, I don\u2019t think Victoria\u2019s going to catch us off guard. I think it\u2019s important, for Charlie\u2019s sake, that we stick with the original plan.\u201d Esme had said, \u201cWe\u2019d never allow anything to happen to you, sweetheart. You know that. Please don\u2019t be anxious.\u201d And then she\u2019d kissed my forehead. Emmett had said, \u201cI\u2019m really glad Edward didn\u2019t kill you. Everything\u2019s so much more fun with you around.\u201d Rosalie had glared at him. Alice had rolled her eyes and said, \u201cI\u2019m offended. You\u2019re not honestly worried about this, are you?\u201d \u201cIf it\u2019s no big deal, then why did Edward drag me to Florida?\u201d I\u2019d demanded. \u201cHaven\u2019t you noticed yet, Bella, that Edward is just the teeniest bit prone to overreaction?\u201d Jasper had silently erased all the panic and tension in my body with his curious talent of controlling emotional atmospheres. I\u2019d felt reassured, and let them talk me out of my desperate pleading. Of course, that calm had worn off as soon as Edward and I had walked out of the room. So the consensus was that I was just supposed to forget that a deranged vampire was stalking me, intent on my death. Go about my business. I did try. And surprisingly, there were other things almost as stressful to dwell on besides my status on the endangered species list. . . . Because Edward\u2019s response had been the most frustrating of them all. \u201cThat\u2019s between you and Carlisle,\u201d he\u2019d said. \u201cOf course, you know that I\u2019m willing to make it between you and me at any time that you wish. You know my condition.\u201d And he had smiled angelically. Ugh. I did know his condition. Edward had promised that he would change me himself whenever I wanted . . . just as long as I was married to him first. Sometimes I wondered if he was only pretending that he couldn\u2019t read my mind. How else had he struck upon the one condition that I would have trouble accepting? The one condition that would slow me down. All in all, a very bad week. And today was the worst day in it. It was always a bad day when Edward was away. Alice had foreseen nothing out of the ordinary this weekend, and so I\u2019d insisted that he take the opportunity to go hunting with his brothers. I knew how it bored him to hunt the easy, nearby prey. \u201cGo have fun,\u201d I\u2019d told him. \u201cBag a few mountain lions for me.\u201d I would never admit to him how hard it was for me when he was gone \u2014 how it brought back the abandonment nightmares. If he knew that, it would make him feel horrible and he would be afraid to ever leave me, even for the most necessary reasons. It had been like that in the beginning, when he\u2019d first returned from Italy. His golden eyes had turned black and he\u2019d suffered from his thirst more than it was already necessary that he suffer. So I put on a brave face and all but kicked him out the door whenever Emmett and Jasper wanted to go. I think he saw through me, though. A little. This morning there had been a note left on my pillow: I\u2019ll be back so soon you won\u2019t have time to miss me. Look after my heart \u2014 I\u2019ve left it with you. So now I had a big empty Saturday with nothing but my morning shift at Newton\u2019s Olympic Outfitters to distract me. And, of course, the oh-so-comforting promise from Alice. \u201cI\u2019m staying close to home to hunt. I\u2019ll only be fifteen minutes away if you need me. I\u2019ll keep an eye out for trouble.\u201d Translation: don\u2019t try anything funny just because Edward is gone. Alice was certainly just as capable of crippling my truck as Edward was. I tried to look on the bright side. After work, I had plans to help Angela with her announcements, so that would be a distraction. And Charlie was in an excellent mood due to Edward\u2019s absence, so I might as well enjoy that while it lasted. Alice would spend the night with me if I was pathetic enough to ask her to. And then tomorrow, Edward would be home. I would survive. Not wanting to be ridiculously early for work, I ate my breakfast slowly, one Cheerio at a time. Then, when I\u2019d washed the dishes, I arranged the magnets on the fridge into a perfect line. Maybe I was developing obsessive-compulsive disorder. The last two magnets \u2014 round black utilitarian pieces that were my favorites because they could hold ten sheets of paper to the fridge without breaking a sweat \u2014 did not want to cooperate with my fixation. Their polarities were reversed; every time I tried to line the last one up, the other jumped out of place. For some reason \u2014 impending mania, perhaps \u2014 this really irritated me. Why couldn\u2019t they just play nice? Stupid with stubbornness, I kept shoving them together as if I was expecting them to suddenly give up. I could have flipped one over, but that felt like losing. Finally, exasperated at myself more than the magnets, I pulled them from the fridge and held them together with two hands. It took a little effort \u2014 they were strong enough to put up a fight \u2014 but I forced them to coexist side-by-side. \u201cSee,\u201d I said out loud \u2014 talking to inanimate objects, never a good sign \u2014 \u201cThat\u2019s not so horrible, is it?\u201d I stood there like an idiot for a second, not quite able to admit that I wasn\u2019t having any lasting effect against scientific principles. Then, with a sigh, I put the magnets back on the fridge, a foot apart. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to be so inflexible,\u201d I muttered. It was still too early, but I decided I\u2019d better get out of the house before the inanimate objects started talking back. When I got to Newton\u2019s, Mike was methodically dry mopping the aisles while his mom arranged a new counter display. I caught them in the middle of an argument, unaware that I had arrived. \u201cBut it\u2019s the only time that Tyler can go,\u201d Mike complained. \u201cYou said after graduation \u2014 \u201cYou\u2019re just going to have to wait,\u201d Mrs. Newton snapped. \u201cYou and Tyler can think of something else to do. You are not going to Seattle until the police stop whatever it is that is going on there. I know Beth Crowley has told Tyler the same thing, so don\u2019t act like I\u2019m the bad guy \u2014 oh, good morning, Bella,\u201d she said when she caught sight of me, brightening her tone quickly. \u201cYou\u2019re early.\u201d Karen Newton was the last person I\u2019d think to ask for help in an outdoor sports equipment store. Her perfectly highlighted blond hair was always smoothed into an elegant twist on the back of her neck, her fingernails were polished by professionals, as were her toenails \u2014 visible through the strappy high heels that didn\u2019t resemble anything Newton\u2019s offered on the long row of hiking boots. \u201cLight traffic,\u201d I joked as I grabbed my hideous fluorescent orange vest out from under the counter. I was surprised that Mrs. Newton was as worked up about this Seattle thing as Charlie. I\u2019d thought he was going to extremes. \u201cWell, er . . .\u201d Mrs. Newton hesitated for a moment, playing uncomfortably with a stack of flyers she was arranging by the register. I stopped with one arm in my vest. I knew that look. When I\u2019d let the Newtons know that I wouldn\u2019t be working here this summer \u2014 abandoning them in their busiest season, in effect \u2014 they\u2019d started training Katie Marshall to take my place. They couldn\u2019t really afford both of us on the payroll at the same time, so when it looked like a slow day . . . \u201cI was going to call,\u201d Mrs. Newton continued. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re expecting a ton of business today.\u00a0 Mike and I can probably handle things. I\u2019m sorry you got up and drove out. . . .\u201d On a normal day, I would be ecstatic with this turn of events. Today . . . not so much. \u201cOkay,\u201d I sighed. My shoulders slumped. What was I going to do now? \u201cThat\u2019s not fair, Mom,\u201d Mike said. \u201cIf Bella wants to work \u2014\u201d \u201cNo, it\u2019s okay, Mrs. Newton. Really, Mike. I\u2019ve got finals to study for and stuff. . . .\u201d I didn\u2019t want to be a source of familial discord when they were already arguing. \u201cThanks, Bella. Mike, you missed aisle four. Um, Bella, do you mind throwing these flyers in a Dumpster on the way out? I told the girl who left them here that I\u2019d put them on the counter, but I really don\u2019t have the room.\u201d \u201cSure, no problem.\u201d I put my vest away, and then tucked the flyers under my arm and headed out into the misty rain. The Dumpster was around the side of Newton\u2019s, next to where we employees were supposed to park. I shuffled along, kicking pebbles petulantly on my way. I was about to fling the stack of bright yellow papers into the trash when the heading printed in bold across the top caught my eye. One word in particular seized my attention. I clutched the papers in both hands as I stared at the picture beneath the caption. A lump rose in my throat. SAVE THE OLYMPIC WOLF Under the words, there was a detailed drawing of a wolf in front of a fir tree, its head thrown back in the act of baying at the moon. It was a disconcerting picture; something about the wolf\u2019s plaintive posture made him look forlorn. Like he was howling in grief. And then I was running to my truck, the flyers still locked in my grip. Fifteen minutes \u2014 that\u2019s all I had. But it should be long enough. It was only fifteen minutes to La Push, and surely I would cross the boundary line a few minutes before I hit the town. My truck roared to life without any difficulty.  Alice couldn\u2019t have seen me doing this, because I hadn\u2019t been planning it. A snap decision, that was the key! And as long as I moved fast enough, I should be able to capitalize on it. I\u2019d thrown the damp flyers in my haste and they were scattered in a bright mess across the passenger seat \u2014 a hundred bolded captions, a hundred dark howling wolves outlined against the yellow background. I barreled down the wet highway, turning the windshield wipers on high and ignoring the groan of the ancient engine. Fifty-five was the most I could coax out of my truck, and I prayed it would be enough. I had no clue where the boundary line was, but I began to feel safer as I passed the first houses outside La Push. This must be beyond where Alice was allowed to follow. I\u2019d call her when I got to Angela\u2019s this afternoon, I reasoned, so that she\u2019d know I was fine. There was no reason for her to get worked up. She didn\u2019t need to be mad at me \u2014 Edward would be angry enough for two when he got back. My truck was positively wheezing by the time it grated to a stop in front of the familiar faded red house. The lump came back to my throat as I stared at the little place that had once been my refuge. It had been so long since I\u2019d been here. Before I could cut the engine, Jacob was standing in the door, his face blank with shock. In the sudden silence when the truck-roar died, I heard him gasp. \u201cBella?\u201d \u201cHey, Jake!\u201d \u201cBella!\u201d he yelled back, and the smile I\u2019d been waiting for stretched across his face like the sun breaking free of the clouds. His teeth gleamed bright against his russet skin. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it!\u201d He ran to the truck and half-yanked me through the open door, and then we were both jumping up and down like kids. \u201cHow did you get here?\u201d \u201cI snuck out!\u201d \u201cAwesome!\u201d \u201cHey, Bella!\u201d Billy had rolled himself into the doorway to see what all the commotion was about. \u201cHey, Bil \u2014!\u201d Just then my air choked off \u2014 Jacob grabbed me up in a bear hug too tight to breathe and swung me around in a circle. \u201cWow, it\u2019s good to see you here!\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t . . . breathe,\u201d I gasped. He laughed and put me down. \u201cWelcome back, Bella,\u201d he said, grinning. And the way he said the words made it sound like welcome home . We started walking, too keyed up to sit still in the house. Jacob was practically bouncing as he moved, and I had to remind him a few times that my legs weren\u2019t ten feet long. As we walked, I felt myself settling into another version of myself, the self I had been with Jacob. A little younger, a little less responsible. Someone who might, on occasion, do something really stupid for no good reason. Our exuberance lasted through the first few topics of conversation: how we were doing, what we were up to, how long I had, and what had brought me here. When I hesitantly told him about the wolf flyer, his bellowing laugh echoed back from the trees. But then, as we ambled past the back of the store and shoved through the thick scrub that ringed the far edge of First Beach, we got to the hard parts. All too soon we had to talk about the reasons behind our long separation, and I watched as the face of my friend hardened into the bitter mask that was already too familiar. \u201cSo what\u2019s the story, anyway?\u201d Jacob asked me, kicking a piece of driftwood out of his way with too much force. It sailed over the sand and then clattered against the rocks. \u201cI mean, since the last time we . . . well, before, you know . . .\u201d He struggled for the words. He took a deep breath and tried again. \u201cWhat I\u2019m asking is . . . everything is just back to the way it was before he left? You forgave him for all of that?\u201d I took a deep breath. \u201cThere was nothing to forgive.\u201d I wanted to skip past this part, the betrayals, the accusations, but I knew that we had to talk it through before we\u2019d be able to move on to anything else. Jacob\u2019s face puckered up like he\u2019d just licked a lemon. \u201cI wish Sam had taken a picture when he found you that night last September. It would be exhibit A.\u201d \u201cNobody\u2019s on trial.\u201d \u201cMaybe somebody should be.\u201d \u201cNot even you would blame him for leaving, if you knew the reason why.\u201d He glared at me for a few seconds. \u201cOkay,\u201d he challenged acidly. \u201cAmaze me.\u201d His hostility was wearing on me \u2014 chafing against the raw; it hurt to have him angry with me. It reminded me of the bleak afternoon, long ago, when \u2014 under orders from Sam \u2014 he\u2019d told me we couldn\u2019t be friends. I took a second to compose myself. \u201cEdward left me last fall because he didn\u2019t think I should be hanging out with vampires. He thought it would be healthier for me if he left.\u201d Jacob did a double take. He had to scramble for a minute. Whatever he\u2019d been planning to say, it clearly no longer applied. I was glad he didn\u2019t know the catalyst behind Edward\u2019s decision. I could only imagine what he\u2019d think if he knew Jasper had tried to kill me. \u201cHe came back, though, didn\u2019t he?\u201d Jacob muttered. \u201cToo bad he can\u2019t stick to a decision.\u201d \u201cIf you remember,I went and got him .\u201d Jacob stared at me for a moment, and then he backed off. His face relaxed, and his voice was calmer when he spoke. \u201cThat\u2019s true. So I never did get the story. What happened?\u201d I hesitated, biting my lip. \u201cIs it a secret?\u201d His voice took on a taunting edge. \u201cAre you not allowed to tell me?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I snapped. \u201cIt\u2019s just a really long story.\u201d Jacob smiled, arrogant, and turned to walk up the beach, expecting me to follow. It was no fun being with Jacob if he was going to act like this. I trailed behind him automatically, not sure if I shouldn\u2019t turn around and leave. I was going to have to face Alice, though, when I got home. . . . I supposed I wasn\u2019t in any rush. Jacob walked to a huge, familiar piece of driftwood \u2014 an entire tree, roots and all, bleached white and beached deep in the sand; it was our tree, in a way. Jacob sat down on the natural bench, and patted the space next to him. \u201cI don\u2019t mind long stories. Is there any action?\u201d I rolled my eyes as I sat next to him. \u201cThere\u2019s some action,\u201d I allowed. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be real horror without action.\u201d \u201cHorror!\u201d I scoffed. \u201cCan you listen, or will you be interrupting me with rude comments about my friends?\u201d He pretended to lock his lips and then threw the invisible key over his shoulder. I tried not to smile, and failed. \u201cI\u2019ll have to start with the stuff you were already there for,\u201d I decided, working to organize the stories in my head before I began. Jacob raised his hand. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand much that was going on at the time.\u201d \u201cYeah, well, it gets complicated, so pay attention. You know how Alice sees things?\u201d I took his scowl \u2014 the wolves weren\u2019t thrilled that the legends of vampires possessing supernatural gifts were true \u2014 for a yes, and proceeded with the account of my race through Italy to rescue Edward. I kept it as succinct as possible \u2014 leaving out anything that wasn\u2019t essential. I tried to read Jacob\u2019s reactions, but his face was enigmatic as I explained how Alice had seen Edward plan to kill himself when he\u2019d heard that I was dead. Sometimes Jacob seemed so deep in thought, I wasn\u2019t sure if he was listening. He only interrupted one time. \u201cThe fortune-telling bloodsucker can\u2019t see us?\u201d he echoed, his face both fierce and gleeful. \u201cSeriously? That\u2019s excellent !\u201d I clenched my teeth together, and we sat in silence, his face expectant as he waited for me to continue. I glared at him until he realized his mistake. \u201cOops!\u201d he said. \u201cSorry.\u201d He locked his lips again. His response was easier to read when I got to the part about the Volturi. His teeth clenched together, goose bumps rose on his arms, and his nostrils flared. I didn\u2019t go into specifics, I just told him that Edward had talked us out of trouble, without revealing the promise we\u2019d had to make, or the visit we were anticipating. Jacob didn\u2019t need to have my nightmares. \u201cNow you know the whole story,\u201d I concluded. \u201cSo it\u2019s your turn to talk. What happened while I was with my mom this weekend?\u201d I knew Jacob would give me more details than Edward had. He wasn\u2019t afraid of scaring me. Jacob leaned forward, instantly animated. \u201cSo Embry and Quil and I were running patrol on Saturday night, just routine stuff, when out of nowhere \u2014 bam!\u201d He threw his arms out, impersonating an explosion. \u201cThere it is \u2014 a fresh trail, not fifteen minutes old. Sam wanted us to wait for him, but I didn\u2019t know you were gone, and I didn\u2019t know if your bloodsuckers were keeping an eye on you or not. So we took off after her at full speed, but she\u2019d crossed the treaty line before we caught up. We spread out along the line, hoping she\u2019d cross back over. It was frustrating, let me tell you.\u201d He wagged his head and his hair \u2014 growing out from the short crop he\u2019d adopted when he\u2019d joined the pack \u2014 flopped into his eyes. \u201cWe ended up too far south. The Cullens chased her back to our side just a few miles north of us. Would have been the perfect ambush if we\u2019d known where to wait.\u201d He shook his head, grimacing now. \u201cThat\u2019s when it got dicey. Sam and the others caught up to her before we did, but she was dancing right along the line, and the whole coven was right there on the other side. The big one, what\u2019s-his-name \u2014\u201d \u201cEmmett.\u201d \u201cYeah, him. He made a lunge for her, but that redhead is fast! He flew right behind her and almost rammed into Paul. So, Paul . . . well, you know Paul.\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cLost his focus. Can\u2019t say that I blame him \u2014 the big bloodsucker was right on top of him. He sprang \u2014 hey, don\u2019t give me that look. The vampire was on our land.\u201d I tried to compose my face so that he would go on. My nails were digging into my palms with the stress of the story, even though I knew it had turned out fine. \u201cAnyway, Paul missed, and the big one got back on his side. But by then the, er, well the, uh, blonde . . .\u201d Jacob\u2019s expression was a comical mix of disgust and unwilling admiration as he tried to come up with a word to describe Edward\u2019s sister. \u201cRosalie.\u201d \u201cWhatever. She got real territorial, so Sam and I fell back to get Paul\u2019s flanks. Then their leader and the other blond male \u2014\u201d \u201cCarlisle and Jasper.\u201d He gave me an exasperated look. \u201cYou know I don\u2019t really care. Anyway, so Carlisle spoke to Sam, trying to calm things down. Then it was weird, because everyone got really calm really fast. It was that other one you told me about, messing with our heads. But even though we knew what he was doing, we couldn\u2019t not be calm.\u201d \u201cYeah, I know how it feels.\u201d \u201cReally annoying, that\u2019s how it feels. Only you can\u2019t be annoyed until afterwards.\u201d He shook his head angrily. \u201cSo Sam and the head vamp agreed that Victoria was the priority, and we started after her again.  Carlisle gave us the line, so that we could follow the scent properly, but then she hit the cliffs just north of Makah country, right where the line hugs the coast for a few miles. She took off into the water again. The big one and the calm one wanted permission to cross the line to go after her, but of course we said no.\u201d \u201cGood. I mean, you were being stupid, but I\u2019m glad. Emmett\u2019s never cautious enough. He could have gotten hurt.\u201d Jacob snorted. \u201cSo did your vampire tell you we attacked for no reason and his totally innocent coven \u2014\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I interrupted. \u201cEdward told me the same story, just without quite as many details.\u201d \u201cHuh,\u201d Jacob said under his breath, and he bent over to pick up a rock from among the millions of pebbles at our feet. With a casual flick, he sent it flying a good hundred meters out into the bay. \u201cWell, she\u2019ll be back, I guess. We\u2019ll get another shot at her.\u201d I shuddered; of course she would be back. Would Edward really tell me next time? I wasn\u2019t sure. I\u2019d have to keep an eye on Alice, to look for the signs that the pattern was about to repeat. . . . Jacob didn\u2019t seem to notice my reaction. He was staring across the waves with a thoughtful expression on his face, his broad lips pursed. \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d I asked after a long, quiet time. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about what you told me. About when the fortune-teller saw you cliff jumping and thought you\u2019d committed suicide, and how it all got out of control. . . . Do you realize that if you had just waited for me like you were supposed to, then the bl \u2014Alice wouldn\u2019t have been able to see you jump? Nothing would have changed. We\u2019d probably be in my garage right now, like any other Saturday. There wouldn\u2019t be any vampires in Forks, and you and me . . .\u201d He trailed off, deep in thought. It was disconcerting the way he said this, like it would be a good thing to have no vampires in Forks. My heart thumped <em>unevenly</em> at the emptiness of the picture he painted. \u201cEdward would have come back anyway.\u201d \u201cAre you sure about that?\u201d he asked, belligerent again as soon as I spoke Edward\u2019s name. \u201cBeing apart . . . It didn\u2019t work out so well for either of us.\u201d He started to say something, something angry from his expression, but he stopped himself, took a breath, and began again. \u201cDid you know Sam is mad at you?\u201d \u201cMe?\u201d It took me a second. \u201cOh. I see. He thinks they would have stayed away if I wasn\u2019t here.\u201d \u201cNo. That\u2019s not it.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s his problem then?\u201d Jacob leaned down to scoop up another rock. He turned it over and over in his fingers; his eyes were riveted on the black stone while he spoke in a low voice. \u201cWhen Sam saw . . . how you were in the beginning, when Billy told them how Charlie worried when you didn\u2019t get better, and then when you started jumping off cliffs . . .\u201d I made a face. No one was ever going to let me forget that. Jacob\u2019s eyes flashed up to mine. \u201cHe thought you were the one person in the world with as much reason to hate the Cullens as he does. Sam feels sort of . . . betrayed that you would just let them back into your life like they never hurt you.\u201d I didn\u2019t believe for a second that Sam was the only one who felt that way. And the acid in my voice now was for both of them. \u201cYou can tell Sam to go right to \u2014\u201d \u201cLook at that,\u201d Jacob interrupted me, pointing to an eagle in the act of plummeting down toward the ocean from an incredible height. It checked itself at the last minute, only its talons breaking the surface of the waves, just for an instant. Then it flapped away, its wings straining against the load of the huge fish it had snagged. \u201cYou see it everywhere,\u201d Jacob said, his voice suddenly distant. \u201cNature taking its course \u2014 hunter and prey, the endless cycle of life and death.\u201d I didn\u2019t understand the point of the nature lecture; I guessed that he was just trying to change the subject. But then he looked down at me with dark humor in his eyes. \u201cAnd yet, you don\u2019t see the fish trying to plant a kiss on the eagle. You never see that .\u201d He grinned a mocking grin. I grinned back tightly, though the acid taste was still in my mouth. \u201cMaybe the fish was trying,\u201d I suggested. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell what a fish is thinking. Eagles are good-looking birds, you know.\u201d \u201cIs that what it comes down to?\u201d His voice was abruptly sharper. \u201cGood looks?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be stupid, Jacob.\u201d \u201cIs it the money, then?\u201d he persisted. \u201cThat\u2019s nice,\u201d I muttered, getting up from the tree. \u201cI\u2019m flattered that you think so much of me.\u201d I turned my back on him and paced away. \u201cAw, don\u2019t get mad.\u201d He was right behind me; he caught my wrist and spun me around. \u201cI\u2019m serious!\u00a0 I\u2019m trying to understand here, and I\u2019m coming up blank.\u201d His eyebrows pushed together angrily, and his eyes were black in their deep shadow. \u201cI love him . Not because he\u2019s beautiful or because he\u2019s rich !\u201d I spat the word at Jacob. \u201cI\u2019d much rather he weren\u2019t either one. It would even out the gap between us just a little bit \u2014 because he\u2019d still be the most loving and unselfish and brilliant and decent person I\u2019ve ever met. Of course I love him. How hard is that to understand?\u201d \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to understand.\u201d \u201cPlease enlighten me, then, Jacob.\u201d I let the sarcasm flow thick. \u201cWhat is a valid reason for someone to love someone else? Since apparently I\u2019m doing it wrong.\u201d \u201cI think the best place to start would be to look within your own species. That usually works.\u201d \u201cWell, that just sucks!\u201d I snapped. \u201cI guess I\u2019m stuck with Mike Newton after all.\u201d Jacob flinched back and bit his lip. I could see that my words had hurt him, but I was too mad to feel bad about that yet. He dropped my wrist and folded his arms across his chest, turning from me to glare toward the ocean. \u201cI\u2019m human,\u201d he muttered, his voice almost inaudible. \u201cYou\u2019re not as human as Mike,\u201d I continued ruthlessly. \u201cDo you still think that\u2019s the most important consideration?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not the same thing.\u201d Jacob didn\u2019t look away from the gray waves. \u201cI didn\u2019t choose this.\u201d I laughed once in disbelief. \u201cDo you think Edward did? He didn\u2019t know what was happening to him any more than you did. He didn\u2019t exactly sign up for this.\u201d Jacob was shaking his head back and forth with a small, quick movement. \u201cYou know, Jacob, you\u2019re awfully self-righteous \u2014 considering that you\u2019re a werewolf and all.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not the same,\u201d Jacob repeated, glowering at me. \u201cI don\u2019t see why not. You could be a bit more understanding about the Cullens. You have no idea how truly good they are \u2014 to the core, Jacob.\u201d He frowned more deeply. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t exist. Their existence goes against nature.\u201d I stared at him for a long moment with one eyebrow raised incredulously. It was a while before he noticed. \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cSpeaking of unnatural . . . ,\u201d I hinted. \u201cBella,\u201d he said, his voice slow and different. Aged. I realized that he sounded suddenly older than me \u2014 like a parent or a teacher. \u201cWhat I am was born in me. It\u2019s a part of who I am, who my family is, who we all are as a tribe \u2014 it\u2019s the reason why we\u2019re still here. \u201cBesides that\u201d \u2014 he looked down at me, his black eyes unreadable \u2014 \u201cI am still human.\u201d He picked up my hand and pressed it to his fever-warm chest. Through his t-shirt, I could feel the steady beating of his heart under my palm. \u201cNormal humans can\u2019t throw motorcycles around the way you can.\u201d He smiled a faint, half-smile. \u201cNormal humans run away from monsters, Bella. And I never claimed to be normal. Just human.\u201d Staying angry with Jacob was too much work. I started to smile as I pulled my hand away from his chest. \u201cYou look plenty human to me,\u201d I allowed. \u201cAt the moment.\u201d \u201cI feel human.\u201d He stared past me, his face far away. His lower lip trembled, and he bit down on it hard. \u201cOh, Jake,\u201d I whispered, reaching for his hand. This was why I was here. This was why I would take whatever reception waited for me when I got back. Because, underneath all the anger and the sarcasm, Jacob was in pain. Right now, it was very clear in his eyes. I didn\u2019t know how to help him, but I knew I had to try. It was more than that I owed him. It was because his pain hurt me, too. Jacob had become a part of me, and there was no changing that now.",

            "en": "4         4. WAKING UP TIME PASSES. EVEN WHEN IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE. EVEN when each tick of the second hand aches like the pulse of blood behind a bruise. It passes <em>unevenly</em>, in strange lurches and dragging lulls, but pass it does. Even for me. CHARLIE'S FIST CAME DOWN ON THE TABLE. \"THAT'S IT, Bella! I'm sending you home.\" I looked up from my cereal, which I was pondering rather than eating, and stared at Charlie in shock. I hadn't been following the conversation\u2014actually, I hadn't been aware that we were having a conversation\u2014and I wasn't sure what he meant. \"I am home,\" I mumbled, confused. \"I'm sending you to Renee, to Jacksonville,\" he clarified. Charlie watched with exasperation as I slowly grasped the meaning of his words. \"What did I do?\" I felt my face crumple. It was so unfair. My behavior had been above reproach for the past four months. After that first week, which neither of us ever mentioned, I hadn't missed a day of school or work. My grades were perfect. I never broke curfew\u2014I never went anywhere from which to break curfew in the first place. I only very rarely served leftovers. Charlie was scowling. \"You didn't do anything. That's the problem. You never do anything.\" \"You want me to get into trouble?\" I wondered, my eyebrows pulling together in mystification. I made an effort to pay attention. It wasn't easy. I was so used to tuning everything out, my ears felt stopped up. \"Trouble would be better than this\u2026 this moping around all the time!\" That stung a bit. I'd been careful to avoid all forms of moroseness, moping included. \"I am not moping around.\" \"Wrong word,\" he grudgingly conceded. \"Moping would be better\u2014that would be doing something. You're just\u2026 lifeless, Bella. I think that's the word I want.\" This accusation struck home. I sighed and tried to put some animation into my response. \"I'm sorry, Dad.\" My apology sounded a little flat, even to me. I'd thought I'd been fooling him. Keeping Charlie from suffering was the whole point of all this effort. How depressing to think that the effort had been wasted. \"I don't want you to apologize.\" I sighed. \"Then tell me what you do want me to do.\" \"Bella,\" he hesitated, scrutinizing my reaction to his next words. \"Honey, you're not the first person to go through this kind of thing, you know.\" \"I know that.\" My accompanying grimace was limp and unimpressive. .  \"Listen, honey. I think that\u2014that maybe you need some help.\" \"Help?\" He paused, searching for the words again. \"When your mother left,\" he began, frowning, \"and took you with her.\" He inhaled deeply. \"Well, that was a really bad time for me.\" \"I know, Dad,\" I mumbled. \"But I handled it,\" he pointed out. \"Honey, you're not handling it. I waited, I hoped it would get better.\" He stared at me and I looked down quickly. \"I think we both know it's not getting better.\" \"I'm fine.\" He ignored me. \"Maybe, well, maybe if you talked to someone about it. A professional.\" \"You want me to see a shrink?\" My voice was a shade sharper as I realized what he was getting at. \"Maybe it would help.\" \"And maybe it wouldn't help one little bit.\" I didn't know much about psychoanalysis, but I was pretty sure that it didn't work unless the subject was relatively honest. Sure, I could tell the truth\u2014if I wanted to spend the rest of my life in a padded cell. He examined my obstinate expression, and switched to another line of attack. \"It's beyond me, Bella. Maybe your mother\" \"Look,\" I said in a flat voice. \"I'll go out tonight, if you want. I'll call Jess or Angela.\" \"That's not what I want,\" he argued, frustrated. \"I don't think I can live through seeing you try harder. I've never seen anyone trying so hard. It hurts to watch.\" I pretended to be dense, looking down at the table. \"I don't understand, Dad. First you're mad because I'm not doing anything, and then you say you don't want me to go out.\" \"I want you to be happy\u2014no, not even that much. I just want you not to be miserable. I think you'll have a better chance if you get out of Forks.\" My eyes flashed up with the first small spark of feeling I'd had in too long to contemplate. \"I'm not leaving,\" I said. \"Why not?\" he demanded. \"I'm in my last semester of school\u2014it would screw everything up.\" \"You're a good student\u2014you'll figure it out.\" \"I don't want to crowd Mom and Phil.\" \"Your mother's been dying to have you back.\" \"Florida is too hot.\" His fist came down on the table again. \"We both know what's really going on here, Bella, and it's not good for you.\" He took a deep breath. \"It's been months. No calls, no letters, no contact. You can't keep waiting for him.\" I glowered at him. The heat almost, but not quite, reached my face. It had been a long time since I'd blushed with any emotion. This whole subject was utterly forbidden, as he was well aware. \"I'm not waiting for anything. I don't expect anything,\" I said in a low monotone. \"Bella\u2014,\" Charlie began, his voice thick. \"I have to get to school,\" I interrupted, standing up and yanking my untouched breakfast from the table. I dumped my bowl in the sink without pausing to wash it out. I couldn't deal with any more conversation. \"I'll make plans with Jessica,\" I called over my shoulder as I strapped on my school bag, not meeting his eyes. \"Maybe I won't be home for dinner. We'll go to Port Angeles and watch a movie.\" I was out the front door before he could react. In my haste to get away from Charlie, I ended up being one of the first ones to school. The plus side was that I got a really good parking spot. The downside was that I had free time on my hands, and I tried to avoid free time at all costs. Quickly, before I could start thinking about Charlie's accusations, I pulled out my Calculus book. I flipped it open to the section we should be starting today, and tried to make sense of it. Reading math was even worse than listening to it, but I was getting better at it. In the last several months, I'd spent ten times the amount of time on Calculus than I'd ever spent on math before. As a result, I was managing to keep in the range of a low A. I knew Mr. Varner felt my improvement was all due to his superior teaching methods. And if that made him happy, I wasn't going to burst his bubble. I forced myself to keep at it until the parking lot was full, and I ended up rushing to English. We were working on Animal Farm, an easy subject matter. I didn't mind communism; it was a welcome change from the exhausting romances that made up most of the curriculum. I settled into my seat, pleased by the distraction of Mr. Berty's lecture. Time moved easily while I was in school. The bell rang all too soon. I started repacking my bag. \"Bella?\" I recognized Mike's voice, and I knew what his next words would be before he said them. \"Are you working tomorrow?\" I looked up. He was leaning across the aisle with an anxious expression. Every Friday he asked me the same question. Never mind that I hadn't taken so much as a sick day. Well, with one exception, months ago. But he had no reason to look at me with such concern. I was a model employee. \"Tomorrow is Saturday, isn't it?\" I said. Having just had it pointed out to me by Charlie, I realized how lifeless my voice really sounded. \"Yeah, it is,\" he agreed. \"See you in Spanish.\" He waved once before turning his back. He didn't bother walking me to class anymore. I trudged off to Calculus with a grim expression. This was the class where I sat next to Jessica. It had been weeks, maybe months, since Jess had even greeted me when I passed her in the hall. I knew I had offended her with my antisocial behavior, and she was sulking. It wasn't going to be easy to talk to her now\u2014especially to ask her to do me a favor. I weighed my options carefully as I loitered outside the classroom, procrastinating. I wasn't about to face Charlie again without some kind of social interaction to report. I knew I couldn't lie, though the thought of driving to Port Angeles and back alone\u2014being sure my odometer reflected the correct mileage, just in case he checked\u2014was very tempting. Jessica's mom was the biggest gossip in town, and Charlie was bound to run into Mrs. Stanley sooner rather than later. When he did, he would no doubt mention the trip. Lying was out. With a sigh, I shoved the door open. Mr. Varner gave me a dark look\u2014he'd already started the lecture. I hurried to my seat. Jessica didn't look up as I sat next to her. I was glad that I had fifty minutes to mentally prepare myself. This class flew by even faster than English. A small part of that speed was due to my goody-goody preparation this morning in the truck\u2014but mostly it stemmed from the fact that time always sped up when I was looking forward to something unpleasant. I grimaced when Mr. Varner dismissed the class five minutes early. He smiled like he was being nice.  \"Jess?\" My nose wrinkled as I cringed, waiting for her to turn on me. She twisted in her seat to face me, eyeing me incredulously. \"Are you talking to me, Bella?\" \"Of course.\" I widened my eyes to suggest innocence. \"What? Do you need help with Calculus?\" Her tone was a tad sour. \"No.\" I shook my head. \"Actually, I wanted to know if you would\u2026 go to the movies with me tonight? I really need a girls' night out.\" The words sounded stiff, like badly delivered lines, and she looked suspicious. \"Why are you asking me?\" she asked, still unfriendly. \"You're the first person I think of when I want girl time.\" I smiled, and I hoped the smile looked genuine. It was probably true. She was at least the first person I thought of when I wanted to avoid Charlie. It amounted to the same thing. She seemed a little mollified. \"Well, I don't know.\" \"Do you have plans?\" \"No\u2026 I guess I can go with you. What do you want to see?\" \"I'm not sure what's playing,\" I hedged. This was the tricky part. I racked my brain for a clue\u2014hadn't I heard someone talk about a movie recently? Seen a poster? \"How about that one with the female president?\" She looked at me oddly. \"Bella, that one's been out of the theater forever.\" \"Oh.\" I frowned. \"Is there anything you'd like to see?\" Jessica's natural bubbliness started to leak out in spite of herself as she thought out loud. \"Well, there's that new romantic comedy that's getting great reviews. I want to see that one. And my dad just saw Dead End and he really liked it.\" I grasped at the promising title. \"What's that one about?\" \"Zombies or something. He said it was the scariest thing he'd seen in years.\" \"That sounds perfect.\" I'd rather deal with real zombies than watch a romance. \"Okay.\" She seemed surprised by my response. I tried to remember if I liked scary movies, but I wasn't sure. \"Do you want me to pick you up after school?\" she offered. \"Sure.\" Jessica smiled at me with tentative friendliness before she left. My answering smile was just a little late, but I thought that she saw it. The rest of the day passed quickly, my thoughts focused on planning for tonight. I knew from experience that once I got Jessica talking, I would be able to get away with a few mumbled responses at the appropriate moments. Only minimal interaction would be required. The thick haze that blurred my days now was sometimes confusing. I was surprised when I found myself in my room, not clearly remembering the drive home from school or even opening the front door. But that didn't matter. Losing track of time was the most I asked from life. I didn't fight the haze as I turned to my closet. The numbness was more essential in some places than in others. I barely registered what I was looking at as I slid the door aside to reveal the pile of rubbish on the left side of my closet, under the clothes I never wore. My eyes did not stray toward the black garbage bag that held my present from that last birthday, did not see the shape of the stereo where it strained against the black plastic; I didn't think of the bloody mess my nails had been when I'd finished clawing it out of the dashboard. I yanked the old purse I rarely used off the nail it hung from, and shoved the door shut. Just then I heard a horn honking. I swiftly traded my wallet from my schoolbag into the purse. I was in a hurry, as if rushing would somehow make the night pass more quickly. I glanced at myself in the hall mirror before I opened the door, arranging my features carefully into a smile and trying to hold them there. \"Thanks for coming with me tonight,\" I told Jess as I climbed into the passenger seat, trying to infuse my tone with gratitude. It had been a while since I'd really thought about what I was saying to anyone besides Charlie. Jess was harder. I wasn't sure which were the right emotions to fake. \"Sure. So, what brought this on?\" Jess wondered as she drove down my street. \"Brought what on?\" \"Why did you suddenly decide\u2026 to go out?\" It sounded like she changed her question halfway through. I shrugged. \"Just needed a change.\" I recognized the song on the radio then, and quickly reached for the dial. \"Do you mind?\" I asked. \"No, go ahead.\" I scanned through the stations until I found one that was harmless. I peeked at Jess's expression as the new music filled the car. Her eyes squinted. \"Since when do you listen to rap?\" \"I don't know,\" I said. \"A while.\" \"You like this?\" she asked doubtfully. \"Sure.\" It would be much too hard to interact with Jessica normally if I had to work to tune out the music, too. I nodded my head, hoping I was in time with the beat. \"Okay\u2026\" She stared out the windshield with wide eyes. \"So what's up with you and Mike these days?\" I asked quickly. \"You see him more than I do.\" The question hadn't started her talking like I'd hoped it would. \"It's hard to talk at work,\" I mumbled, and then I tried again. \"Have you been out with anyone lately?\" \"Not really. I go out with Conner sometimes. I went out with Eric two weeks ago.\" She rolled her eyes, and I sensed a long story. I clutched at the opportunity. \"Eric Yorkie? Who asked who?\" She groaned, getting more animated. \"He did, of course! I couldn't think of a nice way to say no.\" \"Where did he take you?\" I demanded, knowing she would interpret my eagerness as interest. \"Tell me all about it.\" She launched into her tale, and I settled into my seat, more comfortable now. I paid strict attention, murmuring in sympathy and gasping in horror as called for. When she was finished with her Eric story, she continued into a Conner comparison without any prodding. The movie was playing early, so Jess thought we should hit the twilight showing and eat later. I was happy to go along with whatever she wanted; after all, I was getting what I wanted\u2014Charlie off my back. I kept Jess talking through the previews, so I could ignore them more easily. But I got nervous when the movie started. A young couple was walking along a beach, swinging hands and discussing their mutual affection with gooey falseness. I resisted the urge to cover my ears and start humming. I had not bargained for a romance. \"I thought we picked the zombie movie,\" I hissed to Jessica. \"This is the zombie movie.\" \"Then why isn't anyone getting eaten?\" I asked desperately. She looked at me with wide eyes that were almost alarmed. \"I'm sure that part's coming,\" she whispered. \"I'm getting popcorn. Do you want any?\" \"No, thanks.\" Someone shushed us from behind. I took my time at the concession counter, watching the clock and debating what percentage of a ninety-minute movie could be spent on romantic exposition. I decided ten minutes was more than enough, but I paused just inside the theater doors to be sure. I could hear horrified screams blaring from the speakers, so I knew I'd waited long enough. \"You missed everything,\" Jess murmured when I slid back into my seat. \"Almost everyone is a zombie now.\" \"Long line.\" I offered her some popcorn. She took a handful. The rest of the movie was comprised of gruesome zombie attacks and endless screaming from the handful of people left alive, their numbers dwindling quickly. I would have thought there was nothing in that to disturb me. But I felt uneasy, and I wasn't sure why at first. It wasn't until almost the very end, as I watched a haggard zombie shambling after the last shrieking survivor, that I realized what the problem was. The scene kept cutting between the horrified face of the heroine, and the dead, emotionless face of her pursuer, back and forth as it closed the distance. And I realized which one resembled me the most. I stood up. \"Where are you going? There's, like, two minutes left,\" Jess hissed. \"I need a drink,\" I muttered as I raced for the exit. I sat down on the bench outside the theater door and tried very hard not to think of the irony. But it was ironic, all things considered, that, in the end, I would wind up as a zombie. I hadn't seen that one coming. Not that I hadn't dreamed of becoming a mythical monster once\u2014just never a grotesque, animated corpse. I shook my head to dislodge that train of thought, feeling panicky. I couldn't afford to think about what I'd once dreamed of. It was depressing to realize that I wasn't the heroine anymore, that my story was over. Jessica came out of the theater doors and hesitated, probably wondering where the best place was to search for me. When she saw me, she looked relieved, but only for a moment. Then she looked irritated. \"Was the movie too scary for you?\" she wondered. \"Yeah,\" I agreed. \"I guess I'm just a coward.\" \"That's funny.\" She frowned. \"I didn't think you were scared\u2014I was screaming all the time, but I didn't hear you scream once. So I didn't know why you left.\" I shrugged. \"Just scared.\" She relaxed a little. \"That was the scariest movie I think I've ever seen. I'll bet we're going to have nightmares tonight.\" \"No doubt about that,\" I said, trying to keep my voice normal. It was inevitable that I would have nightmares, but they wouldn't be about zombies. Her eyes flashed to my face and away. Maybe I hadn't succeeded with the normal voice. \"Where do you want to eat?\" Jess asked. \"I don't care.\" \"Okay.\" Jess started talking about the male lead in the movie as we walked. I nodded as she gushed over his hotness, unable to remember seeing a non-zombie man at all. I didn't watch where Jessica was leading me. I was only vaguely aware that it was dark and quieter now. It took me longer than it should have to realize why it was quiet. Jessica had stopped babbling. I looked at her apologetically, hoping I hadn't hurt her feelings. Jessica wasn't looking at me. Her face was tense; she stared straight ahead and walked fast. As I watched, her eyes darted quickly to the right, across the road, and back again. I glanced around myself for the first time. We were on a short stretch of unlit sidewalk. The little shops lining the street were all locked up for the night, windows black. Half a block ahead, the streetlights started up again, and I could see, farther down, the bright golden arches of the McDonald's she was heading for. Across the street there was one open business. The windows were covered from inside and there were neon signs, advertisements for different brands of beer, glowing in front of them. The biggest sign, in brilliant green, was the name of the bar\u2014One-Eyed Pete's. I wondered if there was some pirate theme not visible from outside. The metal door was propped open; it was dimly lit inside, and the low murmur of many voices and the sound of ice clinking in glasses floated across the street. Lounging against the wall beside the door were four men. I glanced back at Jessica. Her eyes were fixed on the path ahead and she moved briskly. She didn't look frightened\u2014just wary, trying to not attract attention to herself. I paused without thinking, looking back at the four men with a strong sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. This was a different road, a different night, but the scene was so much the same. One of them was even short and dark. As I stopped and turned toward them, that one looked up in interest.  I stared back at him, frozen on the sidewalk. \"Bella?\" Jess whispered. \"What are you doing?\" I shook my head, not sure myself. \"I think I know them\u2026\" I muttered. What was I doing? I should be running from this memory as fast as I could, blocking the image of the four lounging men from my mind, protecting myself with the numbness I couldn't function without. Why was I stepping, dazed, into the street? It seemed too coincidental that I should be in Port Angeles with Jessica, on a dark street even. My eyes focused on the short one, trying to match the features to my memory of the man who had threatened me that night almost a year ago. I wondered if there was any way I would recognize the man, if it was really him. That particular part of that particular evening was just a blur. My body remembered it better than my mind did; the tension in my legs as I tried to decide whether to run or to stand my ground, the dryness in my throat as I struggled to build a decent scream, the tight stretch of skin across my knuckles as I clenched my hands into fists, the chills on the back of my neck when the dark-haired man called me \"sugar.\"\u2026 There was an indefinite, implied kind of menace to these men that had nothing to do with that other night. It sprung from the fact that they were strangers, and it was dark here, and they outnumbered us\u2014nothing more specific than that. But it was enough that Jessica's voice cracked in panic as she called after me. \"Bella, come on!\" I ignored her, walking slowly forward without ever making the conscious decision to move my feet. I didn't understand why, but the nebulous threat the men presented drew me toward them. It was a senseless impulse, but I hadn't felt any kind of impulse in so long\u2026 I followed it. Something unfamiliar beat through my veins. Adrenaline, I realized, long absent from my system, drumming my pulse faster and fighting against the lack of sensation. It was strange\u2014why the adrenaline when there was no fear? It was almost as if it were an echo of the last time I'd stood like this, on a dark street in Port Angeles with strangers. I saw no reason for fear. I couldn't imagine anything in the world that there was left to be afraid of, not physically at least. One of the few advantages of losing everything. I was halfway across the street when Jess caught up to me and grabbed my arm. \"Bella! You can't go in a bar!\" she hissed. \"I'm not going in,\" I said absently, shaking her hand off. \"I just want to see something\u2026\" \"Are you crazy?\" she whispered. \"Are you suicidal?\" That question caught my attention, and my eyes focused on her. \"No, I'm not.\" My voice sounded defensive, but it was true. I wasn't suicidal. Even in the beginning, when death unquestionably would have been a relief, I didn't consider it. I owed too much to Charlie. I felt too responsible for Renee. I had to think of them. And I'd made a promise not to do anything stupid or reckless. For all those reasons, I was still breathing. Remembering that promise. I felt a twinge of guilt.\u00a0 But what I was doing fight now didn't really count. It wasn't like I was taking a blade to my wrists. Jess's eyes were round, her mouth hung open. Her question about suicide had been rhetorical, I realized too late. \"Go eat,\" I encouraged her, waving toward the fast food. I didn't like the way she looked at me. \"I'll catch up in a minute.\" I turned away from her, back to the men who were watching us with amused, curious eyes. \"Bella, stop this right now!\" My muscles locked into place, froze me where I stood. Because it wasn't Jessica's voice that rebuked me now. It was a furious voice, a familiar voice, a beautiful voice\u2014soft like velvet even though it was irate. It was his voice\u2014I was exceptionally careful not to think his name\u2014and I was surprised that the sound of it did not knock me to my knees, did not curl me onto the pavement in a torture of loss. But there was no pain, none at all. In the instant that I heard his voice, everything was very clear. Like my head had\u00a0 suddenly surfaced out of some dark pool. I was more aware of everything\u2014sight, sound, the feel of the cold air that I hadn't noticed was blowing sharply against my face, the smells coming from the open bar door. I looked around myself in shock. \"Go back to Jessica,\" the lovely voice ordered, still angry. \"You promised\u2014nothing stupid.\" I was alone. Jessica stood a few feet from me, staring at me with frightened eyes. Against the wall, the strangers watched, confused, wondering what I was doing, standing there motionless in the middle of the street. I shook my head, trying to understand. I knew he wasn't there, and yet, he felt improbably close, close for the first time since\u2026 since the end. The anger in his voice was concern, the same anger that was once very familiar\u2014something I hadn't heard in what felt like a lifetime. \"Keep your promise.\" The voice was slipping away, as if the volume was being turned down on a radio. I began to suspect that I was having some kind of hallucination. Triggered, no doubt, by the memory\u2014the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, the strange familiarity of the situation. I ran through the possibilities quickly in my head. Option one: I was crazy. That was the layman's term for people who heard voices in their heads. Possible. Option two: My subconscious mind was giving me what it thought I wanted. This was wish fulfillment\u2014a momentary relief from pain by embracing the incorrect idea that he cared whether I lived or died. Projecting what he would have said if A) he were here, and B) he would be in any way bothered by something bad happening to me. Probable. I could see no option three, so I hoped it was the second option and this was just my subconscious running amuck, rather than something I would need to be hospitalized for. My reaction was hardly sane, though\u2014I was grateful. The sound of his voice was something that I'd feared I was losing, and so, more than anything else, I felt overwhelming gratitude that my unconscious mind had held onto that sound better than my conscious one had. I was not allowed to think of him. That was something I tried to be very strict about. Of course I slipped; I was only human. But I was getting better, and so the pain was something I could avoid for days at a time now. The tradeoff was the never-ending numbness. Between pain and nothing, I'd chosen nothing. I waited for the pain now. I was not numb\u2014my senses felt unusually intense after so many months of the haze\u2014but the normal pain held off. The only ache was the disappointment that his voice was fading. There was a second of choice. The wise thing would be to run away from this potentially destructive\u2014and certainly mentally unstable\u2014development. It would be stupid to encourage hallucinations. But his voice was fading. I took another step forward, testing. \"Bella, turn around,\" he growled. I sighed in relief. The anger was what I wanted to hear\u2014false, fabricated evidence that he cared, a dubious gift from my subconscious. Very few seconds had passed while I sorted this all out. My little audience watched, curious. It probably looked like I was just dithering over whether or not I was going to approach them. How could they guess that I was standing there enjoying an unexpected moment of insanity? \"Hi,\" one of the men called, his tone both confident and a bit sarcastic. He was fair-skinned and fair-haired, and he stood with the assurance of someone who thought of himself as quite good-looking. I couldn't tell whether he was or not. I was prejudiced. The voice in my head answered with an exquisite snarl. I smiled, and the confident man seemed to take that as encouragement. \"Can I help you with something? You look lost.\" He grinned and winked. I stepped carefully over the gutter, running with water that was black in the darkness. \"No. I'm not lost.\" Now that I was closer\u2014and my eyes felt oddly in focus\u2014I analyzed the short, dark man's face. It was not familiar in any way. I suffered a curious sensation of disappointment that this was not the terrible man who had tried to hurt me almost a year ago. The voice in my head was quiet now. The short man noticed my stare. \"Can I buy you a drink?\" he offered, nervous, seeming flattered that I'd singled him out to stare at. \"I'm too young,\" I answered automatically. He was baffled\u00a0 \u2014wondering why I had approached them. I felt compelled to explain. \"From across the street, you looked like someone I knew. Sorry, my mistake.\" The threat that had pulled me across the street had evaporated. These were not the dangerous men I remembered. They were probably nice guys. Safe. I lost interest. \"That's okay,\" the confident blonde said. \"Stay and hang out with us.\" \"Thanks, but I can't.\" Jessica was hesitating in the middle of the street, her eyes wide with outrage and betrayal. \"Oh, just a few minutes.\" I shook my head, and turned to rejoin Jessica. \"Let's go eat,\" I suggested, barely glancing at her. Though I appeared to be, for the moment, freed of the zombie abstraction, I was just as distant. My mind was preoccupied. The safe, numb deadness did not come back, and I got more anxious with every minute that passed without its return. \"What were you thinking?\" Jessica snapped. \"You don't know them\u2014they could have been psychopaths!\" I shrugged, wishing she would let it go. \"I just thought I knew the one guy.\" \"You are so odd, Bella Swan. I feel like I don't know who you are.\" \"Sorry.\" I didn't know what else to say to that. We walked to McDonald's in silence. I'd bet that she was wishing we'd taken her car instead of walking the short distance from the theater, so that she could use the drive-through. She was just as anxious now for this evening to be over as I had been from the beginning. I tried to start a conversation a few times while we ate, but Jessica was not cooperative. I must have really offended her. When we go back in the car, she tuned the stereo back to her favorite station and turned the volume too loud to allow easy conversation. I didn't have to struggle as hard as usual to ignore the music. Even though my mind, for once, was not carefully numb and empty, I had too much to think about to hear the lyrics. I waited for the numbness to return, or the pain. Because the pain must be coming. I'd broken my personal rules. Instead of shying away from the memories, I'd walked forward and greeted them. I'd heard his voice, so clearly, in my head. That was going to cost me, I was sure of it. Especially if I couldn't reclaim the haze to protect myself. I felt too alert, and that frightened me. But relief was still the strongest emotion in my body\u2014relief that came from the very core of my being. As much as I struggled not to think of him, I did not struggle to forget. I worried\u2014late in the night, when the exhaustion of sleep deprivation broke down my defenses\u2014that it was all slipping away. That my mind was a sieve, and I would someday not be able to remember the precise color of his eyes, the feel of his cool skin, or the texture of his voice. I could not think of them, but I must remember them. Because there was just one thing that I had to believe to be able to live\u2014I had to know that he existed. That was all. Everything else I could endure. So long as he existed. That's why I was more trapped in Forks than I ever had been before, why I'd fought with Charlie when he suggested a change. Honestly, it shouldn't matter; no one was ever coming back here. But if I were to go to Jacksonville, or anywhere else bright and unfamiliar, how could I be sure he was real? In a place where I could never imagine him, the conviction might fade\u2026 and that I could not live through. Forbidden to remember, terrified to forget; it was a hard line to walk. I was surprised when Jessica stopped the car in front of my house. The ride had not taken long, but, short as it seemed, I wouldn't have thought that Jessica could go that long without speaking. \"Thanks for going out with me, Jess,\" I said as I opened my door. \"That was\u2026fun.\" I hoped that fun was the appropriate word. \"Sure,\" she muttered. \"I'm sorry about\u2026 after the movie.\" \"Whatever, Bella.\" She glared out the windshield instead of looking at me. She seemed to be growing angrier rather than getting over it. \"See you Monday?\" \"Yeah. Bye.\" I gave up and shut the door. She drove away, still without looking at me. I'd forgotten her by the time I was inside. Charlie was waiting for me in the middle of the hall, his arms folded tight over his chest with his hands balled into fists. \"Hey, Dad,\" I said absentmindedly as I ducked around Charlie, heading for the stairs. I'd been thinking about him for too long, and I wanted to be upstairs before it caught up with me. \"Where have you been?\" Charlie demanded. I looked at my dad, surprised. \"I went to a movie in Port Angeles with Jessica. Like I told you this morning.\" \"Humph,\" he grunted. \"Is that okay?\u201d He studied my face, his eyes widening as if he saw something unexpected. \"Yeah, that's fine. Did you have fun?\" \"Sure,\" I said. \"We watched zombies eat people. It was great.\" His eyes narrowed. \"'Night, Dad.\" He let me pass. I hurried to my room. I lay in my bed a few minutes later, resigned as the pain finally made its appearance. It was a crippling thing, this sensation that a huge hole had been punched through my chest, excising my most vital organs and leaving ragged, unhealed gashes around the edges that continued to throb and bleed despite the passage of time. Rationally, I knew my lungs must still be intact, yet I gasped for air and my head spun like my efforts yielded me nothing. My heart must have been beating, too, but I couldn't hear the sound of my pulse in my ears; my hands felt blue with cold. I curled inward, hugging my ribs to hold myself together. I scrambled for my numbness, my denial, but it evaded me. And yet, I found I could survive. I was alert, I felt the pain\u2014the aching loss that radiated out from my chest, sending wracking waves of hurt through my limbs and head\u2014but it was manageable. I could live through it. It didn't feel like the pain had weakened over time, rather that I'd grown strong enough to bear it. Whatever it was that had happened tonight\u2014and whether it was the zombies, the\u00a0 adrenaline, or the hallucinations that were responsible\u2014it had woken me up. For the first time in a long time, I didn't know what to expect in the morning.",
