Nye is University Distinguished Service Professor at Harvard University, and author ofthe \"The Future of Power,\" which PublicAffairs press will publish in February. In 1993 and 1994 he was chairman of the National Intelligence Council, which coordinates intelligence estimates for the president. In 1994 and 1995, he served as assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs. Cambridge, Massachusetts (CNN) -- A century ago, the rise of Germany and the fear it created in Britain led to world war. Some analysts predict a similar fate from the rise of China and the fear that is creating in the United States. One should be skeptical about such dire projections. By 1900, Germany had surpassed Britain in industrial power, and Kaiser Wilhelm II was pursuing an adventurous, globally oriented foreign policy that was bound to bring about a clash with other great powers. In contrast, China still lags far behind the United States economically and militarily, and has focused its policies primarily on its region and on its economic development. While its \"market Leninist\" economic model (the so-called \"Beijing Consensus\") provides soft power in authoritarian countries, it has the opposite effect in many democracies. Soft power is the ability to produce preferred outcomes by attraction rather than coercion or payment, and China has announced major efforts to increase its soft power. Watch an interview with Joseph Nye Even if China's gross domestic product passes that of the United States around 2030 (as Goldman Sachs projects), the two economies would be equivalent in size, but not equal in composition. China would still have a vast underdeveloped countryside, and it will begin to face demographic problems from the delayed effects of the one child per couple policy it enforced in the 20th century. Moreover, as countries develop, there is a tendency for growth rates to slow. TED.com: Asia's rise...how and when Assuming a 6 percent Chinese growth and only 2 percent American growth after 2030, China would not equal the United States in per capita income until sometime in the second half of the century. China is a long way from posing the kind of challenge to America that the kaiser's Germany posed when it passed Britain at the beginning of the last century. Unlike India, which was born with a democratic constitution, China has not yet found a way to solve the problem of demands for political participation (if not democracy) that tend to accompany rising per capita income. The ideology of communism is long gone, and the legitimacy of the ruling party depends upon economic growth and ethnic Han nationalism. Premier Wen Jiabao talks of reform but faces conservative resistance. The Chinese political system suffers from a high level of corruption, and should the economy falter, it is vulnerable to political unrest. Whether China can develop a formula that can manage an expanding urban middle class, regional inequality, and resentment among ethnic minorities remains to be seen. Xi Jinping has been anointed the likely next leader (in 2012), but not even he knows how China's political future will evolve. The current generation of Chinese leaders, realizing that rapid economic growth is the key to domestic political stability, has focused on economic development and what they call a \"harmonious\" international environment that will not disrupt their country's growth. But generations change, power often creates hubris, and appetites sometimes grow with eating. Already, some younger party members and military men argue that China's success in recovery from the global financial crisis should lead to a greater political role. And the United States objected last summer when China defined its \"core interests\" as including the distant waters of the South China Sea. TED.com: Why nations should pursue \"soft power\" Whatever Chinese intentions are, it is doubtful that China will have the military capability to expel the United States from East Asia. The region has its own internal balance of powers, and in that context, many states welcome an American presence in the region. Chinese leaders will have to contend with the reactions of other countries as well as the constraints created by their own objectives of economic growth and the need for external markets and resources. Too aggressive a Chinese military posture could produce a countervailing coalition among its neighbors that would weaken both its hard and soft power. China's recent <em>overreaction</em> to a maritime collision near the disputed Senkaku islands led to a hardening of attitudes in Japan. A recent Pew poll of 16 countries around the world found a positive attitude towards China's economic rise, but not its military rise. The fact that China is not likely to become a peer competitor to the United States on a global basis does not mean that the dangers of conflict in Asia can be completely ruled out. But given the global challenges such as financial stability, cybersecurity, and climate change that both China and the United States will face, they have much to gain from working together. Unfortunately, hubris and nationalism among some Chinese and unnecessary fear of decline among some Americans make it difficult to assure this future.

            "en": "Does Beijing really want to \u201cbreak up\u201d India         Ananth Krishnan  What the <em>overreaction</em> in India to an anonymous post on an obscure Chinese website calling for \u201csplitting India\u201d reveals about the challenges of understanding China\u2019s changing information landscape.  Whoever the anonymous Internet user \u201cZhong Guo Zhuan Le Gang\u201d (literally, \u201cChinese strategist\u201d) is, he must be quite pleased with himself. Little more than a week ago, a post by him appeared on an obscure Chinese website calling for China to \u201cbreak up\u201d the \u201cHindu Religious State\u201d of India for its own strategic gains. The post was translated and analysed, with some significant errors, by a Chennai-based think-tank, following which reports appeared in the Indian media expressing outrage that \u201cBeijing\u201d had a secret plan to divide India by supporting separatist movements in Kashmir and the Northeast. Leave aside for a moment the contents of the post, which to most readers with even a little understanding of foreign policy reveals an inexperienced writer with poor understanding of India, far removed from a supposedly influential Chinese strategist. Also leave aside the question of whether having broken-up states on its borders with the troubled Xinjiang region and in north-east India even really suits Chinese interests. The real question to be asked here is why and how does an anonymous post by an insignificant Chinese blogger generate such attention and consternation in India? Part of the answer lies in the media reports that appeared last week, which made the following assumptions: an influential Chinese strategist must have been behind the suggestions; he must have had the tacit backing of Beijing since all opinion in China is controlled by the government; and that the website where this post appeared sounded influential enough for India to take notice and worry. But in these assumptions are fundamental misperceptions. For one, there is a tendency to assume every view expressed by a Chinese strategist or newspaper \u2013 let alone an anonymous blogger \u2014 is inextricably linked to Beijing and the Chinese government\u2019s views. This tendency is located in the prevalence of the idea of a monolith China and \u201cChinese\u201d view which dominates Indian perceptions. This was especially evident last week, when news reports in national newspapers, without exception, linked the claims made by the anonymous blogger to \u201cwhat Beijing thinks\u201d. This perception dates back to the 1970s and 1980s, when the only opinions coming out of China were voiced through one or two State-run organs, and often closely mirrored the Chinese government\u2019s views. The last decade has seen the emergence of a completely different information landscape in China. Yet the manner in which this information is processed and interpreted in India remains rooted in the past. The nineties saw the emergence of dozens of new newspapers in China, a few dozen think-tanks in Beijing and a proliferation of voices expressed through the Internet. Currently, there are four main avenues through which information emerges out of China. Their status and roles need spelling out, as understanding and evaluating the nature of this information is crucial for India to create a level of discourse that allows for a more layered analysis of China\u2019s opportunities and threats. Most significant is the official channel through China\u2019s Foreign Ministry, which voices China\u2019s official position on issues. The second, more complicated channel is print media. There are dozens of newspapers in Beijing, and most are State-owned. But each enjoys a unique relationship with both the government and the Communist Party (CPC), and consequently, their opinions need to be interpreted contextually. For instance, the People\u2019s Daily, the CPC\u2019s mouthpiece, often articulates the Party\u2019s stand, which does not necessarily reflect the Chinese government\u2019s official position. Recently, the paper ran a strong editorial aimed at India, crudely belittling India\u2019s political status and calling for a stronger Chinese stand on the border dispute and other issues. This was interpreted in India as the Chinese government changing its position. While the Chinese government on occasion does use the newspaper to articulate its views, the newspaper is more often used by different factions within the CPC in internal debates and has less impact on actual policy. For instance, some groups within the CPC favour a more hawkish attitude to India, and others in the government a more conciliatory position. The distinction between Party and Government is not often clear even in China. This poses a challenge for Indian observers to tease out what opinions really matter to the countries\u2019 relationship, and what opinions are no more than postures adopted for the sake of internal party politics and are less relevant to the countries\u2019 ties. The third category, also diverse, is think-tanks. In the last decade, dozens of think-tanks \u2014 many with similar sounding names, to add to the confusion \u2014 have emerged in China. The fourth and newest avenue of information is the Internet, through Chinese blogs and websites. Confusion between the last two categories was at the heart of last week\u2019s uproar. The post in question appeared on an important-sounding website calling itself the International Institute of Strategic Studies (which has no relation to the London-based think-tank of the same name). The Chennai Centre for China Studies, which first translated and analysed the post before it was circulated among the Indian media, assumed that this was a government-sponsored think-tank, and also wrongly claimed that this was linked to the China Institute for International Strategic Studies (CIISS), a Beijing think-tank. But a quick check revealed that the IISS website where the post appeared actually has no government ties, and is by no means an established Beijing think-tank \u2014 it\u2019s just a website. Scholars at the CIISS and other institutes said they hadn\u2019t even heard of it, and expressed amusement at the media circus that the obscure website had caused in India. The website\u2019s founder Kang Lingyi issued a clarification saying his website was independent and had no link to the government. What news reports did not mention was Mr. Kang, who is only in his twenties, represents a fringe firebrand nationalistic viewpoint that has in the past tried to stir public opinion against another neighbour of China\u2019s \u2014 Japan. Mr. Kang\u2019s views often reflect those of a section known in China as the \u201cFenqing\u201d \u2014 it literally translates to \u201cAngry Youth\u201d, but when pronounced slightly differently describes such youth in a far less kind way, one that\u2019s not fit to print. This reflects the position these views hold in the mainstream in China \u2014 and the error in assuming these fringe views mirror Beijing\u2019s position. But even the nationalistic Mr. Kang distanced himself from the post and stressed that in no way did his website approve of its message. News reports also claimed the write-up could not have been published without the permission of the Chinese authorities \u2014 another dubious claim tied to the simplistic notion that the Chinese government vets every opinion expressed on all of China\u2019s hundreds of political websites. The Chinese government blocks and censors numerous websites that are politically sensitive, discussing subjects like the Tiananmen Square protests or the Falun Gong. But suggesting that the government controls and moderates debates and political opinions in blogs and newspapers is a stretch. It also belies a lack of understanding of the changing nature of China\u2019s information landscape. China has 338 million Internet users and more than 100 million blogs and websites, such as the one where this post first appeared. It only takes a quick glance through half a dozen such sites \u2013 even \u201cinfluential\u201d ones - to look at the divergence of opinions and vibrancy of debates, with many voices even strongly criticising the Communist Party and its government. Yet the simplistic perception still endures in India that in authoritarian China, every analyst or writer must surely speak in the same voice. Interpreting information from these four avenues is further complicated by the fact that they are sometimes inter-linked. For instance, the Chinese government sometimes uses influential think-tanks to hint at changes in policy. Views and opinions from mainstream Chinese newspapers and think-tanks must indeed be taken seriously in India. But at the same time, a more nuanced understanding of China\u2019s information landscape is needed to avoid shrill hyper-reactions to anonymous bloggers and irrelevant fringe groups. This is crucial to creating a level of discourse in India that allows for a deeper, more meaningful engagement with China\u2019s opportunities and threats. http://www.hindu.com/2009/08/17/stories/2009081751020900.htm",

            "en": "4. NATURE I WAS HAVING A BAD WEEK. I knew that essentially nothing had changed. Okay, so Victoria had not given up, but had I ever dreamed for one moment that she had? Her reappearance had only confirmed what I\u2019d already known. No reason for fresh panic. In theory. Not panicking was easier said than done. Graduation was only a few weeks away, but I wondered if it wasn\u2019t a little foolish to sit around, weak and tasty, waiting for the next disaster. It seemed too dangerous to be human \u2014 just begging for trouble. Someone like me shouldn\u2019t be human. Someone with my luck ought to be a little less helpless. But no one would listen to me. Carlisle had said, \u201cThere are seven of us, Bella. And with Alice on our side, I don\u2019t think Victoria\u2019s going to catch us off guard. I think it\u2019s important, for Charlie\u2019s sake, that we stick with the original plan.\u201d Esme had said, \u201cWe\u2019d never allow anything to happen to you, sweetheart. You know that. Please don\u2019t be anxious.\u201d And then she\u2019d kissed my forehead. Emmett had said, \u201cI\u2019m really glad Edward didn\u2019t kill you. Everything\u2019s so much more fun with you around.\u201d Rosalie had glared at him. Alice had rolled her eyes and said, \u201cI\u2019m offended. You\u2019re not honestly worried about this, are you?\u201d \u201cIf it\u2019s no big deal, then why did Edward drag me to Florida?\u201d I\u2019d demanded. \u201cHaven\u2019t you noticed yet, Bella, that Edward is just the teeniest bit prone to <em>overreaction</em>?\u201d Jasper had silently erased all the panic and tension in my body with his curious talent of controlling emotional atmospheres. I\u2019d felt reassured, and let them talk me out of my desperate pleading. Of course, that calm had worn off as soon as Edward and I had walked out of the room. So the consensus was that I was just supposed to forget that a deranged vampire was stalking me, intent on my death. Go about my business. I did try. And surprisingly, there were other things almost as stressful to dwell on besides my status on the endangered species list. . . . Because Edward\u2019s response had been the most frustrating of them all. \u201cThat\u2019s between you and Carlisle,\u201d he\u2019d said. \u201cOf course, you know that I\u2019m willing to make it between you and me at any time that you wish. You know my condition.\u201d And he had smiled angelically. Ugh. I did know his condition. Edward had promised that he would change me himself whenever I wanted . . . just as long as I was married to him first. Sometimes I wondered if he was only pretending that he couldn\u2019t read my mind. How else had he struck upon the one condition that I would have trouble accepting? The one condition that would slow me down. All in all, a very bad week. And today was the worst day in it. It was always a bad day when Edward was away. Alice had foreseen nothing out of the ordinary this weekend, and so I\u2019d insisted that he take the opportunity to go hunting with his brothers. I knew how it bored him to hunt the easy, nearby prey. \u201cGo have fun,\u201d I\u2019d told him. \u201cBag a few mountain lions for me.\u201d I would never admit to him how hard it was for me when he was gone \u2014 how it brought back the abandonment nightmares. If he knew that, it would make him feel horrible and he would be afraid to ever leave me, even for the most necessary reasons. It had been like that in the beginning, when he\u2019d first returned from Italy. His golden eyes had turned black and he\u2019d suffered from his thirst more than it was already necessary that he suffer. So I put on a brave face and all but kicked him out the door whenever Emmett and Jasper wanted to go. I think he saw through me, though. A little. This morning there had been a note left on my pillow: I\u2019ll be back so soon you won\u2019t have time to miss me. Look after my heart \u2014 I\u2019ve left it with you. So now I had a big empty Saturday with nothing but my morning shift at Newton\u2019s Olympic Outfitters to distract me. And, of course, the oh-so-comforting promise from Alice. \u201cI\u2019m staying close to home to hunt. I\u2019ll only be fifteen minutes away if you need me. I\u2019ll keep an eye out for trouble.\u201d Translation: don\u2019t try anything funny just because Edward is gone. Alice was certainly just as capable of crippling my truck as Edward was. I tried to look on the bright side. After work, I had plans to help Angela with her announcements, so that would be a distraction. And Charlie was in an excellent mood due to Edward\u2019s absence, so I might as well enjoy that while it lasted. Alice would spend the night with me if I was pathetic enough to ask her to. And then tomorrow, Edward would be home. I would survive. Not wanting to be ridiculously early for work, I ate my breakfast slowly, one Cheerio at a time. Then, when I\u2019d washed the dishes, I arranged the magnets on the fridge into a perfect line. Maybe I was developing obsessive-compulsive disorder. The last two magnets \u2014 round black utilitarian pieces that were my favorites because they could hold ten sheets of paper to the fridge without breaking a sweat \u2014 did not want to cooperate with my fixation. Their polarities were reversed; every time I tried to line the last one up, the other jumped out of place. For some reason \u2014 impending mania, perhaps \u2014 this really irritated me. Why couldn\u2019t they just play nice? Stupid with stubbornness, I kept shoving them together as if I was expecting them to suddenly give up. I could have flipped one over, but that felt like losing. Finally, exasperated at myself more than the magnets, I pulled them from the fridge and held them together with two hands. It took a little effort \u2014 they were strong enough to put up a fight \u2014 but I forced them to coexist side-by-side. \u201cSee,\u201d I said out loud \u2014 talking to inanimate objects, never a good sign \u2014 \u201cThat\u2019s not so horrible, is it?\u201d I stood there like an idiot for a second, not quite able to admit that I wasn\u2019t having any lasting effect against scientific principles. Then, with a sigh, I put the magnets back on the fridge, a foot apart. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to be so inflexible,\u201d I muttered. It was still too early, but I decided I\u2019d better get out of the house before the inanimate objects started talking back. When I got to Newton\u2019s, Mike was methodically dry mopping the aisles while his mom arranged a new counter display. I caught them in the middle of an argument, unaware that I had arrived. \u201cBut it\u2019s the only time that Tyler can go,\u201d Mike complained. \u201cYou said after graduation \u2014 \u201cYou\u2019re just going to have to wait,\u201d Mrs. Newton snapped. \u201cYou and Tyler can think of something else to do. You are not going to Seattle until the police stop whatever it is that is going on there. I know Beth Crowley has told Tyler the same thing, so don\u2019t act like I\u2019m the bad guy \u2014 oh, good morning, Bella,\u201d she said when she caught sight of me, brightening her tone quickly. \u201cYou\u2019re early.\u201d Karen Newton was the last person I\u2019d think to ask for help in an outdoor sports equipment store. Her perfectly highlighted blond hair was always smoothed into an elegant twist on the back of her neck, her fingernails were polished by professionals, as were her toenails \u2014 visible through the strappy high heels that didn\u2019t resemble anything Newton\u2019s offered on the long row of hiking boots. \u201cLight traffic,\u201d I joked as I grabbed my hideous fluorescent orange vest out from under the counter. I was surprised that Mrs. Newton was as worked up about this Seattle thing as Charlie. I\u2019d thought he was going to extremes. \u201cWell, er . . .\u201d Mrs. Newton hesitated for a moment, playing uncomfortably with a stack of flyers she was arranging by the register. I stopped with one arm in my vest. I knew that look. When I\u2019d let the Newtons know that I wouldn\u2019t be working here this summer \u2014 abandoning them in their busiest season, in effect \u2014 they\u2019d started training Katie Marshall to take my place. They couldn\u2019t really afford both of us on the payroll at the same time, so when it looked like a slow day . . . \u201cI was going to call,\u201d Mrs. Newton continued. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re expecting a ton of business today.\u00a0 Mike and I can probably handle things. I\u2019m sorry you got up and drove out. . . .\u201d On a normal day, I would be ecstatic with this turn of events. Today . . . not so much. \u201cOkay,\u201d I sighed. My shoulders slumped. What was I going to do now? \u201cThat\u2019s not fair, Mom,\u201d Mike said. \u201cIf Bella wants to work \u2014\u201d \u201cNo, it\u2019s okay, Mrs. Newton. Really, Mike. I\u2019ve got finals to study for and stuff. . . .\u201d I didn\u2019t want to be a source of familial discord when they were already arguing. \u201cThanks, Bella. Mike, you missed aisle four. Um, Bella, do you mind throwing these flyers in a Dumpster on the way out? I told the girl who left them here that I\u2019d put them on the counter, but I really don\u2019t have the room.\u201d \u201cSure, no problem.\u201d I put my vest away, and then tucked the flyers under my arm and headed out into the misty rain. The Dumpster was around the side of Newton\u2019s, next to where we employees were supposed to park. I shuffled along, kicking pebbles petulantly on my way. I was about to fling the stack of bright yellow papers into the trash when the heading printed in bold across the top caught my eye. One word in particular seized my attention. I clutched the papers in both hands as I stared at the picture beneath the caption. A lump rose in my throat. SAVE THE OLYMPIC WOLF Under the words, there was a detailed drawing of a wolf in front of a fir tree, its head thrown back in the act of baying at the moon. It was a disconcerting picture; something about the wolf\u2019s plaintive posture made him look forlorn. Like he was howling in grief. And then I was running to my truck, the flyers still locked in my grip. Fifteen minutes \u2014 that\u2019s all I had. But it should be long enough. It was only fifteen minutes to La Push, and surely I would cross the boundary line a few minutes before I hit the town. My truck roared to life without any difficulty.  Alice couldn\u2019t have seen me doing this, because I hadn\u2019t been planning it. A snap decision, that was the key! And as long as I moved fast enough, I should be able to capitalize on it. I\u2019d thrown the damp flyers in my haste and they were scattered in a bright mess across the passenger seat \u2014 a hundred bolded captions, a hundred dark howling wolves outlined against the yellow background. I barreled down the wet highway, turning the windshield wipers on high and ignoring the groan of the ancient engine. Fifty-five was the most I could coax out of my truck, and I prayed it would be enough. I had no clue where the boundary line was, but I began to feel safer as I passed the first houses outside La Push. This must be beyond where Alice was allowed to follow. I\u2019d call her when I got to Angela\u2019s this afternoon, I reasoned, so that she\u2019d know I was fine. There was no reason for her to get worked up. She didn\u2019t need to be mad at me \u2014 Edward would be angry enough for two when he got back. My truck was positively wheezing by the time it grated to a stop in front of the familiar faded red house. The lump came back to my throat as I stared at the little place that had once been my refuge. It had been so long since I\u2019d been here. Before I could cut the engine, Jacob was standing in the door, his face blank with shock. In the sudden silence when the truck-roar died, I heard him gasp. \u201cBella?\u201d \u201cHey, Jake!\u201d \u201cBella!\u201d he yelled back, and the smile I\u2019d been waiting for stretched across his face like the sun breaking free of the clouds. His teeth gleamed bright against his russet skin. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it!\u201d He ran to the truck and half-yanked me through the open door, and then we were both jumping up and down like kids. \u201cHow did you get here?\u201d \u201cI snuck out!\u201d \u201cAwesome!\u201d \u201cHey, Bella!\u201d Billy had rolled himself into the doorway to see what all the commotion was about. \u201cHey, Bil \u2014!\u201d Just then my air choked off \u2014 Jacob grabbed me up in a bear hug too tight to breathe and swung me around in a circle. \u201cWow, it\u2019s good to see you here!\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t . . . breathe,\u201d I gasped. He laughed and put me down. \u201cWelcome back, Bella,\u201d he said, grinning. And the way he said the words made it sound like welcome home . We started walking, too keyed up to sit still in the house. Jacob was practically bouncing as he moved, and I had to remind him a few times that my legs weren\u2019t ten feet long. As we walked, I felt myself settling into another version of myself, the self I had been with Jacob. A little younger, a little less responsible. Someone who might, on occasion, do something really stupid for no good reason. Our exuberance lasted through the first few topics of conversation: how we were doing, what we were up to, how long I had, and what had brought me here. When I hesitantly told him about the wolf flyer, his bellowing laugh echoed back from the trees. But then, as we ambled past the back of the store and shoved through the thick scrub that ringed the far edge of First Beach, we got to the hard parts. All too soon we had to talk about the reasons behind our long separation, and I watched as the face of my friend hardened into the bitter mask that was already too familiar. \u201cSo what\u2019s the story, anyway?\u201d Jacob asked me, kicking a piece of driftwood out of his way with too much force. It sailed over the sand and then clattered against the rocks. \u201cI mean, since the last time we . . . well, before, you know . . .\u201d He struggled for the words. He took a deep breath and tried again. \u201cWhat I\u2019m asking is . . . everything is just back to the way it was before he left? You forgave him for all of that?\u201d I took a deep breath. \u201cThere was nothing to forgive.\u201d I wanted to skip past this part, the betrayals, the accusations, but I knew that we had to talk it through before we\u2019d be able to move on to anything else. Jacob\u2019s face puckered up like he\u2019d just licked a lemon. \u201cI wish Sam had taken a picture when he found you that night last September. It would be exhibit A.\u201d \u201cNobody\u2019s on trial.\u201d \u201cMaybe somebody should be.\u201d \u201cNot even you would blame him for leaving, if you knew the reason why.\u201d He glared at me for a few seconds. \u201cOkay,\u201d he challenged acidly. \u201cAmaze me.\u201d His hostility was wearing on me \u2014 chafing against the raw; it hurt to have him angry with me. It reminded me of the bleak afternoon, long ago, when \u2014 under orders from Sam \u2014 he\u2019d told me we couldn\u2019t be friends. I took a second to compose myself. \u201cEdward left me last fall because he didn\u2019t think I should be hanging out with vampires. He thought it would be healthier for me if he left.\u201d Jacob did a double take. He had to scramble for a minute. Whatever he\u2019d been planning to say, it clearly no longer applied. I was glad he didn\u2019t know the catalyst behind Edward\u2019s decision. I could only imagine what he\u2019d think if he knew Jasper had tried to kill me. \u201cHe came back, though, didn\u2019t he?\u201d Jacob muttered. \u201cToo bad he can\u2019t stick to a decision.\u201d \u201cIf you remember,I went and got him .\u201d Jacob stared at me for a moment, and then he backed off. His face relaxed, and his voice was calmer when he spoke. \u201cThat\u2019s true. So I never did get the story. What happened?\u201d I hesitated, biting my lip. \u201cIs it a secret?\u201d His voice took on a taunting edge. \u201cAre you not allowed to tell me?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I snapped. \u201cIt\u2019s just a really long story.\u201d Jacob smiled, arrogant, and turned to walk up the beach, expecting me to follow. It was no fun being with Jacob if he was going to act like this. I trailed behind him automatically, not sure if I shouldn\u2019t turn around and leave. I was going to have to face Alice, though, when I got home. . . . I supposed I wasn\u2019t in any rush. Jacob walked to a huge, familiar piece of driftwood \u2014 an entire tree, roots and all, bleached white and beached deep in the sand; it was our tree, in a way. Jacob sat down on the natural bench, and patted the space next to him. \u201cI don\u2019t mind long stories. Is there any action?\u201d I rolled my eyes as I sat next to him. \u201cThere\u2019s some action,\u201d I allowed. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be real horror without action.\u201d \u201cHorror!\u201d I scoffed. \u201cCan you listen, or will you be interrupting me with rude comments about my friends?\u201d He pretended to lock his lips and then threw the invisible key over his shoulder. I tried not to smile, and failed. \u201cI\u2019ll have to start with the stuff you were already there for,\u201d I decided, working to organize the stories in my head before I began. Jacob raised his hand. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand much that was going on at the time.\u201d \u201cYeah, well, it gets complicated, so pay attention. You know how Alice sees things?\u201d I took his scowl \u2014 the wolves weren\u2019t thrilled that the legends of vampires possessing supernatural gifts were true \u2014 for a yes, and proceeded with the account of my race through Italy to rescue Edward. I kept it as succinct as possible \u2014 leaving out anything that wasn\u2019t essential. I tried to read Jacob\u2019s reactions, but his face was enigmatic as I explained how Alice had seen Edward plan to kill himself when he\u2019d heard that I was dead. Sometimes Jacob seemed so deep in thought, I wasn\u2019t sure if he was listening. He only interrupted one time. \u201cThe fortune-telling bloodsucker can\u2019t see us?\u201d he echoed, his face both fierce and gleeful. \u201cSeriously? That\u2019s excellent !\u201d I clenched my teeth together, and we sat in silence, his face expectant as he waited for me to continue. I glared at him until he realized his mistake. \u201cOops!\u201d he said. \u201cSorry.\u201d He locked his lips again. His response was easier to read when I got to the part about the Volturi. His teeth clenched together, goose bumps rose on his arms, and his nostrils flared. I didn\u2019t go into specifics, I just told him that Edward had talked us out of trouble, without revealing the promise we\u2019d had to make, or the visit we were anticipating. Jacob didn\u2019t need to have my nightmares. \u201cNow you know the whole story,\u201d I concluded. \u201cSo it\u2019s your turn to talk. What happened while I was with my mom this weekend?\u201d I knew Jacob would give me more details than Edward had. He wasn\u2019t afraid of scaring me. Jacob leaned forward, instantly animated. \u201cSo Embry and Quil and I were running patrol on Saturday night, just routine stuff, when out of nowhere \u2014 bam!\u201d He threw his arms out, impersonating an explosion. \u201cThere it is \u2014 a fresh trail, not fifteen minutes old. Sam wanted us to wait for him, but I didn\u2019t know you were gone, and I didn\u2019t know if your bloodsuckers were keeping an eye on you or not. So we took off after her at full speed, but she\u2019d crossed the treaty line before we caught up. We spread out along the line, hoping she\u2019d cross back over. It was frustrating, let me tell you.\u201d He wagged his head and his hair \u2014 growing out from the short crop he\u2019d adopted when he\u2019d joined the pack \u2014 flopped into his eyes. \u201cWe ended up too far south. The Cullens chased her back to our side just a few miles north of us. Would have been the perfect ambush if we\u2019d known where to wait.\u201d He shook his head, grimacing now. \u201cThat\u2019s when it got dicey. Sam and the others caught up to her before we did, but she was dancing right along the line, and the whole coven was right there on the other side. The big one, what\u2019s-his-name \u2014\u201d \u201cEmmett.\u201d \u201cYeah, him. He made a lunge for her, but that redhead is fast! He flew right behind her and almost rammed into Paul. So, Paul . . . well, you know Paul.\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cLost his focus. Can\u2019t say that I blame him \u2014 the big bloodsucker was right on top of him. He sprang \u2014 hey, don\u2019t give me that look. The vampire was on our land.\u201d I tried to compose my face so that he would go on. My nails were digging into my palms with the stress of the story, even though I knew it had turned out fine. \u201cAnyway, Paul missed, and the big one got back on his side. But by then the, er, well the, uh, blonde . . .\u201d Jacob\u2019s expression was a comical mix of disgust and unwilling admiration as he tried to come up with a word to describe Edward\u2019s sister. \u201cRosalie.\u201d \u201cWhatever. She got real territorial, so Sam and I fell back to get Paul\u2019s flanks. Then their leader and the other blond male \u2014\u201d \u201cCarlisle and Jasper.\u201d He gave me an exasperated look. \u201cYou know I don\u2019t really care. Anyway, so Carlisle spoke to Sam, trying to calm things down. Then it was weird, because everyone got really calm really fast. It was that other one you told me about, messing with our heads. But even though we knew what he was doing, we couldn\u2019t not be calm.\u201d \u201cYeah, I know how it feels.\u201d \u201cReally annoying, that\u2019s how it feels. Only you can\u2019t be annoyed until afterwards.\u201d He shook his head angrily. \u201cSo Sam and the head vamp agreed that Victoria was the priority, and we started after her again.  Carlisle gave us the line, so that we could follow the scent properly, but then she hit the cliffs just north of Makah country, right where the line hugs the coast for a few miles. She took off into the water again. The big one and the calm one wanted permission to cross the line to go after her, but of course we said no.\u201d \u201cGood. I mean, you were being stupid, but I\u2019m glad. Emmett\u2019s never cautious enough. He could have gotten hurt.\u201d Jacob snorted. \u201cSo did your vampire tell you we attacked for no reason and his totally innocent coven \u2014\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I interrupted. \u201cEdward told me the same story, just without quite as many details.\u201d \u201cHuh,\u201d Jacob said under his breath, and he bent over to pick up a rock from among the millions of pebbles at our feet. With a casual flick, he sent it flying a good hundred meters out into the bay. \u201cWell, she\u2019ll be back, I guess. We\u2019ll get another shot at her.\u201d I shuddered; of course she would be back. Would Edward really tell me next time? I wasn\u2019t sure. I\u2019d have to keep an eye on Alice, to look for the signs that the pattern was about to repeat. . . . Jacob didn\u2019t seem to notice my reaction. He was staring across the waves with a thoughtful expression on his face, his broad lips pursed. \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d I asked after a long, quiet time. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about what you told me. About when the fortune-teller saw you cliff jumping and thought you\u2019d committed suicide, and how it all got out of control. . . . Do you realize that if you had just waited for me like you were supposed to, then the bl \u2014Alice wouldn\u2019t have been able to see you jump? Nothing would have changed. We\u2019d probably be in my garage right now, like any other Saturday. There wouldn\u2019t be any vampires in Forks, and you and me . . .\u201d He trailed off, deep in thought. It was disconcerting the way he said this, like it would be a good thing to have no vampires in Forks. My heart thumped unevenly at the emptiness of the picture he painted. \u201cEdward would have come back anyway.\u201d \u201cAre you sure about that?\u201d he asked, belligerent again as soon as I spoke Edward\u2019s name. \u201cBeing apart . . . It didn\u2019t work out so well for either of us.\u201d He started to say something, something angry from his expression, but he stopped himself, took a breath, and began again. \u201cDid you know Sam is mad at you?\u201d \u201cMe?\u201d It took me a second. \u201cOh. I see. He thinks they would have stayed away if I wasn\u2019t here.\u201d \u201cNo. That\u2019s not it.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s his problem then?\u201d Jacob leaned down to scoop up another rock. He turned it over and over in his fingers; his eyes were riveted on the black stone while he spoke in a low voice. \u201cWhen Sam saw . . . how you were in the beginning, when Billy told them how Charlie worried when you didn\u2019t get better, and then when you started jumping off cliffs . . .\u201d I made a face. No one was ever going to let me forget that. Jacob\u2019s eyes flashed up to mine. \u201cHe thought you were the one person in the world with as much reason to hate the Cullens as he does. Sam feels sort of . . . betrayed that you would just let them back into your life like they never hurt you.\u201d I didn\u2019t believe for a second that Sam was the only one who felt that way. And the acid in my voice now was for both of them. \u201cYou can tell Sam to go right to \u2014\u201d \u201cLook at that,\u201d Jacob interrupted me, pointing to an eagle in the act of plummeting down toward the ocean from an incredible height. It checked itself at the last minute, only its talons breaking the surface of the waves, just for an instant. Then it flapped away, its wings straining against the load of the huge fish it had snagged. \u201cYou see it everywhere,\u201d Jacob said, his voice suddenly distant. \u201cNature taking its course \u2014 hunter and prey, the endless cycle of life and death.\u201d I didn\u2019t understand the point of the nature lecture; I guessed that he was just trying to change the subject. But then he looked down at me with dark humor in his eyes. \u201cAnd yet, you don\u2019t see the fish trying to plant a kiss on the eagle. You never see that .\u201d He grinned a mocking grin. I grinned back tightly, though the acid taste was still in my mouth. \u201cMaybe the fish was trying,\u201d I suggested. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell what a fish is thinking. Eagles are good-looking birds, you know.\u201d \u201cIs that what it comes down to?\u201d His voice was abruptly sharper. \u201cGood looks?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be stupid, Jacob.\u201d \u201cIs it the money, then?\u201d he persisted. \u201cThat\u2019s nice,\u201d I muttered, getting up from the tree. \u201cI\u2019m flattered that you think so much of me.\u201d I turned my back on him and paced away. \u201cAw, don\u2019t get mad.\u201d He was right behind me; he caught my wrist and spun me around. \u201cI\u2019m serious!\u00a0 I\u2019m trying to understand here, and I\u2019m coming up blank.\u201d His eyebrows pushed together angrily, and his eyes were black in their deep shadow. \u201cI love him . Not because he\u2019s beautiful or because he\u2019s rich !\u201d I spat the word at Jacob. \u201cI\u2019d much rather he weren\u2019t either one. It would even out the gap between us just a little bit \u2014 because he\u2019d still be the most loving and unselfish and brilliant and decent person I\u2019ve ever met. Of course I love him. How hard is that to understand?\u201d \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to understand.\u201d \u201cPlease enlighten me, then, Jacob.\u201d I let the sarcasm flow thick. \u201cWhat is a valid reason for someone to love someone else? Since apparently I\u2019m doing it wrong.\u201d \u201cI think the best place to start would be to look within your own species. That usually works.\u201d \u201cWell, that just sucks!\u201d I snapped. \u201cI guess I\u2019m stuck with Mike Newton after all.\u201d Jacob flinched back and bit his lip. I could see that my words had hurt him, but I was too mad to feel bad about that yet. He dropped my wrist and folded his arms across his chest, turning from me to glare toward the ocean. \u201cI\u2019m human,\u201d he muttered, his voice almost inaudible. \u201cYou\u2019re not as human as Mike,\u201d I continued ruthlessly. \u201cDo you still think that\u2019s the most important consideration?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not the same thing.\u201d Jacob didn\u2019t look away from the gray waves. \u201cI didn\u2019t choose this.\u201d I laughed once in disbelief. \u201cDo you think Edward did? He didn\u2019t know what was happening to him any more than you did. He didn\u2019t exactly sign up for this.\u201d Jacob was shaking his head back and forth with a small, quick movement. \u201cYou know, Jacob, you\u2019re awfully self-righteous \u2014 considering that you\u2019re a werewolf and all.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not the same,\u201d Jacob repeated, glowering at me. \u201cI don\u2019t see why not. You could be a bit more understanding about the Cullens. You have no idea how truly good they are \u2014 to the core, Jacob.\u201d He frowned more deeply. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t exist. Their existence goes against nature.\u201d I stared at him for a long moment with one eyebrow raised incredulously. It was a while before he noticed. \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cSpeaking of unnatural . . . ,\u201d I hinted. \u201cBella,\u201d he said, his voice slow and different. Aged. I realized that he sounded suddenly older than me \u2014 like a parent or a teacher. \u201cWhat I am was born in me. It\u2019s a part of who I am, who my family is, who we all are as a tribe \u2014 it\u2019s the reason why we\u2019re still here. \u201cBesides that\u201d \u2014 he looked down at me, his black eyes unreadable \u2014 \u201cI am still human.\u201d He picked up my hand and pressed it to his fever-warm chest. Through his t-shirt, I could feel the steady beating of his heart under my palm. \u201cNormal humans can\u2019t throw motorcycles around the way you can.\u201d He smiled a faint, half-smile. \u201cNormal humans run away from monsters, Bella. And I never claimed to be normal. Just human.\u201d Staying angry with Jacob was too much work. I started to smile as I pulled my hand away from his chest. \u201cYou look plenty human to me,\u201d I allowed. \u201cAt the moment.\u201d \u201cI feel human.\u201d He stared past me, his face far away. His lower lip trembled, and he bit down on it hard. \u201cOh, Jake,\u201d I whispered, reaching for his hand. This was why I was here. This was why I would take whatever reception waited for me when I got back. Because, underneath all the anger and the sarcasm, Jacob was in pain. Right now, it was very clear in his eyes. I didn\u2019t know how to help him, but I knew I had to try. It was more than that I owed him. It was because his pain hurt me, too. Jacob had become a part of me, and there was no changing that now.",

            "en": "24           24. AN IMPASSE My eyes opened to a bright, white light. I was in an unfamiliar room, a white room. The wall beside me was covered in long vertical blinds; over my head, the glaring lights blinded me. I was propped up on a hard, uneven bed \u2014 a bed with rails. The pillows were flat and lumpy. There was an annoying beeping sound somewhere close by. I hoped that meant I was still alive. Death shouldn't be this uncomfortable.  My hands were all twisted up with clear tubes, and something was taped across my face, under my nose. I lifted my hand to rip it off. \"No, you don't.\" And cool fingers caught my hand. \"Edward?\" I turned my head slightly, and his exquisite face was just inches from mine, his chin resting on the edge of my pillow. I realized again that I was alive, this time with gratitude and elation. \"Oh, Edward, I'm so sorry!\" \"Shhhh,\" he shushed me. \"Everything's all right now.\" \"What happened?\" I couldn't remember clearly, and my mind rebelled against me as I tried to recall. \"I was almost too late. I could have been too late,\" he whispered, his voice tormented. \"I was so stupid, Edward. I thought he had my mom.\" \"He tricked us all.\" \"I need to call Charlie and my mom,\" I realized through the haze. \"Alice called them. Ren\u00e9e is here \u2014 well, here in the hospital. She's getting something to eat right now.\" \"She's here?\" I tried to sit up, but the spinning in my head accelerated, and his hand pushed me gently down onto the pillows. \"She'll be back soon,\" he promised. \"And you need to stay still.\" \"But what did you tell her?\" I panicked. I had no interest in being soothed. My mom was here and I was recovering from a vampire attack. \"Why did you tell her I'm here?\" \"You fell down two flights of stairs and through a window.\" He paused.\u00a0 \"You have to admit, it could happen.\" I sighed, and it hurt. I stared down at my body under the sheet, the huge lump that was my leg. \"How bad am I?\" I asked. \"You have a broken leg, four broken ribs, some cracks in your skull, bruises covering every inch of your skin, and you've lost a lot of blood.  They gave you a few transfusions. I didn't like it \u2014 it made you smell all wrong for a while.\" \"That must have been a nice change for you.\" \"No, I like how you smell.\" \"How did you do it?\" I asked quietly. He knew what I meant at once. \"I'm not sure.\" He looked away from my wondering eyes, lifting my gauze-wrapped hand from the bed and holding it gently in his, careful not to disrupt the wire connecting me to one of the monitors. I waited patiently for the rest. He sighed without returning my gaze. \"It was impossible\u2026 to stop,\" he whispered. \"Impossible. But I did.\" He looked up finally, with half a smile. \"I must love you.\" \"Don't I taste as good as I smell?\" I smiled in response. That hurt my face. \"Even better \u2014 better than I'd imagined.\" \"I'm sorry,\" I apologized. He raised his eyes to the ceiling. \"Of all the things to apologize for.\" \"What should I apologize for?\" \"For very nearly taking yourself away from me forever.\" \"I'm sorry,\" I apologized again. \"I know why you did it.\" His voice was comforting. \"It was still irrational, of course. You should have waited for me, you should have told me.\" \"You wouldn't have let me go.\" \"No,\" he agreed in a grim tone, \"I wouldn't.\" Some very unpleasant memories were beginning to come back to me. I shuddered, and then winced. He was instantly anxious. \"Bella, what's wrong?\" \"What happened to James?\" \"After I pulled him off you, Emmett and Jasper took care of him.\" There was a fierce note of regret in his voice. This confused me. \"I didn't see Emmett and Jasper there.\" \"They had to leave the room\u2026 there was a lot of blood.\" \"But you stayed.\" \"Yes, I stayed.\" \"And Alice, and Carlisle\u2026\" I said in wonder. \"They love you, too, you know.\" A flash of painful images from the last time I'd seen Alice reminded me of something. \"Did Alice see the tape?\" I asked anxiously. \"Yes.\" A new sound darkened his voice, a tone of sheer hatred. \"She was always in the dark, that's why she didn't remember.\" \"I know. She understands now.\" His voice was even, but his face was black with fury. I tried to reach his face with my free hand, but something stopped me. I glanced down to see the IV pulling at my hand. \"Ugh.\" I winced. \"What is it?\" he asked anxiously \u2014 distracted, but not enough. The bleakness did not entirely leave his eyes. \"Needles,\" I explained, looking away from the one in my hand. I concentrated on a warped ceiling tile and tried to breathe deeply despite the ache in my ribs. \"Afraid of a needle,\" he muttered to himself under his breath, shaking his head. \"Oh, a sadistic vampire, intent on torturing her to death, sure, no problem, she runs off to meet him. An IV, on the other hand\u2026\" I rolled my eyes. I was pleased to discover that this reaction, at least, was pain-free. I decided to change the subject. \"Why are you here?\" I asked. He stared at me, first confusion and then hurt touching his eyes. His brows pulled together as he frowned. \"Do you want me to leave?\" \"No!\" I protested, horrified by the thought. \"No, I meant, why does my mother think you're here? I need to have my story straight before she gets back.\" \"Oh,\" he said, and his forehead smoothed back into marble. \"I came to Phoenix to talk some sense into you, to convince you to come back to Forks.\" His wide eyes were so earnest and sincere, I almost believed him myself. \"You agreed to see me, and you drove out to the hotel where I was staying with Carlisle and Alice \u2014 of course I was here with parental supervision,\" he inserted virtuously, \"but you tripped on the stairs on the way to my room and\u2026 well, you know the rest. You don't need to remember any details, though; you have a good excuse to be a little muddled about the finer points.\" I thought about it for a moment. \"There are a few flaws with that story. Like no broken windows.\" \"Not really,\" he said. \"Alice had a little bit too much fun fabricating evidence. It's all been taken care of very convincingly \u2014 you could probably sue the hotel if you wanted to. You have nothing to worry about,\" he promised, stroking my cheek with the lightest of touches. \"Your only job now is to heal.\" I wasn't so lost to the soreness or the fog of medication that I didn't respond to his touch. The beeping of the monitor jumped around erratically \u2014 now he wasn't the only one who could hear my heart misbehave. \"That's going to be embarrassing,\" I muttered to myself. He chuckled, and a speculative look came into his eye. \"Hmm, I wonder\u2026\" He leaned in slowly; the beeping noise accelerated wildly before his lips even touched me. But when they did, though with the most gentle of pressure, the beeping stopped altogether. He pulled back abruptly, his anxious expression turning to relief as the monitor reported the restarting of my heart. \"It seems that I'm going to have to be even more careful with you than usual.\" He frowned. \"I was not finished kissing you,\" I complained. \"Don't make me come over there.\" He grinned, and bent to press his lips lightly to mine. The monitor went wild. But then his lips were taut. He pulled away. \"I think I hear your mother,\" he said, grinning again. \"Don't leave me,\" I cried, an irrational surge of panic flooding through me. I couldn't let him go \u2014 he might disappear from me again. He read the terror in my eyes for a short second. \"I won't,\" he promised solemnly, and then he smiled. \"I'll take a nap.\" He moved from the hard plastic chair by my side to the turquoise faux-leather recliner at the foot of my bed, leaning it all the way back, and closing his eyes. He was perfectly still. \"Don't forget to breathe,\" I whispered sarcastically. He took a deep breath, his eyes still closed. I could hear my mother now. She was talking to someone, maybe a nurse, and she sounded tired and upset. I wanted to jump out of the bed and run to her, to calm her, promise that everything was fine. But I wasn't in any sort of shape for jumping, so I waited impatiently. The door opened a crack, and she peeked through. \"Mom!\" I whispered, my voice full of love and relief. She took in Edward's still form on the recliner, and tiptoed to my bedside. \"He never leaves, does he?\" she mumbled to herself. \"Mom, I'm so glad to see you!\" She bent down to hug me gently, and I felt warm tears falling on my cheeks. \"Bella, I was so upset!\" \"I'm sorry, Mom. But everything's fine now, it's okay,\" I comforted her. \"I'm just glad to finally see your eyes open.\" She sat on the edge of my bed. I suddenly realized I didn't have any idea when it was. \"How long have they been closed?\" \"It's Friday, hon, you've been out for a while.\" \"Friday?\" I was shocked. I tried to remember what day it had been when\u2026 but I didn't want to think about that. \"They had to keep you sedated for a while, honey \u2014 you've got a lot of injuries.\" \"I know.\" I could feel them. \"You're lucky Dr. Cullen was there. He's such a nice man\u2026 very young, though. And he looks more like a model than a doctor\u2026\" \"You met Carlisle?\" \"And Edward's sister Alice. She's a lovely girl.\" \"She is,\" I agreed wholeheartedly. She glanced over her shoulder at Edward, lying with his eyes closed in the chair. \"You didn't tell me you had such good friends in Forks.\" I cringed, and then moaned. \"What hurts?\" she demanded anxiously, turning back to me. Edward's eyes flashed to my face. \"It's fine,\" I assured them. \"I just have to remember not to move.\" He lapsed back into his phony slumber. I took advantage of my mother's momentary distraction to keep the subject from returning to my less-than-candid behavior. \"Where's Phil?\" I asked quickly. \"Florida \u2014 oh, Bella! You'll never guess! Just when we were about to leave, the best news!\" \"Phil got signed?\" I guessed. \"Yes! How did you guess! The Suns, can you believe it?\" \"That's great, Mom,\" I said as enthusiastically as I could manage, though I had little idea what that meant. \"And you'll like Jacksonville so much,\" she gushed while I stared at her vacantly. \"I was a little bit worried when Phil started talking about Akron, what with the snow and everything, because you know how I hate the cold, but now Jacksonville! It's always sunny, and the humidity really isn't that bad. We found the cutest house, yellow, with white trim, and a porch just like in an old movie, and this huge oak tree, and it's just a few minutes from the ocean, and you'll have your own bathroom \u2014\" \"Wait, Mom!\" I interrupted. Edward still had his eyes closed, but he looked too tense to pass as asleep. \"What are you talking about? I'm not going to Florida. I live in Forks.\" \"But you don't have to anymore, silly,\" she laughed. \"Phil will be able to be around so much more now\u2026 we've talked about it a lot, and what I'm going to do is trade off on the away games, half the time with you, half the time with him.\" \"Mom.\" I hesitated, wondering how best to be diplomatic about this. \"I want to live in Forks. I'm already settled in at school, and I have a couple of girlfriends\" \u2014 she glanced toward Edward again when I reminded her of friends, so I tried another direction \u2014 \"and Charlie needs me. \u00a0He's just all alone up there, and he can't cook at all.\" \"You want to stay in Forks?\" she asked, bewildered. The idea was inconceivable to her. And then her eyes flickered back toward Edward.  \"Why?\" \"I told you \u2014 school, Charlie \u2014 ouch!\" I'd shrugged. Not a good idea. .  Her hands fluttered helplessly over me, trying to find a safe place to pat. She made do with my forehead; it was unbandaged. \"Bella, honey, you hate Forks,\" she reminded me. \"It's not so bad.\" She frowned and looked back and forth between Edward and me, this time very deliberately. \"Is it this boy?\" she whispered. I opened my mouth to lie, but her eyes were scrutinizing my face, and I knew she would see through that. \"He's part of it,\" I admitted. No need to confess how big a part. \"So, have you had a chance to talk with Edward?\" I asked. \"Yes.\" She hesitated, looking at his perfectly still form. \"And I want to talk to you about that.\" Uh-oh. \"What about?\" I asked. \"I think that boy is in love with you,\" she accused, keeping her voice low. \"I think so, too,\" I confided. \"And how do you feel about him?\" She only poorly concealed the raging curiosity in her voice. I sighed, looking away. As much as I loved my mom, this was not a conversation I wanted to have with her. \"I'm pretty crazy about him.\" There \u2014 that sounded like something a teenager with her first boyfriend might say. \"Well, he seems very nice, and, my goodness, he's incredibly good-looking, but you're so young, Bella\u2026\" Her voice was unsure; as far as I could remember, this was the first time since I was eight that she'd come close to trying to sound like a parental authority. I recognized the reasonable-but-firm tone of voice from talks I'd had with her about men. \"I know that, Mom. Don't worry about it. It's just a crush,\" I soothed her. \"That's right,\" she agreed, easily pleased. Then she sighed and glanced guiltily over her shoulder at the big, round clock on the wall. \"Do you need to go?\" She bit her lip. \"Phil's supposed to call in a little while\u2026 I didn't know you were going to wake up\u2026\" \"No problem, Mom.\" I tried to tone down the relief so she wouldn't get her feelings hurt. \"I won't be alone.\" \"I'll be back soon. I've been sleeping here, you know,\" she announced, proud of herself. \"Oh, Mom, you don't have to do that! You can sleep at home \u2014 I'll never notice.\" The swirl of painkillers in my brain was making it hard to concentrate even now, though, apparently, I'd been sleeping for days. \"I was too nervous,\" she admitted sheepishly. \"There's been some crime in the \u00a0neighborhood, and I don't like being there alone.\" \"Crime?\" I asked in alarm. \"Someone broke into that dance studio around the corner from the house and burned it to the ground \u2014 there's nothing left at all! And they left a stolen car right out front. Do you remember when you used to dance there, honey?\" \"I remember.\" I shivered, and winced. \"I can stay, baby, if you need me.\" \"No, Mom, I'll be fine. Edward will be with me.\" She looked like that might be why she wanted to stay. \"I'll be back tonight.\" It sounded as much like a warning as it sounded like a promise, and she glanced at Edward again as she said it. \"I love you, Mom.\" \"I love you, too, Bella. Try to be more careful when you walk, honey, I don't want to lose you.\" Edward's eyes stayed closed, but a wide grin flashed across his face. A nurse came bustling in then to check all my tubes and wires. My mother kissed my forehead, patted my gauze-wrapped hand, and left. The nurse was checking the paper readout on my heart monitor. \"Are you feeling anxious, honey? Your heart rate got a little high there.\" \"I'm fine,\" I assured her. \"I'll tell your RN that you're awake. She'll be in to see you in a minute.\" As soon as she closed the door, Edward was at my side. \"You stole a car?\" I raised my eyebrows. He smiled, unrepentant. \"It was a good car, very fast.\" \"How was your nap?\" I asked. \"Interesting.\" His eyes narrowed. \"What?\" He looked down while he answered. \"I'm surprised. I thought Florida\u2026 and your mother\u2026 well, I thought that's what you would want.\" I stared at him uncomprehendingly. \"But you'd be stuck inside all day in Florida. You'd only be able to come out at night, just like a real vampire.\" He almost smiled, but not quite. And then his face was grave. \"I would stay in Forks, Bella. Or somewhere like it,\" he explained. \"Someplace where I couldn't hurt you anymore.\" It didn't sink in at first. I continued to stare at him blankly as the words one by one clicked into place in my head like a ghastly puzzle. I was barely conscious of the sound of my heart accelerating, though, as my breathing became hyperventilation, I was aware of the sharp aching in my protesting ribs. He didn't say anything; he watched my face warily as the pain that had nothing to do with broken bones, pain that was infinitely worse, threatened to crush me. And then another nurse walked purposefully into the room. Edward sat still as stone as she took in my expression with a practiced eye before turning to the monitors. \"Time for more pain meds, sweetheart?\" she asked kindly, tapping the IV feed. \"No, no,\" I mumbled, trying to keep the agony out of my voice. \"I don't need anything.\" I couldn't afford to close my eyes now. \"No need to be brave, honey. It's better if you don't get too stressed out; you need to rest.\" She waited, but I just shook my head. \"Okay,\" she sighed. \"Hit the call button when you're ready.\" She gave Edward a stern look, and threw one more anxious glance at the machinery, before leaving. His cool hands were on my face; I stared at him with wild eyes. \"Shhh, Bella, calm down.\" \"Don't leave me,\" I begged in a broken voice. \"I won't,\" he promised. \"Now relax before I call the nurse back to sedate you.\" But my heart couldn't slow. \"Bella.\" He stroked my face anxiously. \"I'm not going anywhere. I'll be right here as long as you need me.\" \"Do you swear you won't leave me?\" I whispered. I tried to control the gasping, at least. My ribs were throbbing. He put his hands on either side of my face and brought his face close to mine. His eyes were wide and serious. \"I swear.\" The smell of his breath was soothing. It seemed to ease the ache of my breathing. He continued to hold my gaze while my body slowly relaxed and the beeping returned to a normal pace. His eyes were dark, closer to black than gold today. \"Better?\" he asked. \"Yes,\" I said cautiously. He shook his head and muttered something unintelligible. I thought I picked out the word \"<em>overreaction</em>.\" \"Why did you say that?\" I whispered, trying to keep my voice from shaking. \"Are you tired of having to save me all the time? Do you want me to go away?\" \"No, I don't want to be without you, Bella, of course not. Be rational.  And I have no problem with saving you, either \u2014 if it weren't for the fact that I was the one putting you in danger\u2026 that I'm the reason that you're here.\" \"Yes, you are the reason.\" I frowned. \"The reason I'm here \u2014 alive.\" \"Barely.\" His voice was just a whisper. \"Covered in gauze and plaster and hardly able to move.\" \"I wasn't referring to my most recent near-death experience,\" I said, growing irritated. \"I was thinking of the others \u2014 you can take your pick. If it weren't for you, I would be rotting away in the Forks cemetery.\" He winced at my words, but the haunted look didn't leave his eyes. \"That's not the worst part, though,\" he continued to whisper. He acted as if I hadn't spoken. \"Not seeing you there on the floor\u2026 crumpled and broken.\" His voice was choked. \"Not thinking I was too late. Not even hearing you scream in pain \u2014 all those unbearable memories that I'll carry with me for the rest of eternity. No, the very worst was feeling\u2026 knowing that I couldn't stop. Believing that I was going to kill you myself.\" \"But you didn't.\" \"I could have. So easily.\" I knew I needed to stay calm\u2026 but he was trying to talk himself into leaving me, and the panic fluttered in my lungs, trying to get out.  \"Promise me,\" I whispered. \"What?\" \"You know what.\" I was starting to get angry now. He was so stubbornly determined to dwell on the negative. He heard the change in my tone. His eyes tightened. \"I don't seem to be strong enough to stay away from you, so I suppose that you'll get your way\u2026 whether it kills you or not,\" he added roughly. \"Good.\" He hadn't promised, though \u2014 a fact that I had not missed. The panic was only barely contained; I had no strength left to control the anger. \"You told me how you stopped\u2026 now I want to know why,\" I demanded. \"Why?\" he repeated warily. \"Why you did it. Why didn't you just let the venom spread? By now I would be just like you.\" Edward's eyes seemed to turn flat black, and I remembered that this was something he'd never intended me to know. Alice must have been preoccupied by the things she'd learned about herself\u2026 or she'd been very careful with her thoughts around him \u2014 clearly, he'd had no idea that she'd filled me in on the mechanics of vampire conversions. He was surprised, and infuriated. His nostrils flared, his mouth looked as if it was chiseled from stone. He wasn't going to answer, that much was clear. \"I'll be the first to admit that I have no experience with relationships,\" I said. \"But it just seems logical\u2026 a man and woman have to be somewhat equal\u2026 as in, one of them can't always be swooping in and saving the other one. They have to save each other equally.\" He folded his arms on the side of my bed and rested his chin on his arms. His expression was smooth, the anger reined in. Evidently he'd decided he wasn't angry with me. I hoped I'd get a chance to warn Alice before he caught up with her. \"You have saved me,\" he said quietly. \"I can't always be Lois Lane,\" I insisted. \"I want to be Superman, too.\" \"You don't know what you're asking.\" His voice was soft; he stared intently at the edge of the pillowcase. \"I think I do.\" \"Bella, you don't know. I've had almost ninety years to think about this, and I'm still not sure.\" \"Do you wish that Carlisle hadn't saved you?\" \"No, I don't wish that.\" He paused before continuing. \"But my life was over. I wasn't giving anything up.\" \"You are my life. You're the only thing it would hurt me to lose.\" I was getting better at this. It was easy to admit how much I needed him. He was very calm, though. Decided. \"I can't do it, Bella. I won't do that to you.\" \"Why not?\" My throat rasped and the words weren't as loud as I'd meant them to be. \"Don't tell me it's too hard! After today, or I guess it was a few days ago\u2026 anyway, after that, it should be nothing.\" He glared at me. \"And the pain?\" he asked. I blanched. I couldn't help it. But I tried to keep my expression from showing how clearly I remembered the feeling\u2026 the fire in my veins. \"That's my problem,\" I said. \"I can handle it.\" \"It's possible to take bravery to the point where it becomes insanity.\" \"It's not an issue. Three days. Big deal.\" Edward grimaced again as my words reminded him that I was more informed than he had ever intended me to be. I watched him repress the anger, watched as his eyes grew speculative. \"Charlie?\" he asked curtly. \"Ren\u00e9e?\" Minutes passed in silence as I struggled to answer his question. I opened my mouth, but no sound came out. I closed it again. He waited, and his expression became triumphant because he knew I had no true answer. \"Look, that's not an issue either,\" I finally muttered; my voice was as unconvincing as it always was when I lied. \"Ren\u00e9e has always made the choices that work for her \u2014 she'd want me to do the same. And Charlie's resilient, he's used to being on his own. I can't take care of them forever. I have my own life to live.\" \"Exactly,\" he snapped. \"And I won't end it for you.\" \"If you're waiting for me to be on my deathbed, I've got news for you! I was just there!\" \"You're going to recover,\" he reminded me. I took a deep breath to calm myself, ignoring the spasm of pain it triggered. I stared at him, and he stared back. There was no compromise in his face. \"No,\" I said slowly. \"I'm not.\" His forehead creased. \"Of course you are. You may have a scar or two\u2026\" \"You're wrong,\" I insisted. \"I'm going to die.\" \"Really, Bella.\" He was anxious now. \"You'll be out of here in a few days. Two week at most.\" I glared at him. \"I may not die now\u2026 but I'm going to die sometime. Every minute of the day, I get closer. And I'm going to get old.\" He frowned as what I was saying sunk in, pressing his long fingers to his temples and closing his eyes. \"That's how it's supposed to happen. How it should happen. How it would have happened if I didn't exist \u2014 and I shouldn't exist.\" I snorted. He opened his eyes in surprise. \"That's stupid. That's like going to someone who's just won the lottery, taking their money, and saying, 'Look, let's just go back to how things should be. It's better that way.' And I'm not buying it.\" \"I'm hardly a lottery prize,\" he growled. \"That's right. You're much better.\" He rolled his eyes and set his lips. \"Bella, we're not having this discussion anymore. I refuse to damn you to an eternity of night and that's the end of it.\" \"If you think that's the end, then you don't know me very well,\" I warned him. \"You're not the only vampire I know.\" His eyes went black again. \"Alice wouldn't dare.\" And for a moment he looked so frightening that I couldn't help but believe it \u2014 I couldn't imagine someone brave enough to cross him. \"Alice already saw it, didn't she?\" I guessed. \"That's why the things she says upset you. She knows I'm going to be like you\u2026 someday.\" \"She's wrong. She also saw you dead, but that didn't happen, either.\" \"You'll never catch me betting against Alice.\" We stared at each other for a very long time. It was quiet except for the whirring of the machines, the beeping, the dripping, the ticking of the big clock on the wall. Finally, his expression softened. \"So where does that leave us?\" I wondered. He chuckled humorlessly. \"I believe it's called an impasse.\" I sighed. \"Ouch,\" I muttered. \"How are you feeling?\" he asked, eyeing the button for the nurse. \"I'm fine,\" I lied. \"I don't believe you,\" he said gently. \"I'm not going back to sleep.\" \"You need rest. All this arguing isn't good for you.\" \"So give in,\" I hinted. \"Nice try.\" He reached for the button. \"No!\" He ignored me. \"Yes?\" the speaker on the wall squawked. \"I think we're ready for more pain medication,\" he said calmly, ignoring my furious expression. \"I'll send in the nurse.\" The voice sounded very bored. \"I won't take it,\" I promised. He looked toward the sack of fluids hanging beside my bed. \"I don't think they're going to ask you to swallow anything.\" My heart rate started to climb. He read the fear in my eyes, and sighed in frustration. \"Bella, you're in pain. You need to relax so you can heal. Why are you being so difficult?  They're not going to put any more needles in you now.\" \"I'm not afraid of the needles,\" I mumbled. \"I'm afraid to close my eyes.\" Then he smiled his crooked smile, and took my face between his hands. \"I told you I'm not going anywhere. Don't be afraid. As long as it makes you happy, I'll be here.\" I smiled back, ignoring the ache in my cheeks. \"You're talking about forever, you know.\" \"Oh, you'll get over it \u2014 it's just a crush.\" I shook my head in disbelief\u2014 it made me dizzy. \"I was shocked when Ren\u00e9e swallowed that one. I know you know better.\" \"That's the beautiful thing about being human,\" he told me. \"Things change.\" My eyes narrowed. \"Don't hold your breath.\" He was laughing when the nurse came in, brandishing a syringe. \"Excuse me,\" she said brusquely to Edward. He got up and crossed to the end of the small room, leaning against the wall. He folded his arms and waited. I kept my eyes on him, still apprehensive. He met my gaze calmly. \"Here you go, honey.\" The nurse smiled as she injected the medicine into my tube. \"You'll feel better now.\" \"Thanks,\" I mumbled, unenthusiastic. It didn't take long. I could feel the drowsiness trickling through my bloodstream almost immediately. \"That ought to do it,\" she muttered as my eyelids drooped. She must have left the room, because something cold and smooth touched my face. \"Stay.\" The word was slurred. \"I will,\" he promised. His voice was beautiful, like a lullaby. \"Like I said, as long as it makes you happy\u2026 as long as it's what's best for you.\" I tried to shake my head, but it was too heavy. \"S not the same thing,\" I mumbled. He laughed. \"Don't worry about that now, Bella. You can argue with me when you wake up.\" I think I smiled. '\"Kay.\" I could feel his lips at my ear. \"I love you,\" he whispered. \"Me, too.\" \"I know,\" he laughed quietly. I turned my head slightly\u2026 searching. He knew what I was after. His lips touched mine gently. \"Thanks,\" I sighed. \"Anytime.\" I wasn't really there at all anymore. But I fought against the stupor weakly. There was just one more thing I wanted to tell him. \"Edward?\" I struggled to pronounce his name clearly. \"Yes?\" \"I'm betting on Alice,\" I mumbled. And then the night closed over me.",
