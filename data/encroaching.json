            "en": "19         19. GOODBYES Charlie was waiting up for me. All the house lights were on. My mind was blank as I tried to think of a way to make him let me go. This wasn't going to be pleasant. Edward pulled up slowly, staying well back from my truck. All three of them were acutely alert, ramrod straight in their seats, listening to every sound of the wood, looking through every shadow, catching every scent, searching for something out of place. The engine cut off, and I sat, motionless, as they continued to listen. \"He's not here,\" Edward said tensely. \"Let's go.\" Emmett reached over to help me get out of the harness. \"Don't worry, Bella,\" he said in a low but cheerful voice, \"we'll take care of things here quickly.\" I felt moisture filling up my eyes as I looked at Emmett. I barely knew him, and yet, \u00a0somehow, not knowing when I would see him again after tonight was anguishing. I knew this was just a faint taste of the goodbyes I would have to survive in the next hour, and the thought made the tears begin to spill. \"Alice, Emmett.\" Edward's voice was a command. They slithered soundlessly into the darkness, instantly disappearing. Edward opened my door and took my hand, then drew me into the protecting enclosure of his arm. He walked me swiftly toward the house, eyes always roving through the night. \"Fifteen minutes,\" he warned under his breath. \"I can do this.\" I sniffled. My tears had given me an inspiration. I stopped on the porch and took hold of his face in my hands. I looked fiercely into his eyes. \"I love you,\" I said in a low, intense voice. \"I will always love you, no matter what happens now.\" \"Nothing is going to happen to you, Bella,\" he said just as fiercely. \"Just follow the plan, okay? Keep Charlie safe for me. He's not going to like me very much after this, and I want to have the chance to apologize later.\" \"Get inside, Bella. We have to hurry.\" His voice was urgent. \"One more thing,\" I whispered passionately. \"Don't listen to another word I say tonight!\" He was leaning in, and so all I had to do was stretch up on my toes to kiss his surprised, frozen lips with as much force as I was capable of. Then I turned and kicked the door open. \"Go away, Edward!\" I yelled at him, running inside and slamming the door shut in his still-shocked face. \"Bella?\" Charlie had been hovering in the living room, and he was already on his feet. \"Leave me alone!\" I screamed at him through my tears, which were flowing relentlessly now. I ran up the stairs to my room, throwing the door shut and locking it. I ran to my bed, flinging myself on the floor to retrieve my duffel bag. I reached swiftly between the mattress and box spring to grab the knotted old sock that contained my secret cash hoard. Charlie was pounding on my door. \"Bella, are you okay? What's going on?\" His voice was frightened. \"I'm going borne,\" I shouted, my voice breaking in the perfect spot. \"Did he hurt you?\" His tone edged toward anger. \"No!\" I shrieked a few octaves higher. I turned to my dresser, and Edward was already there, silently yanking out armfuls of random clothes, which he proceeded to throw to me. \"Did he break up with you?\" Charlie was perplexed. \"No!\" I yelled, slightly more breathless as I shoved everything into the bag. Edward threw another drawer's contents at me. The bag was pretty much full now. \"What happened, Bella?\" Charlie shouted through the door, pounding again. \"I broke up with him!\" I shouted back, jerking on the zipper of my bag. Edward's capable hands pushed mine away and zipped it smoothly. He put the strap carefully over my arm. \"I'll be in the truck \u2014 go!\" he whispered, and pushed me toward the door.  He vanished out the window. I unlocked the door and pushed past Charlie roughly, struggling with my heavy bag as I ran down the stairs. \"What happened?\" he yelled. He was right behind me. \"I thought you liked him.\" He caught my elbow in the kitchen. Though he was still bewildered, his grip was firm. He spun me around to look at him, and I could see in his face that he had no intention of letting me leave. I could think of only one way to escape, and it involved hurting him so much that I hated myself for even considering it. But I had no time, and I had to keep him safe. I glared up at my father, fresh tears in my eyes for what I was about to do. \"I do like him \u2014 that's the problem. I can't do this anymore! I can't put down any more roots here! I don't want to end up trapped in this stupid, boring town like Mom! I'm not going to make the same dumb mistake she did. I hate it \u2014 I can't stay here another minute!\" His hand dropped from my arm like I'd electrocuted him. I turned away from his shocked, wounded face and headed for the door. \"Bells, you can't leave now. It's nighttime,\" he whispered behind me. I didn't turn around. \"I'll sleep in the truck if I get tired.\" \"Just wait another week,\" he pled, still shell-shocked. \"Ren\u00e9e will be back by then.\" This completely derailed me. \"What?\" Charlie continued eagerly, almost babbling with relief as I hesitated. \"She called while you were out. Things aren't going so well in Florida, and if Phil doesn't get signed by the end of the week, they're going back to Arizona. The assistant coach of the Sidewinders said they might have a spot for another shortstop.\" I shook my head, trying to reassemble my now-confused thoughts. Every passing second put Charlie in more danger. \"I have a key,\" I muttered, turning the knob. He was too close, one hand extended toward me, his face dazed. I couldn't lose any more time arguing with him. I was going to have to hurt him further. \"Just let me go, Charlie.\" I repeated my mother's last words as she'd walked out this same door so many years ago. I said them as angrily as I could manage, and I threw the door open. \"It didn't work out, okay? I really, really hate Forks!\" My cruel words did their job \u2014 Charlie stayed frozen on the doorstep, stunned, while I ran into the night. I was hideously frightened of the empty yard. I ran wildly for the truck, visualizing a dark shadow behind me. I threw my bag in the bed and wrenched the door open. The key was waiting in the ignition. \"I'll call you tomorrow!\" I yelled, wishing more than anything that I could explain everything to him right then, knowing I would never be able to. I gunned the engine and peeled out. Edward reached for my hand. \"Pull over,\" he said as the house, and Charlie, disappeared behind us. \"I can drive,\" I said through the tears pouring down my cheeks. His long hands unexpectedly gripped my waist, and his foot pushed mine off the gas pedal. He pulled me across his lap, wrenching my hands free of the wheel, and suddenly he was in the driver's seat. The truck didn't swerve an inch. \"You wouldn't be able to find the house,\" he explained. Lights flared suddenly behind us. I stared out the back window, eyes wide with horror. \"It's just Alice,\" he reassured me. He took my hand again. My mind was filled with the image of Charlie in the doorway. \"The tracker?\" \"He heard the end of your performance,\" Edward said grimly. \"Charlie?\" I asked in dread. \"The tracker followed us. He's running behind us now.\" My body went cold. \"Can we outrun him?\" \"No.\" But he sped up as he spoke. The truck's engine whined in protest. My plan suddenly didn't feel so brilliant anymore. I was staring back at Alice's headlights when the truck shuddered and a dark shadow sprung up outside the window. My bloodcurdling scream lasted a fraction of a second before Edward's hand clamped down on my mouth. \"It's Emmett!\" He released my mouth, and wound his arm around my waist. \"It's okay, Bella,\" he promised. \"You're going to be safe.\" We raced through the quiet town toward the north highway. \"I didn't realize you were still so bored with small-town life,\" he said conversationally, and I knew he was trying to distract me. \"It seemed like you were adjusting fairly well \u2014 especially recently. Maybe I was just flattering myself that I was making life more interesting for you.\" \"I wasn't being nice,\" I confessed, ignoring his attempt at diversion, looking down at my knees. \"That was the same thing my mom said when she left him. You could say I was hitting below the belt.\" \"Don't worry. He'll forgive you.\" He smiled a little, though it didn't touch his eyes. I stared at him desperately, and he saw the naked panic in my eyes. \"Bella, it's going to be all right.\" \"But it won't be all right when I'm not with you,\" I whispered. \"We'll be together again in a few days,\" he said, tightening his arm around me. \"Don't forget that this was your idea.\" \"It was the best idea \u2014 of course it was mine.\" His answering smile was bleak and disappeared immediately. \"Why did this happen?\" I asked, my voice catching. \"Why me?\" He stared blackly at the road ahead. \"It's my fault \u2014 I was a fool to expose you like that.\" The rage in his voice was directed internally. \"That's not what I meant,\" I insisted. \"I was there, big deal. It didn't bother the other two. Why did this James decide to kill me? There're people all over the place, why me?\" He hesitated, thinking before he answered. \"I got a good look at his mind tonight,\" he began in a low voice. \"I'm not sure if there's anything I could have done to avoid this, once he saw you. It is partially your fault.\" His voice was wry. \"If you didn't smell so appallingly luscious, he might not have bothered. But when I defended you\u2026 well, that made it a lot worse. He's not used to being thwarted, no matter how insignificant the object. He thinks of himself as a hunter and nothing else. His existence is consumed with tracking, and a challenge is all he asks of life. Suddenly we've presented him with a beautiful challenge \u2014 a large clan of strong fighters all bent on protecting the one vulnerable element. You wouldn't believe how euphoric he is now. It's his favorite game, and we've just made it his most exciting game ever.\" His tone was full of disgust. He paused a moment. \"But if I had stood by, he would have killed you right then,\" he said with hopeless frustration. \"I thought\u2026 I didn't smell the same to the others\u2026 as I do to you,\" I said hesitantly. \"You don't. But that doesn't mean that you aren't still a temptation to every one of them. If you had appealed to the tracker \u2014 or any of them \u2014 the same way you appeal to me, it would have meant a fight right there.\" I shuddered. \"I don't think I have any choice but to kill him now,\" he muttered. \"Carlisle won't like it.\" I could hear the tires cross the bridge, though I couldn't see the river in the dark. I knew we were getting close. I had to ask him now.  \"How can you kill a vampire?\" He glanced at me with unreadable eyes and his voice was suddenly harsh. \"The only way to be sure is to tear him to shreds, and then burn the pieces.\" \"And the other two will fight with him?\" \"The woman will. I'm not sure about Laurent. They don't have a very strong bond \u2014 he's only with them for convenience. He was embarrassed by James in the meadow\u2026\" \"But James and the woman \u2014 they'll try to kill you?\" I asked, my voice raw. \"Bella, don't you dare waste time worrying about me. Your only concern is keeping yourself safe and \u2014 please, please \u2014 trying not to be reckless.\" \"Is he still following?\" \"Yes. He won't attack the house, though. Not tonight.\" He turned off onto the invisible drive, with Alice following behind. We drove right up to the house. The lights inside were bright, but they did little to alleviate the blackness of the <em>encroaching</em> forest. Emmett had my door open before the truck was stopped; he pulled me out of the seat, tucked me like a football into his vast chest, and ran me through the door. We burst into the large white room, Edward and Alice at our sides. All of them were there; they were already on their feet at the sound of our approach. Laurent stood in their midst. I could hear low growls rumble deep in Emmett's throat as he set me down next to Edward. \"He's tracking us,\" Edward announced, glaring balefully at Laurent. Laurent's face was unhappy. \"I was afraid of that.\" Alice danced to Jasper's side and whispered in his ear; her lips quivered with the speed of her silent speech. They flew up the stairs together. Rosalie watched them, and then moved quickly to Emmett's side. Her beautiful eyes were intense and \u2014 when they flickered unwillingly to my face \u2014 furious. \"What will he do?\" Carlisle asked Laurent in chilling tones. \"I'm sorry,\" he answered. \"I was afraid, when your boy there defended her, that it would set him off.\" \"Can you stop him?\" Laurent shook his head. \"Nothing stops James when he gets started.\" \"We'll stop him,\" Emmett promised. There was no doubt what he meant. \"You can't bring him down. I've never seen anything like him in my three hundred years. He's absolutely lethal. That's why I joined his coven.\" His coven, I thought, of course. The show of leadership in the clearing was merely that, a show. Laurent was shaking his head. He glanced at me, perplexed, and back to Carlisle. \"Are you sure it's worth it?\" Edward's enraged roar filled the room; Laurent cringed back. Carlisle looked gravely at Laurent. \"I'm afraid you're going to have to make a choice.\" Laurent understood. He deliberated for a moment. His eyes took in every face, and finally swept the bright room. \"I'm intrigued by the life you've created here. But I won't get in the middle of this. I bear none of you any enmity, but I won't go up against James. I think I will head north \u2014 to that clan in Denali.\" He hesitated. \"Don't underestimate James. He's got a brilliant mind and unparalleled senses. He's every bit as comfortable in the human world as you seem to be, and he won't come at you head on\u2026 I'm sorry for what's been unleashed here. Truly sorry.\" He bowed his head, but I saw him flicker another puzzled look at me. \"Go in peace,\" was Carlisle's formal answer. Laurent took another long look around himself, and then he hurried out the door. The silence lasted less than a second. \"How close?\" Carlisle looked to Edward. Esme was already moving; her hand touched an inconspicuous keypad on the wall, and with a groan, huge metal shutters began sealing up the glass wall. I gaped. \"About three miles out past the river; he's circling around to meet up with the female.\" \"What's the plan?\" \"We'll lead him off, and then Jasper and Alice will run her south.\" \"And then?\" Edward's tone was deadly. \"As soon as Bella is clear, we hunt him.\" \"I guess there's no other choice,\" Carlisle agreed, his face grim. Edward turned to Rosalie. \"Get her upstairs and trade clothes,\" Edward commanded. She stared back at him with livid disbelief. \"Why should I?\" she hissed. \"What is she to me? Except a menace \u2014 a danger you've chosen to inflict on all of us.\" I flinched back from the venom in her voice. \"Rose\u2026\" Emmett murmured, putting one hand on her shoulder. She shook it off. But I was watching Edward carefully, knowing his temper, worried about his reaction. He surprised me. He looked away from Rosalie as if she hadn't spoken, as if she didn't exist. \"Esme?\" he asked calmly. \"Of course,\" Esme murmured. Esme was at my side in half a heartbeat, swinging me up easily into her arms, and dashing up the stairs before I could gasp in shock. \"What are we doing?\" I asked breathlessly as she set me down in a dark room somewhere off the second-story hall. \"Trying to confuse the smell. It won't work for long, but it might help get you out.\" I could hear her clothes falling to the floor. \"I don't think I'll fit\u2026\" I hesitated, but her hands were abruptly pulling my shirt over my head. I quickly stripped my jeans off myself. She handed me something, it felt like a shirt. I struggled to get my arms through the right holes. As soon as I was done she handed me her slacks. I yanked them on, but I couldn't get my feet out; they were too long. She deftly rolled the hems a few times so I could stand. Somehow she was already in my clothes. She pulled me back to the stairs, where Alice stood, a small leather bag in one hand. They each grabbed one of my elbows and half-carried me as they flew down the stairs. It appeared that everything had been settled downstairs in our absence. Edward and Emmett were ready to leave, Emmett carrying a heavy-looking backpack over his shoulder. Carlisle was handing something small to Esme. He turned and handed Alice the same thing \u2014 it was a tiny silver cell phone. \"Esme and Rosalie will be taking your truck, Bella,\" he told me as he passed. I nodded, glancing warily at Rosalie. She was glowering at Carlisle with a resentful expression. \"Alice, Jasper \u2014 take the Mercedes. You'll need the dark tint in the south.\" They nodded as well. \"We're taking the Jeep.\" I was surprised to see that Carlisle intended to go with Edward. I realized suddenly, with a stab of fear, that they made up the hunting party. \"Alice,\" Carlisle asked, \"will they take the bait?\" Everyone watched Alice as she closed her eyes and became incredibly still. Finally her eyes opened. \"He'll track you. The woman will follow the truck. We should be able to leave after that.\" Her voice was certain. \"Let's go.\" Carlisle began to walk toward the kitchen. But Edward was at my side at once. He caught me up in his iron grip, crushing me to him. He seemed unaware of his watching family as he pulled my face to his, lifting my feet off the floor. For the shortest second, his lips were icy and hard against mine. Then it was over. He set me down, still holding my face, his glorious eyes burning into mine. His eyes went blank, curiously dead, as he turned away. And they were gone. We stood there, the others looking away from me as the tears streaked noiselessly down my face.  The silent moment dragged on, and then Esme's phone vibrated in her hand. It flashed to her ear. \"Now,\" she said. Rosalie stalked out the front door without another glance in my direction, but Esme touched my cheek as she passed.  \"Be safe.\" Her whisper lingered behind them as they slipped out the door. I heard my truck start thunderously, and then fade away. Jasper and Alice waited. Alice's phone seemed to be at her ear before it buzzed. \"Edward says the woman is on Esme's trail. I'll get the car.\" She vanished into the shadows the way Edward had gone. Jasper and I looked at each other. He stood across the length of the entryway from me\u2026 being careful. \"You're wrong, you know,\" he said quietly. \"What?\" I gasped. \"I can feel what you're feeling now \u2014 and you are worth it.\" \"I'm not,\" I mumbled. \"If anything happens to them, it will be for nothing.\" \"You're wrong,\" he repeated, smiling kindly at me. I heard nothing, but then Alice stepped through the front door and came toward me with her arms held out. \"May I?\" she asked. \"You're the first one to ask permission.\" I smiled wryly. She lifted me in her slender arms as easily as Emmett had, shielding me protectively, and then we flew out the door, leaving the lights bright behind us.",

            "en": "7          7. NIGHTMARE I told Charlie I had a lot of homework to do, and that I didn't want anything to eat. There was a basketball game on that he was excited about, though of course I had no idea what was special about it, so he wasn't aware of anything unusual in my face or tone. Once in my room, I locked the door. I dug through my desk until I found my old headphones, and I plugged them into my little CD player. I picked up a CD that Phil had given to me for Christmas. It was one of his favorite bands, but they used a little too much bass and shrieking for my tastes. I popped it into place and lay down on my bed. I put on the headphones, hit Play, and turned up the volume until it hurt my ears. I closed my eyes, but the light still intruded, so I added a pillow over the top half of my face. I concentrated very carefully on the music, trying to understand the lyrics, to unravel the complicated drum patterns. By the third time I'd listened through the CD, I knew all the words to the choruses, at least.  I was surprised to find that I really did like the band after all, once I got past the blaring noise. I'd have to thank Phil again.  And it worked. The shattering beats made it impossible for me to think \u2014 which was the whole purpose of the exercise. I listened to the CD again and again, until I was singing along with all the songs, until, finally, I fell asleep. I opened my eyes to a familiar place. Aware in some corner of my consciousness that I was dreaming, I recognized the green light of the forest. I could hear the waves crashing against the rocks somewhere nearby. And I knew that if I found the ocean, I'd be able to see the sun.  I was trying to follow the sound, but then Jacob Black was there, tugging on my hand, pulling me back toward the blackest part of the forest. \"Jacob? What's wrong?\" I asked. His face was frightened as he yanked with all his strength against my resistance; I didn't want to go into the dark. \"Run, Bella, you have to run!\" he whispered, terrified. \"This way, Bella!\" I recognized Mike's voice calling out of the gloomy heart of the trees, but I couldn't see him. \"Why?\" I asked, still pulling against Jacob's grasp, desperate now to find the sun. But Jacob let go of my hand and yelped, suddenly shaking, falling to the dim forest floor. He twitched on the ground as I watched in horror.  \"Jacob!\" I screamed. But he was gone. In his place was a large red-brown wolf with black eyes. The wolf faced away from me, pointing toward the shore, the hair on the back of his shoulders bristling, low growls issuing from between his exposed fangs. \"Bella, run!\" Mike cried out again from behind me. But I didn't turn. I was watching a light coming toward me from the beach. And then Edward stepped out from the trees, his skin faintly glowing, his eyes black and dangerous. He held up one hand and beckoned me to come to him. The wolf growled at my feet. I took a step forward, toward Edward. He smiled then, and his teeth were sharp, pointed. \"Trust me,\" he purred. I took another step. The wolf launched himself across the space between me and the vampire, fangs aiming for the jugular. \"No!\" I screamed, wrenching upright out of my bed. My sudden movement caused the headphones to pull the CD player off the bedside table, and it clattered to the wooden floor. My light was still on, and I was sitting fully dressed on the bed, with my shoes on. I glanced, disoriented, at the clock on my dresser. It was five-thirty in the morning. I groaned, fell back, and rolled over onto my face, kicking off my boots. I was too uncomfortable to get anywhere near sleep, though. I rolled back over and unbuttoned my jeans, yanking them off awkwardly as I tried to stay horizontal. I could feel the braid in my hair, an uncomfortable ridge along the back of my skull. I turned onto my side and ripped the rubber band out, quickly combing through the plaits with my fingers. I pulled the pillow back over my eyes.  It was all no use, of course. My subconscious had dredged up exactly the images I'd been trying so desperately to avoid. I was going to have to face them now. I sat up, and my head spun for a minute as the blood flowed downward. First things first, I thought to myself, happy to put it off as long as possible. I grabbed my bathroom bag. The shower didn't last nearly as long as I hoped it would, though. Even taking the time to blow-dry my hair, I was soon out of things to do in the bathroom. Wrapped in a towel, I crossed back to my room. I couldn't tell if Charlie was still asleep, or if he had already left. I went to look out my window, and the cruiser was gone. Fishing again. I dressed slowly in my most comfy sweats and then made my bed \u2014 something I never did. I couldn't put it off any longer. I went to my desk and switched on my old computer. I hated using the Internet here. My modem was sadly outdated, my free service substandard; just dialing up took so long that I decided to go get myself a bowl of cereal while I waited. I ate slowly, chewing each bite with care. When I was done, I washed the bowl and spoon, dried them, and put them away. My feet dragged as I climbed the stairs. I went to my CD player first, picking it up off the floor and placing it precisely in the center of the table. I pulled out the headphones, and put them away in the desk drawer. Then I turned the same CD on, turning it down to the point where it was background noise.  With another sigh, I turned to my computer. Naturally, the screen was covered in pop-up ads. I sat in my hard folding chair and began closing all the little windows. Eventually I made it to my favorite search engine. I shot down a few more pop-ups and then typed in one word. Vampire. It took an infuriatingly long time, of course. When the results came up, there was a lot to sift through \u2014 everything from movies and TV shows to role-playing games, underground metal, and gothic cosmetic companies. Then I found a promising site \u2014 Vampires A\u2014Z. I waited impatiently for it to load, quickly clicking closed each ad that flashed across the screen. Finally the screen was finished \u2014 simple white background with black text, academic-looking. Two quotes greeted me on the home page: Throughout the vast shadowy world of ghosts and demons there is no figure so terrible, no figure so dreaded and abhorred, yet dight with such fearful fascination, as the vampire, who is himself neither ghost nor demon, but yet who partakes the dark natures and possesses the mysterious and terrible qualities of both. \u2014 Rev. Montague Summers If there is in this world a well-attested account, it is that of the vampires. Nothing is lacking: official reports, affidavits of well-known people, of surgeons, of priests, of magistrates; the judicial proof is most complete. And with all that, who is there who believes in vampires? \u2014 Rousseau The rest of the site was an alphabetized listing of all the different myths of vampires held throughout the world. The first I clicked on, the Danag, was a Filipino vampire supposedly responsible for planting taro on the islands long ago. The myth continued that the Danag worked with humans for many years, but the partnership ended one day when a woman cut her finger and a Danag sucked her wound, enjoying the taste so much that it drained her body completely of blood. I read carefully through the descriptions, looking for anything that sounded familiar, let alone plausible. It seemed that most vampire myths centered around beautiful women as demons and children as victims; they also seemed like constructs created to explain away the high mortality rates for young children, and to give men an excuse for infidelity. Many of the stories involved bodiless spirits and warnings against improper burials. There wasn't much that sounded like the movies I'd seen, and only a very few, like the Hebrew Estrie and the Polish Upier, who were even preoccupied with drinking blood. Only three entries really caught my attention: the Romanian Varacolaci, a powerful undead being who could appear as a beautiful, pale-skinned human, the Slovak Nelapsi, a creature so strong and fast it could massacre an entire village in the single hour after midnight, and one other, the Stregoni benefici. About this last there was only one brief sentence.  Stregoni benefici: An Italian vampire, said to be on the side of goodness, and a mortal enemy of all evil vampires. It was a relief, that one small entry, the one myth among hundreds that claimed the existence of good vampires. Overall, though, there was little that coincided with Jacob's stories or my own observations. I'd made a little catalogue in my mind as I'd read and carefully compared it with each myth. Speed, strength, beauty, pale skin, eyes that shift color; and then Jacob's criteria: blood drinkers, enemies of the werewolf, cold-skinned, and immortal. There were very few myths that matched even one factor. And then another problem, one that I'd remembered from the small number of scary movies that I'd seen and was backed up by today's reading \u2014 vampires couldn't come out in the daytime, the sun would burn them to a cinder. They slept in coffins all day and came out only at night. Aggravated, I snapped off the computer's main power switch, not waiting to shut things down properly. Through my irritation, I felt overwhelming embarrassment. It was all so stupid. I was sitting in my room, researching vampires. What was wrong with me? I decided that most of the blame belonged on the doorstep of the town of Forks \u2014 and the entire sodden Olympic Peninsula, for that matter. I had to get out of the house, but there was nowhere I wanted to go that didn't involve a three-day drive. I pulled on my boots anyway, unclear where I was headed, and went downstairs. I shrugged into my raincoat without checking the weather and stomped out the door.  It was overcast, but not raining yet. I ignored my truck and started east on foot, angling across Charlie's yard toward the ever-<em>encroaching</em> forest. It didn't take long till I was deep enough for the house and the road to be invisible, for the only sound to be the squish of the damp earth under my feet and the sudden cries of the jays. There was a thin ribbon of a trail that led through the forest here, or I wouldn't risk wandering on my own like this. My sense of direction was hopeless; I could get lost in much less helpful surroundings. The trail wound deeper and deeper into the forest, mostly east as far as I could tell. It snaked around the Sitka spruces and the hemlocks, the yews and the maples. I only vaguely knew the names of the trees around me, and all I knew was due to Charlie pointing them out to me from the cruiser window in earlier days. There were many I didn't know, and others I couldn't be sure about because they were so covered in green parasites. I followed the trail as long as my anger at myself pushed me forward. As that started to ebb, I slowed. A few drops of moisture trickled down from the canopy above me, but I couldn't be certain if it was beginning to rain or if it was simply pools left over from yesterday, held high in the leaves above me, slowly dripping their way back to the earth. A recently fallen tree \u2014 I knew it was recent because it wasn't entirely carpeted in moss \u2014 rested against the trunk of one of her sisters, creating a sheltered little bench just a few safe feet off the trail. I stepped over the ferns and sat carefully, making sure my jacket was between the damp seat and my clothes wherever they\u00a0 touched, and leaned my hooded head back against the living tree. This was the wrong place to have come. I should have known, but where else was there to go? The forest was deep green and far too much like the scene in last night's dream to allow for peace of mind. Now that there was no longer the sound of my soggy footsteps, the silence was piercing.  The birds were quiet, too, the drops increasing in frequency, so it must be raining above. The ferns stood higher than my head, now that I was seated, and I knew someone could walk by on the path, three feet away, and not see me. Here in the trees it was much easier to believe the absurdities that embarrassed me indoors. Nothing had changed in this forest for thousands of years, and all the myths and legends of a hundred different lands seemed much more likely in this green haze than they had in my clear-cut bedroom. I forced myself to focus on the two most vital questions I had to answer, but I did so unwillingly.  First, I had to decide if it was possible that what Jacob had said about the Cullens could be true. Immediately my mind responded with a resounding negative. It was silly and morbid to entertain such ridiculous notions. But what, then? I asked myself. There was no rational explanation for how I was alive at this moment. I listed again in my head the things I'd observed myself: the impossible speed and strength, the eye color shifting from black to gold and back again, the inhuman beauty, the pale, frigid skin. And more \u2014 small things that registered slowly \u2014 how they never seemed to eat, the disturbing grace with which they moved. And the way be sometimes spoke, with unfamiliar cadences and phrases that better fit the style of a turn-of-the-century novel than that of a twenty-first-century classroom. He had skipped class the day we'd done blood typing. He hadn't said no to the beach trip till he heard where we were going. He seemed to know what everyone around him was thinking\u2026 except me. He had told me he was the villain, dangerous\u2026 Could the Cullens be vampires? Well, they were something. Something outside the possibility of rational justification was taking place in front of my incredulous eyes. Whether it be Jacob's cold ones or my own superhero theory, Edward Cullen was not\u2026 human. He was something more.  So then \u2014 maybe. That would have to be my answer for now.  And then the most important question of all. What was I going to do if it was true? If Edward was a vampire \u2014 I could hardly make myself think the words \u2014 then what should I do? Involving someone else was definitely out. I couldn't even believe myself; anyone I told would have me committed.  Only two options seemed practical. The first was to take his advice: to be smart, to avoid him as much as possible. To cancel our plans, to go back to ignoring him as far as I was able. To pretend there was an impenetrably thick glass wall between us in the one class where we were forced together. To tell him to leave me alone \u2014 and mean it this time.  I was gripped in a sudden agony of despair as I considered that alternative. My mind rejected the pain, quickly skipping on to the next option. I could do nothing different. After all, if he was something\u2026 sinister, he'd done nothing to hurt me so far. In fact, I would be a dent in Tyler's fender if he hadn't acted so quickly. So quickly, I argued with myself, that it might have been sheer reflexes. But if it was a reflex to save lives, how bad could he be? I retorted. My head spun around in answerless circles. There was one thing I was sure of, if I was sure of anything. The dark Edward in my dream last night was a reflection only of my fear of the word Jacob had spoken, and not Edward himself. Even so, when I'd screamed out in terror at the werewolf's lunge, it wasn't fear for the wolf that brought the cry of \"no\" to my lips. It was fear that he would be harmed \u2014 even as he called to me with sharp-edged fangs, I feared for him. And I knew in that I had my answer. I didn't know if there ever was a choice, really. I was already in too deep. Now that I knew \u2014 if I knew \u2014 I could do nothing about my frightening secret. Because when I thought of him, of his voice, his hypnotic eyes, the magnetic force of his personality, I wanted nothing more than to be with him right now. Even if\u2026 but I couldn't think it. Not here, alone in the darkening forest. Not while the rain made it dim as twilight under the canopy and pattered like footsteps across the matted earthen floor. I shivered and rose quickly from my place of concealment, worried that somehow the path would have disappeared with the rain. But it was there, safe and clear, winding its way out of the dripping green maze. I followed it hastily, my hood pulled close around my face, becoming surprised, as I nearly ran through the trees, at how far I had come. I started to wonder if I was heading out at all, or following the path farther into the confines of the forest. Before I could get too panicky, though, I began to glimpse some open spaces through the webbed branches. And then I could hear a car passing on the street, and I was free, Charlie's lawn stretched out in front of me, the house beckoning me, promising warmth and dry socks. It was just noon when I got back inside. I went upstairs and got dressed for the day, jeans and a t-shirt, since I was staying indoors. It didn't take too much effort to concentrate on my task for the day, a paper on Macbeth that was due Wednesday. I settled into outlining a rough draft contentedly, more serene than I'd felt since\u2026 well, since Thursday afternoon, if I was being honest.  That had always been my way, though. Making decisions was the painful part for me, the part I agonized over. But once the decision was made, I simply followed through \u2014 usually with relief that the choice was made. Sometimes the relief was tainted by despair, like my decision to come to Forks. But it was still better than wrestling with the alternatives.  This decision was ridiculously easy to live with. Dangerously easy.  And so the day was quiet, productive \u2014 I finished my paper before eight. Charlie came home with a large catch, and I made a mental note to pick up a book of recipes for fish while I was in Seattle next week. The chills that flashed up my spine whenever I thought of that trip were no different than the ones I'd felt before I'd taken my walk with Jacob Black. They should be different, I thought. I should be afraid \u2014 I knew I should be, but I couldn't feel the right kind of fear. I slept dreamlessly that night, exhausted from beginning my day so early, and sleeping so poorly the night before. I woke, for the second time since arriving in Forks, to the bright yellow light of a sunny day. I skipped to the window, stunned to see that there was hardly a cloud in the sky, and those there were just fleecy little white puffs that couldn't possibly be carrying any rain. I opened the window \u2014 surprised when it opened silently, without sticking, not having opened it in who knows how many years \u2014 and sucked in the relatively dry air. It was nearly warm and hardly windy at all. My blood was electric in my veins.  Charlie was finishing breakfast when I came downstairs, and he picked up on my mood immediately. \"Nice day out,\" he commented. \"Yes,\" I agreed with a grin. He smiled back, his brown eyes crinkling around the edges. When Charlie smiled, it was easier to see why he and my mother had jumped too quickly into an early marriage. Most of the young romantic he'd been in those days had faded before I'd known him, as the curly brown hair \u2014 the same color, if not the same texture, as mine \u2014 had dwindled, slowly revealing more and more of the shiny skin of his forehead. But when he smiled I could see a little of the man who had run away with Ren\u00e9e when she was just two years older than I was now. I ate breakfast cheerily, watching the dust moats stirring in the sunlight that streamed in the back window. Charlie called out a goodbye, and I heard the cruiser pull away from the house. I hesitated on my way out the door, hand on my rain jacket. It would be tempting fate to leave it home. With a sigh, I folded it over my arm and stepped out into the brightest light I'd seen in months. By dint of much elbow grease, I was able to get both windows in the truck almost completely rolled down. I was one of the first ones to school; I hadn't even checked the clock in my hurry to get outside. I parked and headed toward the seldom-used picnic benches on the south side of the cafeteria. The benches were still a little damp, so I sat on my jacket, glad to have a use for it. My homework was done \u2014 the product of a slow social life \u2014 but there were a few Trig problems I wasn't sure I had right. I took out my book industriously, but halfway through rechecking the first problem I was daydreaming, watching the sunlight play on the red-barked trees. I sketched inattentively along the margins of my homework. After a few minutes, I suddenly realized I'd drawn five pairs of dark eyes staring out of the page at me. I scrubbed them out with the eraser. \"Bella!\" I heard someone call, and it sounded like Mike. I looked around to realize that the school had become populated while I'd been sitting there, absentminded. Everyone was in t-shirts, some even in shorts though the temperature couldn't be over sixty. Mike was coming toward me in khaki shorts and a striped Rugby shirt, waving.  \"Hey, Mike,\" I called, waving back, unable to be halfhearted on a morning like this. He came to sit by me, the tidy spikes of his hair shining golden in the light, his grin stretching across his face. He was so delighted to see me, I couldn't help but feel gratified. \"I never noticed before \u2014 your hair has red in it,\" he commented, catching between his fingers a strand that was fluttering in the light breeze. \"Only in the sun.\" I became just a little uncomfortable as he tucked the lock behind my ear. \"Great day, isn't it?\" \"My kind of day,\" I agreed.  \"What did you do yesterday?\" His tone was just a bit too proprietary. \"I mostly worked on my essay.\" I didn't add that I was finished with it \u2014 no need to sound smug. He hit his forehead with the heel of his hand. \"Oh yeah \u2014 that's due Thursday, right?\" \"Um, Wednesday, I think.\" \"Wednesday?\" He frowned. \"That's not good\u2026 What are you writing yours on?\" \"Whether Shakespeare's treatment of the female characters is misogynistic.\" He stared at me like I'd just spoken in pig Latin. \"I guess I'll have to get to work on that tonight,\" he said, deflated. \"I was going to ask if you wanted to go out.\" \"Oh.\" I was taken off guard. Why couldn't I ever have a pleasant\u00a0 conversation with Mike anymore without it getting awkward? \"Well, we could go to dinner or something\u2026 and I could work on it later.\" He smiled at me hopefully. \"Mike\u2026\" I hated being put on the spot. \"I don't think that would be the best idea.\" His face fell. \"Why?\" he asked, his eyes guarded. My thoughts flickered to Edward, wondering if that's where his thoughts were as well. \"I think\u2026 and if you ever repeat what I'm saying right now I will cheerfully beat you to death,\" I threatened, \"but I think that would hurt Jessica's feelings.\" He was bewildered, obviously not thinking in that direction at all.  \"Jessica?\" \"Really, Mike, are you blind?\" \"Oh,\" he exhaled \u2014 clearly dazed. I took advantage of that to make my escape. \"It's time for class, and I can't be late again.\" I gathered my books up and stuffed them in my bag. We walked in silence to building three, and his expression was distracted. I hoped whatever thoughts he was immersed in were leading him in the right direction. When I saw Jessica in Trig, she was bubbling with enthusiasm. She, Angela, and Lauren were going to Port Angeles tonight to go dress shopping for the dance, and she wanted me to come, too, even though I didn't need one. I was indecisive. It would be nice to get out of town with some girlfriends, but Lauren would be there. And who knew what I could be doing tonight\u2026 But that was definitely the wrong path to let my mind wander down. Of course I was happy about the sunlight. But that wasn't completely responsible for the euphoric mood I was in, not even close. So I gave her a maybe, telling her I'd have to talk with Charlie first. She talked of nothing but the dance on the way to Spanish, continuing as if without an interruption when class finally ended, five minutes late, and we were on our way to lunch. I was far too lost in my own frenzy of anticipation to notice much of what she said. I was painfully eager to see not just him but all the Cullens \u2014 to compare them with the new suspicions that plagued my mind. As I crossed the threshold of the cafeteria, I felt the first true tingle of fear slither down my spine and settle in my stomach. Would they be able to know what I was thinking? And then a different feeling jolted through me \u2014 would Edward be waiting to sit with me again? As was my routine, I glanced first toward the Cullens' table. A shiver of panic trembled in my stomach as I realized it was empty. With dwindling hope, my eyes scoured the rest of the cafeteria, hoping to find him alone, waiting for me. The place was nearly filled \u2014 Spanish had made us late \u2014 but there was no sign of Edward or any of his family. Desolation hit me with crippling strength. I shambled along behind Jessica, not bothering to pretend to listen anymore. We were late enough that everyone was already at our table. I avoided the empty chair next to Mike in favor of one by Angela. I vaguely noticed that Mike held the chair out politely for Jessica, and that her face lit up in response. Angela asked a few quiet questions about the Macbeth paper, which I answered as naturally as I could while spiraling downward in misery. She, too, invited me to go with them tonight, and I agreed now, grasping at anything to distract myself. I realized I'd been holding on to a last shred of hope when I entered Biology, saw his empty seat, and felt a new wave of disappointment. The rest of the day passed slowly, dismally. In Gym, we had a lecture on the rules of badminton, the next torture they had lined up for me. But at least it meant I got to sit and listen instead of stumbling around on the court. The best part was the coach didn't finish, so I got another day off tomorrow. Never mind that the day after they would arm me with a racket before unleashing me on the rest of the class. I was glad to leave campus, so I would be free to pout and mope before I went out tonight with Jessica and company. But right after I walked in the door of Charlie's house, Jessica called to cancel our plans. I tried to be happy that Mike had asked her out to dinner \u2014 I really was relieved that he finally seemed to be catching on \u2014 but my enthusiasm sounded false in my own ears. She rescheduled our shopping trip for tomorrow night. Which left me with little in the way of distractions. I had fish marinating for dinner, with a salad and bread left over from the night before, so there was nothing to do there. I spent a focused half hour on homework, but then I was through with that, too. I checked my e-mail, reading the backlog of letters from my mother, getting snippier as they progressed to the present. I sighed and typed a quick response.  Mom, Sorry. I've been out. I went to the beach with some friends. And I had to write a paper. My excuses were fairly pathetic, so I gave up on that. It's sunny outside today - I know, I'm shocked, too - so I'm going to go outside and soak up as much vitamin D as I can. I love you, Bella. I decided to kill an hour with non-school-related reading. I had a small collection of books that came with me to Forks, the shabbiest volume being a compilation of the works of Jane Austen. I selected that one and headed to the backyard, grabbing a ragged old quilt from the linen cupboard at the top of the stairs on my way down. Outside in Charlie's small, square yard, I folded the quilt in half and laid it out of the reach of the trees' shadows on the thick lawn that would always be slightly wet, no matter how long the sun shone. I lay on my stomach, crossing my ankles in the air, flipping through the different novels in the book, trying to decide which would occupy my mind the most thoroughly. My favorites were Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility. I'd read the first most recently, so I started into Sense and Sensibility, only to remember after I began three that the hero of the story happened to be named Edward. Angrily, I turned to Mansfield Park, but the hero of that piece was named Edmund, and that was just too close. Weren't there any other names available in the late eighteenth century? I snapped the book shut, annoyed, and rolled over onto my back.  I pushed my sleeves up as high as they would go, and closed my eyes. I would think of nothing but the warmth on my skin, I told myself severely. The breeze was still light, but it blew tendrils of my hair around my face, and that tickled a bit. I pulled all my hair over my head, letting it fan out on the quilt above me, and focused again on the heat that touched my eyelids, my cheekbones, my nose, my lips, my forearms, my neck, soaked through my light shirt\u2026 The next thing I was conscious of was the sound of Charlie's cruiser turning onto the bricks of the driveway. I sat up in surprise, realizing the light was gone, behind the trees, and I had fallen asleep. I looked around, muddled, with the sudden feeling that I wasn't alone.  \"Charlie?\" I asked. But I could hear his door slamming in front of the house. I jumped up, foolishly edgy, gathering the now-damp quilt and my book. I ran inside to get some oil heating on the stove, realizing that dinner would be late. Charlie was hanging up his gun belt and stepping out of his boots when I came in. \"Sorry, Dad, dinner's not ready yet \u2014 I fell asleep outside.\" I stifled a yawn. \"Don't worry about it,\" he said. \"I wanted to catch the score on the game, anyway.\" I watched TV with Charlie after dinner, for something to do. There wasn't anything on I wanted to watch, but he knew I didn't like baseball, so he turned it to some mindless sitcom that neither of us enjoyed. He seemed happy, though, to be doing something together. And it felt good, despite my depression, to make him happy. \"Dad,\" I said during a commercial, \"Jessica and Angela are going to look at dresses for the dance tomorrow night in Port Angeles, and they wanted me to help them choose\u2026 do you mind if I go with them?\" \"Jessica Stanley?\" he asked. \"And Angela Weber.\" I sighed as I gave him the details. He was confused. \"But you're not going to the dance, right?\" \"No, Dad, but I'm helping them find dresses \u2014 you know, giving them constructive criticism.\" I wouldn't have to explain this to a woman. \"Well, okay.\" He seemed to realize that he was out of his depth with the girlie stuff. \"It's a school night, though.\" \"We'll leave right after school, so we can get back early. You'll be okay for dinner, right?\" \"Bells, I fed myself for seventeen years before you got here,\" he reminded me. \"I don't know how you survived,\" I muttered, then added more clearly, \"I'll leave some things for cold-cut sandwiches in the fridge, okay? Right on top.\" It was sunny again in the morning. I awakened with renewed hope that I grimly tried to suppress. I dressed for the warmer weather in a deep blue V-neck blouse \u2014 something I'd worn in the dead of winter in Phoenix.  I had planned my arrival at school so that I barely had time to make it to class. With a sinking heart, I circled the full lot looking for a space, while also searching for the silver Volvo that was clearly not there. I parked in the last row and hurried to English, arriving breathless, but subdued, before the final bell.  It was the same as yesterday \u2014 I just couldn't keep little sprouts of hope from budding in my mind, only to have them squashed painfully as I searched the lunchroom in vain and sat at my empty Biology table. The Port Angeles scheme was back on again for tonight and made all the more attractive by the fact that Lauren had other obligations. I was anxious to get out of town so I could stop glancing over my shoulder, hoping to see him appearing out of the blue the way he always did. I vowed to myself that I would be in a good mood tonight and not ruin Angela's or Jessica's enjoyment in the dress hunting. Maybe I could do a little clothes shopping as well. I refused to think that I might be shopping alone in Seattle this weekend, no longer interested in the earlier arrangement. Surely he wouldn't cancel without at least telling me. After school, Jessica followed me home in her old white Mercury so that I could ditch my books and truck. I brushed through my hair quickly when I was inside, feeling a slight lift of excitement as I contemplated getting out of Forks. I left a note for Charlie on the table, explaining again where to find dinner, switched my scruffy wallet from my school bag to a purse I rarely used, and ran out to join Jessica. We went to Angela's house next, and she was waiting for us. My excitement increased exponentially as we actually drove out of the town limits.",
