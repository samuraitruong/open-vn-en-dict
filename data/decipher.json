            "en": "10 Things You Didn't Know About You    \n \n\n\n   Your Stomach Secretes Corrosive Acid\n\n There's one dangerous liquid no airport security can confiscate from you: It's in your gut. Your stomach cells secrete hydrochloric acid, a corrosive compound used to treat metals in the industrial world. It can pickle steel, but mucous lining the stomach wall keeps this poisonous liquid safely in the digestive system. Body Position Affects Your Memory Can't remember your anniversary, hubby? Try getting down on one knee. Memories are highly embodied in our senses. A scent or sound may evoke a distant episode from one's childhood. The connections can be obvious (a bicycle bell makes you remember your old paper route) or inscrutable. A recent study helps <em>decipher</em> some of this embodiment. An article in the January 2007 issue of Cognition reports that episodes from your past are remembered faster and better while in a body position similar to the pose struck during the event. \n \n\n\n \n \n\n   Bones Break (Down) to Balance Minerals\n\n In addition to supporting the bag of organs and muscles that is our body, bones help regulate our calcium levels. Bones contain both phosphorus and calcium, the latter of which is needed by muscles and nerves. If the element is in short supply, certain hormones will cause bones to break down for upping calcium levels in the body until the appropriate extracellular concentration is reached. \n \n\n\n     Much of a Meal is Food For Thought\n\n Though it makes up only 2 percent of our total body weight, the brain demands 20 percent of the body's oxygen and calories. To keep our noggin well-stocked with resources, three major cerebral arteries are constantly pumping in oxygen. A blockage or break in one of them starves brain cells of the energy they require to function, impairing the functions controlled by that region. This is a stroke. \n \n\n\n \n \n\n   Thousands of Eggs Unused by Ovaries\n\n When a woman reaches her late 40s or early 50s, the monthly menstrual cycle that controls her hormone levels and readies ova for insemination ceases. Her ovaries have been producing less and less estrogen, inciting physical and emotional changes across her body. Her underdeveloped egg follicles begin to fail to release ova as regularly as before. The average adolescent girl has 34,000 underdeveloped egg follicles, although only 350 or so mature during her life (at the rate of about one per month). The unused egg follicles then deteriorate. With no potential pregnancy on the horizon, the brain can stop managing the release of ova. \n \n\n\n \n \n\n   Puberty Reshapes Brain Structure, Makes for Missed Curfews\n\n We know that hormone-fueled changes in the body are necessary to encourage growth and ready the body for reproduction. But why is adolescence so emotionally unpleasant? Hormones like testosterone actually influence the development of neurons in the brain, and the changes made to brain structure have many behavioral consequences. Expect emotional awkwardness, apathy and poor decision-making skills as regions in the frontal cortex mature. \n \n\n\n \n \n\n   Cell Hairs Move Mucus\n\n Most cells in our bodies sport hair-like organelles called cilia that help out with a variety of functions, from digestion to hearing. In the nose, cilia help to drain mucus from the nasal cavity down to the throat. Cold weather slows down the draining process, causing a mucus backup that can leave you with snotty sleeves. Swollen nasal membranes or condensation can also cause a stuffed schnozzle. \n \n\n\n \n \n\n   Big Brains Cause Cramped Mouths\n\n Evolution isn't perfect. If it were, we might have wings instead of wisdom teeth. Sometimes useless features stick around in a species simply because they're not doing much harm. But wisdom teeth weren't always a cash crop for oral surgeons. Long ago, they served as a useful third set of meat-mashing molars. But as our brains grew our jawbone structure changed, leaving us with expensively overcrowded mouths. \n \n\n\n \n \n\n   The World Laughs with You\n\n Just as watching someone yawn can induce the behavior in yourself, recent evidence suggests that laughter is a social cue for mimicry. Hearing a laugh actually stimulates the brain region associated with facial movements. Mimicry plays an important role in social interaction. Cues like sneezing, laughing, crying and yawning may be ways of creating strong social bonds within a group. \n \n\n\n \n \n\n   Your Skin Has Four Colors\n\n All skin, without coloring, would appear creamy white. Near-surface blood vessels add a blush of red. A yellow pigment also tints the canvas. Lastly, sepia-toned melanin, created in response to ultraviolet rays, appears black in large amounts. These four hues mix in different proportions to create the skin colors of all the peoples of Earth.",

            "en": "Benefits of Laughter       Written by Chuck Gallozzi Angels fly because they take themselves lightly (G.K. Chesterton) Plato's remark that \"Even the gods love jokes.\" must be correct, for the value of laughter is recorded in sacred scripture. For example, the Koran states that \"He deserves Paradise who makes his companions laugh.\" By the fourteenth century, the healing power of humor was recognized by the medical community. A good French surgeon, Henri de Mondeville (1260-1320), wrote, \"Let the surgeon take care to regulate the whole regimen of the patient's life for joy and happiness, allowing his relatives and special friends to cheer him, and by having someone tell him jokes.\"  However, extensive research on 'laughter therapy' did not begin until after the New England Journal of Medicine published an article by Norman Cousins in 1976. Later, in 1979, this article became the first chapter of his book, 'Anatomy of an Illness.' In it he explained how he was diagnosed in 1964 with ankylosing spondylitis (also known as spondylitis, or bechterew disease). The disease usually results in acute inflammation of the spine and can affect other areas of the body as well. Norman Cousins' case was so severe that he was given a one in five hundred chances of recovery and a few months to live. Realizing that negative thoughts and attitudes can result in illness, he reasoned that positive thoughts and attitudes may have the opposite effect. So he left the hospital and checked into a hotel where he took mega doses of vitamin C and watched humorous movies and shows, including 'Candid Camera' and the Marx Brothers. He found that ten minutes of boisterous laughter resulted in at least two hours of pain-free sleep. He continued his routine until he recovered. Thus, he proved that laughter is the best medicine, and pointed the way to mind-body medicine. William Fry, M.D., professor of psychiatry at Stanford University Medical School and expert on health and laughter, reports the average kindergarten student laughs 300 times a day. Yet, adults average just 17 laughs a day. Why the difference? Are we too uptight, too tense? Do we take life too seriously? Isn't it time we learned how to relax? We don't stop laughing because we grow old; we grow old because we stop laughing. So, if we want to fly like the angels and share in their happiness, we'll have to follow their example and take ourselves lightly. Our five senses are not enough for ideal living. We need to use our sixth sense: our sense of humor. Humor isn't about merely telling jokes; it's the way we view the world. We can be sincere about life without taking it so seriously. We can laugh about our mistakes and pain. Louis Kronenberger explains: \"Humor simultaneously wounds and heals, indicts and pardons, diminishes and enlarges; it constitutes inner growth at the expense of outer gain.\" The brilliant American humorist, James Thurber (1894-1961), described humorists as follows: \"The wit makes fun of other persons; the satirist makes fun of the world; the humorist makes fun of himself, but in so doing, he identifies himself with people - that is, people everywhere, not for the purpose of taking them apart, but simply revealing their true nature.\" The wellspring of laughter is not happiness, but pain, stress, and suffering. Socrates pointed this out when he taught, \"The comic and the tragic lie inseparably close, like light and shadow.\" So, we should be thankful for our suffering, for without it there would be nothing to laugh at! When we laugh at our woes, they dissolve, or at least become bearable, so that we arrive at peace and happiness. As the pragmatic philosopher and psychologist, William James (1842-1910), said, \"We don't laugh because we're happy, we are happy because we laugh.\" What's the reason behind this article? Simply to point out the benefits of laughter are too numerous to ignore. Now is the time to resolve that we will consciously make an effort to laugh frequently throughout the day. Of course, as we do so, we will laugh with people - not at them. We will laugh at what people do, not at what people are. We will laugh not only to lighten our burdens, but those of everyone we meet. The many benefits of laughter 1. When you make fun of yourself, you disempower those who would make fun of you and disarm possible confrontations. 2. Laughter dissolves tension, stress, anxiety, irritation, anger, grief, and depression. Like crying, laughter lowers inhibitions, allowing the release of pent-up emotions. After a hearty bout of laughter, you will experience a sense of well-being. Simply put, he who laughs, lasts. After all, if you can laugh at it, you can live with it. Remember, a person without a sense of humor is like a car without shock absorbers. 3. Medical researches have found that laughter boosts the immune system. The study of how behavior and the brain affect the immune system is called psychoneuroimmunology. Though still in its infancy, this science is rapidly gaining much attention as mankind strives to understand the mind-body relationship. 4. Laughter reduces pain by releasing endorphins that are more potent than equivalent amounts of morphine. 5. Humor helps integrate both hemispheres of our brain, for the left hemisphere is used to <em>decipher</em> the verbal content of a joke while the right hemisphere interprets whether it is funny or not. 6. Laughter adds spice to life; it may comfort our miserable life . 7. Develop your sense of humor and you will find you are more productive, a better communicator, and a superior team player. 8. Everyone loves someone who can make them laugh. The more you share your sense of humor, the more friends you will have. 9. Humor brings the balance we need to get through the turbulence of life comfortably. 10. Laughter is even equivalent to a small amount of exercise. It massages all the organs of the body, according to Dr. James Walsh. 11. A sense of humor can help you accept the inevitable, rise to any challenge, handle the unexpected with ease, and come out of any difficulty smiling. The most wasted day is that in which we have not laughed. Don't wait until you are sick before you begin practicing laughter therapy. Start today by renting comedy classics from your video store, borrowing humorous books from the library, attending comedy clubs or watching comics on TV, and exchanging jokes with family members, friends, and coworkers. If you are visiting someone in the hospital, why not bring funny greeting cards and humorous books instead of flowers? Every time I'm out on a cloudy day with a group of friends, I'm the first person to know when it starts to rain. Do you know why? Because I'm bald!",

            "en": "21          21. PHONE CALL I could feel it was too early again when I woke, and I knew I was getting the schedule of my days and nights slowly reversed. I lay in my bed and listened to the quiet voices of Alice and Jasper in the other room. That they were loud enough for me to hear at all was strange. I rolled till my feet touched the floor and then staggered to the living room. The clock on the TV said it was just after two in the morning. Alice and Jasper were sitting together on the sofa, Alice sketching again while Jasper looked over her shoulder. They didn't look up when I entered, too engrossed in Alice's work. I crept to Jasper's side to peek. \"Did she see something more?\" I asked him quietly. \"Yes. Something's brought him back to the room with the VCR, but it's light now.\" I watched as Alice drew a square room with dark beams across its low ceiling. The walls were paneled in wood, a little too dark, out of date.  The floor had a dark carpet with a pattern in it. There was a large window against the south wall, and an opening through the west wall led to the living room. One side of that entrance was stone \u2014 a large tan stone fireplace that was open to both rooms. The focus of the room from this perspective, the TV and VCR, balanced on a too-small wooden stand, were in the southwest corner of the room. An aged sectional sofa curved around in front of the TV, a round coffee table in front of it. \"The phone goes there,\" I whispered, pointing. Two pairs of eternal eyes stared at me. \"That's my mother's house.\" Alice was already off the couch, phone in hand, dialing. I stared at the precise rendering of my mother's family room. Uncharacteristically, Jasper slid closer to me. He lightly touched his hand to my shoulder, and the physical contact seemed to make his calming influence stronger. The panic stayed dull, unfocused. Alice's lips were trembling with the speed of her words, the low buzzing impossible to <em>decipher</em>. I couldn't concentrate. \"Bella,\" Alice said. I looked at her numbly. \"Bella, Edward is coming to get you. He and Emmett and Carlisle are going to take you somewhere, to hide you for a while.\" \"Edward is coming?\" The words were like a life vest, holding my head above the flood. \"Yes, he's catching the first flight out of Seattle. We'll meet him at the airport, and you'll leave with him.\" \"But, my mother\u2026 he came here for my mother, Alice!\" Despite Jasper, the hysteria bubbled up in my voice. \"Jasper and I will stay till she's safe.\" \"I can't win, Alice. You can't guard everyone I know forever. Don't you see what he's doing? He's not tracking me at all. He'll find someone, he'll hurt someone I love\u2026 Alice, I can't \u2014\" \"We'll catch him, Bella,\" she assured me. \"And what if you get hurt, Alice? Do you think that's okay with me? Do you think it's only my human family he can hurt me with?\" Alice looked meaningfully at Jasper. A deep, heavy fog of lethargy washed over me, and my eyes closed without my permission. My mind struggled against the fog, realizing what was happening. I forced my eyes open and stood up, stepping away from Jasper's hand. \"I don't want to go back to sleep,\" I snapped. I walked to my room and shut the door, slammed it really, so I could be free to go to pieces privately. This time Alice didn't follow me. For three and a half hours I stared at the wall, curled in a ball, rocking. My mind went around in circles, trying to come up with some way out of this nightmare. There was no escape, no reprieve. I could see only one possible end looming darkly in my future. The only question was how many other people would be hurt before I reached it. The only solace, the only hope I had left, was knowing that I would see Edward soon. Maybe, if I could just see his face again, I would also be able to see the solution that eluded me now. When the phone rang, I returned to the front room, a little ashamed of my behavior. I hoped I hadn't offended either of them, that they would know how grateful I was for the sacrifices they were making on my account. Alice was talking as rapidly as ever, but what caught my attention was that, for the first time, Jasper was not in the room. I looked at the clock \u2014 it was five-thirty in the morning. \"They're just boarding their plane,\" Alice told me. \"They'll land at nine-forty-five.\" Just a few more hours to keep breathing till he was here. \"Where's Jasper?\" \"He went to check out.\" \"You aren't staying here?\" \"No, we're relocating closer to your mother's house.\" My stomach twisted uneasily at her words. But the phone rang again, distracting me. She looked surprised, but I was already walking forward, reaching hopefully for the phone. \"Hello?\" Alice asked. \"No, she's right here.\" She held the phone out to me. Your mother, she mouthed. \"Hello?\" \"Bella? Bella?\" It was my mother's voice, in a familiar tone I had heard a thousand times in my childhood, anytime I'd gotten too close to the edge of the sidewalk or strayed out of her sight in a crowded place. It was the sound of panic. I sighed. I'd been expecting this, though I'd tried to make my message as unalarming as possible without lessening the urgency of it. \"Calm down, Mom,\" I said in my most soothing voice, walking slowly away from Alice. I wasn't sure if I could lie as convincingly with her eyes on me. \"Everything is fine, okay? Just give me a minute and I'll explain everything, I promise.\" I paused, surprised that she hadn't interrupted me yet. \"Mom?\" \"Be very careful not to say anything until I tell you to.\" The voice I heard now was as unfamiliar as it was unexpected. It was a man's tenor voice, a very pleasant, generic voice \u2014 the kind of voice that you heard in the background of luxury car commercials. He spoke very quickly. \"Now, I don't need to hurt your mother, so please do exactly as I say, and she'll be fine.\" He paused for a minute while I listened in mute horror. \"That's very good,\" he congratulated. \"Now repeat after me, and do try to sound natural. Please say, 'No, Mom, stay where you are.'\" \"No, Mom, stay where you are.\" My voice was barely more than a whisper. \"I can see this is going to be difficult.\" The voice was amused, still light and friendly. \"Why don't you walk into another room now so your face doesn't ruin everything? There's no reason for your mother to suffer. As you're walking, please say, 'Mom, please listen to me.' Say it now.\" \"Mom, please listen to me,\" my voice pleaded. I walked very slowly to the bedroom, feeling Alice's worried stare on my back. I shut the door behind me, trying to think clearly through the terror that gripped my brain. \"There now, are you alone? Just answer yes or no.\"  \"Yes.\" \"But they can still hear you, I'm sure.\" \"Yes.\" \"All right, then,\" the agreeable voice continued, \"say, 'Mom, trust me.'\" \"Mom, trust me.\" \"This worked out rather better than I expected. I was prepared to wait, but your mother arrived ahead of schedule. It's easier this way, isn't it? Less suspense, less anxiety for you.\" I waited. \"Now I want you to listen very carefully. I'm going to need you to get away from your friends; do you think you can do that? Answer yes or no.\" \"No.\" \"I'm sorry to hear that. I was hoping you would be a little more creative than that. Do you think you could get away from them if your mother's life depended on it? Answer yes or no.\" Somehow, there had to be a way. I remembered that we were going to the airport. Sky Harbor International Airport: crowded, confusingly laid out\u2026 \"Yes.\" \"That's better. I'm sure it won't be easy, but if I get the slightest hint that you have any company, well, that would be very bad for your mother,\" the friendly voice promised. \"You must know enough about us by now to realize how quickly I would know if you tried to bring anyone along with you. And how little time I would need to deal with your mother if that was the case. Do you understand? Answer yes or no.\" \"Yes.\" My voice broke. \"Very good, Bella. Now this is what you have to do. I want you to go to your mother's house. Next to the phone there will be a number. Call it, and I'll tell you where to go from there.\" I already knew where I would go, and where this would end. But I would follow his instructions exactly. \"Can you do that? Answer yes or no.\" \"Yes.\" \"Before noon, please, Bella. I haven't got all day,\" he said politely. \"Where's Phil?\" I asked tersely. \"Ah, be careful now, Bella. Wait until I ask you to speak, please.\" I waited. \"It's important, now, that you don't make your friends suspicious when you go back to them.  Tell them that your mother called, and that you talked her out of coming home for the time being. Now repeat after me, 'Thank you, Mom.' Say it now.\" \"Thank you, Mom.\" The tears were coming. I tried to fight them back. \"Say, 'I love you, Mom, I'll see you soon.' Say it now.\" \"I love you, Mom.\" My voice was thick. \"I'll see you soon,\" I promised. \"Goodbye, Bella. I look forward to seeing you again.\" He hung up. I held the phone to my ear. My joints were frozen with terror \u2014 I couldn't unbend my fingers to drop it. I knew I had to think, but my head was filled with the sound of my mother's panic. Seconds ticked by while I fought for control.  Slowly, slowly, my thoughts started to break past that brick wall of pain. To plan. For I had no choices now but one: to go to the mirrored room and die. I had no guarantees, nothing to give to keep my mother alive. I could only hope that James would be satisfied with winning the game, that beating Edward would be enough. Despair gripped me; there was no way to bargain, nothing I could offer or withhold that could influence him. But I still had no choice. I had to try. I pushed the terror back as well as I could. My decision was made. It did no good to waste time agonizing over the outcome. I had to think clearly, because Alice and Jasper were waiting for me, and evading them was absolutely essential, and absolutely impossible. I was suddenly grateful that Jasper was gone. If he had been here to feel my anguish in the last five minutes, how could I have kept them from being suspicious? I choked back the dread, the anxiety, tried to stifle it. I couldn't afford it now. I didn't know when he would return. I concentrated on my escape. I had to hope that my familiarity with the airport would turn the odds in my favor. Somehow, I had to keep Alice away\u2026 I knew Alice was in the other room waiting for me, curious. But I had to deal with one more thing in private, before Jasper was back. I had to accept that I wouldn't see Edward again, not even one last glimpse of his face to carry with me to the mirror room. I was going to hurt him, and I couldn't say goodbye. I let the waves of torture wash over me, have their way for a time. Then I pushed them back, too, and went to face Alice. The only expression I could manage was a dull, dead look. I saw her alarm and I didn't wait for her to ask. I had just one script and I'd never manage improvisation now. \"My mom was worried, she wanted to come home. But it's okay, I convinced her to stay away.\" My voice was lifeless. \"We'll make sure she's fine, Bella, don't worry.\" I turned away; I couldn't let her see my face. My eye fell on a blank page of the hotel stationery on the desk. I went to it slowly, a plan forming. There was an envelope there, too. That was good. \"Alice,\" I asked slowly, without turning, keeping my voice level. \"If I write a letter for my mother, would you give it to her? Leave it at the house, I mean.\" \"Sure, Bella.\" Her voice was careful. She could see me coming apart at the seams. I had to keep my emotions under better control.  I went into the bedroom again, and knelt next to the little bedside table to write. \"Edward,\" I wrote. My hand was shaking, the letters were hardly legible. I love you. I am so sorry. He has my mom, and I have to try. I know it may not work. I am so very, very sorry. Don't be angry with Alice and Jasper. If I get away from them it will be a miracle. Tell them thank you for me. Alice especially, please.  And please, please, don't come after him. That's what he wants. I think.  I can't bear it if anyone has to be hurt because of me, especially you. Please, this is the only thing I can ask you now. For me. I love you. Forgive me. Bella I folded the letter carefully, and sealed it in the envelope. Eventually he would find it. I only hoped he would understand, and listen to me just this once. And then I carefully sealed away my heart.",

            "en": "13        13. CONFESSIONS Edward in the sunlight was shocking. I couldn't get used to it, though I'd been staring at him all afternoon. His skin, white despite the faint flush from yesterday's hunting trip, literally sparkled, like thousands of tiny diamonds were embedded in the surface. He lay perfectly still in the grass, his shirt open over his sculpted, incandescent chest, his scintillating arms bare. His glistening, pale lavender lids were shut, though of course he didn't sleep. A perfect statue, carved in some unknown stone, smooth like marble, glittering like crystal. Now and then, his lips would move, so fast it looked like they were trembling. But, when I asked, he told me he was singing to himself; it was too low for me to hear. I enjoyed the sun, too, though the air wasn't quite dry enough for my taste. I would have liked to lie back, as he did, and let the sun warm my face. But I stayed curled up, my chin resting on my knees, unwilling to take my eyes off him. The wind was gentle; it tangled my hair and ruffled the grass that swayed around his motionless form. The meadow, so spectacular to me at first, paled next to his magnificence. Hesitantly, always afraid, even now, that he would disappear like a mirage, too beautiful to be real\u2026 hesitantly, I reached out one finger and stroked the back of his shimmering hand, where it lay within my reach. I marveled again at the perfect texture, satin smooth, cool as stone. When I looked up again, his eyes were open, watching me. Butterscotch today, lighter, warmer after hunting. His quick smile turned up the corners of his flawless lips. \"I don't scare you?\" he asked playfully, but I could hear the real curiosity in his soft voice. \"No more than usual.\" He smiled wider; his teeth flashed in the sun. I inched closer, stretched out my whole hand now to trace the contours of his forearm with my fingertips. I saw that my fingers trembled, and knew it wouldn't escape his notice. \"Do you mind?\" I asked, for he had closed his eyes again. \"No,\" he said without opening his eyes. \"You can't imagine how that feels.\" He sighed. I lightly trailed my hand over the perfect muscles of his arm, followed\u00a0 the faint pattern of bluish veins inside the crease at his elbow. With my other hand, I reached to turn his hand over. Realizing what I wished, he flipped his palm up in one of those blindingly fast, disconcerting movements of his. It startled me; my fingers froze on his arm for a brief second. \"Sorry,\" he murmured. I looked up in time to see his golden eyes close again. \"It's too easy to be myself with you.\" I lifted his hand, turning it this way and that as I watched the sun glitter on his palm. I held it closer to my face, trying to see the hidden facets in his skin. \"Tell me what you're thinking,\" he whispered. I looked to see his eyes watching me, suddenly intent. \"It's still so strange for me, not knowing.\" \"You know, the rest of us feel that way all the time.\" \"It's a hard life.\" Did I imagine the hint of regret in his tone? \"But you didn't tell me.\" \"I was wishing I could know what you were thinking\u2026\" I hesitated. \"And?\" \"I was wishing that I could believe that you were real. And I was wishing that I wasn't afraid.\" \"I don't want you to be afraid.\" His voice was just a soft murmur. I heard what he couldn't truthfully say, that I didn't need to be afraid, that there was nothing to fear. \"Well, that's not exactly the fear I meant, though that's certainly something to think about.\" So quickly that I missed his movement, he was half sitting, propped up on his right arm, his left palm still in my hands. His angel's face was only a few inches from mine. I might have \u2014 should have \u2014 flinched away from his unexpected closeness, but I was unable to move.  His golden eyes mesmerized me. \"What are you afraid of, then?\" he whispered intently. But I couldn't answer. As I had just that once before, I smelled his cool breath in my face. Sweet, delicious, the scent made my mouth water. It was unlike anything else. Instinctively, unthinkingly, I leaned closer, inhaling. And he was gone, his hand ripped from mine. In the time it took my eyes to focus, he was twenty feet away, standing at the edge of the small meadow, in the deep shade of a huge fir tree. He stared at me, his eyes dark in the shadows, his expression unreadable. I could feel the hurt and shock on my face. My empty hands stung. \"I'm\u2026 sorry\u2026 Edward,\" I whispered. I knew he could hear. \"Give me a moment,\" he called, just loud enough for my less sensitive ears. I sat very still. After ten incredibly long seconds, he walked back, slowly for him. He stopped, still several feet away, and sank gracefully to the ground, crossing his legs. His eyes never left mine.  He took two deep breaths, and then smiled in apology. \"I am so very sorry.\" He hesitated. \"Would you understand what I meant if I said I was only human?\" I nodded once, not quite able to smile at his joke. Adrenaline pulsed through my veins as the realization of danger slowly sank in. He could smell that from where he sat. His smile turned mocking. \"I'm the world's best predator, aren't I? Everything about me invites you in \u2014 my voice, my face, even my smell. As if I need any of that!\" Unexpectedly, he was on his feet, bounding away, instantly out of sight, only to appear beneath the same tree as before, having circled the meadow in half a second. \"As if you could outrun me,\" he laughed bitterly. He reached up with one hand and, with a deafening crack, effortlessly ripped a two-foot-thick branch from the trunk of the spruce. He balanced it in that hand for a moment, and then threw it with blinding speed, shattering it against another huge tree, which shook and trembled at the blow. And he was in front of me again, standing two feet away, still as a stone. \"As if you could fight me off,\" he said gently. I sat without moving, more frightened of him than I had ever been. I'd never seen him so completely freed of that carefully cultivated facade. He'd never been less human\u2026 or more beautiful. Face ashen, eyes wide, I sat like a bird locked in the eyes of a snake. His lovely eyes seem to glow with rash excitement. Then, as the seconds passed, they dimmed. His expression slowly folded into a mask of ancient sadness. \"Don't be afraid,\" he murmured, his velvet voice unintentionally seductive. \"I promise\u2026\" He hesitated. \"I swear not to hurt you.\" He seemed more concerned with convincing himself than me. \"Don't be afraid,\" he whispered again as he stepped closer, with exaggerated slowness. He sat sinuously, with deliberately unhurried movements, till our faces were on the same level, just a foot apart. \"Please forgive me,\" he said formally. \"I can control myself. You caught me off guard. But I'm on my best behavior now.\" He waited, but I still couldn't speak. \"I'm not thirsty today, honestly.\" He winked. At that I had to laugh, though the sound was shaky and breathless. \"Are you all right?\" he asked tenderly, reaching out slowly, carefully, to place his marble hand back in mine. I looked at his smooth, cold hand, and then at his eyes. They were soft, repentant. I looked back at his hand, and then deliberately returned to tracing the lines in his hand with my fingertip. I looked up and smiled timidly. His answering smile was dazzling. \"So where were we, before I behaved so rudely?\" he asked in the gentle cadences of an earlier century. \"I honestly can't remember.\" He smiled, but his face was ashamed. \"I think we were talking about why you were afraid, besides the obvious reason.\" \"Oh, right.\" \"Well?\" I looked down at his hand and doodled aimlessly across his smooth, iridescent palm. The seconds ticked by. \"How easily frustrated I am,\" he sighed. I looked into his eyes, abruptly grasping that this was every bit as new to him as it was to me. As many years of unfathomable experience as he had, this was hard for him, too. I took courage from that thought. \"I was afraid\u2026 because, for, well, obvious reasons, I can't stay with you. And I'm afraid that I'd like to stay with you, much more than I should.\" I looked down at his hands as I spoke. It was difficult for me to say this aloud. \"Yes,\" he agreed slowly. \"That is something to be afraid of, indeed. Wanting to be with me. That's really not in your best interest.\" I frowned. \"I should have left long ago,\" he sighed. \"I should leave now. But I don't know if I can.\" \"I don't want you to leave,\" I mumbled pathetically, staring down again. \"Which is exactly why I should. But don't worry. I'm essentially a selfish creature. I crave your company too much to do what I should.\" \"I'm glad.\" \"Don't be!\" He withdrew his hand, more gently this time; his voice was harsher than usual. Harsh for him, still more beautiful than any human voice. It was hard to keep up \u2014 his sudden mood changes left me always a step behind, dazed. \"It's not only your company I crave! Never forget that. Never forget I am more dangerous to you than I am to anyone else.\" He stopped, and I looked to see him gazing unseeingly into the forest. I thought for a moment. \"I don't think I understand exactly what you mean \u2014 by that last part anyway,\" I said. He looked back at me and smiled, his mood shifting yet again. \"How do I explain?\" he mused. \"And without frightening you again\u2026 hmmmm.\" Without seeming to think about it, he placed his hand back in mine; I held it tightly in both of mine. He looked at our hands. \"That's amazingly pleasant, the warmth.\" He sighed. A moment passed as he assembled his thoughts. \"You know how everyone enjoys different flavors?\" he began. \"Some people love chocolate ice cream, others prefer strawberry?\" I nodded. \"Sorry about the food analogy \u2014 I couldn't think of another way to explain.\" I smiled. He smiled ruefully back. \"You see, every person smells different, has a different essence. If you locked an alcoholic in a room full of stale beer, he'd gladly drink it. But he could resist, if he wished to, if he were a recovering alcoholic. Now let's say you placed in that room a glass of hundred-year-old brandy, the rarest, finest cognac \u2014 and filled the room with its warm aroma \u2014 how do you think he would fare then?\" We sat silently, looking into each other's eyes \u2014 trying to read each other's thoughts. He broke the silence first. \"Maybe that's not the right comparison. Maybe it would be too easy to turn down the brandy. Perhaps I should have made our alcoholic a heroin addict instead.\" \"So what you're saying is, I'm your brand of heroin?\" I teased, trying to lighten the mood. He smiled swiftly, seeming to appreciate my effort. \"Yes, you are exactly my brand of heroin.\" \"Does that happen often?\" I asked. He looked across the treetops, thinking through his response. \"I spoke to my brothers about it.\" He still stared into the distance. \"To Jasper, every one of you is much the same. He's the most recent to join our family. It's a struggle for him to abstain at all. He hasn't had time to grow sensitive to the differences in smell, in flavor.\" He glanced swiftly at me, his expression apologetic. \"Sorry,\" he said. \"I don't mind. Please don't worry about offending me, or frightening me, or whichever. That's the way you think. I can understand, or I can try to at least. Just explain however you can.\" He took a deep breath and gazed at the sky again. \"So Jasper wasn't sure if he'd ever come across someone who was as\" \u2014 he hesitated, looking for the right word \u2014 \"appealing as you are to me.\u00a0 Which makes me think not. Emmett has been on the wagon longer, so to speak, and he understood what I meant. He says twice, for him, once stronger than the other.\" \"And for you?\" \"Never.\" The word hung there for a moment in the warm breeze. \"What did Emmett do?\" I asked to break the silence. It was the wrong question to ask. His face grew dark, his hand clenched into a fist inside mine. He looked away. I waited, but he wasn't going to answer. \"I guess I know,\" I finally said. He lifted his eyes; his expression was wistful, pleading. \"Even the strongest of us fall off the wagon, don't we?\" \"What are you asking? My permission?\" My voice was sharper than I'd intended. I tried to make my tone kinder \u2014 I could guess what his honesty must cost him. \"I mean, is there no hope, then?\" How calmly I could discuss my own death! \"No, no!\" He was instantly contrite. \"Of course there's hope! I mean, of course I won't\u2026\" He left the sentence hanging. His eyes burned into mine. \"It's different for us. Emmett\u2026 these were strangers he happened across. It was a long time ago, and he wasn't as\u2026 practiced, as careful, as he is now.\" He fell silent and watched me intently as I thought it through. \"So if we'd met\u2026 oh, in a dark alley or something\u2026\" I trailed off. \"It took everything I had not to jump up in the middle of that class full of children and \u2014\" He stopped abruptly, looking away. \"When you walked past me, I could have ruined everything Carlisle has built for us, right then and there. If I hadn't been denying my thirst for the last, well, too many years, I wouldn't have been able to stop myself.\" He paused, scowling at the trees. He glanced at me grimly, both of us remembering. \"You must have thought I was possessed.\" \"I couldn't understand why. How you could hate me so quickly\u2026\" \"To me, it was like you were some kind of demon, summoned straight from my own personal hell to ruin me. The fragrance coming off your skin\u2026 I thought it would make me deranged that first day. In that one hour, I thought of a hundred different ways to lure you from the room with me, to get you alone. And I fought them each back, thinking of my family, what I could do to them. I had to run out, to get away before I could speak the words that would make you follow\u2026\" He looked up then at my staggered expression as I tried to absorb his bitter memories. His golden eyes scorched from under his lashes, hypnotic and deadly. \"You would have come,\" he promised. I tried to speak calmly. \"Without a doubt.\" He frowned down at my hands, releasing me from the force of his stare. \"And then, as I tried to rearrange my schedule in a pointless attempt to avoid you, you were there \u2014 in that close, warm little room, the scent was maddening. I so very nearly took you then. There was only one other frail human there \u2014 so easily dealt with.\" I shivered in the warm sun, seeing my memories anew through his eyes, only now grasping the danger. Poor Ms. Cope; I shivered again at how close I'd come to being inadvertently responsible for her death. \"But I resisted. I don't know how. I forced myself not to wait for you, not to follow you from the school. It was easier outside, when I couldn't smell you anymore, to think clearly, to make the right decision. I left the others near home \u2014 I was too ashamed to tell them how weak I was, they only knew something was very wrong \u2014 and then I went straight to Carlisle, at the hospital, to tell him I was leaving.\" I stared in surprise.  \"I traded cars with him \u2014 he had a full tank of gas and I didn't want to stop. I didn't dare to go home, to face Esme. She wouldn't have let me go without a scene. She would have tried to convince me that it wasn't necessary\u2026 \"By the next morning I was in Alaska.\" He sounded ashamed, as if admitting a great cowardice. \"I spent two days there, with some old acquaintances\u2026 but I was homesick. I hated knowing I'd upset Esme, and the rest of them, my adopted family. In the pure air of the mountains it was hard to believe you were so irresistible. I convinced myself it was weak to run away. I'd dealt with temptation before, not of this magnitude, not even close, but I was strong. Who were you, an insignificant little girl\" \u2014 he grinned suddenly \u2014 \"to chase me from the place I wanted to be? So I came back\u2026\" He stared off into space. I couldn't speak. \"I took precautions, hunting, feeding more than usual before seeing you again. I was sure that I was strong enough to treat you like any other human. I was arrogant about it. \"It was unquestionably a complication that I couldn't simply read your thoughts to know what your reaction was to me. I wasn't used to having to go to such circuitous measures, listening to your words in Jessica's mind\u2026 her mind isn't very original, and it was annoying to have to stoop to that. And then I couldn't know if you really meant what you said. It was all extremely irritating.\" He frowned at the memory. \"I wanted you to forget my behavior that first day, if possible, so I tried to talk with you like I would with any person. I was eager actually, hoping to <em>decipher</em> some of your thoughts. But you were too interesting, I found myself caught up in your expressions\u2026 and every now and then you would stir the air with your hand or your hair, and the scent would stun me again\u2026 \"Of course, then you were nearly crushed to death in front of my eyes. Later I thought of a perfectly good excuse for why I acted at that moment \u2014 because if I hadn't saved you, if your blood had been spilled there in front of me, I don't think I could have stopped myself from exposing us for what we are. But I only thought of that excuse later. At the time, all I could think was, 'Not her.'\" He closed his eyes, lost in his agonized confession. I listened, more eager than rational. Common sense told me I should be terrified. Instead, I was relieved to finally understand. And I was filled with compassion for his suffering, even now, as he confessed his craving to take my life. I finally was able to speak, though my voice was faint. \"In the hospital?\" His eyes flashed up to mine. \"I was appalled. I couldn't believe I had put us in danger after all, put myself in your power \u2014 you of all people. As if I needed another motive to kill you.\"  We both flinched as that word slipped out. \"But it had the opposite effect,\" he continued quickly. \"I fought with Rosalie, Emmett, and Jasper when they suggested that now was the time\u2026 the worst fight we've ever had. Carlisle sided with me, and Alice.\" He grimaced when he said her name. I couldn't imagine why. \"Esme told me to do whatever I had to in order to stay.\" He shook his head indulgently. \"All that next day I eavesdropped on the minds of everyone you spoke to, shocked that you kept your word. I didn't understand you at all. But I knew that I couldn't become more involved with you. I did my very best to stay as far from you as possible. And every day the perfume of your skin, your breath, your hair\u2026 it hit me as hard as the very first day.\" He met my eyes again, and they were surprisingly tender. \"And for all that,\" he continued, \"I'd have fared better if I had exposed us all at that first moment, than if now, here \u2014 with no witnesses and nothing to stop me \u2014 I were to hurt you.\" I was human enough to have to ask. \"Why?\" \"Isabella.\" He pronounced my full name carefully, then playfully ruffled my hair with his free hand. A shock ran through my body at his casual touch. \"Bella, I couldn't live with myself if I ever hurt you. You don't know how it's tortured me.\" He looked down, ashamed again. \"The thought of you, still, white, cold\u2026 to never see you blush scarlet again, to never see that flash of intuition in your eyes when you see through my pretenses\u2026 it would be unendurable.\" He lifted his glorious, agonized eyes to mine. \"You are the most important thing to me now. The most important thing to me ever.\" My head was spinning at the rapid change in direction our conversation had taken. From the cheerful topic of my impending demise, we were suddenly declaring ourselves. He waited, and even though I looked down to study our hands between us, I knew his golden eyes were on me.  \"You already know how I feel, of course,\" I finally said. \"I'm here\u2026 which, roughly translated, means I would rather die than stay away from you.\" I frowned. \"I'm an idiot.\" \"You are an idiot,\" he agreed with a laugh. Our eyes met, and I laughed, too. We laughed together at the idiocy and sheer impossibility of such a moment. \"And so the lion fell in love with the lamb\u2026\" he murmured. I looked away, hiding my eyes as I thrilled to the word. \"What a stupid lamb,\" I sighed. \"What a sick, masochistic lion.\" He stared into the shadowy forest for a long moment, and I wondered where his thoughts had taken him. \"Why\u2026 ?\" I began, and then paused, not sure how to continue. He looked at me and smiled; sunlight glinted off his face, his teeth.  \"Yes?\" \"Tell me why you ran from me before.\" His smile faded. \"You know why.\" \"No, I mean, exactly what did I do wrong? I'll have to be on my guard, you see, so I better start learning what I shouldn't do. This, for example\" \u2014 I stroked the back of his hand \u2014 \"seems to be all right.\" He smiled again. \"You didn't do anything wrong, Bella. It was my fault.\" \"But I want to help, if I can, to not make this harder for you.\" \"Well\u2026\" He contemplated for a moment. \"It was just how close you were. Most humans instinctively shy away from us, are repelled by our alienness\u2026 I wasn't expecting you to come so close. And the smell of your throat.\" He stopped short, looking to see if he'd upset me. \"Okay, then,\" I said flippantly, trying to alleviate the suddenly tense atmosphere. I tucked my chin. \"No throat exposure.\" It worked; he laughed. \"No, really, it was more the surprise than anything else.\" He raised his free hand and placed it gently on the side of my neck. I sat very still, the chill of his touch a natural warning \u2014 a warning telling me to be terrified. But there was no feeling of fear in me. There were, however, other feelings\u2026 \"You see,\" he said. \"Perfectly fine.\" My blood was racing, and I wished I could slow it, sensing that this must make everything so much more difficult \u2014 the thudding of my pulse in my veins. Surely he could hear it. \"The blush on your cheeks is lovely,\" he murmured. He gently freed his other hand. My hands fell limply into my lap. Softly he brushed my cheek, then held my face between his marble hands. \"Be very still,\" he whispered, as if I wasn't already frozen. Slowly, never moving his eyes from mine, he leaned toward me. Then abruptly, but very gently, he rested his cold cheek against the hollow at the base of my throat. I was quite unable to move, even if I'd wanted to. I listened to the sound of his even breathing, watching the sun and wind play in his bronze hair, more human than any other part of him. With deliberate slowness, his hands slid down the sides of my neck. I shivered, and I heard him catch his breath. But his hands didn't pause as they softly moved to my shoulders, and then stopped. His face drifted to the side, his nose skimming across my collarbone. He came to rest with the side of his face pressed tenderly against my chest. Listening to my heart. \"Ah,\" he sighed. I don't know how long we sat without moving. It could have been hours.  Eventually the throb of my pulse quieted, but he didn't move or speak again as he held me. I knew at any moment it could be too much, and my life could end \u2014 so quickly that I might not even notice. And I couldn't make myself be afraid. I couldn't think of anything, except that he was touching me. And then, too soon, he released me.  His eyes were peaceful. \"It won't be so hard again,\" he said with satisfaction. \"Was that very hard for you?\" \"Not nearly as bad as I imagined it would be. And you?\" \"No, it wasn't bad\u2026 for me.\" He smiled at my inflection. \"You know what I mean.\" I smiled. \"Here.\" He took my hand and placed it against his cheek. \"Do you feel how warm it is?\" And it was almost warm, his usually icy skin. But I barely noticed, for I was touching his face, something I'd dreamed of constantly since the first day I'd seen him. \"Don't move,\" I whispered. No one could be still like Edward. He closed his eyes and became as immobile as stone, a carving under my hand. I moved even more slowly than he had, careful not to make one unexpected move. I caressed his cheek, delicately stroked his eyelid, the purple shadow in the hollow under his eye. I traced the shape of his perfect nose, and then, so carefully, his flawless lips. His lips parted under my hand, and I could feel his cool breath on my fingertips. I wanted to lean in, to inhale the scent of him. So I dropped my hand and leaned away, not wanting to push him too far. He opened his eyes, and they were hungry. Not in a way to make me fear, but rather to tighten the muscles in the pit of my stomach and send my pulse hammering through my veins again. \"I wish,\" he whispered, \"I wish you could feel the\u2026 complexity\u2026 the confusion\u2026 I feel. That you could understand.\" He raised his hand to my hair, then carefully brushed it across my face. \"Tell me,\" I breathed. \"I don't think I can. I've told you, on the one hand, the hunger \u2014 the thirst \u2014 that, deplorable creature that I am, I feel for you. And I think you can understand that, to an extent. Though\" \u2014 he half-smiled \u2014 \"as you are not addicted to any illegal substances, you probably can't empathize completely. \"But\u2026\" His fingers touched my lips lightly, making me shiver again. \"There are other hungers. Hungers I don't even understand, that are foreign to me.\" \"I may understand that better than you think.\" \"I'm not used to feeling so human. Is it always like this?\" \"For me?\" I paused. \"No, never. Never before this.\" He held my hands between his. They felt so feeble in his iron strength. \"I don't know how to be close to you,\" he admitted. \"I don't know if I can.\" I leaned forward very slowly, cautioning him with my eyes. I placed my cheek against his stone chest. I could hear his breath, and nothing else. \"This is enough,\" I sighed, closing my eyes. In a very human gesture, he put his arms around me and pressed his face against my hair. \"You're better at this than you give yourself credit for,\" I noted. \"I have human instincts \u2014 they may be buried deep, but they're there.\" We sat like that for another immeasurable moment; I wondered if he could be as unwilling to move as I was. But I could see the light was fading, the shadows of the forest beginning to touch us, and I sighed. \"You have to go.\" \"I thought you couldn't read my mind.\" \"It's getting clearer.\" I could hear a smile in his voice. He took my shoulders and I looked into his face. \"Can I show you something?\" he asked, sudden excitement flaring in his eyes. \"Show me what?\" \"I'll show you how I travel in the forest.\" He saw my expression. \"Don't worry, you'll be very safe, and we'll get to your truck much faster.\" His mouth twitched up into that crooked smile so beautiful my heart nearly stopped. \"Will you turn into a bat?\" I asked warily. He laughed, louder than I'd ever heard. \"Like I haven't heard that one before!\" \"Right, I'm sure you get that all the time.\" \"Come on, little coward, climb on my back.\" I waited to see if he was kidding, but, apparently, he meant it. He smiled as he read my hesitation, and reached for me. My heart reacted; even though he couldn't hear my thoughts, my pulse always gave me away. He then proceeded to sling me onto his back, with very little effort on my part, besides, when in place, clamping my legs and arms so tightly around him that it would choke a normal person. It was like clinging to a stone. \"I'm a bit heavier than your average backpack,\" I warned.  \"Hah!\" he snorted. I could almost hear his eyes rolling. I'd never seen him in such high spirits before. He startled me, suddenly grabbing my hand, pressing my palm to his face, and inhaling deeply. \"Easier all the time,\" he muttered. And then he was running. If I'd ever feared death before in his presence, it was nothing compared to how I felt now. He streaked through the dark, thick underbrush of the forest like a bullet, like a ghost. There was no sound, no evidence that his feet touched the earth. His breathing never changed, never indicated any effort. But the trees flew by at deadly speeds, always missing us by inches. I was too terrified to close my eyes, though the cool forest air whipped against my face and burned them. I felt as if I were stupidly sticking my head out the window of an airplane in flight. And, for the first time in my life, I felt the dizzy faintness of motion sickness. Then it was over. We'd hiked hours this morning to reach Edward's meadow, and now, in a matter of minutes, we were back to the truck. \"Exhilarating, isn't it?\" His voice was high, excited. He stood motionless, waiting for me to climb down. I tried, but my muscles wouldn't respond. My arms and legs stayed locked around him while my head spun uncomfortably. \"Bella?\" he asked, anxious now. \"I think I need to lie down,\" I gasped. \"Oh, sorry.\" He waited for me, but I still couldn't move. \"I think I need help,\" I admitted. He laughed quietly, and gently unloosened my stranglehold on his neck. There was no resisting the iron strength of his hands. Then he pulled me around to face him, cradling me in his arms like a small child. He held me for a moment, then carefully placed me on the springy ferns. \"How do you feel?\" he asked. I couldn't be sure how I felt when my head was spinning so crazily. \"Dizzy, I think.\" \"Put your head between your knees.\" I tried that, and it helped a little. I breathed in and out slowly, keeping my head very still. I felt him sitting beside me. The moments passed, and eventually I found that I could raise my head. There was a hollow ringing sound in my ears. \"I guess that wasn't the best idea,\" he mused. I tried to be positive, but my voice was weak. \"No, it was very interesting.\" \"Hah! You're as white as a ghost \u2014 no, you're as white as me!\" \"I think I should have closed my eyes.\" \"Remember that next time.\" \"Next time!\" I groaned. He laughed, his mood still radiant. \"Show-off,\" I muttered. \"Open your eyes, Bella,\" he said quietly. And he was right there, his face so close to mine. His beauty stunned my mind \u2014 it was too much, an excess I couldn't grow accustomed to. \"I was thinking, while I was running\u2026\" He paused. \"About not hitting the trees, I hope.\" \"Silly Bella,\" he chuckled. \"Running is second nature to me, it's not something I have to think about.\" \"Show-off,\" I muttered again. He smiled. \"No,\" he continued, \"I was thinking there was something I wanted to try.\" And he took my face in his hands again. I couldn't breathe. He hesitated \u2014 not in the normal way, the human way. Not the way a man might hesitate before he kissed a woman, to gauge her reaction, to see how he would be received. Perhaps he would hesitate to prolong the moment, that ideal moment of anticipation, sometimes better than the kiss itself. Edward hesitated to test himself, to see if this was safe, to make sure he was still in control of his need. And then his cold, marble lips pressed very softly against mine. What neither of us was prepared for was my response. Blood boiled under my skin, burned in my lips. My breath came in a wild gasp. My fingers knotted in his hair, clutching him to me. My lips parted as I breathed in his heady scent. Immediately I felt him turn to unresponsive stone beneath my lips. His hands gently, but with irresistible force, pushed my face back. I opened my eyes and saw his guarded expression. \"Oops,\" I breathed. \"That's an understatement.\" His eyes were wild, his jaw clenched in acute restraint, yet he didn't lapse from his perfect articulation. He held my face just inches from his. He dazzled my eyes. \"Should I\u2026 ?\" I tried to disengage myself, to give him some room. His hands refused to let me move so much as an inch. \"No, it's tolerable. Wait for a moment, please.\" His voice was polite, controlled. I kept my eyes on his, watched as the excitement in them faded and gentled. Then he smiled a surprisingly impish grin. \"There,\" he said, obviously pleased with himself. \"Tolerable?\" I asked. He laughed aloud. \"I'm stronger than I thought. It's nice to know.\" \"I wish I could say the same. I'm sorry.\" \"You are only human, after all.\" \"Thanks so much,\" I said, my voice acerbic. He was on his feet in one of his lithe, almost invisibly quick movements. He held out his hand to me, an unexpected gesture. I was so used to our standard of careful non-contact. I took his icy hand, needing the support more than I thought. My balance had not yet returned. \"Are you still faint from the run? Or was it my kissing expertise?\" How lighthearted, how human he seemed as he laughed now, his seraphic face untroubled. He was a different Edward than the one I had known. And I felt all the more besotted by him. It would cause me physical pain to be separated from him now. \"I can't be sure, I'm still woozy,\" I managed to respond. \"I think it's some of both, though.\" \"Maybe you should let me drive.\" \"Are you insane?\" I protested. \"I can drive better than you on your best day,\" he teased. \"You have much slower reflexes.\" \"I'm sure that's true, but I don't think my nerves, or my truck, could take it.\" \"Some trust, please, Bella.\" My hand was in my pocket, curled tightly around the key. I pursed my lips, deliberated, then shook my head with a tight grin. \"Nope. Not a chance.\" He raised his eyebrows in disbelief. I started to step around him, heading for the driver's side. He might have let me pass if I hadn't wobbled slightly. Then again, he might not have. His arm created an inescapable snare around my waist. \"Bella, I've already expended a great deal of personal effort at this point to keep you alive. I'm not about to let you behind the wheel of a vehicle when you can't even walk straight. Besides, friends don't let friends drive drunk,\" he quoted with a chuckle. I could smell the unbearably sweet fragrance coming off his chest. \"Drunk?\" I objected. \"You're intoxicated by my very presence.\" He was grinning that playful smirk again. \"I can't argue with that,\" I sighed.; I couldn't resist him in anything. I held the key high and dropped it, watching his hand flash like lightning to catch it soundlessly. \"Take it easy \u2014 my truck is a senior citizen.\" \"Very sensible,\" he approved. \"And are you not affected at all?\" I asked, irked. \"By my presence?\" Again his mobile features transformed, his expression became soft, warm. He didn't answer at first; he simply bent his face to mine, and brushed his lips slowly along my jaw, from my ear to my chin, back and forth. I trembled. \"Regardless,\" he finally murmured, \"I have better reflexes.\"",
