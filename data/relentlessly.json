Sportswriter Wright Thompson, said of Jordan, \"There's no way to measure these things, but there's a strong case to be made that Jordan is the most intense competitor on the planet.\" Whether it was basketball, golf or the video game, Bejeweled, Jordan had a beyond normal appetite for competition and winning.   As with most things, extremism can be dangerous and should be approached with caution. Still, it must be said that a competitive streak, channeled properly, is necessary to achieve at the highest levels.  To put Jordan's competitiveness into perspective, once after losing at golf to Olympic Dream Team coach Chuck Daly, Jordan persisted <em>relentlessly</em> for a rematch. As reported by Rick Reilly of Sports Illustrated, \"The next morning, at the crack of dawn, Jordan rang Daly's room. Getting no response, he went directly to Daly's room and knocked. Then he pounded. He wouldn't go away until he got his rematch. He got it, and he won by a stroke. \"  There is no, \"I lost to a better player\" in him. His need to have a rematch immediately signifies that he can never be permanently defeated; he will always get up off the mat from a knockdown. Everyone can learn from that aspect of competitiveness.",

            "en": "19         19. GOODBYES Charlie was waiting up for me. All the house lights were on. My mind was blank as I tried to think of a way to make him let me go. This wasn't going to be pleasant. Edward pulled up slowly, staying well back from my truck. All three of them were acutely alert, ramrod straight in their seats, listening to every sound of the wood, looking through every shadow, catching every scent, searching for something out of place. The engine cut off, and I sat, motionless, as they continued to listen. \"He's not here,\" Edward said tensely. \"Let's go.\" Emmett reached over to help me get out of the harness. \"Don't worry, Bella,\" he said in a low but cheerful voice, \"we'll take care of things here quickly.\" I felt moisture filling up my eyes as I looked at Emmett. I barely knew him, and yet, \u00a0somehow, not knowing when I would see him again after tonight was anguishing. I knew this was just a faint taste of the goodbyes I would have to survive in the next hour, and the thought made the tears begin to spill. \"Alice, Emmett.\" Edward's voice was a command. They slithered soundlessly into the darkness, instantly disappearing. Edward opened my door and took my hand, then drew me into the protecting enclosure of his arm. He walked me swiftly toward the house, eyes always roving through the night. \"Fifteen minutes,\" he warned under his breath. \"I can do this.\" I sniffled. My tears had given me an inspiration. I stopped on the porch and took hold of his face in my hands. I looked fiercely into his eyes. \"I love you,\" I said in a low, intense voice. \"I will always love you, no matter what happens now.\" \"Nothing is going to happen to you, Bella,\" he said just as fiercely. \"Just follow the plan, okay? Keep Charlie safe for me. He's not going to like me very much after this, and I want to have the chance to apologize later.\" \"Get inside, Bella. We have to hurry.\" His voice was urgent. \"One more thing,\" I whispered passionately. \"Don't listen to another word I say tonight!\" He was leaning in, and so all I had to do was stretch up on my toes to kiss his surprised, frozen lips with as much force as I was capable of. Then I turned and kicked the door open. \"Go away, Edward!\" I yelled at him, running inside and slamming the door shut in his still-shocked face. \"Bella?\" Charlie had been hovering in the living room, and he was already on his feet. \"Leave me alone!\" I screamed at him through my tears, which were flowing <em>relentlessly</em> now. I ran up the stairs to my room, throwing the door shut and locking it. I ran to my bed, flinging myself on the floor to retrieve my duffel bag. I reached swiftly between the mattress and box spring to grab the knotted old sock that contained my secret cash hoard. Charlie was pounding on my door. \"Bella, are you okay? What's going on?\" His voice was frightened. \"I'm going borne,\" I shouted, my voice breaking in the perfect spot. \"Did he hurt you?\" His tone edged toward anger. \"No!\" I shrieked a few octaves higher. I turned to my dresser, and Edward was already there, silently yanking out armfuls of random clothes, which he proceeded to throw to me. \"Did he break up with you?\" Charlie was perplexed. \"No!\" I yelled, slightly more breathless as I shoved everything into the bag. Edward threw another drawer's contents at me. The bag was pretty much full now. \"What happened, Bella?\" Charlie shouted through the door, pounding again. \"I broke up with him!\" I shouted back, jerking on the zipper of my bag. Edward's capable hands pushed mine away and zipped it smoothly. He put the strap carefully over my arm. \"I'll be in the truck \u2014 go!\" he whispered, and pushed me toward the door.  He vanished out the window. I unlocked the door and pushed past Charlie roughly, struggling with my heavy bag as I ran down the stairs. \"What happened?\" he yelled. He was right behind me. \"I thought you liked him.\" He caught my elbow in the kitchen. Though he was still bewildered, his grip was firm. He spun me around to look at him, and I could see in his face that he had no intention of letting me leave. I could think of only one way to escape, and it involved hurting him so much that I hated myself for even considering it. But I had no time, and I had to keep him safe. I glared up at my father, fresh tears in my eyes for what I was about to do. \"I do like him \u2014 that's the problem. I can't do this anymore! I can't put down any more roots here! I don't want to end up trapped in this stupid, boring town like Mom! I'm not going to make the same dumb mistake she did. I hate it \u2014 I can't stay here another minute!\" His hand dropped from my arm like I'd electrocuted him. I turned away from his shocked, wounded face and headed for the door. \"Bells, you can't leave now. It's nighttime,\" he whispered behind me. I didn't turn around. \"I'll sleep in the truck if I get tired.\" \"Just wait another week,\" he pled, still shell-shocked. \"Ren\u00e9e will be back by then.\" This completely derailed me. \"What?\" Charlie continued eagerly, almost babbling with relief as I hesitated. \"She called while you were out. Things aren't going so well in Florida, and if Phil doesn't get signed by the end of the week, they're going back to Arizona. The assistant coach of the Sidewinders said they might have a spot for another shortstop.\" I shook my head, trying to reassemble my now-confused thoughts. Every passing second put Charlie in more danger. \"I have a key,\" I muttered, turning the knob. He was too close, one hand extended toward me, his face dazed. I couldn't lose any more time arguing with him. I was going to have to hurt him further. \"Just let me go, Charlie.\" I repeated my mother's last words as she'd walked out this same door so many years ago. I said them as angrily as I could manage, and I threw the door open. \"It didn't work out, okay? I really, really hate Forks!\" My cruel words did their job \u2014 Charlie stayed frozen on the doorstep, stunned, while I ran into the night. I was hideously frightened of the empty yard. I ran wildly for the truck, visualizing a dark shadow behind me. I threw my bag in the bed and wrenched the door open. The key was waiting in the ignition. \"I'll call you tomorrow!\" I yelled, wishing more than anything that I could explain everything to him right then, knowing I would never be able to. I gunned the engine and peeled out. Edward reached for my hand. \"Pull over,\" he said as the house, and Charlie, disappeared behind us. \"I can drive,\" I said through the tears pouring down my cheeks. His long hands unexpectedly gripped my waist, and his foot pushed mine off the gas pedal. He pulled me across his lap, wrenching my hands free of the wheel, and suddenly he was in the driver's seat. The truck didn't swerve an inch. \"You wouldn't be able to find the house,\" he explained. Lights flared suddenly behind us. I stared out the back window, eyes wide with horror. \"It's just Alice,\" he reassured me. He took my hand again. My mind was filled with the image of Charlie in the doorway. \"The tracker?\" \"He heard the end of your performance,\" Edward said grimly. \"Charlie?\" I asked in dread. \"The tracker followed us. He's running behind us now.\" My body went cold. \"Can we outrun him?\" \"No.\" But he sped up as he spoke. The truck's engine whined in protest. My plan suddenly didn't feel so brilliant anymore. I was staring back at Alice's headlights when the truck shuddered and a dark shadow sprung up outside the window. My bloodcurdling scream lasted a fraction of a second before Edward's hand clamped down on my mouth. \"It's Emmett!\" He released my mouth, and wound his arm around my waist. \"It's okay, Bella,\" he promised. \"You're going to be safe.\" We raced through the quiet town toward the north highway. \"I didn't realize you were still so bored with small-town life,\" he said conversationally, and I knew he was trying to distract me. \"It seemed like you were adjusting fairly well \u2014 especially recently. Maybe I was just flattering myself that I was making life more interesting for you.\" \"I wasn't being nice,\" I confessed, ignoring his attempt at diversion, looking down at my knees. \"That was the same thing my mom said when she left him. You could say I was hitting below the belt.\" \"Don't worry. He'll forgive you.\" He smiled a little, though it didn't touch his eyes. I stared at him desperately, and he saw the naked panic in my eyes. \"Bella, it's going to be all right.\" \"But it won't be all right when I'm not with you,\" I whispered. \"We'll be together again in a few days,\" he said, tightening his arm around me. \"Don't forget that this was your idea.\" \"It was the best idea \u2014 of course it was mine.\" His answering smile was bleak and disappeared immediately. \"Why did this happen?\" I asked, my voice catching. \"Why me?\" He stared blackly at the road ahead. \"It's my fault \u2014 I was a fool to expose you like that.\" The rage in his voice was directed internally. \"That's not what I meant,\" I insisted. \"I was there, big deal. It didn't bother the other two. Why did this James decide to kill me? There're people all over the place, why me?\" He hesitated, thinking before he answered. \"I got a good look at his mind tonight,\" he began in a low voice. \"I'm not sure if there's anything I could have done to avoid this, once he saw you. It is partially your fault.\" His voice was wry. \"If you didn't smell so appallingly luscious, he might not have bothered. But when I defended you\u2026 well, that made it a lot worse. He's not used to being thwarted, no matter how insignificant the object. He thinks of himself as a hunter and nothing else. His existence is consumed with tracking, and a challenge is all he asks of life. Suddenly we've presented him with a beautiful challenge \u2014 a large clan of strong fighters all bent on protecting the one vulnerable element. You wouldn't believe how euphoric he is now. It's his favorite game, and we've just made it his most exciting game ever.\" His tone was full of disgust. He paused a moment. \"But if I had stood by, he would have killed you right then,\" he said with hopeless frustration. \"I thought\u2026 I didn't smell the same to the others\u2026 as I do to you,\" I said hesitantly. \"You don't. But that doesn't mean that you aren't still a temptation to every one of them. If you had appealed to the tracker \u2014 or any of them \u2014 the same way you appeal to me, it would have meant a fight right there.\" I shuddered. \"I don't think I have any choice but to kill him now,\" he muttered. \"Carlisle won't like it.\" I could hear the tires cross the bridge, though I couldn't see the river in the dark. I knew we were getting close. I had to ask him now.  \"How can you kill a vampire?\" He glanced at me with unreadable eyes and his voice was suddenly harsh. \"The only way to be sure is to tear him to shreds, and then burn the pieces.\" \"And the other two will fight with him?\" \"The woman will. I'm not sure about Laurent. They don't have a very strong bond \u2014 he's only with them for convenience. He was embarrassed by James in the meadow\u2026\" \"But James and the woman \u2014 they'll try to kill you?\" I asked, my voice raw. \"Bella, don't you dare waste time worrying about me. Your only concern is keeping yourself safe and \u2014 please, please \u2014 trying not to be reckless.\" \"Is he still following?\" \"Yes. He won't attack the house, though. Not tonight.\" He turned off onto the invisible drive, with Alice following behind. We drove right up to the house. The lights inside were bright, but they did little to alleviate the blackness of the encroaching forest. Emmett had my door open before the truck was stopped; he pulled me out of the seat, tucked me like a football into his vast chest, and ran me through the door. We burst into the large white room, Edward and Alice at our sides. All of them were there; they were already on their feet at the sound of our approach. Laurent stood in their midst. I could hear low growls rumble deep in Emmett's throat as he set me down next to Edward. \"He's tracking us,\" Edward announced, glaring balefully at Laurent. Laurent's face was unhappy. \"I was afraid of that.\" Alice danced to Jasper's side and whispered in his ear; her lips quivered with the speed of her silent speech. They flew up the stairs together. Rosalie watched them, and then moved quickly to Emmett's side. Her beautiful eyes were intense and \u2014 when they flickered unwillingly to my face \u2014 furious. \"What will he do?\" Carlisle asked Laurent in chilling tones. \"I'm sorry,\" he answered. \"I was afraid, when your boy there defended her, that it would set him off.\" \"Can you stop him?\" Laurent shook his head. \"Nothing stops James when he gets started.\" \"We'll stop him,\" Emmett promised. There was no doubt what he meant. \"You can't bring him down. I've never seen anything like him in my three hundred years. He's absolutely lethal. That's why I joined his coven.\" His coven, I thought, of course. The show of leadership in the clearing was merely that, a show. Laurent was shaking his head. He glanced at me, perplexed, and back to Carlisle. \"Are you sure it's worth it?\" Edward's enraged roar filled the room; Laurent cringed back. Carlisle looked gravely at Laurent. \"I'm afraid you're going to have to make a choice.\" Laurent understood. He deliberated for a moment. His eyes took in every face, and finally swept the bright room. \"I'm intrigued by the life you've created here. But I won't get in the middle of this. I bear none of you any enmity, but I won't go up against James. I think I will head north \u2014 to that clan in Denali.\" He hesitated. \"Don't underestimate James. He's got a brilliant mind and unparalleled senses. He's every bit as comfortable in the human world as you seem to be, and he won't come at you head on\u2026 I'm sorry for what's been unleashed here. Truly sorry.\" He bowed his head, but I saw him flicker another puzzled look at me. \"Go in peace,\" was Carlisle's formal answer. Laurent took another long look around himself, and then he hurried out the door. The silence lasted less than a second. \"How close?\" Carlisle looked to Edward. Esme was already moving; her hand touched an inconspicuous keypad on the wall, and with a groan, huge metal shutters began sealing up the glass wall. I gaped. \"About three miles out past the river; he's circling around to meet up with the female.\" \"What's the plan?\" \"We'll lead him off, and then Jasper and Alice will run her south.\" \"And then?\" Edward's tone was deadly. \"As soon as Bella is clear, we hunt him.\" \"I guess there's no other choice,\" Carlisle agreed, his face grim. Edward turned to Rosalie. \"Get her upstairs and trade clothes,\" Edward commanded. She stared back at him with livid disbelief. \"Why should I?\" she hissed. \"What is she to me? Except a menace \u2014 a danger you've chosen to inflict on all of us.\" I flinched back from the venom in her voice. \"Rose\u2026\" Emmett murmured, putting one hand on her shoulder. She shook it off. But I was watching Edward carefully, knowing his temper, worried about his reaction. He surprised me. He looked away from Rosalie as if she hadn't spoken, as if she didn't exist. \"Esme?\" he asked calmly. \"Of course,\" Esme murmured. Esme was at my side in half a heartbeat, swinging me up easily into her arms, and dashing up the stairs before I could gasp in shock. \"What are we doing?\" I asked breathlessly as she set me down in a dark room somewhere off the second-story hall. \"Trying to confuse the smell. It won't work for long, but it might help get you out.\" I could hear her clothes falling to the floor. \"I don't think I'll fit\u2026\" I hesitated, but her hands were abruptly pulling my shirt over my head. I quickly stripped my jeans off myself. She handed me something, it felt like a shirt. I struggled to get my arms through the right holes. As soon as I was done she handed me her slacks. I yanked them on, but I couldn't get my feet out; they were too long. She deftly rolled the hems a few times so I could stand. Somehow she was already in my clothes. She pulled me back to the stairs, where Alice stood, a small leather bag in one hand. They each grabbed one of my elbows and half-carried me as they flew down the stairs. It appeared that everything had been settled downstairs in our absence. Edward and Emmett were ready to leave, Emmett carrying a heavy-looking backpack over his shoulder. Carlisle was handing something small to Esme. He turned and handed Alice the same thing \u2014 it was a tiny silver cell phone. \"Esme and Rosalie will be taking your truck, Bella,\" he told me as he passed. I nodded, glancing warily at Rosalie. She was glowering at Carlisle with a resentful expression. \"Alice, Jasper \u2014 take the Mercedes. You'll need the dark tint in the south.\" They nodded as well. \"We're taking the Jeep.\" I was surprised to see that Carlisle intended to go with Edward. I realized suddenly, with a stab of fear, that they made up the hunting party. \"Alice,\" Carlisle asked, \"will they take the bait?\" Everyone watched Alice as she closed her eyes and became incredibly still. Finally her eyes opened. \"He'll track you. The woman will follow the truck. We should be able to leave after that.\" Her voice was certain. \"Let's go.\" Carlisle began to walk toward the kitchen. But Edward was at my side at once. He caught me up in his iron grip, crushing me to him. He seemed unaware of his watching family as he pulled my face to his, lifting my feet off the floor. For the shortest second, his lips were icy and hard against mine. Then it was over. He set me down, still holding my face, his glorious eyes burning into mine. His eyes went blank, curiously dead, as he turned away. And they were gone. We stood there, the others looking away from me as the tears streaked noiselessly down my face.  The silent moment dragged on, and then Esme's phone vibrated in her hand. It flashed to her ear. \"Now,\" she said. Rosalie stalked out the front door without another glance in my direction, but Esme touched my cheek as she passed.  \"Be safe.\" Her whisper lingered behind them as they slipped out the door. I heard my truck start thunderously, and then fade away. Jasper and Alice waited. Alice's phone seemed to be at her ear before it buzzed. \"Edward says the woman is on Esme's trail. I'll get the car.\" She vanished into the shadows the way Edward had gone. Jasper and I looked at each other. He stood across the length of the entryway from me\u2026 being careful. \"You're wrong, you know,\" he said quietly. \"What?\" I gasped. \"I can feel what you're feeling now \u2014 and you are worth it.\" \"I'm not,\" I mumbled. \"If anything happens to them, it will be for nothing.\" \"You're wrong,\" he repeated, smiling kindly at me. I heard nothing, but then Alice stepped through the front door and came toward me with her arms held out. \"May I?\" she asked. \"You're the first one to ask permission.\" I smiled wryly. She lifted me in her slender arms as easily as Emmett had, shielding me protectively, and then we flew out the door, leaving the lights bright behind us.",

            "en": "11        11. COMPLICATIONS Everyone watched us as we walked together to our lab table. I noticed that he no longer angled the chair to sit as far from me as the desk would allow. Instead, he sat quite close beside me, our arms almost touching. Mr. Banner backed into the room then \u2014 what superb timing the man had \u2014 pulling a tall metal frame on wheels that held a heavy-looking, outdated TV and VCR. A movie day \u2014 the lift in the class atmosphere was almost tangible. Mr. Banner shoved the tape into the reluctant VCR and walked to the wall to turn off the lights. And then, as the room went black, I was suddenly hyperaware that Edward was sitting less than an inch from me. I was stunned by the unexpected electricity that flowed through me, amazed that it was possible to be more aware of him than I already was. A crazy impulse to reach over and touch him, to stroke his perfect face just once in the darkness, nearly overwhelmed me. I crossed my arms tightly across my chest, my hands balling into fists. I was losing my mind. The opening credits began, lighting the room by a token amount. My eyes, of their own accord, flickered to him. I smiled sheepishly as I realized his posture was identical to mine, fists clenched under his arms, right down to the eyes, peering sideways at me. He grinned back, his eyes somehow managing to smolder, even in the dark. I looked away before I could start hyperventilating. It was absolutely ridiculous that I should feel dizzy. The hour seemed very long. I couldn't concentrate on the movie \u2014 I didn't even know what subject it was on. I tried unsuccessfully to relax, but the electric current that seemed to be originating from somewhere in his body never slackened. Occasionally I would permit myself a quick glance in his direction, but he never seemed to relax, either. The overpowering craving to touch him also refused to fade, and I crushed my fists safely against my ribs until my fingers were aching with the effort. I breathed a sigh of relief when Mr. Banner flicked the lights back on at the end of class, and stretched my arms out in front of me, flexing my stiff fingers. Edward \u00a0chuckled beside me. \"Well, that was interesting,\" he murmured. His voice was dark and his eyes were cautious. \"Umm,\" was all I was able to respond. \"Shall we?\" he asked, rising fluidly. I almost groaned. Time for Gym. I stood with care, worried my balance might have been affected by the strange new intensity between us. He walked me to my next class in silence and paused at the door; I turned to say goodbye. His face startled me \u2014 his expression was torn, almost pained, and so fiercely beautiful that the ache to touch him flared as strong as before. My goodbye stuck in my throat. He raised his hand, hesitant, conflict raging in his eyes, and then swiftly brushed the length of my cheekbone with his fingertips. His skin was as icy as ever, but the trail his fingers left on my skin was alarmingly warm \u2014 like I'd been burned, but didn't feel the pain of it yet. He turned without a word and strode quickly away from me. I walked into the gym, lightheaded and wobbly. I drifted to the locker room, changing in a trance like state, only vaguely aware that there were other people surrounding me. Reality didn't fully set in until I was handed a racket. It wasn't heavy, yet it felt very unsafe in my hand. I could see a few of the other kids in class eyeing me furtively. Coach Clapp ordered us to pair up into teams. Mercifully, some vestiges of Mike's chivalry still survived; he came to stand beside me. \"Do you want to be a team?\" \"Thanks, Mike \u2014 you don't have to do this, you know.\" I grimaced apologetically. \"Don't worry, I'll keep out of your way.\" He grinned. Sometimes it was so easy to like Mike. It didn't go smoothly. I somehow managed to hit myself in the head with my racket and clip Mike's shoulder on the same swing. I spent the rest of the hour in the back corner of the court, the racket held safely behind my back. Despite being handicapped by me, Mike was pretty good; he won three games out of four single handedly. He gave me an unearned high five when the coach finally blew the whistle ending class. \"So,\" he said as we walked off the court. \"So what?\" \"You and Cullen, huh?\" he asked, his tone rebellious. My previous feeling of affection disappeared. \"That's none of your business, Mike,\" I warned, internally cursing Jessica straight to the fiery pits of Hades. \"I don't like it,\" he muttered anyway. \"You don't have to,\" I snapped. \"He looks at you like\u2026 like you're something to eat,\" he continued, ignoring me. I choked back the hysteria that threatened to explode, but a small giggle managed to get out despite my efforts. He glowered at me. I waved and fled to the locker room. I dressed quickly, something stronger than butterflies battering recklessly against the walls of my stomach, my argument with Mike already a distant memory. I was wondering if Edward would be waiting, or if I should meet him at his car. What if his family was there? I felt a wave of real terror. Did they know that I knew? Was I supposed to know that they knew that I knew, or not? By the time I walked out of the gym, I had just about decided to walk straight home without even looking toward the parking lot. But my worries were unnecessary. Edward was waiting, leaning casually against the side of the gym, his breathtaking face untroubled now. As I walked to his side, I felt a peculiar sense of release. \"Hi,\" I breathed, smiling hugely. \"Hello.\" His answering smile was brilliant. \"How was Gym?\" My face fell a tiny bit. \"Fine,\" I lied. \"Really?\" He was unconvinced. His eyes shifted their focus slightly, looking over my shoulder and narrowing. I glanced behind me to see Mike's back as he walked away. \"What?\" I demanded. His eyes slid back to mine, still tight. \"Newton's getting on my nerves.\" \"You weren't listening again?\" I was horror-struck. All traces of my sudden good humor vanished. \"How's your head?\" he asked innocently. \"You're unbelievable!\" I turned, stomping away in the general direction of the parking lot, though I hadn't ruled out walking at this point. He kept up with me easily. \"You were the one who mentioned how I'd never seen you in Gym \u2014 it made me curious.\" He didn't sound repentant, so I ignored him. We walked in silence \u2014 a furious, embarrassed silence on my part \u2014 to his car. But I had to stop a few steps away \u2014 a crowd of people, all boys, were surrounding it. Then I realized they weren't surrounding the Volvo, they were actually circled around Rosalie's red convertible, unmistakable lust in their eyes. None of them even looked up as Edward slid between them to open his door. I climbed quickly in the passenger side, also unnoticed. \"Ostentatious,\" he muttered. \"What kind of car is that?\" I asked. \"An M3.\" \"I don't speak Car and Driver.\" \"It's a BMW.\" He rolled his eyes, not looking at me, trying to back out without running over the car enthusiasts. I nodded \u2014 I'd heard of that one. \"Are you still angry?\" he asked as he carefully maneuvered his way out. \"Definitely.\" He sighed. \"Will you forgive me if I apologize?\" \"Maybe\u2026 if you mean it. And if you promise not to do it again,\" I insisted. His eyes were suddenly shrewd. \"How about if I mean it, and I agree to let you drive Saturday?\" he countered my conditions. I considered, and decided it was probably the best offer I would get. \"Deal,\" I agreed. \"Then I'm very sorry I upset you.\" His eyes burned with sincerity for a protracted moment \u2014 playing havoc with the rhythm of my heart \u2014 and then turned playful. \"And I'll be on your doorstep bright and early Saturday morning.\" \"Um, it doesn't help with the Charlie situation if an unexplained Volvo is left in the driveway.\" His smile was condescending now. \"I wasn't intending to bring a car.\" \"How \u2014\" He cut me off. \"Don't worry about it. I'll be there, no car.\" I let it go. I had a more pressing question. \"Is it later yet?\" I asked significantly. He frowned. \"I supposed it is later.\" I kept my expression polite as I waited. He stopped the car. I looked up, surprised \u2014 of course we were already at Charlie's house, parked behind the truck. It was easier to ride with him if I only looked when it was over. When I looked back at him, he was staring at me, measuring with his eyes.  \"And you still want to know why you can't see me hunt?\" He seemed solemn, but I thought I saw a trace of humor deep in his eyes. \"Well,\" I clarified, \"I was mostly wondering about your reaction.\" \"Did I frighten you?\" Yes, there was definitely humor there. \"No,\" I lied. He didn't buy it. \"I apologize for scaring you,\" he persisted with a slight smile, but then all evidence of teasing disappeared. \"It was just the very thought of you being there\u2026 while we hunted.\" His jaw tightened. \"That would be bad?\" He spoke from between clenched teeth. \"Extremely.\" \"Because\u2026 ?\" He took a deep breath and stared through the windshield at the thick, rolling clouds that seemed to press down, almost within reach. \"When we hunt,\" he spoke slowly, unwillingly, \"we give ourselves over to our senses\u2026 govern less with our minds. Especially our sense of smell. If you were anywhere near me when I lost control that way\u2026\" He shook his head, still gazing morosely at the heavy clouds. I kept my expression firmly under control, expecting the swift flash of his eyes to judge my reaction that soon followed. My face gave nothing away. But our eyes held, and the silence deepened \u2014 and changed. Flickers of the electricity I'd felt this afternoon began to charge the atmosphere as he gazed unrelentingly into my eyes. It wasn't until my head started to swim that I realized I wasn't breathing. When I drew in a jagged breath, breaking the stillness, he closed his eyes. \"Bella, I think you should go inside now.\" His low voice was rough, his eyes on the clouds again. I opened the door, and the arctic draft that burst into the car helped clear my head. Afraid I might stumble in my woozy state, I stepped carefully out of the car and shut the door behind me without looking back. The whir of the automatic window unrolling made me turn. \"Oh, Bella?\" he called after me, his voice more even. He leaned toward the open window with a faint smile on his lips. \"Yes?\" \"Tomorrow it's my turn.\" \"Your turn to what?\" He smiled wider, flashing his gleaming teeth. \"Ask the questions.\" And then he was gone, the car speeding down the street and disappearing around the corner before I could even collect my thoughts. I smiled as I walked to the house. It was clear he was planning to see me tomorrow, if nothing else. That night Edward starred in my dreams, as usual. However, the climate of my unconsciousness had changed. It thrilled with the same electricity that had charged the afternoon, and I tossed and turned restlessly, waking often. It was only in the early hours of the morning that I finally sank into an exhausted, dreamless sleep. When I woke I was still tired, but edgy as well. I pulled on my brown turtleneck and the inescapable jeans, sighing as I daydreamed of spaghetti straps and shorts. Breakfast was the usual, quiet event I expected. Charlie fried eggs for himself; I had my bowl of cereal. I wondered if he had forgotten about this Saturday. He answered my unspoken question as he stood up to take his plate to the sink. \"About this Saturday\u2026\" he began, walking across the kitchen and turning on the faucet. I cringed. \"Yes, Dad?\" \"Are you still set on going to Seattle?\" he asked. \"That was the plan.\" I grimaced, wishing he hadn't brought it up so I wouldn't have to compose careful half-truths. He squeezed some dish soap onto his plate and swirled it around with the brush. \"And you're sure you can't make it back in time for the dance?\" \"I'm not going to the dance, Dad.\" I glared. \"Didn't anyone ask you?\" he asked, trying to hide his concern by focusing on rinsing the plate. I sidestepped the minefield. \"It's a girl's choice.\" \"Oh.\" He frowned as he dried his plate. I sympathized with him. It must be a hard thing, to be a father; living in fear that your daughter would meet a boy she liked, but also having to worry if she didn't. How ghastly it would be, I thought, shuddering, if Charlie had even the slightest inkling of exactly what I did like. Charlie left then, with a goodbye wave, and I went upstairs to brush my teeth and gather my books. When I heard the cruiser pull away, I could only wait a few seconds before I had to peek out of my window. The silver car was already there, waiting in Charlie's spot on the driveway. I bounded down the stairs and out the front door, wondering how long this bizarre routine would continue. I never wanted it to end.  He waited in the car, not appearing to watch as I shut the door behind me without bothering to lock the dead-bolt. I walked to the car, pausing shyly before opening the door and stepping in. He was smiling, relaxed \u2014 and, as usual, perfect and beautiful to an excruciating degree. \"Good morning.\" His voice was silky. \"How are you today?\" His eyes roamed over my face, as if his question was something more than simple courtesy. \"Good, thank you.\" I was always good \u2014 much more than good \u2014 when I was near him. His gaze lingered on the circles under my eyes. \"You look tired.\" \"I couldn't sleep,\" I confessed, automatically swinging my hair around my shoulder to provide some measure of cover. \"Neither could I,\" he teased as he started the engine. I was becoming used to the quiet purr. I was sure the roar of my truck would scare me, whenever I got to drive it again. I laughed. \"I guess that's right. I suppose I slept just a little bit more than you did.\" \"I'd wager you did.\" \"So what did you do last night?\" I asked. He chuckled. \"Not a chance. It's my day to ask questions.\" \"Oh, that's right. What do you want to know?\" My forehead creased. I couldn't imagine anything about me that could be in any way interesting to him. \"What's your favorite color?\" he asked, his face grave. I rolled my eyes. \"It changes from day to day.\" \"What's your favorite color today?\" He was still solemn. \"Probably brown.\" I tended to dress according to my mood. He snorted, dropping his serious expression. \"Brown?\" he asked skeptically. \"Sure. Brown is warm. I miss brown. Everything that's supposed to be brown \u2014 tree trunks, rocks, dirt \u2014 is all covered up with squashy green stuff here,\" I complained. He seemed fascinated by my little rant. He considered for a moment, staring into my eyes. \"You're right,\" he decided, serious again. \"Brown is warm.\" He reached over, swiftly, but somehow still hesitantly, to sweep my hair back behind my shoulder. We were at the school by now. He turned back to me as he pulled into a parking space. \"What music is in your CD player right now?\" he asked, his face as somber as if he'd asked for a murder confession. I realized I'd never removed the CD Phil had given me. When I said the name of the band, he smiled crookedly, a peculiar expression in his eyes. He flipped open a compartment under his car's CD player, pulled out one of thirty or so CDs that were jammed into the small space, and handed it to me, \"Debussy to this?\" He raised an eyebrow. It was the same CD. I examined the familiar cover art, keeping my eyes down. It continued like that for the rest of the day. While he walked me to English, when he met me after Spanish, all through the lunch hour, he questioned me <em>relentlessly</em> about every insignificant detail of my existence. Movies I'd liked and hated, the few places I'd been and the many places I wanted to go, and books \u2014 endlessly books. I couldn't remember the last time I'd talked so much. More often than not, I felt self-conscious, certain I must be boring him. But the absolute absorption of his face, and his never-ending stream of questions, compelled me to continue. Mostly his questions were easy, only a very few triggering my easy blushes. But when I did flush, it brought on a whole new round of questions. Such as the time he asked my favorite gemstone, and I blurted out topaz before thinking. He'd been flinging questions at me with such speed that I felt like I was taking one of those psychiatric tests where you answer with the first word that comes to mind. I was sure he would have continued down whatever mental list he was following, except for the blush. My face reddened because, until very recently, my favorite gemstone was garnet. It was impossible, while staring back into his topaz eyes, not to remember the reason for the switch. And, naturally, he wouldn't rest until I'd admitted why I was embarrassed. \"Tell me,\" he finally commanded after persuasion failed \u2014 failed only because I kept my eyes safely away from his face. \"It's the color of your eyes today,\" I sighed, surrendering, staring down at my hands as I fiddled with a piece of my hair. \"I suppose if you asked me in two weeks I'd say onyx.\" I'd given more information than necessary in my unwilling honesty, and I worried it would provoke the strange anger that flared whenever I slipped and revealed too clearly how obsessed I was. But his pause was very short. \"What kinds of flowers do you prefer?\" he fired off. I sighed in relief, and continued with the psychoanalysis. Biology was a complication again. Edward had continued with his quizzing up until Mr. Banner entered the room, dragging the audiovisual frame again. As the teacher approached the light switch, I noticed Edward slide his chair slightly farther away from mine. It didn't help. As soon as the room was dark, there was the same electric spark, the same restless craving to stretch my hand across the short space and touch his cold skin, as yesterday. I leaned forward on the table, resting my chin on my folded arms, my hidden fingers gripping the table's edge as I fought to ignore the irrational longing that unsettled me. I didn't look at him, afraid that if he was looking at me, it would only make self-control that much harder. I sincerely tried to watch the movie, but at the end of the hour I had no idea what I'd just seen. I sighed in relief again when Mr. Banner turned the lights on, finally glancing at Edward; he was looking at me, his eyes ambivalent. He rose in silence and then stood still, waiting for me. We walked toward the gym in silence, like yesterday. And, also like yesterday, he touched my face wordlessly \u2014 this time with the back of his cool hand, stroking once from my temple to my jaw \u2014 before he turned and walked away. Gym passed quickly as I watched Mike's one-man badminton show. He didn't speak to me today, either in response to my vacant expression or because he was still angry about our squabble yesterday. Somewhere, in a corner of my mind, I felt bad about that. But I couldn't concentrate on him. I hurried to change afterward, ill at ease, knowing the faster I moved, the sooner I would be with Edward. The pressure made me more clumsy than usual, but eventually I made it out the door, feeling the same release when I saw him standing there, a wide smile automatically spreading across my face. He smiled in reaction before launching into more cross-examination. His questions were different now, though, not as easily answered. He wanted to know what I missed about home, insisting on descriptions of anything he wasn't familiar with. We sat in front of Charlie's house for hours, as the sky darkened and rain plummeted around us in a sudden deluge. I tried to describe impossible things like the scent of creosote \u2014 bitter, slightly resinous, but still pleasant \u2014 the high, keening sound of the cicadas in July, the feathery barrenness of the trees, the very size of the sky, extending white-blue from horizon to horizon, barely interrupted by the low mountains covered with purple volcanic rock. The hardest thing to explain was why it was so beautiful to me \u2014 to justify a beauty that didn't depend on the sparse, spiny vegetation that often looked half dead, a beauty that had more to do with the exposed shape of the land, with the shallow bowls of valleys between the craggy hills, and the way they held on to the sun. I found myself using my hands as I tried to describe it to him. His quiet, probing questions kept me talking freely, forgetting, in the dim light of the storm, to be embarrassed for monopolizing the conversation. Finally, when I had finished detailing my cluttered room at home, he paused instead of responding with another question.  \"Are you finished?\" I asked in relief. \"Not even close \u2014 but your father will be home soon.\" \"Charlie!\" I suddenly recalled his existence, and sighed. I looked out at the rain-darkened sky, but it gave nothing away. \"How late is it?\" I wondered out loud as I glanced at the clock. I was surprised by the time \u2014 Charlie would be driving home now. \"It's twilight,\" Edward murmured, looking at the western horizon, obscured as it was with clouds. His voice was thoughtful, as if his mind were somewhere far away. I stared at him as he gazed unseeingly out the windshield. I was still staring when his eyes suddenly shifted back to mine. \"It's the safest time of day for us,\" he said, answering the unspoken question in my eyes. \"The easiest time. But also the saddest, in a way\u2026 the end of another day, the return of the night. Darkness is so predictable, don't you think?\" He smiled wistfully. \"I like the night. Without the dark, we'd never see the stars.\" I frowned. \"Not that you see them here much.\" He laughed, and the mood abruptly lightened. \"Charlie will be here in a few minutes. So, unless you want to tell him that you'll be with me Saturday\u2026\" He raised one eyebrow. \"Thanks, but no thanks.\" I gathered my books, realizing I was stiff from sitting still so long. \"So is it my turn tomorrow, then?\" \"Certainly not!\" His face was teasingly outraged. \"I told you I wasn't done, didn't I?\" \"What more is there?\" \"You'll find out tomorrow.\" He reached across to open my door for me, and his sudden proximity sent my heart into frenzied palpitations. But his hand froze on the handle. \"Not good,\" he muttered. \"What is it?\" I was surprised to see that his jaw was clenched, his eyes disturbed. He glanced at me for a brief second. \"Another complication,\" he said glumly. He flung the door open in one swift movement, and then moved, almost cringed, swiftly away from me. The flash of headlights through the rain caught my attention as a dark car pulled up to the curb just a few feet away, facing us. \"Charlie's around the corner,\" he warned, staring through the downpour at the other vehicle. I hopped out at once, despite my confusion and curiosity. The rain was louder as it glanced off my jacket. I tried to make out the shapes in the front seat of the other car, but it was too dark. I could see Edward illuminated in the glare of the new car's headlights; he was still staring ahead, his gaze locked on something or someone I couldn't see. His expression was a strange mix of frustration and defiance. Then he revved the engine, and the tires squealed against the wet pavement. The Volvo was out of sight in seconds. \"Hey, Bella,\" called a familiar, husky voice from the driver's side of the little black car. \"Jacob?\" I asked, squinting through the rain. Just then, Charlie's cruiser swung around the corner, his lights shining on the occupants of the car in front of me. Jacob was already climbing out, his wide grin visible even through the darkness. In the passenger seat was a much older man, a heavyset man with a memorable face \u2014 a face that overflowed, the cheeks resting against his shoulders, with creases running through the russet skin like an old leather jacket. And the surprisingly familiar eyes, black eyes that seemed at the same time both too young and too ancient for the broad face they were set in. Jacob's father, Billy Black. I knew him immediately, though in the more than five years since I'd seen him last I'd managed to forget his name when Charlie had spoken of him my first day here. He was staring at me, scrutinizing my face, so I smiled tentatively at him. His eyes were wide, as if in shock or fear, his nostrils flared. My smile faded. Another complication, Edward had said. Billy still stared at me with intense, anxious eyes. I groaned internally. Had Billy recognized Edward so easily? Could he really believe the impossible legends his son had scoffed at? The answer was clear in Billy's eyes. Yes. Yes, he could.",
