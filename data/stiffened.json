            "en": "16           16. CARLISLE He led me back to the room that he'd pointed out as Carlisle's office. He paused outside the door for an instant. \"Come in,\" Carlisle's voice invited. Edward opened the door to a high-ceilinged room with tall, west-facing windows. The walls were paneled again, in a darker wood \u2014 where they were visible. Most of the wall space was taken up by towering bookshelves that reached high above my head and held more books than I'd ever seen outside a library. Carlisle sat behind a huge mahogany desk in a leather chair. He was just placing a bookmark in the pages of the thick volume he held. The room was how I'd always imagined a college dean's would look \u2014 only Carlisle looked too young to fit the part. \"What can I do for you?\" he asked us pleasantly, rising from his seat.  \"I wanted to show Bella some of our history,\" Edward said. \"Well, your history, actually.\" \"We didn't mean to disturb you,\" I apologized. \"Not at all. Where are you going to start?\" \"The Waggoner,\" Edward replied, placing one hand lightly on my shoulder and spinning me around to look back toward the door we'd just come through. Every time he touched me, in even the most casual way, my heart had an audible reaction. It was more embarrassing with Carlisle there. The wall we faced now was different from the others. Instead of bookshelves, this wall was crowded with framed pictures of all sizes, some in vibrant colors, others dull monochromes. I searched for some logic, some binding motif the collection had in common, but I found nothing in my hasty examination. Edward pulled me toward the far left side, standing me in front of a small square oil painting in a plain wooden frame. This one did not stand out among the bigger and brighter pieces; painted in varying tones of sepia, it depicted a miniature city full of steeply slanted roofs, with thin spires atop a few scattered towers. A wide river filled the foreground, crossed by a bridge covered with structures that looked like tiny cathedrals. \"London in the sixteen-fifties,\" Edward said. \"The London of my youth,\" Carlisle added, from a few feet behind us. I flinched; I hadn't heard him approach. Edward squeezed my hand.  \"Will you tell the story?\" Edward asked. I twisted a little to see Carlisle's reaction. He met my glance and smiled. \"I would,\" he replied. \"But I'm actually running a bit late. The hospital called this morning \u2014 Dr. Snow is taking a sick day. Besides, you know the stories as well as I do,\" he added, grinning at Edward now. It was a strange combination to absorb \u2014 the everyday concerns of the town doctor stuck in the middle of a discussion of his early days in seventeenth-century London. It was also unsettling to know that he spoke aloud only for my benefit. After another warm smile for me, Carlisle left the room. I stared at the little picture of Carlisle's hometown for a long moment.  \"What happened then?\" I finally asked, staring up at Edward, who was watching me. \"When he realized what had happened to him?\" He glanced back to the paintings, and I looked to see which image caught his interest now. It was a larger landscape in dull fall colors \u2014 an empty, shadowed meadow in a forest, with a craggy peak in the distance. \"When he knew what he had become,\" Edward said quietly, \"he rebelled against it. He tried to destroy himself. But that's not easily done.\" \"How?\" I didn't mean to say it aloud, but the word broke through my shock. \"He jumped from great heights,\" Edward told me, his voice impassive. \"He tried to drown himself in the ocean\u2026 but he was young to the new life, and very strong. It is amazing that he was able to resist\u2026 feeding\u2026 while he was still so new. The instinct is more powerful then, it takes over everything. But he was so repelled by himself that he had the strength to try to kill himself with starvation.\" \"Is that possible?\u201dMy voice was faint. \"No, there are very few ways we can be killed.\" I opened my mouth to ask, but he spoke before I could. \"So he grew very hungry, and eventually weak. He strayed as far as he could from the human populace, recognizing that his willpower was weakening, too.  For months he wandered by night, seeking the loneliest places, loathing himself. \"One night, a herd of deer passed his hiding place. He was so wild with thirst that he attacked without a thought. His strength returned and he realized there was an alternative to being the vile monster he feared. Had he not eaten venison in his former life? Over the next months his new philosophy was born. He could exist without being a demon. He found himself again. \"He began to make better use of his time. He'd always been intelligent, eager to learn. Now he had unlimited time before him. He studied by night, planned by day. He swam to France and \u2014\" \"He swam to France?\" \"People swim the Channel all the time, Bella,\" he reminded me patiently. \"That's true, I guess. It just sounded funny in that context. Go on.\" \"Swimming is easy for us \u2014\" \"Everything is easy for you,\" I griped. He waited, his expression amused. \"I won't interrupt again, I promise.\" He chuckled darkly, and finished his sentence. \"Because, technically, we don't need to breathe.\" \"You \u2014\" \"No, no, you promised.\" He laughed, putting his cold finger lightly to my lips. \"Do you want to hear the story or not?\" \"You can't spring something like that on me, and then expect me not to say anything,\" I mumbled against his finger. He lifted his hand, moving it to rest against my neck. The speed of my heart reacted to that, but I persisted. \"You don't have to breathe?\" I demanded. \"No, it's not necessary. Just a habit.\" He shrugged. \"How long can you go\u2026 without breathing?\" \"Indefinitely, I suppose; I don't know. It gets a bit uncomfortable \u2014 being without a sense of smell.\" \"A bit uncomfortable,\" I echoed. I wasn't paying attention to my own expression, but something in it made him grow somber. His hand dropped to his side and he stood very still, his eyes intent on my face. The silence lengthened. His features were immobile as stone. \"What is it?\" I whispered, touching his frozen face. His face softened under my hand, and he sighed. \"I keep waiting for it to happen.\" \"For what to happen?\" \"I know that at some point, something I tell you or something you see is going to be too much. And then you'll run away from me, screaming as you go.\" He smiled half a smile, but his eyes were serious. \"I won't stop you. I want this to happen, because I want you to be safe. And yet, I want to be with you. The two desires are impossible to reconcile\u2026\" He trailed off, staring at my face. Waiting. \"I'm not running anywhere,\" I promised. \"We'll see,\" he said, smiling again. I frowned at him. \"So, go on \u2014 Carlisle was swimming to France.\" He paused, getting back into his story. Reflexively, his eyes flickered to another picture \u2014 the most colorful of them all, the most ornately framed, and the largest; it was twice as wide as the door it hung next to. The canvas overflowed with bright figures in swirling robes, writhing around long pillars and off marbled balconies. I couldn't tell if it represented Greek mythology, or if the characters floating in the clouds above were meant to be biblical. \"Carlisle swam to France, and continued on through Europe, to the universities there. By night he studied music, science, medicine \u2014 and found his calling, his penance, in that, in saving human lives.\" His expression became awed, almost reverent. \"I can't adequately describe the struggle; it took Carlisle two centuries of torturous effort to perfect his self-control. Now he is all but immune to the scent of human blood, and he is able to do the work he loves without agony. He finds a great deal of peace there, at the hospital\u2026\" Edward stared off into space for a long moment. Suddenly he seemed to recall his purpose. He tapped his finger against the huge painting in front of us. \"He was studying in Italy when he discovered the others there. They were much more civilized and educated than the wraiths of the London sewers.\" He touched a comparatively sedate quartet of figures painted on the highest balcony, looking down calmly on the mayhem below them. I examined the grouping carefully and realized, with a startled laugh, that I recognized the golden-haired man. \"Solimena was greatly inspired by Carlisle's friends. He often painted them as gods,\" Edward chuckled. \"Aro, Marcus, Caius,\" he said, indicating the other three, two black-haired, one snowy-white. \"Nighttime patrons of the arts.\" \"What happened to them?\" I wondered aloud, my fingertip hovering a centimeter from the figures on the canvas. \"They're still there.\" He shrugged. \"As they have been for who knows how many millennia. Carlisle stayed with them only for a short time, just a few decades. He greatly admired their civility, their refinement, but they persisted in trying to cure his aversion to 'his natural food source,' as they called it. They tried to persuade him, and he tried to persuade them, to no avail. At that point, Carlisle decided to try the New World. He dreamed of finding others like himself. He was very lonely, you see. \"He didn't find anyone for a long time. But, as monsters became the stuff of fairy tales, he found he could interact with unsuspecting humans as if he were one of them. He began practicing medicine. But the companionship he craved evaded him; he couldn't risk familiarity. \"When the influenza epidemic hit, he was working nights in a hospital in Chicago. He'd been turning over an idea in his mind for several years, and he had almost decided to act \u2014 since he couldn't find a companion, he would create one. He wasn't absolutely sure how his own transformation had occurred, so he was hesitant. And he was loath to steal anyone's life the way his had been stolen. It was in that frame of mind that he found me. There was no hope for me; I was left in a ward with the dying. He had nursed my parents, and knew I was alone. He decided to try\u2026\" His voice, nearly a whisper now, trailed off. He stared unseeingly through the west windows. I wondered which images filled his mind now, Carlisle's memories or his own. I waited quietly. When he turned back to me, a gentle angel's smile lit his expression. \"And so we've come full circle,\" he concluded. \"Have you always stayed with Carlisle, then?\" I wondered. \"Almost always.\" He put his hand lightly on my waist and pulled me with him as he walked through the door. I stared back at the wall of pictures, wondering if I would ever get to hear the other stories. Edward didn't say any more as we walked down the hall, so I asked, \"Almost?\" He sighed, seeming reluctant to answer. \"Well, I had a typical bout of rebellious adolescence \u2014 about ten years after I was\u2026 born\u2026 created, whatever you want to call it. I wasn't sold on his life of abstinence, and I resented him for curbing my appetite. So I went off on my own for a time.\" \"Really?\" I was intrigued, rather than frightened, as I perhaps should have been. He could tell. I vaguely realized that we were headed up the next flight of stairs, but I wasn't paying much attention to my surroundings. \"That doesn't repulse you?\" \"No.\" \"Why not?\" \"I guess\u2026 it sounds reasonable.\" He barked a laugh, more loudly than before. We were at the top of the stairs now, in another paneled hallway. \"From the time of my new birth,\" he murmured, \"I had the advantage of knowing what everyone around me was thinking, both human and non-human alike. That's why it took me ten years to defy Carlisle \u2014 I could read his perfect sincerity, understand exactly why he lived the way he did. \"It took me only a few years to return to Carlisle and recommit to his vision. I thought I would be exempt from the\u2026 depression\u2026 that accompanies a conscience. Because I knew the thoughts of my prey, I could pass over the innocent and pursue only the evil. If I followed a murderer down a dark alley where he stalked a young girl \u2014 if I saved her, then surely I wasn't so terrible.\" I shivered, imagining only too clearly what he described \u2014 the alley at night, the frightened girl, the dark man behind her. And Edward, Edward as he hunted, terrible and glorious as a young god, unstoppable. Would she have been grateful, that girl, or more frightened than before? \"But as time went on, I began to see the monster in my eyes. I couldn't escape the debt of so much human life taken, no matter how justified. And I went back to Carlisle and Esme. They welcomed me back like the prodigal. It was more than I deserved.\" We'd come to a stop in front of the last door in the hall. \"My room,\" he informed me, opening it and pulling me through. His room faced south, with a wall-sized window like the great room below. The whole back side of the house must be glass. His view looked down on the winding Sol Duc River, across the untouched forest to the Olympic Mountain range. The mountains were much closer than I would have believed. The western wall was completely covered with shelf after shelf of CDs. His room was better stocked than a music store. In the corner was a sophisticated-looking sound system, the kind I was afraid to touch because I'd be sure to break something. There was no bed, only a wide and inviting black leather sofa. The floor was covered with a thick golden carpet, and the walls were hung with heavy fabric in a slightly darker shade. \"Good acoustics?\" I guessed. He chuckled and nodded. He picked up a remote and turned the stereo on. It was quiet, but the soft jazz number sounded like the band was in the room with us. I went to look at his mind-boggling music collection. \"How do you have these organized?\" I asked, unable to find any rhyme or reason to the titles. He wasn't paying attention. \"Ummm, by year, and then by personal preference within that frame,\" he said absently. I turned, and he was looking at me with a peculiar expression in his eyes. \"What?\" \"I was prepared to feel\u2026 relieved. Having you know about everything, not needing to keep secrets from you. But I didn't expect to feel more than that. I like it. It makes me\u2026 happy.\" He shrugged, smiling slightly. \"I'm glad,\" I said, smiling back. I'd worried that he might regret telling me these things. It was good to know that wasn't the case. But then, as his eyes dissected my expression, his smile faded and his forehead creased. \"You're still waiting for the running and the screaming, aren't you?\" I guessed. A faint smile touched his lips, and he nodded. \"I hate to burst your bubble, but you're really not as scary as you think you are. I don't find you scary at all, actually,\" I lied casually. He stopped, raising his eyebrows in blatant disbelief. Then he flashed a wide, wicked smile. \"You really shouldn't have said that,\" he chuckled. He growled, a low sound in the back of his throat; his lips curled back over his perfect teeth. His body shifted suddenly, half-crouched, tensed like a lion about to pounce. I backed away from him, glaring. \"You wouldn't.\" \u00a0\" I didn't see him leap at me \u2014 it was much too fast. I only found myself suddenly airborne, and then we crashed onto the sofa, knocking it into the wall. All the while, his arms formed an iron cage of protection around me \u2014 I was barely jostled. But I still was gasping as I tried to right myself. He wasn't having that. He curled me into a ball against his chest, holding me more securely than iron chains. I glared at him in alarm, but he seemed well in control, his jaw relaxed as he grinned, his eyes bright only with humor. \"You were saying?\" he growled playfully. \"That you are a very, very terrifying monster,\" I said, my sarcasm marred a bit by my breathless voice. \"Much better,\" he approved. \"Um.\" I struggled. \"Can I get up now?\" He just laughed. \"Can we come in?\" a soft voice sounded from the hall. I struggled to free myself, but Edward merely readjusted me so that I was somewhat more conventionally seated on his lap. I could see it was Alice, then, and Jasper behind her in the doorway. My cheeks burned, but Edward seemed at ease. \"Go ahead.\" Edward was still chuckling quietly. Alice seemed to find nothing unusual in our embrace; she walked \u2014 almost danced, her movements were so graceful \u2014 to the center of the room, where she folded herself sinuously onto the floor. Jasper, however, paused at the door, his expression a trifle shocked. He stared at Edward's face, and I wondered if he was tasting the atmosphere with his unusual sensitivity. \"It sounded like you were having Bella for lunch, and we came to see if you would share,\" Alice announced. I <em>stiffened</em> for an instant, until I realized Edward was grinning \u2014 whether at her comment or my response, I couldn't tell. \"Sorry, I don't believe I have enough to spare,\" he replied, his arms holding me recklessly close. \"Actually,\" Jasper said, smiling despite himself as he walked into the room, \"Alice says there's going to be a real storm tonight, and Emmett wants to play ball. Are you game?\" The words were all common enough, but the context confused me. I gathered that Alice was a bit more reliable than the weatherman, though. Edward's eyes lit up, but he hesitated. \"Of course you should bring Bella,\" Alice chirped. I thought I saw Jasper throw a quick glance at her. \"Do you want to go?\" Edward asked me, excited, his expression vivid. \"Sure.\" I couldn't disappoint such a face. \"Um, where are we going?\" \"We have to wait for thunder to play ball \u2014 you'll see why,\" he promised. \"Will I need an umbrella?\" They all three laughed aloud. \"Will she?\" Jasper asked Alice. \"No.\" She was positive. \"The storm will hit over town. It should be dry enough in the clearing.\" \"Good, then.\" The enthusiasm in Jasper's voice was catching, naturally. I found myself eager, rather than scared stiff. \"Let's go see if Carlisle will come.\" Alice bounded up and to the door in a fashion that would break any ballerina's heart. \"Like you don't know,\" Jasper teased, and they were swiftly on their way. Jasper managed to inconspicuously close the door behind them. \"What will we be playing?\" I demanded. \"You will be watching,\" Edward clarified. \"We will be playing baseball.\" I rolled my eyes. \"Vampires like baseball?\" \"It's the American pastime,\" he said with mock solemnity.",

            "en": "7 REPETITION        22 FLIGHT DEMETRI LEFT US IN THE CHEERFULLY OPULENT RECEPTION area, where the woman Gianna was still at her post behind the polished counter. Bright, harmless music tinkled from hidden speakers. \"Do not leave until dark,\" he warned us. Edward nodded, and Demetri hurried away. Gianna did not seem at all surprised by the exchange, though she did eye Edward's borrowed cloak with shrewd speculation. \"Are you all right?\" Edward asked under his breath, too low for the human woman to hear. His voice was rough\u2014if velvet can be rough\u2014with anxiety. Still stressed by our situation, I imagined. \"You'd better make her sit before she falls,\" Alice said. \"She's going to pieces.\" It was only then that I realize I was shaking, shaking hard, my entire frame vibrating until my teeth chattered and the room around me seemed to wobble and blur in my eyes. For one wild second, I wondered if this was how Jacob felt just before exploding into a werewolf.  I heard a sound that didn't make sense, a strange, ripping counterpart to the otherwise cheery background music. Distracted by the shaking, I couldn't tell where it was coming from. \"Shh, Bella, shh,\" Edward said as he pulled me to the sofa farthest away from the curious human at the desk. \"I think she's having hysterics. Maybe you should slap her,\" Alice suggested. Edward threw a frantic glance at her. Then I understood. Oh. The noise was me. The ripping sound was the sobs coming from my chest. That's what was shaking me. \"It's all right, you're safe, it's all right,\" he chanted again and again. He pulled me onto his lap and tucked the thick wool cloak around me, protecting me from his cold skin. I knew it was stupid to react like this. Who knew how much time I had to look at his face? He was saved, and I was saved, and he could leave me as soon as we were free. To have my eyes so filled with tears that I could not see his features clearly was wasteful\u2014\u00a0 insanity. But, behind my eyes where the tears could not wash the image away, I could still see the panicked face of the tiny woman with the rosary. \"All those people,\" I sobbed. \"I know,\" he whispered. \"It's so horrible.\" \"Yes, it is. I wish you hadn't had to see that.\" I rested my head against his cold chest, using the thick cloak to wipe my eyes. I took a few deep breaths, trying to calm myself. \"Is there anything I can get you?\" a voice asked politely. It was Gianna, leaning over Edward's shoulder with a look that was both concerned and yet still professional and detached at the same time. It didn't seem to bother her that her face was inches from a hostile vampire. She was either totally oblivious, or very good at her job. \"No,\" Edward answered coldly. She nodded, smiled at me, and then disappeared. I waited until she was out of hearing range. \"Does she know what's going on here?\" I demanded, my voice low and hoarse. I was getting control of myself, my breathing evening out. \"Yes. She knows everything,\" Edward told me. \"Does she know they're going to kill her someday?\" \"She's knows it's a possibility,\" he said. That surprised me. Edward's face was hard to read. \"She's hoping they'll decide to keep her.\" I felt the blood leave my face. \"She wants to be one of them?\" He nodded once, his eyes sharp on my face, watching my reaction. I shuddered. \"How can she want that?\" I whispered, more to myself than really looking for an answer. \"How can she watch those people file through to that hideous room and want to be a part of that?\" Edward didn't answer. His expression twisted in response to something I'd said. As I stared at his too beautiful face, trying to understand the change, it suddenly struck me that I was really here, in Edward's arms, however fleetingly, and that we were not\u2014at this exact moment\u2014about to be killed. \"Oh, Edward,\" I cried, and I was sobbing again. It was such a stupid reaction. The tears were too thick for me to see his face again, and that was inexcusable. I only had until sunset for sure. Like a fairy tale again, with deadlines that ended the magic. \"What's wrong?\" he asked, still anxious, rubbing my back with gentle pats. I wrapped my arms around his neck\u2014what was the worst he could do? Just push me away\u2014and hugged myself closer to him. \"Is it really sick for me to be happy right now?\" I asked. My voice broke twice. He didn't push me away. He pulled me tight against his ice-hard chest, so tight it was hard to breathe, even with my lungs securely intact. \"I know exactly what you mean,\" he whispered. \"But we have lots of reasons to be happy. For one, we're alive.\" \"Yes,\" I agreed. \"That's a good one.\" \"And together,\" he breathed. His breath was so sweet it made my head swim. I just nodded, sure that he did not place the same weight on that consideration as I did. \"And, with any luck, we'll still be alive tomorrow.\" \"Hopefully,\" I said uneasily. \"The outlook is quite good,\" Alice assured me. She'd been so quiet, I'd almost forgotten her presence. \"I'll see Jasper in less than twenty-four hours,\" she added in a satisfied tone. Lucky Alice. She could trust her future. I couldn't keep my eyes off of Edward's face for long. I stared at him, wishing more than anything that the future would never happen. That this moment would last forever, or, if it couldn't, that I would stop existing when it did. Edward stared right back at me, his dark eyes soft, and it was easy to pretend that he felt the same way. So that's what I did. I pretended, to make the moment sweeter. His fingertips traced the circles under my eyes. \"You look so tired.\" \"And you look thirsty,\" I whispered back, studying the purple bruises under his black irises. He shrugged. \"It's nothing.\" \"Are you sure? I could sit with Alice,\" I offered, unwilling; I'd rather he killed me now than move one inch from where I was.  \"Don't be ridiculous.\" He sighed; his sweet breath caressed my face. \"I've never been in better control of that side of my nature than right now.\" I had a million questions for him. One of them bubbled to my lips now, but I held my tongue. I didn't want to ruin the moment, as imperfect as it was, here in this room that made me sick, under the eyes of the would-be monster. Here in his arms, it was so easy to fantasize that he wanted me. I didn't want to think about his motivations now\u2014about whether he acted this way to keep me calm while we were still in danger, or if he just felt guilty for where we were and relieved that he wasn't responsible for my death. Maybe the time apart had been enough that I didn't bore him for the moment. But it didn't matter. I was so much happier pretending. I lay quiet in his arms, re-memorizing his face, pretending\u2026 He stared at my face like he was doing the same, while he and Alice discussed how to get home. Their voices were so quick and low that I knew Gianna couldn't understand. I missed half of it myself. It sounded like more theft would be involved, though. I wondered idly if the yellow Porsche had made it back to its owner yet. \"What was all that talk about singers?\" Alice asked at one point. \"La tua cantante,\" Edward said. His voice made the words into music. \"Yes, that,\" Alice said, and I concentrated for a moment. I'd wondered about that, too, at the time. I felt Edward shrug around me. \"They have a name for someone who smells the way Bella does to me.\u00a0 They call her my singer\u2014because her blood sings for me.\" Alice laughed. I was tired enough to sleep, but I fought against the weariness. I wasn't going to miss a second of the time I had with him. Now and then, as he talked with Alice, he would lean down suddenly and kiss me\u2014his glass-smooth lips brushing against my hair, my forehead, the tip of my nose. Each time it was like an electric shock to my long dormant heart. The sound of its beating seemed to fill the entire room. It was heaven\u2014right smack in the middle of hell. I lost track of the time completely. So when Edward's arms tightened around me, and both he and Alice looked to the back of the room with wary eyes, I panicked. I cringed into Edward's chest as Alec\u2014his eyes now a vivid ruby, but still spotless in his light gray suit despite the afternoon meal\u2014walked through the double doors. It was good news. \"You're free to leave now,\" Alec told us, his tone so warm you'd think we were all lifelong friends. \"We ask that you don't linger in the city.\" Edward made no answering pretence; his voice was ice cold. \"That won't be a problem.\" Alec smiled, nodded, and disappeared again.  \"Follow the right hallway around the corner to the first set of elevators,\" Gianna told us as Edward helped me to my feet. \"The lobby is two floors down, and exits to the street. Goodbye, now,\" she added pleasantly. I wondered if her competence would be enough to save her.  Alice shot her a dark look. I was relieved there was another way out; I wasn't sure if I could handle another tour through the underground. We left through a tastefully luxurious lobby. I was the only one who glanced back at the medieval castle that housed the elaborate business facade. \u00a0I couldn't see the turret from here, for which I was grateful. The party was still in full swing in the streets. The street lamps were just coming on as we walked swiftly through the narrow, cobbled lanes. The sky was a dull, fading gray overhead, but the buildings crowded the streets so closely that it felt darker. The party was darker, too. Edward's long, trailing cloak did not stand out in the way it might have on a normal evening in Volterra. There were others in black satin cloaks now, and the plastic fangs I'd seen on the child in the square today seemed to be very popular with the adults. \"Ridiculous,\" Edward muttered once. I didn't notice when Alice disappeared from beside me. I looked over to ask her a question, and she was gone. \"Where's Alice?\" I whispered in a panic. \"She went to retrieve your bags from where she stashed them this morning.\" I'd forgotten that I had access to a toothbrush. It brightened my outlook considerably. \"She's stealing a car, too, isn't she?\" I guessed. He grinned. \"Not till we're outside.\" It seemed like a very long way to the entryway. Edward could see that I was spent; he wound his arm around my waist and supported most of my weight as we walked. I shuddered as he pulled me through the dark stone archway. The huge, ancient portcullis above was like a cage door, threatening to drop on us, to lock us in. He led me toward a dark car, waiting in a pool of shadow to the right of the gate with the engine running. To my surprise, he slid into the backseat with me, instead of insisting on driving. Alice was apologetic. \"I'm sorry.\" She gestured vaguely toward the dashboard. \"There wasn't much to choose from.\" \"It's fine, Alice.\" He grinned. \"They can't all be 911 Turbos.\" She sighed. \"I may have to acquire one of those legally. It was fabulous.\" \"I'll get you one for Christmas,\" Edward promised. Alice turned to beam at him, which worried me, as she was already speeding down the dark and curvy hillside at the same time. \"Yellow,\" she told him. Edward kept me tight in his arms. Inside the gray cloak, I was warm and comfortable. More than comfortable. \"You can sleep now, Bella,\" he murmured. \"It's over.\" I knew he meant the danger, the nightmare in the ancient city, but I still had to swallow hard before I could answer. \"I don't want to sleep. I'm not tired.\" Just the second part was a lie. I wasn't about to close my eyes. The car was only dimly lit by the dashboard controls, but it was enough that I could see his face. He pressed his lips to the hollow under my ear. \"Try,\" he encouraged. I shook my head. He sighed. \"You're still just as stubborn.\" I was stubborn; I fought with my heavy lids, and I won. The dark road was the hardest part; the bright lights at the airport in Florence made it easier, as did the chance to brush my teeth and change into clean clothes; Alice bought Edward new clothes, too, and he left the dark cloak on a pile of trash in an alley. The plane trip to Rome was so short that there wasn't really a chance for the fatigue to drag me under. I knew the flight from Rome to Atlanta would be another matter entirely, so I asked the flight attendant if she could bring me a Coke. \"Bella,\" Edward said disapprovingly. He knew my low tolerance for caffeine. Alice was behind us. I could hear her murmuring to Jasper on the phone. \"I don't want to sleep,\" I reminded him. I gave him an excuse that was believable because it was true. \"If I close my eyes now, I'll see things I don't want to see. I'll have nightmares.\" He didn't argue with me after that. It would have been a very good time to talk, to get the answers I needed\u2014needed but not really wanted; I was already despairing at the thought of what I might hear. We had an uninterrupted block of time ahead of us, and he couldn't escape me on an airplane\u2014well, not easily, at least. No one would hear us except Alice; it was late, and most of the passengers were turning off lights and asking for pillows in muted voices. Talk would help me fight off the exhaustion. But, perversely, I bit my tongue against the flood of questions. My reasoning was probably flawed by exhaustion, but I hoped that by postponing the discussion, I could buy a few more hours with him at some later time\u2014spin this out for another night, Scheherazade-style. So I kept drinking soda, and resisting even the urge to blink. Edward seemed perfectly content to hold me in his arms, his fingers tracing my face again and again. I touched his face, too. I couldn't stop myself, though I was afraid it would hurt me later, when I was alone again. He continued to kiss my hair, my forehead, my wrists\u2026 but never my lips, and that was good. After all, how many ways can one heart be mangled and still be expected to keep beating? I'd lived through a lot that should have finished me in the last few days, but it didn't make me feel strong. Instead, I felt horribly fragile, like one word could shatter me. Edward didn't speak. Maybe he was hoping I would sleep. Maybe he had nothing to say. I won the fight against my heavy lids. I was awake when we reached the airport in Atlanta, and I even watched the sun beginning to rise over Seattle's cloud cover before Edward slid the window shut. I was proud of myself. I hadn't missed one minute. Neither Alice nor Edward was surprised by the reception that waited for us at Sea-Tac airport, but it caught me off guard. Jasper was the first one I saw\u2014he didn't seem to see me at all. His eyes were only for Alice. She went quickly to his side; they didn't embrace like other couples meeting there. They only stared into each other's faces, yet, somehow, the moment was so private that I still felt the need to look away. Carlisle and Esme waited in a quiet corner far from the line for the metal detectors, in the shadow of a wide pillar. Esme reached for me, hugging me fiercely, yet awkwardly, because Edward kept his arms around me, too. \"Thank you so much,\" she said in my ear. Then she threw her arms around Edward, and she looked like she would be crying if that were possible. \"You will never put me through that again,\" she nearly growled. Edward grinned, repentant. \"Sorry, Mom.\" \"Thank you, Bella,\" Carlisle said. \"We owe you.\" \"Hardly,\" I mumbled. The sleepless night was suddenly overpowering. My head felt disconnected from my body. \"She's dead on her feet,\" Esme scolded Edward. \"Let's get her home.\" Not sure if home was what I wanted at this point, I stumbled, half-blind, through the airport, Edward dragging me on one side and Esme on the other. I didn't know if Alice and Jasper were behind us or not, and I was too exhausted to look. I think I was mostly asleep, though I was still walking, when we reached their car. The surprise of seeing Emmett and Rosalie leaning against the black sedan under the dim lights of the parking garage revived me some. Edward <em>stiffened</em>. \"Don't,\" Esme whispered. \"She feels awful.\" \"She should,\" Edward said, making no attempt to keep his voice down. \"It's not her fault,\" I said, my words garbled with exhaustion. \"Let her make amends,\" Esme pleaded.  \"We'll ride with Alice and Jasper.\"\u00a0 Edward glowered at the absurdly lovely blond vampire waiting for us. \"Please, Edward,\" I said. I didn't want to ride with Rosalie any more than he seemed to, but I'd caused more than enough discord in his family. He sighed, and towed me toward the car. Emmett and Rosalie got in the front seat without speaking, while Edward pulled me in the back again. I knew I wasn't going to be able to fight my eyelids anymore, and I laid my head against his chest in defeat, letting them close. I felt the car purr to life. \"Edward,\" Rosalie began. \"I know.\" Edward's brusque tone was not generous. \"Bella?\" Rosalie asked softly. My eyelids fluttered open in shock. It was the first time she'd ever spoken directly to me. \"Yes, Rosalie?\" I asked, hesitant. \"I'm so very sorry, Bella. I feel wretched about every part of this, and so grateful that you were brave enough to go save my brother after what I did. Please say you'll forgive me.\" The words were awkward, stilted because of her embarrassment, but they seemed sincere. \"Of course, Rosalie,\" I mumbled, grasping at any chance to make her hate me a little less. \"It's not your fault at all. I'm the one who jumped off the damn cliff. Of course I forgive you.\" The words came out like mush. \"It doesn't count until she's conscious, Rose,\" Emmett chuckled. \"I'm conscious,\" I said; it just sounded like a garbled sigh. \"Let her sleep,\" Edward insisted, but his voice was a little warmer. It was quiet then, except for the gentle thrum of the engine. I must have fallen asleep, because it seemed like seconds later when the door opened and Edward was carrying me from the car. My eyes wouldn't open. At first I thought we were still at the airport. And then I heard Charlie. \"Bella!\" he shouted from some distance. \"Charlie,\" I mumbled, trying to shake off the stupor. \"Shh,\" Edward whispered. \"It's okay; you're home and safe. Just sleep.\" \"I can't believe you have the nerve to show your face here.\" Charlie bellowed at Edward, his voice much closer now. \"Stop it, Dad,\" I groaned. He didn't hear me. \"What's wrong with her?\" Charlie demanded. \"She's just very tired, Charlie,\" Edward assured him quietly. \"Please let her rest.\" \"Don't tell me what to do!\" Charlie yelled. \"Give her to me. Get your hands off her!\" Edward tried to pass me to Charlie, but I clung to him with locked, tenacious fingers. I could feel my dad yanking on my arm. \"Cut it out, Dad,\" I said with more volume. I managed to drag my lids back to stare at Charlie with bleary eyes. \"Be mad at me.\" We were in front of my house. The front door was standing open. The cloud cover overhead was too thick to guess at a time of day. \"You bet I will be,\" Charlie promised. \"Get inside.\" \u201cO\u2019Kay. Let me down,\" I sighed. Edward set me on my feet. I could see that I was upright, but I couldn't feel my legs. I trudged forward anyway, until the sidewalk swirled up toward my face. Edward's arms caught me before I hit the concrete. \"Just let me get her upstairs,\" Edward said. \"Then I'll leave.\" \"No,\" I cried, panicking. I hadn't got my answers yet. He had to stay for at least that much, didn't he? \"I won't be far,\" Edward promised, whispering so low in my ear that Charlie didn't have a hope of hearing. I didn't hear Charlie answer, but Edward headed into the house. My open eyes only made it till the stairs. The last thing I felt was Edward's cool hands prying my fingers loose from his shirt.",

            "en": "18         18. THE HUNT They emerged one by one from the forest edge, ranging a dozen meters apart. The first male into the clearing fell back immediately, allowing the other male to take the front, orienting himself around the tall, dark-haired man in a manner that clearly displayed who led the pack. The third was a woman; from this distance, all I could see of her was that her hair was a startling shade of red. They closed ranks before they continued cautiously toward Edward's family, exhibiting the natural respect of a troop of predators as it encounters a larger, unfamiliar group of its own kind. As they approached, I could see how different they were from the Cullens. Their walk was catlike, a gait that seemed constantly on the edge of shifting into a crouch. They dressed in the ordinary gear of backpackers:\u00a0 jeans and casual button-down shirts in heavy, weatherproof fabrics. The clothes were frayed, though, with wear, and they were barefoot. Both men had cropped hair, but the woman's brilliant orange hair was filled with leaves and debris from the woods. Their sharp eyes carefully took in the more polished, urbane stance of Carlisle, who, flanked by Emmett and Jasper, stepped guardedly forward to meet them. Without any seeming communication between them, they each straightened into a more casual, erect bearing. The man in front was easily the most beautiful, his skin olive-toned beneath the typical pallor, his hair a glossy black. He was of a medium build, hard-muscled, of course, but nothing next to Emmett's brawn. He smiled an easy smile, exposing a flash of gleaming white teeth. The woman was wilder, her eyes shifting restlessly between the men facing her, and the loose grouping around me, her chaotic hair quivering in the slight breeze. Her posture was distinctly feline. The second male hovered unobtrusively behind them, slighter than the leader, his light brown hair and regular features both nondescript. His eyes, though completely still, somehow seemed the most vigilant. Their eyes were different, too. Not the gold or black I had come to expect, but a deep burgundy color that was disturbing and sinister. The dark-haired man, still smiling, stepped toward Carlisle.  \"We thought we heard a game,\" he said in a relaxed voice with the slightest of French accents. \"I'm Laurent, these are Victoria and James.\" He gestured to the vampires beside him. \"I'm Carlisle. This is my family, Emmett and Jasper, Rosalie, Esme and Alice, Edward and Bella.\" He pointed us out in groups, deliberately not calling attention to individuals. I felt a shock when he said my name. \"Do you have room for a few more players?\" Laurent asked sociably. Carlisle matched Laurent's friendly tone. \"Actually, we were just finishing up. But we'd certainly be interested another time. Are you planning to stay in the area for long?\" \"We're headed north, in fact, but we were curious to see who was in the neighborhood. We haven't run into any company in a long time.\" \"No, this region is usually empty except for us and the occasional visitor, like yourselves.\" The tense atmosphere had slowly subsided into a casual conversation; I guessed that Jasper was using his peculiar gift to control the situation. \"What's your hunting range?\" Laurent casually inquired. Carlisle ignored the assumption behind the inquiry. \"The Olympic Range here, up and down the Coast Ranges on occasion. We keep a permanent residence nearby. There's another permanent settlement like ours up near Denali.\" Laurent rocked back on his heels slightly. \"Permanent? How do you manage that?\" There was honest curiosity in his voice. \"Why don't you come back to our home with us and we can talk comfortably?\" Carlisle invited. \"It's a rather long story.\" James and Victoria exchanged a surprised look at the mention of the word \"home,\" but Laurent controlled his expression better. \"That sounds very interesting, and welcome.\" His smile was genial. \"We've been on the hunt all the way down from Ontario, and we haven't had the chance to clean up in a while.\" His eyes moved appreciatively over Carlisle's refined appearance. \"Please don't take offense, but we'd appreciate it if you'd refrain from hunting in this immediate area. We have to stay inconspicuous, you understand,\" Carlisle explained. \"Of course.\" Laurent nodded. \"We certainly won't encroach on your territory. We just ate outside of Seattle, anyway,\" he laughed. A shiver ran up my spine. \"We'll show you the way if you'd like to run with us \u2014 Emmett and Alice, you can go with Edward and Bella to get the Jeep,\" he casually added. Three things seemed to happen simultaneously while Carlisle was speaking. My hair ruffled with the light breeze, Edward <em>stiffened</em>, and the second male, James, suddenly whipped his head around, scrutinizing me, his nostrils flaring. A swift rigidity fell on all of them as James lurched one step forward into a crouch. Edward bared his teeth, crouching in defense, a feral snarl ripping from his throat. It was nothing like the playful sounds I'd heard from him this morning; it was the single most menacing thing I had ever heard, and chills ran from the crown of my head to the back of my heels. \"What's this?\" Laurent exclaimed in open surprise. Neither James nor Edward relaxed their aggressive poses. James feinted slightly to the side, and Edward shifted in response. \"She's with us.\" Carlisle's firm rebuff was directed toward James. Laurent seemed to catch my scent less powerfully than James, but awareness now dawned on his face. \"You brought a snack?\" he asked, his expression incredulous as he took an involuntary step forward. Edward snarled even more ferociously, harshly, his lip curling high above his glistening, bared teeth. Laurent stepped back again. \"I said she's with us,\" Carlisle corrected in a hard voice. \"But she's human,\" Laurent protested. The words were not at all aggressive, merely astounded. \"Yes.\" Emmett was very much in evidence at Carlisle's side, his eyes on James. James slowly straightened out of his crouch, but his eyes never left me, his nostrils still wide. Edward stayed tensed like a lion in front of me. When Laurent spoke, his tone was soothing \u2014 trying to defuse the sudden hostility. \"It appears we have a lot to learn about each other.\" \"Indeed.\" Carlisle's voice was still cool. \"But we'd like to accept your invitation.\" His eyes flicked toward me and back to Carlisle. \"And, of course, we will not harm the human girl. We won't hunt in your range, as I said.\" James glanced in disbelief and aggravation at Laurent and exchanged another brief look with Victoria, whose eyes still flickered edgily from face to face. Carlisle measured Laurent's open expression for a moment before he spoke. \"We'll show you the way. Jasper, Rosalie, Esme?\" he called. They gathered together, blocking me from view as they converged. Alice was instantly at my side, and Emmett fell back slowly, his eyes locked on James as he backed toward us. \"Let's go, Bella.\" Edward's voice was low and bleak. This whole time I'd been rooted in place, terrified into absolute immobility. Edward had to grip my elbow and pull sharply to break my trance. Alice and Emmett were close behind us, hiding me. I stumbled alongside Edward, still stunned with fear. I couldn't hear if the main group had left yet. Edward's impatience was almost tangible as we moved at human speed to the forest edge. Once we were into the trees, Edward slung me over his back without breaking stride. I gripped as tightly as possible as he took off, the others close on his heels. I kept my head down, but my eyes, wide with fright, wouldn't close. They plunged through the now-black forest like wraiths. The sense of exhilaration that usually seemed to possess Edward as he ran was completely absent, replaced by a fury that consumed him and drove him still faster. Even with me on his back, the others trailed behind. We reached the Jeep in an impossibly short time, and Edward barely slowed as he flung me in the backseat. \"Strap her in,\" he ordered Emmett, who slid in beside me. Alice was already in the front seat, and Edward was starting the engine. It roared to life and we swerved backward, spinning around to face the winding road. Edward was growling something too fast for me to understand, but it sounded a lot like a string of profanities. The jolting trip was much worse this time, and the darkness only made it more frightening. Emmett and Alice both glared out the side windows. We hit the main road, and though our speed increased, I could see much better where we were going. And we were headed south, away from Forks. \"Where are we going?\" I asked. No one answered. No one even looked at me. \"Dammit, Edward! Where are you taking me?\" \"We have to get you away from here \u2014 far away \u2014 now.\" He didn't look back, his eyes on the road. The speedometer read a hundred and five miles an hour. \"Turn around! You have to take me home!\" I shouted. I struggled with the stupid harness, tearing at the straps. \"Emmett,\" Edward said grimly. And Emmett secured my hands in his steely grasp. \"No! Edward! No, you can't do this.\" \"I have to, Bella, now please be quiet.\" \"I won't! You have to take me back \u2014 Charlie will call the FBI! They'll be all over your family \u2014 Carlisle and Esme! They'll have to leave, to hide forever!\" \"Calm down, Bella.\" His voice was cold. \"We've been there before.\" \"Not over me, you don't! You're not ruining everything over me!\" I struggled violently, with total futility. Alice spoke for the first time. \"Edward, pull over.\" He flashed her a hard look, and then sped up. \"Edward, let's just talk this through.\" \"You don't understand,\" he roared in frustration. I'd never heard his voice so loud; it was deafening in the confines of the Jeep. The speedometer neared one hundred and fifteen. \"He's a tracker, Alice, did you see that? He's a tracker!\" I felt Emmett stiffen next to me, and I wondered at his reaction to the word. It meant something more to the three of them than it did to me; I wanted to understand, but there was no opening for me to ask. \"Pull over, Edward.\" Alice's tone was reasonable, but there was a ring of authority in it I'd never heard before. The speedometer inched passed one-twenty. \"Do it, Edward.\" \"Listen to me, Alice. I saw his mind. Tracking is his passion, his obsession \u2014 and he wants her, Alice \u2014 her, specifically. He begins the hunt tonight.\" \"He doesn't know where \u2014\" He interrupted her. \"How long do you think it will take him to cross her scent in town? His plan was already set before the words were out of Laurent's mouth.\" I gasped, knowing where my scent would lead. \"Charlie! You can't leave him there! You can't leave him!\" I thrashed against the harness. \"She's right,\" Alice said. The car slowed slightly. \"Let's just look at our options for a minute,\" Alice coaxed. The car slowed again, more noticeably, and then suddenly we screeched to a stop on the shoulder of the highway. I flew against the harness, and then slammed back into the seat. \"There are no options,\" Edward hissed. \"I'm not leaving Charlie!\" I yelled. He ignored me completely. \"We have to take her back,\" Emmett finally spoke. \"No.\" Edward was absolute. \"He's no match for us, Edward. He won't be able to touch her.\" \"He'll wait.\" Emmett smiled. \"I can wait, too.\" \"You didn't see \u2014 you don't understand. Once he commits to a hunt, he's unshakable. We'd have to kill him.\" Emmett didn't seem upset by the idea. \"That's an option.\" \"And the female. She's with him. If it turns into a fight, the leader will go with them, too.\" \"There are enough of us.\" \"There's another option,\" Alice said quietly. Edward turned on her in fury, his voice a blistering snarl. \"There \u2014 is \u2014 no \u2014 other \u2014 option!\" Emmett and I both stared at him in shock, but Alice seemed unsurprised. The silence lasted for a long minute as Edward and Alice stared each other down. I broke it. \"Does anyone want to hear my plan?\" \"No,\" Edward growled. Alice glared at him, finally provoked. \"Listen,\" I pleaded. \"You take me back.\" \"No,\" he interrupted. I glared at him and continued. \"You take me back. I tell my dad I want to go home to Phoenix. I pack my bags. We wait till this tracker is watching, and then we run. He'll follow us and leave Charlie alone. Charlie won't call the FBI on your family. Then you can take me any damned place you want.\" They stared at me, stunned. \"It's not a bad idea, really.\" Emmett's surprise was definitely an insult. \"It might work \u2014 and we simply can't leave her father unprotected. You know that,\" Alice said. Everyone looked at Edward. \"It's too dangerous \u2014 I don't want him within a hundred miles of her.\" Emmett was supremely confident. \"Edward, he's not getting through us.\" Alice thought for a minute. \"I don't see him attacking. He'll try to wait for us to leave her alone.\" \"It won't take long for him to realize that's not going to happen.\" \"I demand that you take me home.\" I tried to sound firm. Edward pressed his fingers to his temples and squeezed his eyes shut. \"Please,\" I said in a much smaller voice. He didn't look up. When he spoke, his voice sounded worn. \"You're leaving tonight, whether the tracker sees or not. You tell Charlie that you can't stand another minute in Forks. Tell him whatever story works. Pack the first things your hands touch, and then get in your truck. I don't care what he says to you. You have fifteen minutes. Do you hear me? Fifteen minutes from the time you cross the doorstep.\" The Jeep rumbled to life, and he spun us around, the tires squealing. The needle on the speedometer started to race up the dial.  \"Emmett?\" I asked, looking pointedly at my hands. \"Oh, sorry.\" He let me loose. A few minutes passed in silence, other than the roar of the engine. Then Edward spoke again. \"This is how it's going to happen. When we get to the house, if the tracker is not there, I will walk her to the door. Then she has fifteen minutes.\" He glared at me in the rearview mirror. \"Emmett, you take the outside of the house. Alice, you get the truck. I'll be inside as long as she is. After she's out, you two can take the Jeep home and tell Carlisle.\" \"No way,\" Emmett broke in. \"I'm with you.\" \"Think it through, Emmett. I don't know how long I'll be gone.\" \"Until we know how far this is going to go, I'm with you.\" Edward sighed. \"If the tracker is there,\" he continued grimly, \"we keep driving.\" \"We're going to make it there before him,\" Alice said confidently. Edward seemed to accept that. Whatever his problem with Alice was, he didn't doubt her now. \"What are we going to do with the Jeep?\" she asked. His voice had a hard edge. \"You're driving it home.\" \"No, I'm not,\" she said calmly. The unintelligible stream of profanities started again. \"We can't all fit in my truck,\" I whispered. Edward didn't appear to hear me. \"I think you should let me go alone,\" I said even more quietly. He heard that. \"Bella, please just do this my way, just this once,\" he said between clenched teeth. \"Listen, Charlie's not an imbecile,\" I protested. \"If you're not in town tomorrow, he's going to get suspicious.\" \"That's irrelevant. We'll make sure he's safe, and that's all that matters.\" \"Then what about this tracker? He saw the way you acted tonight. He's going to think you're with me, wherever you are.\" Emmett looked at me, insultingly surprised again. \"Edward, listen to her,\" he urged. \"I think she's right.\" \"Yes, she is,\" Alice agreed. \"I can't do that.\" Edward's voice was icy. \"Emmett should stay, too,\" I continued. \"He definitely got an eyeful of Emmett.\" \"What?\" Emmett turned on me. \"You'll get a better crack at him if you stay,\" Alice agreed. Edward stared at her incredulously. \"You think I should let her go alone?\" \"Of course not,\" Alice said. \"Jasper and I will take her.\" \"I can't do that,\" Edward repeated, but this time there was a trace of defeat in his voice. The logic was working on him. I tried to be persuasive. \"Hang out here for a week \u2014\" I saw his expression in the mirror and amended \"\u2014 a few days. Let Charlie see you haven't kidnapped me, and lead this James on a wild-goose chase. Make\u00a0 sure he's completely off my trail. Then come and meet me. Take a roundabout route, of course, and then Jasper and Alice can go home.\" I could see him beginning to consider it. \"Meet you where?\" \"Phoenix.\" Of course. \"No. He'll hear that's where you're going,\" he said impatiently. \"And you'll make it look like that's a ruse, obviously. He'll know that we'll know that he's listening. He'll never believe I'm actually going where I say I am going.\" \"She's diabolical,\" Emmett chuckled. \"And if that doesn't work?\" \"There are several million people in Phoenix,\" I informed him. \"It's not that hard to find a phone book.\" \"I won't go home.\" \"Oh?\" he inquired, a dangerous note in his voice. \"I'm quite old enough to get my own place.\" \"Edward, we'll be with her,\" Alice reminded him. \"What are you going to do in Phoenix?\" he asked her scathingly. \"Stay indoors.\" \"I kind of like it.\" Emmett was thinking about cornering James, no doubt. \"Shut up, Emmett.\" \"Look, if we try to take him down while she's still around, there's a much better chance that someone will get hurt \u2014 she'll get hurt, or you will, trying to protect her. Now, if we get him alone\u2026\" He trailed off with a slow smile. I was right. The Jeep was crawling slowly along now as we drove into town. Despite my brave talk, I could feel the hairs on my arms standing up. I thought about Charlie, alone in the house, and tried to be courageous. \"Bella.\" Edward's voice was very soft. Alice and Emmett looked out their windows. \"If you let anything happen to yourself\u2014 anything at all \u2014 I'm holding you personally responsible. Do you understand that?\" \"Yes,\" I gulped. He turned to Alice. \"Can Jasper handle this?\" \"Give him some credit, Edward. He's been doing very, very well, all things considered.\" \"Can you handle this?\" he asked. And graceful little Alice pulled back her lips in a horrific grimace and let loose with a guttural snarl that had me cowering against the seat in terror. Edward smiled at her. \"But keep your opinions to yourself,\" he muttered suddenly.",

            "en": "7 REPETITION        21 VERDICT WE WERE IN A BRIGHTLY LIT, UNREMARKABLE HALLWAY. The walls were off-white, the floor carpeted in industrial gray. Common rectangular fluorescent lights were spaced evenly along the ceiling. It was warmer here, for which I was grateful. This hall seemed very benign after the gloom of the ghoulish stone sewers. Edward didn't seem to agree with my assessment. He glowered darkly down the long hallway, toward the slight, black shrouded figure at the end, standing by an elevator. He pulled me along, and Alice walked on my other side. The heavy door creaked shut behind us, and then there was the thud of a bolt sliding home.\u00a0 Jane waited by the elevator, one hand holding the doors open for us. Her expression was apathetic. Once inside the elevator, the three vampires that belonged to the Volturi relaxed further. They threw back their cloaks, letting the hoods fall back on their shoulders. Felix and Demetri were both of a slightly olive complexion\u2014it looked odd combined with their chalky pallor. Felix's black hair was cropped short, but Demetri's waved to his shoulders. Their irises were deep crimson around the edges, darkening until they were black around the pupil. Under the shrouds, their clothes were modern, pale, and nondescript. I cowered in the corner, cringing against Edward. His hand still rubbed against my arm. He never took his eyes off Jane. The elevator ride was short; we stepped out into what looked like a posh office reception area. The walls were paneled in wood, the floors carpeted in thick, deep green. There were no windows, but large, brightly lit paintings of the Tuscan countryside hung everywhere as replacements. Pale leather couches were arranged in cozy groupings, and the glossy tables held crystal vases full of vibrantly colored bouquets. The flowers' smell reminded me of a funeral home.  In the middle of the room was a high, polished mahogany counter. I gawked in astonishment at the woman behind it. She was tall, with dark skin and green eyes. She would have been very pretty in any other company\u2014but not here. Because she was every bit as human as I was. I couldn't comprehend what this human woman was doing here, totally at ease, surrounded by vampires.  She smiled politely in welcome. \"Good afternoon, Jane,\" she said. There was no surprise in her face as she glanced at Jane's company. Not Edward, his bare chest glinting dimly in the white lights, or even me, disheveled and comparatively hideous. Jane nodded. \"Gianna.\" She continued toward a set of double doors in the back of the room, and we followed. As Felix passed the desk, he winked at Gianna, and she giggled. On the other side of the wooden doors was a different kind of reception. The pale boy in the pearl gray suit could have been Jane's twin. His hair was darker, and his lips were not as full, but he was just as lovely. He came forward to meet us. He smiled, reaching for her. \"Jane.\" \"Alec,\" she responded, embracing the boy. They kissed each other's cheeks on both sides. Then he looked at us. \"They send you out for one and you come back with two\u2026 and a half,\" he noted, looking at me. \"Nice work.\" She laughed\u2014the sound sparkled with delight like a baby's cooing. \"Welcome back, Edward,\" Alec greeted him. \"You seem in a better mood.\" \"Marginally,\" Edward agreed in a flat voice. I glanced at Edward's hard face, and wondered how his mood could have been darker before. Alec chuckled, and examined me as I clung to Edward's side. \"And this is the cause of all the trouble?\" he asked, skeptical. Edward only smiled, his expression contemptuous. Then he froze. \"Dibs,\" Felix called casually from behind. Edward turned, a low snarl building deep in his chest. Felix smiled\u2014his hand was raised, palm up; he curled his fingers twice, inviting Edward forward. Alice touched Edward's arm. \"Patience,\" she cautioned him. They exchanged a long glance, and I wished I could hear what she was telling him. I figured that it was something to do with not attacking Felix, because Edward took a deep breath and turned back to Alec. \"Aro will be so pleased to see you again,\" Alec said, as if nothing had passed. \"Let's not keep him waiting,\" Jane suggested. Edward nodded once. Alec and Jane, holding hands, led the way down yet another wide, ornate hall\u2014would there ever be an end? They ignored the doors at the end of the hall\u2014doors entirely sheathed in gold\u2014stopping halfway down the hall and sliding aside a piece of the paneling to expose a plain wooden door. It wasn't locked. Alec held it open for Jane. I wanted to groan when Edward pulled me through to the other side of the door. It was the same ancient stone as the square, the alley, and the sewers. And it was dark and cold again. The stone antechamber was not large. It opened quickly into a brighter, cavernous room, perfectly round like a huge castle turret\u2026 which was probably exactly what it was. Two stories up, long window slits threw thin rectangles of bright sunlight onto the stone floor below. There were no artificial lights. The only furniture in the room were several massive wooden chairs, like thrones, that were spaced unevenly, flush with the curving stone walls. In the very center of the circle, in a slight depression, was another drain. I wondered if they used it as an exit, like the hole in the street. The room was not empty. A handful of people were convened in seemingly relaxed conversation. The murmur of low, smooth voices was a gentle hum in the air. As I watched, a pair of pale women in summer dresses paused in a patch of light, and, like prisms, their skin threw the light in rainbow sparkles against the sienna walls. The exquisite faces all turned toward our party as we entered the room. Most of the immortals were dressed in inconspicuous pants and shirts\u2014things that wouldn't stick out at all on the streets below. But the man who spoke first wore one of the long robes. It was pitch-black, and brushed against the floor. For a moment, I thought his long, jet-black hair was the hood of his cloak. \"Jane, dear one, you've returned!\" he cried in evident delight. His voice was just a soft sighing. He drifted forward, and the movement flowed with such surreal grace that I gawked, my mouth hanging open. Even Alice, whose every motion looked like dancing, could not compare. I was only more astonished as he floated closer and I could see his face. It was not like the unnaturally attractive faces that surrounded him (for he did not approach us alone; the entire group converged around him, some following, and some walking ahead of him with the alert manner of bodyguards). I couldn't decide if his face was beautiful or not. I suppose the features were perfect.  But he was as different from the vampires beside him as they were from me. His skin was translucently white, like onionskin, and it looked just as delicate\u2014it stood in shocking contrast to the long black hair that framed his face. I felt a strange, horrifying urge to touch his cheek, to see if it was softer than Edward's or Alice's, or if it was powdery, like chalk. His eyes were red, the same as the others around him, but the color was clouded, milky; I wondered if his vision was affected by the haze. He glided to Jane, took her face in his papery hands, kissed her lightly on her full lips, and then floated back a step. \"Yes, Master.\" Jane smiled; the expression made her look like an angelic child. \"I brought him back alive, just as you wished.\" \"Ah, Jane.\" He smiled, too. \"You are such a comfort to me.\" He turned his misty eyes toward us, and the smile brightened\u2014became ecstatic. \"And Alice and Bella, too!\" he rejoiced, clapping his thin hands together. \"This is a happy surprise!  Wonderful!\" I stared in shock as he called our names informally, as if we were old friends dropping in for an unexpected visit. He turned to our hulking escort. \"Felix, be a dear and tell my brothers about our company. I'm sure they wouldn't want to miss this.\" \"Yes, Master.\" Felix nodded and disappeared back the way we had come. \"You see, Edward?\" The strange vampire turned and smiled at Edward like a fond but scolding grandfather. \"What did I tell you? Aren't you glad that I didn't give you what you wanted yesterday?\" \"Yes, Aro, I am,\" he agreed, tightening his arm around my waist. \"I love a happy ending.\" Aro sighed. \"They are so rare. But I want the whole story. How did this happen? Alice?\" He turned to gaze at Alice with curious, misty eyes. \"Your brother seemed to think you infallible, but apparently there was some mistake.\" \"Oh, I'm far from infallible.\" She flashed a dazzling smile. She looked perfectly at ease, except that her hands were balled into tight little fists. \"As you can see today, I cause problems as often as I cure them.\" \"You're too modest,\" Aro chided. \"I've seen some of your more amazing exploits, and I must admit I've never observed anything like your talent. Wonderful!\" Alice flickered a glance at Edward. Aro did not miss it. \"I'm sorry, we haven't been introduced properly at all, have we? It's just that I feel like I know you already, and I tend get ahead of myself. Your brother introduced us yesterday, in a peculiar way. You see, I share some of your brother's talent, only I am limited in a way that he is not.\" Aro shook his head; his tone was envious. \"And also exponentially more powerful,\" Edward added dryly. He looked at Alice as he swiftly explained. \"Aro needs physical contact to hear your thoughts, but he hears much more than I do. You know I can only hear what's passing through your head in the moment. Aro hears every thought your mind has ever had.\" Alice raised her delicate eyebrows, and Edward inclined his head. Aro didn't miss that either. \"But to be able to hear from a distance\u2026\" Aro sighed, gesturing toward the two of them, and the exchange that had just taken place. \"That would be so convenient.\" Aro looked over our shoulders. All the other heads turned in the same direction, including Jane, Alec, and Demetri, who stood silently beside us. I was the slowest to turn. Felix was back, and behind him floated two more black-robed men. Both looked very much like Aro, one even had the same flowing black hair. The other had a shock of snow-white hair\u2014the same shade as his face\u2014that brushed against his shoulders. Their faces had identical, paper-thin skin. The trio from Carlisle's painting was complete, unchanged by the last three hundred years since it was painted. \"Marcus, Caius, look!\" Aro crooned. \"Bella is alive after all, and Alice is here with her! Isn't that wonderful?\" Neither of the other two looked as if wonderful would be their first choice of words. The dark-haired man seemed utterly bored, like he'd seen too many millennia of Aro's enthusiasm. The other's face was sour under the snowy hair. Their lack of interest did not curb Aro's enjoyment. \"Let us have the story,\" Aro almost sang in his feathery voice. The white-haired ancient vampire drifted away, gliding toward one of the wooden thrones. The other paused beside Aro, and he reached his hand out, at first I thought to take Aro's hand. But he just touched Aro's palm briefly and then dropped his hand to his side. Aro raised one black brow. I wondered how his papery skin did not crumple in the effort. Edward snorted very quietly, and Alice looked at him, curious. \"Thank you, Marcus,\" Aro said. \"That's quite interesting.\" I realized, a second late, that Marcus was letting Aro know his thoughts. Marcus didn't look interested. He glided away from Aro to join the one who must be Caius, seated against the wall. Two of the attending vampires followed silently behind him\u2014bodyguards, like I'd thought before. I could see that the two women in the sundresses had gone to stand beside Caius in the same manner. The idea of any vampire needing a guard was faintly ridiculous to me, but maybe the ancient ones were as frail as their skin suggested. Aro was shaking his head. \"Amazing,\"' he said. \"Absolutely amazing.\" Alice's expression was frustrated. Edward turned to her and explained again in a swift, low voice.  \"Marcus sees relationships. He's surprised by the intensity of ours.\" Aro smiled. \"So convenient,\" he repeated to himself. Then he spoke to us. \"It takes quite a bit to surprise Marcus, I can assure you.\" I looked at Marcus's dead face, and I believed that. \"It's just so difficult to understand, even now,\" Aro mused, staring at Edward's arm wrapped around me. It was hard for me to follow Aro's chaotic train of thought. I struggled to keep up. \"How can you stand so close to her like that?\" \"It's not without effort,\" Edward answered calmly. \"But still\u2014la tua cantante! What a waste!\" Edward chuckled once without humor. \"I look at it more as a price.\" Aro was skeptical. \"A very high price.\" \"Opportunity cost.\" Aro laughed. \"If I hadn't smelled her through your memories, I wouldn't have believed the call of anyone's blood could be so strong. I've never felt anything like it myself. Most of us would trade much for such a gift, and yet you\u2026\" \"Waste it,\" Edward finished, his voice sarcastic now. Aro laughed again. \"Ah, how I miss my friend Carlisle! You remind me of him\u2014only he was not so angry.\" \"Carlisle outshines me in many other ways as well.\" \"I certainly never thought to see Carlisle bested for self-control of all things, but you put him to shame.\" \"Hardly.\" Edward sounded impatient. As if he were tired of the preliminaries. It made me more afraid; I couldn't help but try to imagine what he expected would follow. \"I am gratified by his success,\" Aro mused. \"Your memories of him are quite a gift for me, though they astonish me exceedingly. I am surprised by how it\u2026 pleases me, his success in this unorthodox path he's chosen. I expected that he would waste, weaken with time. I'd scoffed at his plan to find others who would share his peculiar vision. Yet, somehow, I'm happy to be wrong.\" Edward didn't reply. \"But your restraint!\" Aro sighed. \"I did not know such strength was possible. To inure yourself against such a siren call, not just once but again and again\u2014if I had not felt it myself, I would not have believed.\" Edward gazed back at Aro's admiration with no expression. I knew his face well enough\u2014time had not changed that\u2014to guess at something seething beneath the surface. I fought to keep my breathing even. \"Just remembering how she appeals to you\u2026\" Aro chuckled. \"It makes me thirsty.\" Edward tensed. \"Don't be disturbed,\" Aro reassured him. \"I mean her no harm. But I am so curious, about one thing in particular.\" He eyed me with bright interest. \"May I?\" he asked eagerly, lifting one hand. \"Ask her,\" Edward suggested in a flat voice. \"Of course, how rude of me!\" Aro exclaimed. \"Bella,\" he addressed me directly now. \"I'm fascinated that you are the one exception to Edward's impressive talent\u2014so very interesting that such a thing should occur! And I was wondering, since our talents are similar in many ways, if you would be so kind as to allow me to try\u2014to see if you are an exception for me, as well?\" My eyes flashed up to Edward's face in terror. Despite Aro's overt politeness, I didn't believe I really had a choice. I was horrified at the thought of allowing him to touch me, and yet also perversely intrigued by the chance to feel his strange skin. Edward nodded in encouragement\u2014whether because he was sure Aro would not hurt me, or because there was no choice, I couldn't tell. I turned back to Aro and raised my hand slowly in front of me. It was trembling. He glided closer, and I believe he meant his expression to be reassuring. But his papery features were too strange, too alien and frightening, to reassure. The look on his face was more confident than his words had been. Aro reached out, as if to shake my hand, and pressed his insubstantial-looking skin against mine. It was hard, but felt brittle\u2014shale rather than granite\u2014and even colder than I expected. His filmy eyes smiled down at mine, and it was impossible to look away. They were mesmerizing in an odd, unpleasant way. Aro's face altered as I watched. The confidence wavered and became first doubt, then incredulity before he calmed it into a friendly mask. \"So very interesting,\" he said as he released my hand and drifted back. My eyes flickered to Edward, and, though his face was composed, I thought he seemed a little smug. Aro continued to drift with a thoughtful expression. He was quiet for a moment, his eyes flickering between the three of us. Then, abruptly, he shook his head. \"A first,\" he said to himself \"I wonder if she is immune to our other talents\u2026 Jane, dear?\" \"No!\" Edward snarled the word. Alice grabbed his arm with a restraining hand. He shook her off. Little Jane smiled up happily at Aro. \"Yes, Master?\" Edward was truly snarling now, the sound ripping and tearing from him, glaring at Aro with baleful eyes. The room had gone still, everyone watching him with amazed disbelief, as if he were committing some embarrassing social faux pas. I saw Felix grin hopefully and move a step forward. Aro glanced at him once, and he froze in place, his grin turning to a sulky expression. Then he spoke to Jane. \"I was wondering, my dear one, if Bella is immune to you.\" I could barely hear Aro over Edward's furious growls. He let go of me, moving to hide me from their view. Caius ghosted in our direction, with his entourage, to watch. Jane turned toward us with a beatific smile. \"Don't!\" Alice cried as Edward launched himself at the little girl. Before I could react, before anyone could jump between them, before Aro's bodyguards could tense, Edward was on the ground. No one had touched him, but he was on the stone floor writhing in obvious agony, while I stared in horror. Jane was smiling only at him now, and it all clicked together. What Alice had said about formidable gifts , why everyone treated Jane with such deference, and why Edward had thrown himself in her path before she could do that to me. \"Stop!\" I shrieked, my voice echoing in the silence, jumping forward to put myself between them. But Alice threw her arms around me in an unbreakable grasp and ignored my struggles. No sound escaped Edward's lips as he cringed against the stones. It felt like my head would explode from the pain of watching this. \"Jane,\" Aro recalled her in a tranquil voice. She looked up quickly, still smiling with pleasure, her eyes questioning. As soon as Jane looked away, Edward was still. Aro inclined his head toward me. Jane turned her smile in my direction. I didn't even meet her gaze. I watched Edward from the prison of Alice's arms, still struggling pointlessly. \"He's fine,\" Alice whispered in a tight voice. As she spoke, he sat up, and then sprang lightly to his feet. His eyes met mine, and they were horror-struck. At first I thought the horror was for what he had just suffered. But then he looked quickly at Jane, and back to me\u2014and his face relaxed into relief. I looked at Jane, too, and she no longer smiled. She glared at me, her jaw clenched with the intensity of her focus. I shrank back, waiting for the pain. Nothing happened. Edward was by my side again. He touched Alice's arm, and she surrendered me to him. Aro started to laugh. \"Ha, ha. ha,\" he chuckled. \"This is wonderful!\" Jane hissed in frustration, leaning forward like she was preparing to spring. \"Don't be put out, dear one,\" Aro said in a comforting tone, placing a powder-light hand on her shoulder. \"She confounds us all.\" Jane's upper lip curled back ever her teeth as she continued to glare at me. \"Ha, ha, ha,\" Aro chortled again. \"You're very brave, Edward, to endure in silence. I asked Jane to do that to me once\u2014just out of curiosity.\" He shook his head in admiration. Edward glared, disgusted. \"So what do we do with you now?\" Aro sighed. Edward and Alice <em>stiffened</em>. This was the part they'd been waiting for. I began to tremble. \"I don't suppose there's any chance that you've changed your mind?\" Aro asked Edward hopefully. \"Your talent would be an excellent addition to our little company.\" Edward hesitated. From the corner of my eye, I saw both Felix and Jane grimace. Edward seemed to weigh each word before he spoke it. \"I'd\u2026 rather\u2026 not.\" \"Alice?\" Aro asked, still hopeful. \"Would you perhaps be interested in joining with us?\" \"No, thank you,\" Alice said. \"And you, Bella?\" Aro raised his eyebrows. Edward hissed, low in my ears. I stared at Aro blankly. Was he joking? Or was he really asking me if I wanted to stay for dinner? It was the white-haired Caius who broke the silence. \"What?\" he demanded of Aro; his voice, though no more than a whisper, was flat. \"Caius, surely you see the potential,\" Aro chided him affectionately. \"I haven't seen a prospective talent so promising since we found Jane and Alec. Can you imagine the possibilities when she is one of us?\" Caius looked away with a caustic expression. Jane's eyes sparked with indignation at the comparison. Edward fumed beside me. I could hear a rumble in his chest, building toward a growl. I couldn't let his temper get him hurt. \"No, thank you,\" I spoke up in barely more than a whisper, my voice breaking in fright. Aro sighed. \"That's unfortunate. Such a waste.\" Edward hissed. \"Join or die, is that it? I suspected as much when we were brought to this room. So much for your laws.\" The tone of his voice surprised me. He sounded irate, but there was something deliberate about his delivery\u2014as if he'd chosen his words with great care. \"Of course not.\" Aro blinked, astonished. \"We were already convened here, Edward, awaiting Heidi's return. Not for you.\" \"Aro,\" Caius hissed. \"The law claims them.\" Edward glared at Caius. \"How so?\" he demanded. He must have known what Caius was thinking, but he seemed determined to make him speak it aloud. Caius pointed a skeletal finger at me. \"She knows too much. You have exposed our secrets.\" His voice was papery thin, just like his skin. \"There are a few humans in on your charade here, as well,\" Edward reminded him, and I thought of the pretty receptionist below. Caius's face twisted into a new expression. Was it supposed to be a smiled. \"Yes,\" he agreed. \"But when they are no longer useful to us, they will serve to sustain us. That is not your plan for this one. If she betrays our secrets, are you prepared to destroy her? I think not,\" he scoffed. \"I wouldn't\u2014,\" I began, still whispering. Caius silenced me with an icy look. \"Nor do you intend to make her one of us,\" Caius continued. \"Therefore, she is a vulnerability. Though it is true, for this, only her life is forfeit. You may leave if you wish.\" Edward bared his teeth. \"That's what I thought,\" Caius said, with something akin to pleasure. Felix leaned forward, eager. \"Unless\u2026\" Aro interrupted. He looked unhappy with the way the conversation had gone. \"Unless you do intend to give her immortality?\" Edward pursed his lips, hesitating for a moment before he answered. \"And if I do?\" Aro smiled, happy again. \"Why, then you would be free to go home and give my regards to my friend Carlisle.\" His expression turned more hesitant. \"But I'm afraid you would have to mean it.\" Aro raised his hand in front of him. Caius, who had begun to scowl furiously, relaxed. Edward's lips tightened into a fierce line. He stared into my eyes, and I stared back. \"Mean it,\" I whispered. \"Please.\" Was it really such a loathsome idea? Would he rather die than change me? I felt like I'd been kicked in the stomach. Edward stared down at me with a tortured expression. And then Alice stepped away from us, forward toward Aro. We turned to watch her. Her hand was raised like his. She didn't say anything, and Aro waved off his anxious guard as they moved to block her approach. Aro met her halfway, and took her hand with an eager, acquisitive glint in his eyes. He bent his head over their touching hands, his eyes closing as he concentrated. Alice was motionless, her face blank. I heard Edward's teeth snap together. No one moved. Aro seemed frozen over Alice's hand. The seconds passed and I grew more and more stressed, wondering how much time would pass before it was too much time. Before it meant something was wrong\u2014more wrong than it already was. Another agonizing moment passed, and then Aro's voice broke the silence. \"Ha, ha, ha,\" he laughed, his head still bent forward. He looked up slowly, his eyes bright with excitement. \"That was fascinating!\" Alice smiled dryly. \"I'm glad you enjoyed it.\" \"To see the things you've seen\u2014especially the ones that haven't happened yet!\" He shook his head in wonder. \"But that will,\" she reminded him, voice calm. \"Yes, yes, it's quite determined. Certainly there's no problem.\" Caius looked bitterly disappointed\u2014a feeling he seemed to share with Felix and Jane. \"Aro,\" Caius complained. \"Dear Caius,\" Aro smiled. \"Do not fret. Think of the possibilities! They do not join us today, but we can always hope for the future. Imagine the joy young Alice alone would bring to our little household\u2026 Besides, I'm so terribly curious to see how Bella turns out!\" Aro seemed convinced. Did he not realize how subjective Alice's visions were.' That she could make up her mind to transform me today, and then change it tomorrow? A million tiny decisions, her decisions and so many others', too\u2014Edward's\u2014could alter her path, and with that, the future. And would it really matter that Alice was willing, would it make any difference if I did become a vampire, when the idea was so repulsive to Edward? If death was, to him, a better alternative than having me around forever, an immortal annoyance? Terrified as I was, I felt myself sinking down into depression, drowning in it\u2026 \"Then we are free to go now?\" Edward asked in an even voice. \"Yes, yes,\" Aro said pleasantly. \"But please visit again. It's been absolutely enthralling!\" \"And we will visit you as well,\" Caius promised, his eyes suddenly half-closed like the heavy-lidded gaze of a lizard. \"To be sure that you follow through on your side. Were I you, I would not delay too long. We do not offer second chances.\" Edward's jaw clenched tight, but he nodded once. Caius smirked and drifted back to where Marcus still sat, unmoving and uninterested. Felix groaned. \"Ah, Felix.\" Aro smiled, amused. \"Heidi will be here at any moment. Patience.\" \"Hmm.\" Edward's voice had a new edge to it. \"In that case, perhaps we'd better leave sooner rather than later.\" \"Yes,\" Aro agreed. \"That's a good idea. Accidents do happen. Please wait below until after dark, though, if you don't mind.\" \"Of course,\" Edward agreed, while I cringed at the thought of waiting out the day before we could escape. \"And here,\" Aro added, motioning to Felix with one finger. Felix came forward at once, and Aro unfastened the gray cloak the huge vampire wore, pulling from his shoulders. He tossed it to Edward. \"Take this. You're a little conspicuous.\" Edward put the long cloak on, leaving the hood down. Aro sighed. \"It suits you.\" Edward chuckled, but broke off suddenly, glancing over his shoulder. \"Thank you, Aro. We'll wait below.\" \"Goodbye, young friends,\" Aro said, his eyes bright as he stared in the same direction. \"Let's go,\" Edward said, urgent now. Demetri gestured that we should follow, and then set off the way we'd come in, the only exit by the look of things. Edward pulled me swiftly along beside him. Alice was close by my other side, her face hard. \"Not fast enough,\" she muttered. I stared up at her, frightened, but she only seemed chagrined. It was then that I first heard the babble of voices\u2014loud, rough voices\u2014coming from the antechamber. \"Well this is unusual,\" a man's coarse voice boomed. \"So medieval,\" an unpleasantly shrill, female voice gushed back. A large crowd was coming through the little door, filling the smaller stone chamber. Demetri motioned for us to make room. We pressed back against the cold wall to let them pass. The couple in front, Americans from the sound of them, glanced around themselves with appraising eyes. \"Welcome, guests! Welcome to Volterra!\" I could hear Aro sing from the big turret room. The rest of them, maybe forty or more, filed in after the couple. Some studied the setting like tourists. A few even snapped pictures. Others looked confused, as if the story that had led them to this room was not making sense anymore. I noticed one small, dark woman in particular. Around her neck was a rosary, and she gripped the cross tightly in one hand. She walked more slowly than the others, touching someone now and then and asking a question in an unfamiliar language. No one seemed to understand her, and her voice grew more panicked. Edward pulled my face against his chest, but it was too late. I already understood. As soon as the smallest break appeared, Edward pushed me quickly toward the door. I could feel the horrified expression on my face, and the tears beginning to pool in my eyes. The ornate golden hallway was quiet, empty except for one gorgeous, statuesque woman. She stared at us curiously, me in particular. \"Welcome home, Heidi,\" Demetri greeted her from behind us. Heidi smiled absently. She reminded me of Rosalie, though they looked nothing alike\u2014it was just that her beauty, too, was exceptional, unforgettable. I couldn't seem to look away. She was dressed to emphasize that beauty. Her amazingly long legs, darkened with tights, were exposed by the shortest of miniskirts. Her top was long-sleeved and high-necked, but extremely close-fitting, and constructed of red vinyl. Her long mahogany hair was lustrous, and her eyes were the strangest shade of violet\u2014a color that might result from blue-tinted contacts over red irises. \"Demetri,\" she responded in a silky voice, her eyes flickering between my face and Edward's gray cloak. \"Nice fishing,\" Demetri complimented her, and I suddenly understood the attention-grabbing outfit she wore\u2026 she was not only the fisherman, but also the bait. \"Thanks.\" She flashed a stunning smile. \"Aren't you coming?\" \"In a minute. Save a few for me.\" Heidi nodded and ducked through the door with one last curious look at me. Edward set a pace that had me running to keep up. But we still couldn't get through the ornate door at the end of the hallway before the screaming started.",

            "en": "5         5. IMPRINT \u201cAre you okay, Jake?\u00a0 Charlie said you were having a hard time. . . . Isn\u2019t it getting any better?\u201d His warm hand curled around mine. \u201cIt\u2019s not so bad,\u201d he said, but he wouldn\u2019t meet my eyes. He walked slowly back to the driftwood bench, staring at the rainbow-colored pebbles, and pulling me along at his side. I sat back down on our tree, but he sat on the wet, rocky ground rather than next to me. I wondered if it was so that he could hide his face more easily. He kept my hand. I started babbling to fill the silence. \u201cIt\u2019s been so long since I was here. I\u2019ve probably missed a ton of things. How are Sam and Emily? And Embry? Did Quil \u2014?\u201d I broke off mid-sentence, remembering that Jacob\u2019s friend Quil had been a sensitive subject. \u201cAh, Quil,\u201d Jacob sighed. So then it must have happened \u2014 Quil must have joined the pack. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I mumbled. To my surprise, Jacob snorted. \u201cDon\u2019t say that to him.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cQuil\u2019s not looking for pity. Just the opposite \u2014 he\u2019s jazzed. Totally thrilled.\u201d This made no sense to me. All the other wolves had been so depressed at the idea of their friend sharing their fate. \u201cHuh?\u201d Jacob tilted his head back to look at me. He smiled and rolled his eyes.    \u201cQuil thinks it\u2019s the coolest thing that\u2019s ever happened to him. Part of it is finally knowing what\u2019s going on. And he\u2019s excited to have his friends back \u2014 to be part of the \u2018in crowd.\u2019\u201d Jacob snorted again. \u201cShouldn\u2019t be surprised, I guess. It\u2019s so Quil.\u201d \u201cHe likes it?\u201d \u201cHonestly . . . most of them do,\u201d Jacob admitted slowly. \u201cThere are definitely good sides to this \u2014 the speed, the freedom, the strength . . . the sense of \u2014 of family . . . . Sam and I are the only ones who ever felt really bitter. And Sam got past that a long time ago. So I\u2019m the crybaby now.\u201d Jacob laughed at himself. There were so many things I wanted to know. \u201cWhy are you and Sam different? What happened to Sam anyway? What\u2019s his problem?\u201d The questions tumbled out without room to answer them, and Jacob laughed again. \u201cThat\u2019s a long story.\u201d \u201cI told you a long story. Besides, I\u2019m not in any hurry to get back,\u201d I said, and then I grimaced as I thought of the trouble I would be in. He looked up at me swiftly, hearing the double edge in my words. \u201cWill he be mad at you?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d I admitted. \u201cHe really hates it when I do things he considers . . . risky.\u201d \u201cLike hanging out with werewolves.\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d Jacob shrugged. \u201cSo don\u2019t go back. I\u2019ll sleep on the couch.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a great idea,\u201d I grumbled. \u201cBecause then he would come looking for me.\u201d Jacob <em>stiffened</em>, and then smiled bleakly. \u201cWould he?\u201d \u201cIf he was afraid I was hurt or something \u2014 probably.\u201d \u201cMy idea\u2019s sounding better all the time.\u201d \u201cPlease, Jake. That really bugs me.\u201d \u00a0\u201cWhat does?\u201d \u201cThat you two are so ready to kill each other!\u201d I complained. \u201cIt makes me crazy. Why can\u2019t you both just be civilized?\u201d \u201cIs he ready to kill me?\u201d Jacob asked with a grim smile, unconcerned by my anger. \u201cNot like you seem to be!\u201d I realized I was yelling. \u201cAt least he can be a grown-up about this. He knows that hurting you would hurt me \u2014 and so he never would. You don\u2019t seem to care about that at all!\u201d \u201cYeah, right,\u201d Jacob muttered. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s quite the pacifist.\u201d \u201cUgh!\u201d I ripped my hand out of his and shoved his head away. Then I pulled my knees up to my chest and wrapped my arms tightly around them. I glared out toward the horizon, fuming. Jacob was quiet for a few minutes. Finally, he got up off the ground and sat beside me, putting his arm around my shoulders. I shook it off. \u201cSorry,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI\u2019ll try to behave myself.\u201d I didn\u2019t answer. \u201cDo you still want to hear about Sam?\u201d he offered. I shrugged. \u00a0\u201cLike I said, it\u2019s a long story. And very . . . strange. There\u2019re so many strange things about this new life. I haven\u2019t had time to tell you the half of it. And this thing with Sam \u2014 well, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll even be able to explain it right.\u201d His words pricked my curiosity in spite of my irritation. \u201cI\u2019m listening,\u201d I said stiffly. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the side of his face pull up in a smile. \u201cSam had it so much harder than the rest of us. Because he was the first, and he was alone, and he didn\u2019t have anyone to tell him what was happening. Sam\u2019s grandfather died before he was born, and his father has never been around. There was no one there to recognize the signs. The first time it happened \u2014 the first time he phased \u2014 he thought he\u2019d gone insane. It took him two weeks to calm down enough to change back. \u00a0\u201cThis was before you came to Forks, so you wouldn\u2019t remember. Sam\u2019s mother and Leah Clearwater had the forest rangers searching for him, the police. People thought there had been an accident or something. . . .\u201d \u201cLeah?\u201d I asked, surprised. Leah was Harry\u2019s daughter. Hearing her name sent an automatic surge of pity through me. Harry Clearwater, Charlie\u2019s life-long friend, had died of a heart attack this past spring. His voice changed, became heavier. \u201cYeah. Leah and Sam were high school sweethearts. They started dating when she was just a freshman. She was frantic when he disappeared.\u201d \u201cBut he and Emily \u2014\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll get to that \u2014 it\u2019s part of the story,\u201d he said. He inhaled slowly, and then exhaled in a gust. I supposed it was silly for me to imagine that Sam had never loved anyone before Emily. Most people fall in and out of love many times in their lives. It was just that I\u2019d seen Sam with Emily, and I couldn\u2019t imagine him with someone else. The way he looked at her . . . well, it reminded me of a look I\u2019d seen sometimes in Edward\u2019s eyes \u2014 when he was looking at me. \u00a0\u201cSam came back,\u201d Jacob said, \u201cbut he wouldn\u2019t talk to anyone about where he\u2019d been. Rumors flew \u2014 that he was up to no good, mostly. And then Sam happened to run in to Quil\u2019s grandfather one afternoon when Old Quil Ateara came to visit Mrs. Uley. Sam shook his hand. Old Quil just about had a stroke.\u201d Jacob paused to laugh. \u201cWhy?\u201d Jacob put his hand on my cheek and pulled my face around to look at him \u2014 he was leaning toward me, his face was just a few inches away. His palm burned my skin, like he had a fever. \u00a0\u201cOh, right,\u201d I said. It was uncomfortable, having my face so close to his with his hand hot against my skin. \u201cSam was running a temperature.\u201d Jacob laughed again. \u201cSam\u2019s hand felt like he\u2019d left it sitting on a hot stovetop.\u201d He was so close, I could feel his warm breath. I reached up casually, to take his hand away and free my face, but wound my fingers through his so that I wouldn\u2019t hurt his feelings. He smiled and leaned back, undeceived by my attempt at nonchalance. \u201cSo Mr. Ateara went straight to the other elders,\u201d Jacob went on. \u201cThey were the only ones left who still knew, who remembered. Mr. Ateara, Billy, and Harry had actually seen their grandfathers make the change. When Old Quil told them, they met with Sam secretly and explained. \u201cIt was easier when he understood \u2014 when he wasn\u2019t alone anymore. They knew he wouldn\u2019t be the only one affected by the Cullens\u2019 return\u201d \u2014 he pronounced the name with unconscious bitterness \u2014 \u201cbut no one else was old enough. So Sam waited for the rest of us to join him. . . .\u201d  \u201cThe Cullens had no idea,\u201d I said in a whisper. \u201cThey didn\u2019t think that werewolves still existed here. They didn\u2019t know that coming here would change you.\u201d \u201cIt doesn\u2019t change the fact that it did.\u201d \u201cRemind me not to get on your bad side.\u201d \u201cYou think I should be as forgiving as you are? We can\u2019t all be saints and martyrs.\u201d \u201cGrow up, Jacob.\u201d \u00a0\u201cI wish I could,\u201d he murmured quietly. I stared at him, trying to make sense of his response. \u201cWhat?\u201d Jacob chuckled. \u201cOne of those many strange things I mentioned.\u201d \u201cYou . . . can\u2019t . . . grow up?\u201d I said blankly. \u201cYou\u2019re what? Not . . .aging? Is that a joke?\u201d \u201cNope.\u201d He popped his lips on the P. I felt blood flood my face. Tears \u2014 tears of rage \u2014 filled my eyes. My teeth mashed together with an audible grinding sound. \u201cBella? What did I say?\u201d I was on my feet again, my hands balled up into fists, my whole frame shaking. \u201cYou. Are. Not. Aging,\u201d I growled through my teeth. Jacob tugged my arm gently, trying to make me sit. \u201cNone of us are. What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d \u201cAm I the only one who has to get old? I get older every stinking day!\u201d I nearly shrieked, throwing my hands in the air. Some little part of me recognized that I was throwing a Charlie-esque fit, but that rational part was greatly overshadowed by the irrational part. \u201cDamn it! What kind of world is this? Where\u2019s the justice?\u201d \u201cTake it easy, Bella.\u201d \u201cShut up, Jacob. Just shut up! This is so unfair!\u201d \u201cDid you seriously just stamp your foot? I thought girls only did that on TV.\u201d I growled unimpressively. \u201cIt\u2019s not as bad as you seem to think it is. Sit down and I\u2019ll explain.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll stand.\u201d He rolled his eyes. \u201cOkay. Whatever you want. But listen, Iwill get older . . . someday.\u201d \u201cExplain.\u201d He patted the tree. I glowered for a second, but then sat; my temper had burned out as suddenly as it had flared and I\u2019d calmed down enough to realize that I was making a fool of myself. \u201cWhen we get enough control to quit . . . ,\u201d Jacob said. \u201cWhen we stop phasing for a solid length of time, we age again. It\u2019s not easy.\u201d He shook his head, abruptly doubtful. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna take a really long time to learn that kind of restraint, I think. Even Sam\u2019s not there yet. \u2019Course it doesn\u2019t help that there\u2019s a huge coven of vampires right down the road. We can\u2019t even think about quitting when the tribe needs protectors. But you shouldn\u2019t get all bent out of shape about it, anyway, because I\u2019m already older than you, physically at least.\u201d \u00a0\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d \u201cLook at me, Bells. Do I look sixteen?\u201d I glanced up and down his mammoth frame, trying to be unbiased. \u201cNot exactly, I guess.\u201d \u201cNot at all. Because we reach full growth inside of a few months when the werewolf gene gets triggered. It\u2019s one hell of a growth spurt.\u201d He made a face. \u201cPhysically, I\u2019m probably twenty-five or something. So there\u2019s no need for you to freak out about being too old for me for at least another seven years.\u201d Twenty-five or something.The idea messed with my head. But I remembered that growth spurt \u2014 I remembered watching him shoot up and fill out right before my eyes. I remembered how he would look different from one day to the next. . . . I shook my head, feeling dizzy. \u201cSo, did you want to hear about Sam, or did you want to scream at me some more for things that are out of my control?\u201d I took a deep breath. \u201cSorry. Age is a touchy subject for me. That hit a nerve.\u201d Jacob\u2019s eyes tightened, and he looked as if he were trying to decide how to word something. Since I didn\u2019t want to talk about the truly touchy stuff \u2014 my plans for the future, or treaties that might be broken by said plans, I prompted him. \u201cSo once Sam understood what was going on, once he had Billy and Harry and Mr. Ateara, you said it wasn\u2019t so hard anymore. And, like you also said, there are the cool parts. . . .\u201d I hesitated briefly. \u201cWhy does Sam hate them so much? Why does he wish I would hate them?\u201d Jacob sighed. \u201cThis is the really weird part.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a pro at weird.\u201d \u201cYeah, I know.\u201d He grinned before he continued. \u201cSo, you\u2019re right. Sam knew what was going on, and everything was almost okay. In most ways, his life was back to, well, not normal. But better.\u201d Then Jacob\u2019s expression tightened, like something painful was coming. \u201cSam couldn\u2019t tell Leah. We aren\u2019t supposed to tell anyone who doesn\u2019t have to know. And it wasn\u2019t really safe for him to be around her \u2014 but he cheated, just like I did with you. Leah was furious that he wouldn\u2019t tell her what was going on \u2014 where he\u2019d been, where he went at night, why he was always so exhausted \u2014 but they were working it out. They were trying. They really loved each other.\u201d \u201cDid she find out? Is that what happened?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cNo, that wasn\u2019t the problem. Her cousin, Emily Young, came down from the Makah reservation to visit her one weekend.\u201d I gasped. \u201cEmily is Leah\u2019s cousin?\u201d \u201cSecond cousins. They\u2019re close, though. They were like sisters when they were kids.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s . . . horrible. How could Sam . . . ?\u201d I trailed off, shaking my head. \u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t judge him just yet. Did anyone ever tell you . . . Have you ever heard of imprinting ?\u201d \u201cImprinting?\u201d I repeated the unfamiliar word. \u201cNo. What\u2019s that mean?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s one of those bizarre things we have to deal with. It doesn\u2019t happen to everyone. In fact, it\u2019s the rare exception, not the rule. Sam had heard all the stories by then, the stories we all used to think were legends. He\u2019d heard of imprinting, but he never dreamed . . .\u201d \u201cWhat is it?\u201d I prodded. Jacob\u2019s eyes strayed to the ocean. \u201cSam did love Leah. But when he saw Emily, that didn\u2019t matter anymore. Sometimes . . . we don\u2019t exactly know why . . . we find our mates that way.\u201d His eyes flashed back to me, his face reddening. \u201cI mean . . . our soul mates.\u201d \u00a0\u201cWhat way? Love at first sight?\u201d I snickered. Jacob wasn\u2019t smiling. His dark eyes were critical of my reaction. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit more powerful than that. More absolute.\u201d \u201cSorry,\u201d I muttered. \u201cYou\u2019re serious, aren\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cYeah, I am.\u201d \u201cLove at first sight? But more powerful?\u201d My voice still sounded dubious, and he could hear that. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to explain. It doesn\u2019t matter, anyway.\u201d He shrugged indifferently.  \u00a0\u201cYou wanted to know what happened to Sam to make him hate the vampires for changing him, to make him hate himself. And that\u2019s what happened. He broke Leah\u2019s heart. He went back on every promise he\u2019d ever made her. Every day he has to see the accusation in her eyes, and know that she\u2019s right.\u201d He stopped talking abruptly, as if he\u2019d said something he hadn\u2019t meant to. \u201cHow did Emily deal with this? If she was so close to Leah . . . ?\u201d Sam and Emily were utterly right together, two puzzle pieces, shaped for each other exactly. Still . . . how had Emily gotten past the fact that he\u2019d belonged to someone else? Her sister, almost. \u00a0\u201cShe was real angry, in the beginning. But it\u2019s hard to resist that level of commitment and adoration.\u201d Jacob sighed. \u201cAnd then, Sam could tell her everything. There are no rules that can bind you when you find your other half. You know how she got hurt?\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d The story in Forks was that she was mauled by a bear, but I was in on the secret. Werewolves are unstable, Edward had said.The people near them get hurt. \u201cWell, weirdly enough, that was sort of how they resolved things. Sam was so horrified, so sickened by himself, so full of hate for what he\u2019d done. . . . He would have thrown himself under a bus if it would have made her feel better. He might have anyway, just to escape what he\u2019d done. He was shattered. . . . Then, somehow, she was the one comforting him , and after that. . . .\u201d Jacob didn\u2019t finish his thought, and I sensed the story had gotten too personal to share. \u00a0\u201cPoor Emily,\u201d I whispered. \u201cPoor Sam. Poor Leah. . . .\u201d \u201cYeah, Leah got the worst end of the stick,\u201d he agreed. \u201cShe puts on a brave face. She\u2019s going to be a bridesmaid.\u201d I gazed away, toward the jagged rocks that rose from the ocean like stubby broken-off fingers on the south rim of the harbor, while I tried to make sense of it all. I could feel his eyes on my face, waiting for me to say something.   \u201cDid it happen to you?\u201d I finally asked, still looking away. \u201cThis love-at-first-sight thing?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d he answered briskly. \u201cSam and Jared are the only ones.\u201d \u201cHmm,\u201d I said, trying to sound only politely interested. I was relieved, and I tried to explain my reaction to myself. I decided I was just glad he didn\u2019t claim there was some mystical, wolfy connection between the two of us. Our relationship was confusing enough as it was. I didn\u2019t need any more of the supernatural than I already had to deal with. He was quiet, too, and the silence felt a little awkward. My intuition told me that I didn\u2019t want to hear what he was thinking.   \u00a0\u201cHow did that work out for Jared?\u201d I asked to break the silence. \u201cNo drama there. It was just a girl he\u2019d sat next to in school every day for a year and never looked at twice. And then, after he changed, he saw her again and never looked away. Kim was thrilled. She\u2019d had a huge crush on him. She\u2019d had his last name tacked on to the end of hers all over in her diary.\u201d He laughed mockingly. I frowned. \u201cDid Jared tell you that? He shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d  Jacob bit his lip. \u201cI guess I shouldn\u2019t laugh. It was funny, though.\u201d \u201cSome soul mate.\u201d He sighed. \u201cJared didn\u2019t tell us anything on purpose. I already told you this part, remember?\u201d \u201cOh, yeah. You can hear each other\u2019s thoughts, but only when you\u2019re wolves, right?\u201d \u201cRight. Just like your bloodsucker.\u201d He glowered. \u201cEdward,\u201d I corrected. \u00a0\u201cSure, sure. That\u2019s how come I know so much about how Sam felt. It\u2019s not like he would have told us all that if he\u2019d had a choice. Actually, that\u2019s something we all hate.\u201d The bitterness was abruptly harsh in his voice. \u201cIt\u2019s awful. No privacy, no secrets. Everything you\u2019re ashamed of, laid out for everyone to see.\u201d He shuddered. \u201cIt sounds horrible,\u201d I whispered. \u201cIt is sometimes helpful when we need to coordinate,\u201d he said grudgingly. \u201cOnce in a blue moon, when some bloodsucker crosses into our territory. Laurent was fun. And if the Cullens hadn\u2019t gotten in our way last Saturday . . . ugh!\u201d he groaned. \u201cWe could have had her!\u201d His fists clenched into angry balls. I flinched. As much as I worried about Jasper or Emmett getting hurt, it was nothing like the panic I felt at the idea of Jacob going up against Victoria. Emmett and Jasper were the closest thing to indestructible I could imagine. Jacob was still warm, still comparatively human. Mortal. I thought of Jacob facing Victoria, her brilliant hair blowing around her oddly feline face . . . and shuddered. Jacob looked up at me with a curious expression. \u201cBut isn\u2019t it like that for you all the time? Having him in your head?\u201d  \u201cOh, no. Edward\u2019s never in my head. He only wishes.\u201d Jacob\u2019s expression became confused. \u201cHe can\u2019t hear me,\u201d I explained, my voice a tiny bit smug from old habit. \u201cI\u2019m the only one like that, for him. We don\u2019t know why he can\u2019t.\u201d \u201cWeird,\u201d Jacob said. \u201cYeah.\u201d The smugness faded. \u201cIt probably means there\u2019s something wrong with my brain,\u201d I admitted. \u201cI already knew there was something wrong with your brain,\u201d Jacob muttered. \u201cThanks.\u201d The sun broke through the clouds suddenly, a surprise I hadn\u2019t been expecting, and I had to narrow my eyes against the glare off the water. Everything changed color \u2014 the waves turned from gray to blue, the trees from dull olive to brilliant jade, and the rainbow-hued pebbles glittered like jewels. We squinted for a moment, letting our eyes adjust. There were no sounds besides the hollow roar of the waves that echoed from every side of the sheltered harbor, the soft grinding of the stones against each other under the water\u2019s movement, and the cry of gulls high overhead. It was very peaceful. He settled closer to me, so that he was leaning against my arm. He was so warm. After a minute of this, I shrugged out of my rain jacket. He made a little sound of contentment in the back of his throat, and rested his cheek on the top of my head. I could feel the sun heat my skin \u2014 thought it was not quite as warm as Jacob \u2014 and I wondered idly how long it would take me to burn. Absentmindedly, I twisted my right hand to the side, and watched the sunlight glitter subtly off the scar James had left there. \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d he murmured. \u201cThe sun.\u201d \u201cMmm. It\u2019s nice.\u201d \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d I asked. He chuckled to himself. \u201cI was remembering that moronic movie you took me to. And Mike Newton puking all over everything.\u201d I laughed, too, surprised by how time had changed the memory. It used to be one of stress, of confusion. So much had changed that night. . . . And now I could laugh. It was the last night Jacob and I had had before he\u2019d learned the truth about his heritage. The last human memory. An oddly pleasant memory now. \u201cI miss that,\u201d Jacob said. \u201cThe way it used to be so easy . . . uncomplicated. I\u2019m glad I\u2019ve got a good memory.\u201d He sighed. He felt the sudden tension in my body as his words triggered a memory of my own. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked. \u201cAbout that good memory of yours . . .\u201d I pulled away from him so that I could read his face. At the moment, it was confused. \u201cDo you mind telling me what you were doing Monday morning? You were thinking something that bothered Edward.\u201d Bothered wasn\u2019t quite the word for it, but I wanted an answer, so I thought it was best not to start out too severely. Jacob\u2019s face brightened with understanding, and he laughed. \u201cI was just thinking about you. Didn\u2019t like that much, did he?\u201d \u201cMe? What about me?\u201d Jacob laughed, with a harder edge this time. \u201cI was remembering the way you looked that night Sam found you \u2014 I\u2019ve seen it in his head, and it\u2019s like I was there; that memory has always haunted Sam, you know. And then I remembered how you looked the first time you came to my place. I bet you don\u2019t even realize what a mess you were then, Bella. It was weeks before you started to look human again. And I remembered how you always used to have your arms wrapped around yourself, trying to hold yourself together. . . .\u201d Jacob winced, and then shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to remember how sad you were, and it wasn\u2019t my fault. So I figured it would be harder for him. And I thought he ought to get a look at what he\u2019d done.\u201d I smacked his shoulder. It hurt my hand. \u201cJacob Black, don\u2019t you ever do that again! Promise me you won\u2019t.\u201d \u201cNo way. I haven\u2019t had that much fun in months.\u201d \u201cSo help me, Jake \u2014\u201d \u201cOh, get a grip, Bella. When am I ever going to see him again? Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d I got to my feet, and he caught my hand as I started to walk away. I tried to tug free. \u201cI\u2019m leaving, Jacob.\u201d \u201cNo, don\u2019t go yet,\u201d he protested, his hand tightening around mine. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. And . . . okay, I won\u2019t do it again. Promise.\u201d I sighed. \u201cThanks, Jake.\u201d \u201cCome on, we\u2019ll go back to my house,\u201d he said eagerly. \u00a0\u201cActually, I think I really do need to go. Angela Weber is expecting me, and I know Alice is worried. I don\u2019t want to upset her too much.\u201d \u201cBut you just got here!\u201d \u201cIt feels that way,\u201d I agreed. I glared up at the sun, somehow already directly overhead. How had the time passed so quickly? His eyebrows pulled down over his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll see you again,\u201d he said in a hurt voice. \u201cI\u2019ll come back the next time he\u2019s away,\u201d I promised impulsively. \u201cAway?\u201d Jacob rolled his eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s a nice way to describe what he\u2019s doing. Disgusting parasites.\u201d \u201cIf you can\u2019t be nice, I won\u2019t come back at all!\u201d I threatened, trying to pull my hand free. He refused to let go. \u201cAw, don\u2019t be mad,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cKnee-jerk reaction.\u201d \u201cIf I\u2019m going to try to come back again, you\u2019re going to have to get something straight, okay?\u201d He waited. \u201cSee,\u201d I explained. \u201cI don\u2019t care who\u2019s a vampire and who\u2019s a werewolf. That\u2019s irrelevant. You are Jacob, and he is Edward, and I am Bella. And nothing else matters.\u201d His eyes narrowed slightly. \u201cBut I am a werewolf,\u201d he said unwillingly. \u201cAnd he is a vampire,\u201d he added with obvious revulsion. \u201cAnd I\u2019m a Virgo!\u201d I shouted, exasperated. He raised his eyebrows, measuring my expression with curious eyes. Finally, he shrugged. \u201cIf you can really see it that way . . .\u201d \u201cI can. I do.\u201d   \u201cOkay. Just Bella and Jacob. None of those freaky Virgos here.\u201d He smiled at me, the warm, familiar smile that I had missed so much. I felt the answering smile spread across my face. \u201cI\u2019ve really missed you, Jake,\u201d I admitted impulsively. \u201cMe, too,\u201d his smile widened. His eyes were happy and clear, free for once of the angry bitterness. \u201cMore than you know. Will you come back soon?\u201d \u201cAs soon as I can,\u201d I promised.",

            "en": "7 REPETITION        19. HATE WE MADE OUR FLIGHT WITH SECONDS TO SPARE, AND THEN the true torture began. The plane sat idle on the tarmac while the flight attendants strolled\u2014so casually\u2014up and down the aisle, patting the bags in the overhead compartments to make sure everything fit. The pilots leaned out of the cockpit, chatting with them as they passed. Alice's hand was hard on my shoulder, holding me in my seat while I bounced anxiously up and down. \"It's faster than running,\" she reminded me in a low voice. I just nodded in time with my bouncing. At last the plane rolled lazily from the gate, building speed with a gradual steadiness that tortured me further. I expected some kind of relief when we achieved liftoff, but my \u00a0frenzied impatience didn't lessen. Alice lifted the phone on the back of the seat in front of her before we'd stopped climbing, turning her back on the stewardess who eyed her with disapproval. Something about my expression stopped the stewardess from coming over to protest. I tried to tune out what Alice was murmuring to Jasper; I didn't want to hear the words again, but some slipped through. \"I can't be sure, I keep seeing him do different things, he keeps changing his mind\u2026 A killing spree through the city, attacking the guard, lifting a car over his head in the main square\u2026 mostly things that would expose them\u2014he knows that's the fastest way to force a reaction\u2026\" \"No, you can't.\" Alice's voice dropped till it was nearly inaudible, though I was sitting inches from her. Contrarily, I listened harder. \"Tell Emmett no\u2026 Well, go after Emmett and Rosalie and bring them back\u2026 Think about it, Jasper. If he sees any of us, what do you think he will do?\" She nodded. \"Exactly. I think Bella is the only chance\u2014if there is a chance\u2026 I'll do everything that can be done, but prepare Carlisle; the odds aren't good.\" She laughed then, and there was a catch in her voice. \"I've thought of that\u2026 Yes, I promise.\" Her voice became pleading. \"Don't follow me. I promise, Jasper. One way or another, I'll get out\u2026 And I love you.\" She hung up, and leaned back in her seat with her eyes closed. \"I hate lying to him.\" \"Tell me everything, Alice,\" I begged. \"I don't understand. Why did you tell Jasper to stop Emmett, why can't they come help us?\" \"Two reasons,\" she whispered, her eyes still closed. \"The first I told him. We could try to stop Edward ourselves\u2014if Emmett could get his hands on him, we might be able to stop him long enough to convince him you're alive. But we can't sneak up on Edward. And if he sees us coming for him, he'll just act that much faster. He'll throw a Buick through a wall or something, and the Volturi will take him down. \"That's the second reason of course, the reason I couldn't say to Jasper. Because if they're there and the Volturi kill Edward, they'll fight them. Bella.\" She opened her eyes and stared at me, beseeching. \"If there were any chance we could win\u2026 if there were a way that the four of us could save my brother by fighting for him, maybe it would be different. But we can't, and, Bella, I can't lose Jasper like that.\" I realized why her eyes begged for my understanding. She was protecting Jasper, at our expense, and maybe at Edward's, too. I understood, and I did not think badly of her. I nodded. \"Couldn't Edward hear you, though.'\" I asked. \"Wouldn't he know, as soon as he heard your thoughts, that I was alive, that there was no point to this?\" Not that there was any justification, either way. I still couldn't believe that he was capable of reacting like this. It made no sense! I remembered with painful clarity his words that day on the sofa, while we watched Romeo and Juliet kill themselves, one after the other. I wasn't going to live without you, he'd said, as if it should be such an obvious conclusion. But the words he had spoken in the forest as he'd left me had canceled all that out\u2014forcefully. \"If he were listening,\" she explained. \"But believe it or not, it's possible to lie with your thoughts. If you had died, I would still try to stop him. And I would be thinking 'she's alive, she's alive' as hard as I could.  He knows that.\" I ground my teeth in mute frustration. \"If there were any way to do this without you, Bella, I wouldn't be endangering you like this. It's very wrong of me.\" \"Don't be stupid. I'm the last thing you should be worrying about.\" I shook my head impatiently. \"Tell me what you meant, about hating to lie to Jasper.\" She smiled a grim smile. \"I promised him I would get out before they killed me, too. It's not something I can guarantee\u2014not by a long shot.\" She raised her eyebrows, as if willing me to take the danger more seriously. \"Who are these Volturi?\" I demanded in a whisper. \"What makes them so much more dangerous than Emmett, Jasper, Rosalie, and you?\" It was hard to imagine something scarier than that. She took a deep breath, and then abruptly leveled a dark glance over my shoulder. I turned in time to see the man in the aisle seat looking away as if he wasn't listening to us. He appeared to be a businessman, in a dark suit with a power tie and a laptop on his knees. While I stared at him with irritation, he opened the computer and very conspicuously put headphones on. I leaned closer to Alice. Her lips were at my ears as she breathed the story. \"I was surprised that you recognized the name,\" she said. \"That you understood so immediately what it meant\u2014when I said he was going to Italy. I thought I would have to explain. How much did Edward tell you?\" \"He just said they were an old, powerful family\u2014like royalty. That you didn't antagonize them unless you wanted to\u2026 die,\" I whispered. The last word was hard to choke out. \"You have to understand,\" she said, her voice slower, more measured now. \"We Cullens are unique in more ways than you know. It's\u2026 abnormal for so many of us to live together in peace. It's the same for Tanya's family in the north, and Carlisle speculates that abstaining makes it easier for us to be civilized, to form bonds based on love rather than survival or convenience. Even James's little coven of three was unusually large\u2014and you saw how easily Laurent left them. Our kind travel alone, or in pairs, as a general rule. Carlisle's family is the biggest in existence, as far as I know, with the one exception. The Volturi. \"There were three of them originally, Aro, Caius, and Marcus.\" \"I've seen them,\" I mumbled. \"In the picture in Carlisle's study.\" Alice nodded. \"Two females joined them over time, and the five of them make up the family. I'm not sure, but I suspect that their age is what gives them the ability to live peacefully together. They are well over three thousand years old. Or maybe it's their gifts that give them extra tolerance. Like Edward and I, Aro and Marcus are\u2026 talented.\" She continued before I could ask. \"Or maybe it's just their love of power that binds them together.\u00a0 Royalty is an apt description.\" \"But if there are only five\u2014\" \"Five that make up the family,\" she corrected. \"That doesn't include their guard.\" I took a deep breath. \"That sounds\u2026 serious.\" \"Oh, it is,\" she assured me. \"There were nine members of the guard that were permanent, the last time we heard. Others are more\u2026 transitory. It changes. And many of them are gifted as well\u2014with formidable gifts, gifts that make what I can do look like a parlor trick. The Volturi chose them for their abilities, physical or otherwise.\" I opened my mouth, and then closed it. I didn't think I wanted to know how bad the odds were.  She nodded again, as if she understood exactly what I was thinking. \"They don't get into too many confrontations. No one is stupid enough to mess with them. They stay in their city, leaving only as duty calls.\" \"Duty?\" I wondered. \"Didn't Edward tell you what they do?\" \"No,\" I said, feeling the blank expression on my face. Alice looked over my head again, toward the businessman, and put her wintry lips back to my ear. \"There's a reason he called them royalty\u2026 the ruling class. Over the millennia, they have assumed the position of enforcing our rules\u2014which actually translates to punishing transgressors. They fulfill that duty decisively.\" My eyes popped wide with shock. \"There are rules?\" I asked in a voice that was too loud. \"Shh!\" \"Shouldn't somebody have mentioned this to me earlier?\" I whispered angrily. \"I mean, I wanted to be a\u2026 to be one of you! Shouldn't somebody have explained the rules to me?\" Alice chuckled once at my reaction. \"It's not that complicated, Bella. There's only one core restriction\u2014and if you think about it, you can probably figure it out for yourself.\"  I thought about it. \"Nope, I have no idea.\" She shook her head, disappointed. \"Maybe it's too obvious. We just have to keep our existence a secret.\" \"Oh,\" I mumbled. It was obvious. \"It makes sense, and most of us don't need policing,\" she continued. \"But, after a few centuries, sometimes one of us gets bored. Or crazy. I don\u2019t know. And then the Volturi step in before it can compromise them, or the rest of us.\" \"So Edward\u2026\" \"Is planning to flout that in their own city\u2014the city they've secretly held for three thousand years, since the time of the Etruscans. They are so protective of their city that they don't allow hunting within its walls.\u00a0 Volterra is probably the safest city in the world\u2014from vampire attack at the very least.\" \"But you said they didn't leave. How do they eat?\" \"They don't leave. They bring in their food from the outside, from quite far away sometimes. It gives their guard something to do when they're not out annihilating mavericks. Or protecting Volterra from exposure\u2026\" \"From situations like this one, like Edward,\" I finished her sentence. It was amazingly easy to say his name now. I wasn't sure what the difference was. Maybe because I wasn't really planning on living much longer without seeing him. Or at all, if we were too late. It was comforting to know that I would have an easy out. \"I doubt they've ever had a situation quite like this,\" she muttered, disgusted. \"You don't get a lot of suicidal vampires.\" The sound that escaped out of my mouth was very quiet, but Alice seemed to understand that it was a cry of pain. She wrapped her thin, strong arm around my shoulders. \"We'll do what we can, Bella. It's not over yet.\" \"Not yet.\" I let her comfort me, though I knew she thought our chances were poor. \"And the Volturi will get us if we mess up.\" Alice <em>stiffened</em>. \"You say that like it's a good thing.\" I shrugged. \"Knock it off, Bella, or we're turning around in New York and going back to Forks.\" \"What?\" \"You know what. If we're too late for Edward, I'm going to do my damnedest to get you back to Charlie, and I don't want any trouble from you. Do you understand that?\" \"Sure, Alice.\" She pulled back slightly so that she could glare at me. \"No trouble.\" \"Scout's honor,\" I muttered. She rolled her eyes. \"Let me concentrate, now. I'm trying to see what he's planning.\" She left her arm around me, but let her head fall back against the seat and closed her eyes. She pressed her free hand to the side of her face, rubbing her fingertips against her temple. I watched her in fascination for a long time. Eventually, she became utterly motionless, her face like a stone sculpture. The minutes passed, and if I didn't know better, I would have thought she'd fallen asleep. I didn't dare interrupt her to ask what was going on. I wished there was something safe for me to think about. I couldn't allow myself to consider the horrors we were headed toward, or, more horrific yet, the chance that we might fail\u2014not if I wanted to keep from screaming aloud. I couldn't anticipate anything, either. Maybe, if I were very, very, very lucky, I would somehow be able to save Edward. But I wasn't so stupid as to think that saving him would mean that I could stay with him. I was no different, no more special than I'd been before. There would be no new reason for him to want me now. Seeing him and losing him again\u2026 I fought back against the pain. This was the price I had to pay to save his life. I would pay it.  They showed a movie, and my neighbor got headphones. Sometimes I watched the figures moving across the little screen, but I couldn't even tell if the movie was supposed to be a romance or a horror film. After an eternity, the plane began to descend toward New York City. Alice remained in her trance. I dithered, reaching out to touch her, only to pull my hand back again. This happened a dozen times before the plane touched town with a jarring impact. \"Alice,\" I finally said. \"Alice, we have to go.\" I touched her arm. Her eyes came open very slowly. She shook her head from side to side for a moment. \"Anything new?\" I asked in a low voice, conscious of the man listening on the other side of me. \"Not exactly,\" she breathed in a voice I could barely catch. \"He's getting closer. He's deciding how he's going to ask.\" We had to run for our connection, but that was good\u2014better than having to wait. As soon as the plane was in the air, Alice closed her eyes and slid back into the same stupor as before. I waited as patiently as I could. When it was dark again, I opened the window to stare out into the flat black that was no better than the window shade. I was grateful that I'd had so many months' practice with controlling my thoughts. Instead of dwelling on the terrifying possibilities that, no matter what Alice said, I did not intend to survive, I concentrated on lesser problems. Like, what I was going to say to Charlie if I got back:' That was a thorny enough problem to occupy several hours. And Jacob? He'd promised to wait for me, but did that promise still apply? Would I end up home alone in Forks, with no one at all? Maybe I didn't want to survive, no matter what happened. It felt like seconds later when Alice shook my shoulder\u2014I hadn't realized I'd fallen \u00a0asleep. \"Bella,\" she hissed, her voice a little too loud in the darkened cabin full of sleeping humans. I wasn't disoriented\u2014I hadn't been out long enough for that. \"What's wrong?\" Alice's eyes gleamed in the dim light of a reading lamp in the row behind us. \"It's not wrong.\" She smiled fiercely. \"It's right. They're deliberating, but they've decided to tell him no.\" \"The Volturi?\" I muttered, groggy. \"Of course, Bella, keep up. I can see what they're going to say.\" \"Tell me.\" An attendant tiptoed down the aisle to us. \"Can I get you ladies a pillow?\" His hushed whisper was a rebuke to our comparatively loud conversation. \"No, thank you.\" Alice beamed at up at him, her smile shockingly lovely. The attendant's expression was dazed as he turned and stumbled his way back. \"Tell me,\" I breathed almost silently. She whispered into my ear. \"They're interested in him\u2014they think his talent could be useful. They're going to offer him a place with them.\" \"What will he say?\" \"I can't see that yet, but I'll bet it's colorful.\" She grinned again. \"This is the first good news\u2014the first break. They're intrigued; they truly don't want to destroy him\u2014'wasteful,' that's the word Aro will use\u2014and that may be enough to force him to get creative. The longer he spends on his plans, the better for us.\" It wasn't enough to make me hopeful, to make me feel the relief she obviously felt. There were still so many ways that we could be too late. And if I didn't get through the walls into the Volturi city, I wouldn't be able to stop Alice from dragging me back home. \"Alice?\" \"What?\" \"I'm confused. How are you seeing this so clearly? And then other times, you see things far away\u2014things that don't happen?\" Her eyes tightened. I wondered if she guessed what I was thinking of. \"It's clear because it's immediate and close, and I'm really concentrating. The faraway things that come on their own\u2014those are just glimpses, faint maybes. Plus, I see my kind more easily than yours. Edward is even easier because I'm so attuned to him.\" \"You see me sometimes,\" I reminded her. She shook her head. \"Not as clearly.\" I sighed. \"I really wish you could have been right about me. In the beginning, when you first saw things about me, before we even met\u2026\" \"What do you mean?\" \"You saw me become one of you.\" I barely mouthed the words. She sighed. \"It was a possibility at the time.\" \"At the time,\" I repeated. \"Actually, Bella\u2026\" She hesitated, and then seemed to make a choice. \"Honestly, I think it's all gotten beyond ridiculous. I'm debating whether to just change you myself.\" I stared at her, frozen with shock. Instantly, my mind resisted her words. I couldn't afford that kind of hope if she changed her mind. \"Did I scare you?\" she wondered. \"I thought that's what you wanted.\" \"I do!\" I gasped. \"Oh, Alice, do it now! I could help you so much\u2014and I wouldn't slow you down. Bite me!\" \"Shh,\" she cautioned. The attendant was looking in our direction again. \"Try to be reasonable,\" she whispered. \"We don't have enough time. We have to get into Volterra tomorrow. You'd be writhing in pain for days.\" She made a face. \"And I don't think the other passengers would react well.\" I bit my lip. \"If you don't do it now, you'll change your mind.\" \"No.\" She frowned, her expression unhappy. \"I don't think I will. He'll be furious, but what will he be able to do about it?\" My heart beat faster. \"Nothing at all.\" She laughed quietly, and then sighed. \"You have too much faith in me, Bella. I'm not sure that I can. I'll probably just end up killing you.\" \"I'll take my chances.\" \"You are so bizarre, even for a human.\" \"Thanks.\" \"Oh well, this is purely hypothetical at this point, anyway. First we have to live through tomorrow.\" \"Good point.\" But at least I had something to hope for if we did. If Alice made good on her promise\u2014and if she didn't kill me\u2014then Edward could run after his distractions all he wanted, and I could follow. I wouldn't let him be distracted. Maybe, when I was beautiful and strong, he wouldn't want distractions. \"Go back to sleep,\" she encouraged me. \"I'll wake you up when there's something new.\" \"Right,\" I grumbled, certain that sleep was a lost cause now. Alice pulled her legs up on the seat, wrapping her arms Around them and leaning her forehead against her knees. She rocked back and forth as she concentrated. I rested my head against the seat, watching her, and the next thing I knew, she was snapping the shade closed against the faint brightening in the eastern sky. \"What's happening?\" I mumbled. \"They've told him no,\" she said quietly. I noticed at once that her enthusiasm was gone. My voice choked in my throat with panic. \"What's he going to do?\" \"It was chaotic at first. I was only getting flickers, he was changing plans so quickly.\" \"What kinds of plans?\" I pressed. \"There was a bad hour,\" she whispered. \"He'd decided to go hunting.\" She looked at me, seeing the comprehension in my face. \"In the city,\" she explained. \"It got very close. He changed his mind at the last minute.\" \"He wouldn't want to disappoint Carlisle,\" I mumbled. Not at the end. \"Probably,\" she agreed. \"Will there be enough time?\" As I spoke, there was a shift in the cabin pressure. I could feel the plane angling downward. \"I'm hoping so\u2014if he sticks to his latest decision, maybe.\" \"What is that?\" \"He's going to keep it simple. He's just going to walk out into the sun.\" Just walk out into the sun. That was all. It would be enough. The image of Edward in the meadow\u2014glowing, shimmering like his skin was made of a million diamond facets\u2014was burned into my memory. No human who saw that would ever forget. The Volturi couldn't possibly allow it. Not if they wanted to keep their city inconspicuous. I looked at the slight gray glow that shone through the opened windows. \"We'll be too late,\" I whispered, my throat closing in panic. She shook her head. \"Right now, he's leaning toward the melodramatic. He wants the biggest audience possible, so he'll choose the main plaza, under the clock tower. The walls are high there. He'll wait till the sun is exactly overhead.\" \"So we have till noon?\" \"If we're lucky. If he sticks with this decision.\" The pilot came on over the intercom, announcing, first in French and then in English, our imminent landing. The seat belt lights dinged and flashed. \"How far is it from Florence to Volterra?\" \"That depends on how fast you drive\u2026 Bella?\" \"Yes?\" She eyed me speculatively. \"How strongly are you opposed to grand theft auto?\" A bright yellow Porsche screamed to a stop a few feet in front of where I paced, the word TURBO scrawled in silver cursive across its back. Everyone beside me on the crowded airport sidewalk stared. \"Hurry, Bella!\" Alice shouted impatiently through the open passenger window. I ran to the door and threw myself in, feeling as though I might as well be wearing a black stocking over my head. \"Sheesh, Alice,\" I complained. \"Could you pick a more conspicuous car to steal?\" The interior was black leather, and the windows were tinted dark. It felt safer inside, like nighttime. Alice was already weaving, too fast, through the thick airport traffic\u2014sliding through tiny spaces between the cars as I cringed and fumbled for my seat belt. \"The important question,\" she corrected, \"is whether I could have stolen a faster car, and I don't think so. I got lucky.\" \"I'm sure that will be very comforting at the roadblock.\" She trilled a laugh. \"Trust me, Bella. If anyone sets up a roadblock, it will be behind us.\" She hit the gas then, as if to prove her point. I probably should have watched out the window as first the city of Florence and then the Tuscan landscape flashed past with blurring speed. This was my first trip anywhere, and maybe my last, too. But Alice's driving frightened me, despite the fact that I knew I could trust her behind the wheel. And I was too tortured with anxiety to really see the hills or the walled towns that looked like castles in the distance. \"Do you see anything more?\" \"There's something going on,\" Alice muttered. \"Some kind of festival. The streets are full of people and red flags. What's the date today?\" I wasn't entirely sure. \"The nineteenth, maybe?\" \"Well, that's ironic. It's Saint Marcus Day.\" \"Which means?\" She chuckled darkly. \"The city holds a celebration every year. As the legend goes, a Christian missionary, a Father Marcus\u2014Marcus of the Voltun, in fact\u2014drove all the vampires from Volterra fifteen hundred years ago. The story claims he was martyred in Romania, still trying to drive away the vampire scourge. Of course that's nonsense\u2014he's never left the city. But that's where some of the superstitions about things like crosses and garlic come from. Father Marcus used them so successfully. And vampires don't trouble Volterra, so they must work.\" Her smile was sardonic. \"It's become more of a celebration of the city, and recognition for the police force\u2014after all, Volterra is an amazingly safe city. The police get the credit.\" I was realizing what she meant when she'd said ironic. \"They're not going to be very happy if Edward messes things up for them on St. Marcus Day, are they?\" She shook her head, her expression grim. \"No. They'll act very quickly.\" I looked away, fighting against my teeth as they tried to break through the skin of my lower lip. Bleeding was not the best idea right now. The sun was terrifyingly high in the pale blue sky. \"He's still planning on noon?\" I checked. \"Yes. He's decided to wait. And they're waiting for him.\" \"Tell me what I have to do.\" She kept her eyes on the winding road\u2014the needle on the speedometer was touching the far right on the dial. \"You don't have to do anything. He just has to see you before he moves into the light. And he has to see you before he sees me.\" \"How are we going to work that?\" A small red car seemed to be racing backward as Alice zoomed Around it. \"I'm going to get you as close as possible, and then you're going to run in the direction I point you.\" I nodded. \"Try not to trip,\" she added. \"We don't have time for a concussion today.\" I groaned. That would be just like me\u2014ruin everything, destroy the world, in a moment of klutziness. The sun continued to climb in the sky while Alice raced against it. It was too bright:, and that had me panicking. Maybe he wouldn't feel the need to wait for noon after all. \"There,\" Alice said abruptly, pointing to the castle city atop the closest hill. I stared at it, feeling the very first hint of a new kind of fear. Every minute since yesterday morning\u2014it seemed like a week ago\u2014when Alice had spoken his name at the foot of the stairs, there had been only one fear. And yet, now, as I stared at the ancient sienna walls and towers crowning the peak of the steep hill, I felt another, more selfish kind of dread thrill through me. I supposed the city was very beautiful. It absolutely terrified me. \"Volterra,\" Alice announced in a flat, icy voice.",

            "en": "7 REPETITION         17. VISITOR UNNATURALLY STILL AND WHITE, WITH LARGE BLACK EYES intent on my face, my visitor waited perfectly motionless in the center of the hall, beautiful beyond imagining. My knees trembled for a second, and I nearly fell. Then I hurled myself at her. \"Alice, oh, Alice!\" I cried, as I slammed into her. I'd forgotten how hard she was; it was like running headlong into a wall of cement. \"Bella?\" There was a strange mingling of relief and confusion in her voice. I locked my arms around her, gasping to inhale as much of the scent of her skin as possible. It wasn't like anything else\u2014not floral or spice, citrus or musk. No perfume in the world could compare. My memory hadn't done it justice. I didn't notice when the gasping turned into something else\u2014I only realized I was sobbing when Alice dragged me to the living room couch and pulled me into her lap. It was like curling up into a cool stone, but a stone that was contoured comfortingly to the shape of my body. She rubbed my back in a gentle rhythm, waiting for me to get control of myself. \"I'm\u2026 sorry,\" I blubbered. \"I'm just\u2026 so happy\u2026 to see you!\" \"It's okay, Bella. Everything's okay.\" \"Yes,\" I bawled. And, for once, it seemed that way. Alice sighed. \"I'd forgotten how exuberant you are,\" she said, and her tone was disapproving. I looked up at her through my streaming eyes. Alice's neck was tight, straining away from me, her lips pressed together firmly. Her eyes were black as pitch. \"Oh,\" I puffed, as I realized the problem. She was thirsty. And I smelled appetizing. It had been a while since I'd had to think about that kind of thing. \"Sorry.\" \"It's my own fault. It's been too long since I hunted. I shouldn't let myself get so thirsty. But I was in a hurry today.\" The look she directed at me then was a glare. \"Speaking of which, would you like to explain to me how you're alive?\" That brought me up short and stopped the sobs. I realized what must have happened immediately, and why Alice was here. I swallowed loudly. \"You saw me fall.\" \"No,\" she disagreed, her eyes narrowing. \"I saw you jump.\" I pursed my lips as I tried to think of an explanation that wouldn't sound nuts. Alice shook her head. \"I told him this would happen, but he didn't believe me. 'Bella promised,'\" her voice imitated his so perfectly that I froze in shock while the pain ripped through my torso. \"'Don't be looking for her future, either,'\" she continued to quote him. '\"We've done enough damage.\" \"But just because I'm not looking, doesn't mean I don't see\" she went on. \"I wasn't \u00a0keeping tabs on you,\u00a0 I swear, Bella. It's just that I'm already attuned to you\u2026 when I saw you jumping, I didn't think, I just got on a plane. I knew I would be too late, but I couldn't do nothing. And then I get here, thinking maybe I could help Charlie somehow, and you drive up.\" She shook her head, this time in confusion. Her voice was strained. \"I saw you go into the water and I waited and waited for you to come up, but you didn't. \u00a0\u00a0What happened? And how could you do that to Charlie? Did you stop to think what this would do to him? And my brother? Do you have any idea what Edward\u2014\" I cut her off then, as soon as she said his name. I'd let her go on, even after I realized the misunderstanding she was under, just to hear the perfect bell tone of her voice. But it was time to interrupt. \"Alice, I wasn't committing suicide.\" She eyed me dubiously. \"Are you saying you didn't jump off a cliff?\" \"No, but\u2026\" I grimaced. \"It was for recreational purposes only.\" Her expression hardened. \"I'd seen some of Jacob's friends cliff diving,\" I insisted. \"It looked like\u2026 fun, and I was bored\u2026\" She waited. \"I didn't think about how the storm would affect the currents. Actually, I didn't think about the water much at all.\" Alice didn't buy it. I could see that she still thought I had been trying to kill myself. I decided to redirect. \"So if you saw me go in, why didn't you see Jacob?\" She cocked her head to the side, distracted. I continued. \"It's true that I probably would have drowned if Jacob hadn't jumped in after me. Well, okay, there's no probably about it. But he did, and he pulled me out, and I guess he towed me back to shore, though I was kind of out for that part. It couldn't have been more than a minute that I was under before he grabbed me. How come you didn't see that?\" She frowned in perplexity. \"Someone pulled you out?\" \"Yes. Jacob saved me.\" I watched curiously as an enigmatic range of emotions flitted across her face. Something was bothering her\u2014her imperfect vision? But I wasn't sure. Then she deliberately leaned in and sniffed my shoulder. I froze. \"Don't be ridiculous,\" she muttered, sniffing at me some more. \"What are you doing?\" She ignored my question. \"Who was with you out there just now? It sounded like you were arguing.\" \"Jacob Black. He's\u2026 sort of my best friend, I guess. At least, he was\u2026\" I thought of Jacob's angry, betrayed face, and wondered what he was to me now. Alice nodded, seeming preoccupied. \"What?\" \"I don't know,\" she said. \"I'm not sure what it means.\" \"Well, I'm not dead, at least.\" She rolled her eyes. \"He was a fool to think you could survive alone. I've never seen anyone so prone to life-threatening idiocy.\" \"I survived,\" I pointed out. She was thinking of something else. \"So, if the currents were too much for you, how did this Jacob manage?\" \"Jacob is\u2026 strong.\" She heard the reluctance in my voice, and her eyebrows rose. I gnawed on my lip for a second. Was this a secret, or not? And if it was, then who was my greatest allegiance to? Jacob, or Alice? It was too hard to keep secrets, I decided. Jacob knew everything, why not Alice, too? \"See, well, he's\u2026 sort of a werewolf,\" I admitted in a rush. \"The Quileutes turn into \u00a0wolves when there are vampires around. They know Carlisle from a long time ago. Were you with Carlisle back then?\" Alice gawked at me for a moment, and then recovered herself, blinking rapidly. \"Well, I guess that explains the smell,\" she muttered. \"But does it explain what I didn't see?\" She frowned, her porcelain forehead creasing. \"The smell?\" I repeated. \"You smell awful,\" she said absently, still frowning. \"A werewolf? Are you sure about that?\"  \"Very sure,\" I promised, wincing as I remembered Paul and Jacob fighting in the road. \"I guess you weren't with Carlisle the last time there were werewolves here in Forks?\" \"No. I hadn't found him yet.\" Alice was still lost in thought. Suddenly, her eyes widened, and she turned to stare at me with a shocked expression. \"Your best friend is a \u00a0werewolf?\" I nodded sheepishly. \"How long has this been going on?\" \"Not long,\" I said, my voice sounding defensive. \"He's only been a werewolf for just a few weeks.\" She glowered at me. \"A young werewolf? Even worse! Edward was right\u2014you're a magnet for danger. Weren't you supposed to be staying out of trouble?\" \"There's nothing wrong with werewolves,\" I grumbled, stung by her critical tone. \"Until they lose their tempers.\" She shook her head sharply from side to side. \"Leave it to you, Bella.  Anyone else would be better off when the vampires left town. But you have to start hanging out with the first monsters you can find.\" I didn't want to argue with Alice\u2014I was still trembling with joy that she was really, truly here, that I could touch her marble skin and hear her wind-chime voice\u2014but she had it all wrong. \"No, Alice, the vampires didn't really leave\u2014not all of them, anyway. That's the whole trouble. If it weren't for the werewolves, Victoria would have gotten me by now. Well, if it weren't for Jake and his friends, Laurent would have gotten me before she could, I guess, so\u2014\" \"Victoria?\" she hissed. \"Laurent?\" I nodded, a teensy bit alarmed by the expression in her black eyes. I pointed at my chest. \"Danger magnet, remember?\" She shook her head again. \"Tell me everything\u2014start at the beginning.\" I glossed over the beginning, skipping the motorcycles and the voices, but telling her everything else right up to today's misadventure. Alice didn't like my thin explanation about boredom and the cliffs, so I hurried on to the strange flame I'd seen on the water and what I thought it meant. Her eyes narrowed almost to slits at that part. It was strange to see her look so\u2026 so dangerous\u2014like a vampire. I swallowed hard and went on with the rest about Harry. She listened to my story without interrupting. Occasionally, she would shake her head, and the crease in her forehead deepened until it looked like it was carved permanently into the marble of her skin. She didn't speak and, finally, I fell quiet, struck again by the borrowed grief at Harry's passing. I thought of Charlie; he would be home soon. What condition would he be in? \"Our leaving didn't do you any good at all, did it?\" Alice murmured. I laughed once\u2014it was a slightly hysterical sound. \"That was never the point, though, was it? It's not like you left for my benefit.\" Alice scowled at the floor for a moment. \"Well\u2026 I guess I acted impulsively today. I probably shouldn't have intruded.\" I could feel the blood draining from my face. My stomach dropped. \"Don't go, Alice,\" I whispered. My fingers locked around the collar of her white shirt and I began to hyperventilate. \"Please don't leave me.\" Her eyes opened wider. \"All right,\" she said, enunciating each word with slow precision. \"I'm not going anywhere tonight. Take a deep breath.\" I tried to obey, though I couldn't quite locate my lungs. She watched my face while I concentrated on my breathing. She waited till I was calmer to comment.  \"You look like hell, Bella.\" \"I drowned today,\" I reminded her. \"It goes deeper than that. You're a mess.\" I flinched. \"Look, I'm doing my best.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"It hasn't been easy. I'm working on it.\" She frowned. \"I told him,\" she said to herself. \"Alice,\" I sighed. \"What did you think you were going to find? I mean, besides me dead? Did you expect to find me skipping around and whistling show tunes? You know me better than that.\" \"I do. But I hoped.\" \"Then I guess I don't have the corner on the idiocy market.\" The phone rang. \"That has to be Charlie,\" I said, staggering to my feet. I grabbed Alice's stone hand and dragged her with me to the kitchen. I wasn't about to let her out of my sight. \"Charlie?\" I answered the phone. \"No, it's me,\" Jacob said. \"Jake!\" Alice scrutinized my expression. \"Just making sure you were still alive,\" Jacob said sourly. \"I'm fine. I told you that it wasn't\u2014\" \"Yeah. I got it. 'Bye.\" Jacob hung up on me. I sighed and let my head hang back, staring at the ceiling. \"That's going to be a problem.\" Alice squeezed my hand. \"They aren't excited I'm here.\" \"Not especially. But it's none of their business anyway.\" Alice put her arm around me. \"So what do we do now?\" she mused. She seemed to talk to herself for a moment. \"Things to do. Loose ends to tie.\" \"What things to do?\" Her face was suddenly careful. \"I don't know for sure\u2026 I need to see Carlisle.\" Would she leave so soon? My stomach dropped. \"Could you stay?\" I begged. \"Please? For just a little while. I've missed you so much.\" My voice broke. \"If you think that's a good idea.\" Her eyes were unhappy. \"I do. You can stay here\u2014Charlie would love that.\" \"I have a house, Bella.\" I nodded, disappointed but resigned. She hesitated, studying me. \"Well, I need to go get a suitcase of clothes, at the very least.\" I threw my arms around her. \"Alice, you're the best!\" \"And I think I'll need to hunt. Immediately,\" she added in a strained voice. \"Oops.\" I took a step back. \"Can you stay out of trouble for one hour?\" she asked skeptically. Then, before I could \u00a0answer, she held up one finger and closed her eyes. Her face went smooth and blank for a few seconds. And then her eyes opened and she answered her own question. \"Yes, you'll be fine. For tonight, anyway.\" She grimaced. Even making faces, she looked like an angel. \"You'll come back?\" I asked in a small voice. \"I promise\u2014one hour.\" I glanced at the clock over the kitchen table. She laughed and leaned in quickly to kiss me on the cheek. Then she was gone. I took a deep breath. Alice would be back. I suddenly felt so much better. I had plenty to do to keep myself busy while I waited. A shower was definitely first on the agenda. I sniffed my shoulders as I undressed, but I couldn't smell anything but the brine and seaweed scent of the ocean. I wondered what Alice had meant about me smelling bad. When I was cleaned up, I went back to the kitchen. I couldn't see any signs that Charlie had eaten recently, and he would probably be hungry when he got back. I hummed tunelessly to myself as I moved around the kitchen. While Thursday's casserole rotated in the microwave, I made up the couch with sheets and an old pillow. Alice wouldn't need it, but Charlie would need to see it. I was careful not to watch the clock. There was no reason to start myself panicking; Alice had promised. I hurried through my dinner, not tasting it\u2014just feeling the ache as it slid down my raw throat. Mostly I was thirsty; I must have drunk a half gallon of water by the time I was finished. All the salt in my system had dehydrated me. I went to go try to watch TV while I waited. Alice was already there, sitting on her improvised bed. Her eyes were a liquid butterscotch. She smiled and patted the pillow. \"Thanks.\" \"You're early,\" I said, elated. I sat down next to her and leaned my head on her shoulder. She put her cold arms around me and sighed. \"Bella. What are we going to do with you?\" \"I don't know,\" I admitted. \"I really have been trying my hardest.\" \"I believe you.\" It was silent. \"Does\u2014does he\u2026\" I took a deep breath. It was harder to say his name out loud, even though I was able to think it now. \"Does Edward know you're here?\" I couldn't help asking. It was my pain, after all. I'd deal with it when she was gone, I promised myself, and felt sick at the thought. \"No.\" There was only one way that could be true. \"He's not with Carlisle and Esme?\" \"He checks in every few months.\" \"Oh.\" He must still be out enjoying his distractions. I focused my curiosity on a safer topic. \"You said you flew here\u2026 Where did you come from?\" \"I was in Denali. Visiting Tanya's family.\" \"Is Jasper here? Did he come with your'\" She shook her head. \"He didn't approve of my interfering. We promised\u2026\" she trailed off, and then her tone changed. \"And you think Charlie won't mind my being here?\" she asked, sounding worried. \"Charlie thinks you're wonderful, Alice.\" \"Well, we're about to find out.\" Sure enough, a few seconds later I heard the cruiser pull into the driveway. I jumped up and hurried to open the door. Charlie trudged slowly up the walk, his eyes on the ground and his shoulders slumped. I walked forward to meet him; he didn't even see me until I hugged him around the waist. He embraced me back fiercely. \"I'm so sorry about Harry, Dad.\" \"I'm really going to miss him,\" Charlie mumbled. \"How's Sue doing?\" \"She seems dazed, like she hasn't grasped it yet. Sam's staying with her\u2026\" The volume of his voice faded in and out. \"Those poor kids. Leah's just a year older than you, and Seth is only fourteen\u2026\" He shook his head. He kept his arms tight around me as he started toward the door again. \"Um, Dad?\" I figured I'd better warn him. \"You'll never guess who's here.\" He looked at me blankly. His head swiveled around, and he spied the Mercedes across the street, the porch light reflecting off the glossy black paint. Before he could react, Alice was in the doorway. \"Hi, Charlie,\" she said in a subdued voice. \"I'm sorry I came at such a bad time.\" \"Alice Cullen?\" he peered at the slight figure in front of him as if he doubted what his eyes were telling him. \"Alice, is that you?\" \"It's me,\" she confirmed. \"I was in the neighborhood.\" \"Is Carlisle\u2026?\" \"No, I'm alone.\" Both Alice and I knew he wasn't really asking about Carlisle. His arm tightened over my shoulder. \"She can stay here, can't she?\" I pleaded. \"I already asked her.\" \"Of course,\" Charlie said mechanically. \"We'd love to have you, Alice.\" \"Thank you, Charlie. I know it's horrid timing.\" \"No, it's fine, really. I'm going to be really busy doing what I can for Harry's family; it will be nice for Bella to have some company.\" \"There's dinner for you on the table, Dad,\" I told him. \"Thanks, Bell.\" He gave me one more squeeze before he shuffled toward the kitchen. Alice went back to the couch, and I followed her. This time, she was the one to pull me against her shoulder. \"You look tired.\" \"Yeah,\" I agreed, and shrugged. \"Near-death experiences do that to me\u2026 So, what does Carlisle think of you being here?\" \"He doesn't know. He and Esme were on a hunting trip. I'll hear from him in a few days, when he gets back.\" \"You won't tell him, though\u2026 when he checks in again?\" I asked. She knew I didn't mean Carlisle now. \"No. He'd bite my head off,\" Alice said grimly. I laughed once, and then sighed. I didn't want to sleep. I wanted to stay up all night talking to Alice. And it didn't make sense for me to be tired, what with crashing on Jacob's couch all day. But drowning really had taken a lot out of me, and my eyes wouldn't stay open. I rested my head on her stone shoulder, and drifted into a more peaceful oblivion than I had any hope of. I woke early, from a deep and dreamless sleep, feeling well-rested, but stiff. I was on the couch tucked under the blankets I'd laid out for Alice, and I could hear her and Charlie talking in the kitchen. It sounded like Charlie was fixing her breakfast. \"How bad was it, Charlie?\" Alice asked softly, and at first I thought they were talking about the Clear waters. Charlie sighed. \"Real bad.\" \"Tell me about it. I want to know exactly what happened when we left.\" There was a pause while a cupboard door was closed and a dial on the stove was clicked off. I waited, cringing. \"I've never felt so helpless,\" Charlie began slowly. \"I didn't know what to do. That first week\u2014I thought I was going to have to hospitalize her. She wouldn't eat or drink, she wouldn't move. Dr. Gerandy was throwing around words like 'catatonic,' but I didn't let him up to see her. I was afraid it would scare her.\" \"She snapped out of it though?\" \"I had Renee come to take her to Florida. I just didn't want to be the one\u2026 if she had to go to a hospital or something. I hoped being with her mother would help. But when we started packing her clothes, she woke up with a vengeance. I've never seen Bella throw a fit like that. She was never one for the tantrums, but, boy, did she fly into a fury. She threw her clothes everywhere and screamed that we couldn't make her leave\u2014and then she finally started crying. I thought that would be the turning point. I didn't argue when she insisted on staying here\u2026 and she did seem to get better at first\u2026\" Charlie trailed off. It was hard listening to this, knowing how much pain I'd caused him. \"But?\" Alice prompted. \"She went back to school and work, she ate and slept and did her homework. She answered when someone asked her a direct question. But she was\u2026 empty. Her eyes were blank. There were lots of little things\u2014she wouldn't listen to music anymore; I found a bunch of CDs broken in the trash. She didn't read; she wouldn't be in the same room when the TV was on, not that she watched it so much before. I finally figured it out\u2014she was avoiding everything that might remind her of\u2026 him. \"We could hardly talk; I was so worried about saying something that would upset her\u2014the littlest things would make her flinch\u2014and she never volunteered anything. She would just answer if I asked her something. \"She was alone all the time. She didn't call her friends back, and after a while, they stopped calling. \"It was night of the living dead around here. I still hear her screaming in her sleep\u2026\" I could almost see him shuddering. I shuddered, too, remembering. And then I sighed. I hadn't fooled him at all, not for one second. \"I'm so sorry, Charlie,\" Alice said, voice glum. \"It's not your fault.\" The way he said it made it perfectly clear that he was holding someone responsible. \"You were always a good friend to her.\" \"She seems better now, though.\" \"Yeah. Ever since she started hanging out with Jacob Black, I've noticed a real improvement. She has some color in her cheeks when she comes home, some light in her eyes. She's happier.\" He paused, and his voice was different when he spoke again. \"He's a year or so younger than her, and I know she used to think of him as a friend, but I think maybe it's something more now, or headed that direction, anyway.\" Charlie said this in a tone that was almost belligerent. It was a warning, not for Alice, but for her to pass along. \"Jake's old for his years,\" he continued, still sounding defensive. \"He's taken care of his father physically the way Bella took care of her mother \u00a0emotionally. It matured him. He's a good-looking kid, too\u2014takes after his mom's side. He's good for Bella, you know,\" Charlie insisted.  \"Then it's good she has him,\" Alice agreed. Charlie sighed out a big gust of air, folding quickly to the lack of opposition. \"Okay, so I guess that's overstating things. I don't know\u2026 even with Jacob, now and then I see something in her eyes, and I wonder if I've ever grasped how much pain she's really in It's not normal, Alice, and it\u2026 it frightens me. Not normal at all. Not like someone\u2026 left her, but like someone died.\" His voice cracked. It was like someone had died\u2014like I had died. Because it had been more than just losing the truest of true loves, as if that were not enough to kill anyone. It was also losing a whole future, a whole family\u2014the whole life that I'd chosen\u2026 Charlie went on in a hopeless tone. \"I don't know if she's going to get over it\u2014I'm not sure if it's in her nature to heal from something like this. She's always been such a constant little thing. She doesn't get past things, change her mind.\" \"She's one of a kind,\" Alice agreed in a dry voice. \"And Alice\u2026\" Charlie hesitated. \"Now, you know how fond I am of you, and I can tell that she's happy to see you, but\u2026 I'm a little worried about what your visit will do to her.\" \"So am I, Charlie, so am I. I wouldn't have come if I'd had any idea. I'm sorry.\" \"Don't apologize, honey. Who knows? Maybe it will be good for her.\" \"I hope you're right.\" There was a long break while forks scraped plates and Charlie chewed. I wondered where Alice was hiding the food. \"Alice, I have to ask you something,\" Charlie said awkwardly. Alice was calm. \"Go ahead.\" \"He's not coming back to visit, too, is he?\" I could hear the suppressed anger in Charlie's voice. Alice answered in a soft, reassuring tone. \"He doesn't even know I'm here. The last time I spoke with him, he was in South America.\" I <em>stiffened</em> as I heard this new information, and listened harder. \"That's something, at least.\" Charlie snorted. \"Well, I hope he's enjoying himself.\" For the first time, Alice's voice had a bit of steel in it. \"I wouldn't make assumptions, Charlie.\" I knew how her eyes would flash when she used that tone. A chair scooted from the table, scraping loudly across the floor. I pictured Charlie getting up; there was no way Alice would make that kind of noise. The faucet ran, splashing against a dish. It didn't sound like they were going to say anything more about Edward, so I decided it was time to wake up. I turned over, bouncing against the springs to make them squeak. Then I yawned loudly. All was quiet in the kitchen. I stretched and groaned. \"Alice?\" I asked innocently; the soreness rasping in my throat added nicely to the charade. \"I'm in the kitchen, Bella,\" Alice called, no hint in her voice that she suspected my eavesdropping. But she was good at hiding things like that. Charlie had to leave then\u2014he was helping Sue Clearwater with the funeral arrangements. It would have been a very long day without Alice. She never spoke about leaving, and I didn't ask her. I knew it was inevitable, but I put it out of my mind. Instead, we talked about her family\u2014all but one. Carlisle was working nights in Ithaca and teaching part time at Cornell. Esme was restoring a seventeenth century house, a historical monument, in the forest north of the city. Emmett and Rosalie had gone to Europe for a few months on another honeymoon, but they were back now. Jasper was at Cornell, too, studying philosophy this time. And Alice had been doing some personal research, concerning the information I'd accidentally uncovered for her last spring. She'd successfully tracked down the asylum where she'd spent the last years of her human life. The life she had no memory of. \"My name was Mary Alice Brandon,\" she told me quietly. \"I had a little sister named Cynthia. Her daughter\u2014my niece\u2014is still alive in Biloxi.\" \"Did you find out why they put you in\u2026 that place?\" What would drive parents to that extreme? Even if their daughter saw visions of the future\u2026 She just shook her head, her topaz eyes thoughtful. \"I couldn't find much about them. I went through all the old newspapers on microfiche. My family wasn't mentioned often; they weren't part of the social circle that made the papers. My parents' engagement was there, and Cynthia's.\" The name fell uncertainly from her tongue. \"My birth was announced\u2026 and my death. I found my grave. I also filched my admissions sheet from the old asylum archives. The date on the admission and the date on my tombstone are the same.\" I didn't know what to say, and, after a short pause, Alice moved on to lighter topics. The Cullens were reassembled now, with the one exception, spending Cornell's spring break in Denali with Tanya and her family. I listened too eagerly to even the most trivial news. She never mentioned the one I was most interested in, and for that I was grateful. It was enough to listen to the stories of the family I'd once dreamed of belonging to. Charlie didn't get back until after dark, and he looked more worn than he had the night before. He would be headed back to the reservation first thing in the morning for Harry's funeral, so he turned in early. I stayed on the couch with Alice again. Charlie was almost a stranger when he came down the stairs before the sun was up, wearing an old suit I'd never seen him in before. The jacket hung open; I guessed it was too tight to fasten the buttons. His tie was a bit wide for the current style. He tiptoed to the door, trying not to wake us up. I let him go, pretending to sleep, as Alice did on the recliner. As soon as he was out the door, Alice sat up. Under the quilt, she was fully dressed. \"So, what are we doing today?\" she asked. \"I don't know\u2014do you see anything interesting happening?\" She smiled and shook her head. \"But it's still early.\" All the time I'd been spending in La Push meant a pile of things I'd been neglecting at home, and I decided to catch up on my chores. I wanted to do something, anything that might make life easier for Charlie\u2014maybe it would make him feel just a little better to come home to a clean, organized house. I started with the bathroom\u2014it showed the most signs of neglect. While I worked, Alice leaned against the doorjamb and asked nonchalant questions about my, well, our high school friends and what they been up to since she'd left. Her face stayed casual and emotionless, but I sensed her disapproval when she realized how little I could tell her. Or maybe I just had a guilty conscience after eavesdropping on her conversation with Charlie yesterday morning. I was literally up to my elbows in Comet, scrubbing the floor of the bathtub, when the doorbell rang. I looked to Alice at once, and her expression was perplexed, almost worried, which was strange; Alice was never taken by surprise. \"Hold on!\" I shouted in the general direction of the front door, getting up and hurrying to the sink to rinse my arms off. \"Bella,\" Alice said with a trace of frustration in her voice, \"I have a fairly good guess who that might be, and I think I'd better step out.\" \"Guess?\" I echoed. Since when did Alice have to guess anything? \"If this is a repeat of my egregious lapse in foresight yesterday, then it's most likely Jacob Black or one of his\u2026 friends.\" I stared at her, putting it together. \"You can't see werewolves?\" She grimaced. \"So it would seem.\" She was obviously annoyed by this fact\u2014very annoyed. The doorbell rang again\u2014buzzing twice quickly and impatiently. \"You don't have go anywhere, Alice. You were here first.\" She laughed her silvery little laugh\u2014it had a dark edge. \"Trust me\u2014it wouldn't be a good idea to have me and Jacob Black in a room together.\" She kissed my cheek swiftly before she vanished through Charlie's door\u2014and out his back window, no doubt. The doorbell rang again.",

            "en": "7 REPETITION          14. FAMILY I COWERED INTO JACOB'S SIDE, MY EYES SCANNING the forest for the other werewolves. When they appeared, striding out from between the trees, they weren't what I was expecting. I'd gotten the image of the wolves stuck in my head. These were just four really big half-naked boys. Again, they reminded me of brothers, quadruplets. Something about the way they moved almost in synchronization to stand across the road from us, the way they all had the same long, round muscles under the same red-brown skin, the same cropped black hair, and the way their expressions altered at exactly the same moment. They started out curious and cautious. When they saw me there, half-hidden beside Jacob, they all became furious in the same second. Sam was still the biggest, though Jacob was getting close to catching up with him. Sam didn't really count as a boy. His face was older\u2014not in the sense of lines or signs of aging, but in the maturity, the patience of his expression. \"What have you done, Jacob?\" he demanded. One of the others, one I didn't recognize\u2014Jared or Paul\u2014thrust past Sam and spoke before Jacob could defend himself. \"Why can't you just follow the rules, Jacob?\" he yelled, throwing his arms in the air. \"What the hell are you thinking? Is she more important than everything\u2014than the whole tribe? Than the people getting killed?\" \"She can help,\" Jacob said quietly. \"Help!\" the angry boy shouted. His arms begin to quiver. \"Oh, that's likely! I'm sure the leech-lover is just dying to help us out!\" \"Don't talk about her like that!\" Jacob shouted back, stung by the boy's criticism. A shudder rippled through the other boy, along his shoulders and down his spine. \"Paul! Relax!\" Sam commanded. Paul shook his head back and forth, not in defiance, but as though he were trying to concentrate. \"Jeez, Paul,\" one of the other boys\u2014probably Jared\u2014muttered. \"Get a grip.\" Paul twisted his head toward Jared, his lips curling back in irritation. Then he shifted his glare in my direction. Jacob took a step to put himself in front of me. That did it. \"Right, protect her!\" Paul roared in outrage. Another shudder, a convulsion, heaved through his body. He threw his head back, a real growl tearing from between his teeth. \"Paul!\" Sam and Jacob shouted together. Paul seemed to fall forward, vibrating violently. Halfway to the ground, there was a loud ripping noise, and the boy exploded. Dark silver fur blew out from the boy, coalescing into a shape more than five-times his size\u2014a massive, crouched shape, ready to spring. The wolf's muzzle wrinkled back over his teeth, and another growl rolled through his colossal chest. His dark, enraged eyes focused on me. In the same second, Jacob was running across the road straight for the monster. \"Jacob!\" I screamed. Mid-stride, a long tremor shivered down Jacob's spine. He leaped forward, diving headfirst into the empty air. With another sharp tearing sound, Jacob exploded, too. He burst out of his skin\u2014shreds of black and white cloth blasted up into the air. It happened so quickly that if I'd blinked, I'd have missed the entire transformation. One second it was Jacob diving into the air, and then it was the gigantic, russet brown wolf\u2014so enormous that I couldn't make sense of its mass somehow fitting inside Jacob\u2014charging the crouched silver beast. Jacob met the other werewolf's attack head-on. Their angry snarls echoed like thunder off the trees. The black and white scraps\u2014the remains of Jacob's clothes\u2014fluttered to the ground where he'd disappeared. \"Jacob!\" I screamed again, staggering forward. \"Stay where you are, Bella,\" Sam ordered. It was hard to hear him over the roar of the fighting wolves. They were snapping and tearing at each other, their sharp teeth flashing toward each other's throats. The Jacob-wolf seemed to have the upper hand\u2014he was visibly bigger than the other wolf, and it looked like he was stronger, too. He rammed his shoulder against the gray wolf again and again, knocking him back toward the trees. \"Take her to Emily's,\" Sam shouted toward the other boys, who were watching the conflict with rapt expressions. Jacob had successfully shoved the gray wolf off the road, and they were disappearing into the forest, though the sound of their snarls was still loud. Sam ran after them, kicking off his shoes on the way. As he darted into the trees, he was quivering from head to toe.  The growling and snapping was fading into the distance. Suddenly, the sound cut off and it was very quiet on the road. One of the boys started laughing. I turned to stare at him\u2014my wide eyes felt frozen, like I couldn't even blink them. The boy seemed to be laughing at my expression. \"Well, there's something you don't see every day,\" he snickered. His face was vaguely familiar\u2014thinner than the others\u2026 Embry Call. \"I do,\" the other boy, Jared, grumbled. \"Every single day.\" \"Aw, Paul doesn't lose his temper every day,\" Embry disagreed, still grinning. \"Maybe two out of three.\" Jared stopped to pick something white up off the ground. He held it up toward Embry; it dangled in limp strips from his hand. \"Totally shredded,\" Jared said. \"Billy said this was the last pair he could afford\u2014guess Jacob's going barefoot now.\" \"This one survived,\" Embry said, holding up a white sneaker. \"Jake can hop,\" he added with a laugh. Jared started collecting various pieces of fabric from the dirt. \"Get Sam's shoes, will you? All the rest of this is headed for the trash.\" Embry grabbed the shoes and then jogged into the trees where Sam had disappeared. He was back in a few seconds with a pair of cut-off jeans draped over his arm. Jared gathered the torn remnants of Jacob's and Paul's clothes and wadded them into a ball. Suddenly, he seemed to remember me. He looked at me carefully, assessing. \"Hey, you're not going to faint or puke or anything?\" he demanded. \"I don't think so,\" I gasped. \"You don't look so good. Maybe you should sit down.\" \"Okay,\" I mumbled. For the second time in one morning, I put my head between my\u00a0 knees. \"Jake should have warned us,\" Embry complained. \"He shouldn't have brought his girlfriend into this. What did he expect?\" \"Well, the wolf's out of the bag now.\" Embry sighed. \"Way to go, Jake.\" I raised my head to glare at the two boys who seemed to be taking this all so lightly. \"Aren't you worried about them at all?\" I demanded. Embry blinked once in surprise \"Worried? Why?\" \"They could hurt each other!\" Embry and Jared guffawed. \"I hope Paul gets a mouthful of him,\" Jared said. \"Teach him a lesson.\" I blanched. \"Yeah, right!\" Embry disagreed. \"Did you see Jake? Even Sam couldn't have phased on the fly like that.\u00a0 He saw Paul losing it, and it took him, what, half a second to attack? The boy's got a gift.\" \"Paul's been fighting longer. I'll bet you ten bucks he leaves a mark.\" \"You're on. Jake's a natural. Paul doesn't have a prayer.\" They shook hands, grinning. I tried to comfort myself with their lack of concern, but I couldn't drive the brutal image of the fighting werewolves from my head. My stomach churned, sore and empty, my head ached with worry. \"Let's go see Emily. You know she'll have food waiting.\" Embry looked down at me. \"Mind giving us a ride?\" \"No problem,\" I choked. Jared raised one eyebrow. \"Maybe you'd better drive, Embry. She still looks like she might hurl.\" \"Good idea. Where are the keys?\" Embry asked me. \"Ignition.\" Embry opened the passenger-side door. \"In you go,\" he said cheerfully, hauling me up from the ground with one hand and stuffing me into my seat. He appraised the available space. \"You'll have to ride in the back,\" he told Jared. \"That's fine. I got a weak stomach. I don't want to be in there when she blows.\" \"I bet she's tougher than that. She runs with vampires.\" \"Five bucks?\" Jared asked. \"Done. I feel guilty, taking your money like this.\" Embry got in and started the engine while Jared leapt agilely into the bed. As soon as his door was closed, Embry muttered to me, \"Don't throw up, okay? I've only got a ten, and if Paul got his teeth into Jacob\u2026\" \"Okay,\" I whispered. Embry drove us back toward the village. \"Hey, how did Jake get around the injunction anyway?\" \"The\u2026 what?\" \"Er, the order. You know, to not spill the beans. How did he tell you about this?\" \"Oh, that,\" I said, remembering Jacob trying to choke out the truth to me last night. \"He didn't. I guessed right.\" Embry pursed his lips, looking surprised. \"Hmm. S'pose that would work.\" \"Where are we going?\" I asked. \"Emily's house. She's Sam's girlfriend\u2026 no, fianc\u00e9e, now, I guess. They'll meet us back there after Sam gives it to them for what just happened. And after Paul and Jake scrounge up some new clothes, if Paul even has any left.\" \"Does Emily know about\u2026 ?\" \"Yeah. And hey, don't stare at her. That bugs Sam.\" I frowned at him. \"Why would I stare?\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Embry looked uncomfortable. \"Like you saw just now, hanging out around werewolves has its risks.\" He changed the subject quickly. \"Hey, are you okay about the whole thing with the black-haired bloodsucker in the meadow? It didn't look like he was a friend of yours, but. .\" Embry shrugged. \"No, he wasn't my friend.\" \"That's good. We didn't want to start anything, break the treaty, you know.\" \"Oh, yeah, Jake told me about the treaty once, a long time ago. Why would killing Laurent break the treaty?\" \"Laurent,\" he repeated, snorting, like he was amused the vampire had had a name. \"Well, we were technically on Cullen turf. We're not allowed to attack any of them, the Cullens, at least, off our land\u2014unless they break the treaty first. We didn't know if the black-haired one was a relative of theirs or something. Looked like you knew him.\" \"How would they go about breaking the treaty?\" \"If they bite a human. Jake wasn't so keen on the idea of letting it go that far.\" \"Oh. Um, thanks. I'm glad you didn't wait.\" \"Our pleasure.\" He sounded like he meant that in a literal sense. Embry drove past the easternmost house on the highway before turning off onto a narrow dirt road. \"Your truck is slow,\" he noted. \"Sorry.\" At the end of the lane was a tiny house that had once been gray. There was only one narrow window beside the weathered blue door, but the window box under it was filled with bright orange and yellow marigolds, giving the whole place a cheerful look. Embry opened the truck door and inhaled. \"Mmm, Emily's cooking.\" Jared jumped out of the back of the truck and headed for the door, but Embry stopped him with one hand on his chest. He looked at me meaningfully, and cleared his throat. \"I don't have my wallet on me,\" Jared said. \"That's okay. I won't forget.\" They climbed up the one step and entered the house without knocking. I followed timidly after them. The front room, like Billy's house, was mostly kitchen. A young woman with satiny copper skin and long, straight, crow-black hair was standing at the counter by the sink, popping big muffins out of a tin and placing them on a paper plate. For one second, I thought the reason Embry had told me not to stare was because the girl was so beautiful. And then she asked \"You guys hungry?\" in a melodic voice, and she turned to face us full on, a smile on half of her face. The right side of her face was scarred from hairline to chin by three thick, red lines, livid in color though they were long healed. One line pulled down the corner of her dark, almond-shaped right eye, another twisted the right side of her mouth into a permanent grimace. Thankful for Embry's warning, I quickly turned my eyes to the muffins in her hands. They smelled wonderful\u2014like fresh blueberries. \"Oh,\" Emily said, surprised. \"Who's this?\" I looked up, trying to focus on the left half of her face. \"Bella Swan,\" Jared told her, shrugging. Apparently, I'd been a topic of conversation before. \"Who else?\" \"Leave it to Jacob to find a way around,\" Emily murmured. She stared at me, and neither half of her once-beautiful face was friendly. \"So, you're the vampire girl.\" I <em>stiffened</em>. \"Yes. Are you the wolf girl?\" She laughed, as did Embry and Jared. The left half of her face warmed. \"I guess I am.\" She turned to Jared. \"Where's Sam?\" \"Bella, er, surprised Paul this morning.\" Emily rolled her good eye. \"Ah, Paul,\" she sighed. \"Do you think they'll be long? I was just about to start the eggs.\" \"Don't worry,\" Embry told her. \"If they're late, we won't let anything go to waste.\" Emily chuckled, and then opened the refrigerator. \"No doubt,\" she agreed. \"Bella, are you hungry? Go ahead and help yourself to a muffin.\" \"Thanks.\" I took one from the plate and started nibbling around the edges. It was delicious, and it felt good in my tender stomach. Embry picked up his third and shoved it into his mouth whole. \"Save some for your brothers,\" Emily chastised him, hitting him on the head with a wooden spoon. The word surprised me, but the others thought nothing of it. \"Pig,\" Jared commented. I leaned against the counter and watched the three of them banter like a family. Emily's kitchen was a friendly place, bright with white cupboards and pale wooden floorboards. On the little round table, a cracked blue-and-white china pitcher was overflowing with wildflowers. Embry and Jared seemed entirely at ease here. Emily was mixing a humongous batch of eggs, several dozen, in a big yellow bowl. She had the sleeves of her lavender shirt pushed up, and I could see that the scars extended all the way down her arm to the back of her right hand. Hanging out with werewolves truly did have its risks, just as Embry had said. The front door opened, and Sam stepped through. \"Emily,\" he said, and so much love saturated his voice that I felt embarrassed, intrusive, as I watched him cross the room in one stride and take her face in his wide hands. He leaned down and kissed the dark scars on her right cheek before he kissed her lips. \"Hey, none of that,\" Jared complained. \"I'm eating.\" \"Then shut up and eat,\" Sam suggested, kissing Emily's ruined mouth again. \"Ugh,\" Embry groaned. This was worse than any romantic movie; this was so real that it sang out loud with joy and life and true love. I put my muffin down and folded my arms across my empty chest. I stared at the flowers, trying to ignore the utter peace of their moment, and the wretched throbbing of my wounds. I was grateful for the distraction when Jacob and Paul came through the door, and then shocked when I saw that they were laughing. While I watched, Paul punched Jacob on the shoulder and Jacob went for a kidney jab in return. They laughed again. They both appeared to be in one piece. Jacob scanned the room, his eyes stopping when he found me leaning, awkward and out of place, against the counter in the far corner of the kitchen. \"Hey, Bells,\" he greeted me cheerfully. He grabbed two muffins as he passed the table and came to stand beside me. \"Sorry about before,\" he muttered under his breath. \"How are you holding up.'\" \"Don't worry, I'm okay. Good muffins.\" I picked mine back up and started libber again. My chest felt better as soon as Jacob was beside me. \"Oh, man!\" Jared wailed, interrupting us. I looked up, and he and Embry were examining a fading pink line on Paul's forearm. Embry was grinning, exultant. \"Fifteen dollars,\" he crowed. \"Did you do that?\" I whispered to Jacob, remembering the bet. \"I barely touched him. He'll be perfect by sundown.\" \"By sundown?\" I looked at the line on Paul's arm. Odd, but it looked weeks old. \"Wolf thing,\" Jacob whispered. I nodded, trying to not look weirded out. \"You okay?\" I asked him under my breath. \"Not a scratch on me.\" His expression was smug. \"Hey, guys,\" Sam said in a loud voice, interrupting all the conversations going on in the small room. Emily was at the stove, scraping the egg mixture around a big skillet, but Sam still had one hand touching the small of her back, an unconscious gesture. \"Jacob has information for us.\" Paul looked unsurprised. Jacob must have explained this to him and Sam already. Or\u2026 they'd just heard his thoughts. \"I know what the redhead wants.\" Jacob directed his words toward Jared and Embry. \"That's what I was trying to tell you before.\" He kicked the leg of the chair Paul had settled into. \"And?\" Jared asked. Jacob's face got serious. \"She is trying to avenge her mate\u2014only it wasn't the black-haired leech we killed. The Cullens got her mate last year, and she's after Bella now.\" This wasn't news to me, but I still shivered. Jared, Embry, and Emily stared at me with open-mouthed surprise. \"She's just a girl,\" Embry protested. \"I didn't say it made sense. But that's why the bloodsucker's been trying to get past us. She's been heading for Forks.\" They continued to stare at me, mouths still hanging open, for a long moment. I ducked my head. \"Excellent,\" Jared finally said, a smile beginning to pull up the corners of his mouth. \"We've got bait.\" With stunning speed, Jacob yanked a can opener from the counter and launched it at Jared's head. Jared's hand flicked up faster than I would have thought possible, and he snagged the tool just before it hit his face. \"Bella is not bait.\" \"You know what I mean,\" Jared said, unabashed. \"So we'll be changing our patterns,\" Sam said, ignoring their squabble. \"We'll try leaving a few holes, and see if she falls for it. We'll have to split up, and I don't like that. But if she's really after Bella, she probably won't try to take advantage of our divided numbers.\" \"Quit's got to be close to joining us,\" Embry murmured. \"Then we'll be able to split evenly.\" Everyone looked down. I glanced at Jacob's face, and it was hopeless, like it had been yesterday afternoon, outside his house. No matter how comfortable they seemed to be with their fate, here in this happy kitchen, none of these werewolves wanted the same fate for their friend. \"Well, we won't count on that,\" Sam said in a low voice, and then continued at his regular volume. \"Paul, Jared, and Embry will take the outer perimeter, and Jacob and I will take the inner. We'll collapse in when we've got her trapped.\" I noticed that Emily didn't particularly like that Sam would be in the smaller grouping. Her worry had me glancing up at Jacob, worrying, too. Sam caught my eye. \"Jacob thinks it would be best if you spent as much time as possible here in La Push.\u00a0 She won't know where to find you so easily, just in case.\" \"What about Charlie?\" I demanded. \"March Madness is still going,\" Jacob said. \"I think Billy and Harry can manage to keep Charlie down here when he's not at work.\" \"Wait,\" Sam said, holding one hand up. His glance flickered to Emily and then back to me. \"That's what Jacob thinks is best, but you need to decide for yourself. You should weigh the risks of both options very seriously. You saw this morning how easily things can get dangerous here, how quickly they get out of hand. If you choose to stay with us, I can't make any guarantees about your safety.\" \"I won't hurt her,\" Jacob mumbled, looking down. Sam acted as if he hadn't heard him speak. \"If there was somewhere else you felt safe\u2026\" I bit my lip. Where could I go that wouldn't put someone else in danger? I recoiled again from the idea of bringing Renee into this\u2014pulling her into the circle of the target I wore\u2026 \"I don't want to lead Victoria anywhere else,\" I whispered. Sam nodded. \"That's true. It's better to have her here, where we can end this.\" I flinched. I didn't want Jacob or any of the rest of them trying to end Victoria. I glanced at Jake's face; it was relaxed, almost the same as I remembered it from before the onset of the wolf thing, and utterly unconcerned by the idea of hunting vampires. \"You'll be careful, right?\" I asked, an audible lump in my throat. The boys burst into loud hoots of amusement. Everyone laughed at me\u2014except Emily. She met my eyes, and I could suddenly see the symmetry underlying her deformity. Her face was still beautiful, and alive with a concern even more fierce than mine. I had to look away, before the love behind that concern could start me aching again. \"Food's ready,\" she announced then, and the strategic conversation was history. The guys hurried to surround the table\u2014which looked tiny and in danger of being crushed by them\u2014and devoured the buffet-sized pan of eggs Emily placed in their midst in record time. Emily ate leaning against the counter like me\u2014avoiding the bedlam at the table\u2014and watched them with affectionate eyes. Her expression clearly stated that this was her family. All in all, it wasn't exactly what I'd been expecting from a pack of werewolves. I spent the day in La Push, the majority of it in Billy's house. He left a message on Charlie's phone and at the station, and Charlie showed up around dinnertime with two pizzas. It was good he brought two larges; Jacob ate one all by himself. I saw Charlie eyeing the two of us suspiciously all night, especially the much-changed Jacob. He asked about the hair; Jacob shrugged and told him it was just more convenient. I knew that as soon as Charlie and I were headed home, Jacob would take off\u2014off to run around as a wolf, as he had done intermittently through the entire day. He and his brothers of sorts kept up a constant watch, looking for some sign of Victoria's return. But since they'd chased her away from the hot springs last night\u2014chased her halfway to Canada, according to Jacob\u2014she'd yet to make another foray. I had no hope at all that she might just give up. I didn't have that kind of luck. Jacob walked me to my truck after dinner and lingered by the window, waiting for Charlie to drive away first. \"Don't be afraid tonight,\" Jacob said, while Charlie pretended to be having trouble with his seat belt. \"We'll be out there, watching.\" \"I won't worry about myself,\" I promised. \"You're silly. Hunting vampires is fun. It's the best part of this whole mess.\" I shook my head. \"If I'm silly, then you're dangerously unbalanced.\" He chuckled. \"Get some rest, Bella, honey. You look exhausted.\" \"I'll try.\" Charlie honked his horn impatiently. \"See you tomorrow,\" Jacob said. \"Come down first thing.\" \"I will.\" Charlie followed me home. I paid scant attention to the lights in my rearview mirror. Instead, I wondered where Sam and Jared and Embry and Paul were, out running in the night. I wondered if Jacob had joined them yet. When we got home, I hurried for the stairs, but Charlie was right behind me. \"What's going on, Bella?\" he demanded before I could escape. \"I thought Jacob was part of a gang and you two were fighting.\" \"We made up.\" \"And the gang?\" \"I don't know\u2014who can understand teenage boys? They're a mystery. But I met Sam Uley and his fianc\u00e9e, Emily. They seemed pretty nice to me.\" I shrugged. \"Must have all been a misunderstanding.\" His face changed. \"I hadn't heard that he and Emily had made it official. That's nice. Poor girl.\" \"Do you know what happened to her?\" \"Mauled by a bear, up north, during salmon spawning season\u2014horrible accident .\u00a0 It was more than a year ago now. I heard Sam was really messed up over it.\" \"That's horrible,\" I echoed. More than a year ago. I'd bet that meant it had happened when there was just one werewolf in La Push. I shuddered at the thought of how Sam must have felt every time he looked at Emily's face. That night, I lay awake for a long time trying to sort through the day. I worked my way backward through dinner with Billy, Jacob, and Charlie, to the long afternoon in the Blacks' house, waiting anxiously to hear something from Jacob, to Emily's kitchen, to the horror of the werewolf fight, to talking with Jacob on the beach. I thought about what Jacob had said early this morning, about hypocrisy. I thought about that for a long time. I didn't like to think that I was a hypocrite, only what was the point of lying to myself? I curled into a tight ball. No, Edward wasn't a killer. Even in his darker past, he'd never been a murderer of innocents, at least. But what if he had been? What if, during the time I that I'd known him, he'd been just like any other vampire? What if people had been disappearing from the woods, just like now? Would that have kept me away from him? I shook my head sadly. Love is irrational, I reminded myself. The more you loved someone, the less sense anything made. I rolled over and tried to think of something else\u2014and I thought of Jacob and his brothers, out running in the darkness. I fell asleep imagining the wolves, invisible in the night, guarding me from danger. When I dreamed, I stood in the forest again, but I didn't wander. I was holding Emily's scarred hand as we faced into the shadows and waited anxiously for our werewolves to come home.",
