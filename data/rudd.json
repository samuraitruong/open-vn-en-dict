The US has told its nationals to stay 50 miles (80km) away from Fukushima and has chartered flights for those wanting to flee the country. France and China are to evacuate thousands, while the UK and Australia have advised people to leave Tokyo.  Japan has imposed a 12-mile exclusion zone around the Fukushima plant. Workers are battling to cool overheating fuel at plant after a series of explosions led to fears large amounts of radiation could be released into the atmosphere. On Wednesday, the UK Foreign Office said that any Britons living in or north of Tokyo should \"consider leaving\", but officials have stressed there is no immediate risk to health. The FCO has advised Britons to use commercial flights, but it has also chartered planes to fly from Tokyo to Hong Kong, with free places for those directly affected by the disaster. The US State Department has also laid on flights for citizens wishing to leave Japan and has authorised the departure of some 600 dependents of diplomatic and commercial staff in Japan. The White House said its advice to US nationals to stay 50 miles from Fukushima did not imply a lack of confidence in the Japanese warnings.  Spokesman Jay Carney said the steps were \"what we would do if this incident were happening in the United States\". As he advised Australians to leave Japan, Foreign Minister Kevin <em>Rudd</em> said the main concern was over problems caused by the extensive damage to infrastructure. \"We have uncertainty of power supply, we have problems with train services, we have problems with public transport services, many schools have closed and there is this repeated series of aftershocks,\" he said. China has moved thousands of people to Tokyo to prepare for their evacuation while France has assigned two government planes to fly its nationals away from Japan. Most other countries have also advised their nationals to evacuate from the north-eastern region of Japan or to leave the country altogether if they can. The official death toll from Friday's magnitude 9 quake and the tsunami which followed it has now rising to 5,400, with another 9,500 still missing. About 380,000 people are currently still in temporary shelters",

            "en": "China's War for Ore         \nBusiness is being reshaped around the world.\n China was miffed by the outcome of what we last year called the corporate \"deal of the century.\" But shareholder interests prevailed. How often will that be said in the future? Politics, that ugly dynamic when mixed with business, was already back in play last week as Rio Tinto, an Australian mining giant at the heart of the controversy, saw four of its Chinese executives arrested in Shanghai on spying charges. China says the busts are not retribution for the cancelled deal between Rio and a state-owned company, which received angry press in China. Instead, the arrests supposedly arise from skullduggery by Rio officials during fraught annual ore-price negotiations with mainland steelmakers. But the distinction may be irrelevant. Ore has become a major neuralgic concern for China. It sees its dependence on imported supply as strategically risky. It fears that its massive attempts to \"stimulate\" domestic job growth are being drained off as fatter profits for Australian mining companies. When the intrigue is unraveled, moreover, don't be surprised if the arrests are partly aimed at corralling the mainland's own restive steelmakers, many of whom have not cooperated in Beijing's ore strategy but have been striking their own spot market deals at higher prices. But let's step back. Rio has been wrongfooted over and over lately amid the zigzagging of the world's monetary conditions, whose chaos is now disastrously reshaping business-government relations globally (think the Obama administration's ownership of most of the Detroit auto industry). When China was booming, Rio played coy in the face of a merger bid from fellow miner BHP Billiton 18 months ago, acknowledging the \"industrial logic\" of the deal but insisting the offering price was \"several ballparks\" short of fair value. Oops. With the collapse of Lehman and the global meltdown, ore prices plummeted and BHP withdrew its bid. Suddenly, Rio needed its own debt bailout and turned to a company on the cash-rich mainland, state-owned Chinalco. Beijing was doubly pleased by the $19.5 billion Chinalco deal. Not only was China getting ownership of Australian ore assets at a bargain price, but the deal also killed off any chance of a BHP merger, seen on the mainland as an Aussie plot to gouge China. Oops. The Chinalco proposal ran into a buzzsaw of nationalist opposition in Australia. And while a government review board dragged its feet, the delay allowed Ben Bernanke to rev up the monetary engine and China to launch its own massive stimulus. Ore prices recovered. A BHP joint venture was back on the table. In a jilting worthy of a Judy Blume novel, Rio last month dumped its Chinese savior and leapt into bed with its erstwhile Australian suitor. Now the Chinese naturally see dirty politics at work, but the deal was actually scuttled by Rio's shareholders, who rightly saw more upside in BHP's offer. Yet it's also true the Chinalco bid would likely eventually have been torpedoed by the Australian government. Polls were running strongly against selling the country's mineral patrimony to a company ultimately controlled by the Chinese Communist Party. Australia Prime Minister Kevin <em>Rudd</em>, who prides himself on being an old China hand, must have been overjoyed when this icky chalice was taken from his lips by Rio's shareholders Yet the politics have only turned ickier since the Rio arrests. And Beijing has other cards up its sleeve. It can take its opposition to the BHP-Rio deal to Europe's trustbusters, who voiced qualms about their earlier proposed tie-up. China also can make use of its own new anti-monopoly law, which has already been used to punish the U.S. for blocking an oil deal. Earlier this year, Chinese regulators nixed Coca-Cola's purchase of a local juicemaker on \"competition\" grounds that antitrust lawyers considered ludicrous. More disturbing, China has upped its ore purchases in recent weeks even as mainland growth seems to be slowing, suggesting an effort to lay in a stockpile for a longer showdown against Rio-BHP. If the Rio arrests mark the beginning of a Chinese war to remake the global ore market more to China's liking, Beijing might want to think again. Its clumsy attempt to make computer makers instruments of Internet censorship was not exactly confidence-inspiring. Ensuring nobody wants to do a business deal with China for fear of being charged with a death penalty crime hardly improves the case. Then there's the epic civil disorder in Xinjiang. The final casualty may be China's overblown reputation for macroeconomic competence, on which so many hopes for global recovery depend. There are already signs its stimulus efforts are running off the rails. The world might appreciate a signal right now that China's government actually knows what it's doing.
