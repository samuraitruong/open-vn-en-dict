            "en": "Human bias is inevitable, but another source of bias in the representation of history has to do with the transitory nature of the materials themselves. The simple fact is\u00a0that not everything from history survives the historical process. Castles, palaces and\u00a0cathedrals have a longer lifespan than the dwellings of ordinary people. The same\u00a0applies to the furnishings and other contents of the premises. In a town like <em>Leyden</em> in\u00a0Holland, which in the seventeenth century was occupied by approximately the same\u00a0number of inhabitants as today, people lived within the walled town, an area more\u00a0than five times smaller than modern <em>Leyden</em>. In most of the houses several families\u00a0lived together in circumstances beyond our imagination. Yet in museums, fine period\u00a0rooms give only an image of the lifestyle of the upper class of that era. No wonder\u00a0that people who stroll around exhibitions are filled with nostalgia; the evidence in\u00a0museums indicates that life was so much better in the past. This notion is induced by\u00a0the bias in its representation in museums and heritage centres.",
