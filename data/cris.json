Walking counts, as long as it's brisk enough that you work up a sweat and breathe harder, with your heart rate faster than usual.To get the same results in half the time, step up your pace and get vigorous exercise -- like jogging or walking. You'd need to do that for 20 minutes a day, 4 days a week.  Jog, if you're already fit, or walk briskly at an incline on a treadmill if you're not ready for jogging. Vigorous workouts on stationary bikes and elliptical or rowing machines are also effective, says Duke researcher <em>Cris</em> Slentz, PhD.  Moderate activity -- raising your heart rate for 30 minutes at least three times per week -- also helps. It slows down how much visceral fat you gain. But to torch visceral fat, your workouts may need to be stepped up.  \u201cRake leaves, walk, garden, play soccer with your kids. It doesn\u2019t have to be in the gym,\u201d Hairston says.  If you are not active now, it's a good idea to check with your health care provider before starting a new fitness program.",
