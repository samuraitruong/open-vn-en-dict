The issue of Roma (Gypsy) deportations from France has dominated an EU summit. Mr Sarkozy told a news conference that Chancellor Merkel had said to him that she intended to follow France's example in dismantling Roma camps. Mrs Merkel's spokesman denied she had discussed the issue with Mr Sarkozy. Fresh from a blazing row with the president of the European Commission, President Sarkozy has managed to fall out with his closest ally in Europe, says the BBC's Oana Lungescu, who was at the summit in Brussels.  Heated exchange Mr Sarkozy told reporters at the summit that Chancellor Merkel had said she intended to dismantle Roma camps in the coming weeks. He predicted the action could unsettle German politics. But promptly after landing in Berlin, the Chancellor's spokesman firmly denied that Mrs Merkel had discussed any so-called Roma camps with the French president during the summit or on the margins, let alone their evacuation.  During the summit, Mr Sarkozy clashed with the European Commission over the matter of Roma deportations. Since August, France has dismantled about 200 Roma settlements and deported about 1,000 of their inhabitants to Romania and Bulgaria. It has also evicted French nationals from illegal traveller settlements.  Earlier this week, the EU justice commissioner Viviane Reding had appeared to compare France's actions to persecutions in Nazi-occupied France. \"The disgusting and shameful words that were used - World War II, the evocation of the Jews - was something that shocked us deeply,\" Mr Sarkozy said. He then went on to have a heated exchange with the EU Commission President, Jose Manuel Barroso.  This is an unprecedented row between Brussels and Paris, our correspondent says. Mr Barroso recognised that some excessive comments had been made, but insisted that discrimination against ethnic minorities was unacceptable.  \"It is true that in the past few weeks, some things have been said that are out of order,\" Mr Barroso admitted. \"But I think we need to leave that on one side now.\" Ms Reding, the EU commissioner from Luxembourg, said on Tuesday: \"This is a situation I had thought Europe would not have to witness again after the Second World War.\" She also urged the European Commission to take legal action against France over the deportations. Ms Reding later said she regretted interpretations of her statement. Although France has deported thousands of Romanian and Bulgarian Roma over the past few years, it began accelerating the process last month, as part of a high-profile crackdown on illegal camps in the country. On Monday, Euro MPs accused the commission of failing to protect the Roma deported from France. In all, Mr Sarkozy said around 500 camps were dismantled in August, of which 199 were Roma settlements. About 5,400 people were evicted from the Roma camps, but the majority of those living in the camps were French nationals, the president said. The president's <em>assertions</em> appeared to contradict a leaked memo from the French interior ministry which surfaced on Monday. It showed the authorities had been instructed to target Roma camps, rather than deal with migrants on a case-by-case basis, as the French migration minister and the minister for Europe had assured the European Commission.  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11338112",

            "en": "Suicide Bomber Attacks Afghan Defense Ministry         KABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 An insurgent wearing an Afghan Army uniform and a vest laced with explosives opened fire inside the heavily fortified Ministry of Defense headquarters on Monday, killing at least two soldiers, a ministry spokesman said.  A spokesman for the Taliban, which claimed responsibility for the attack, said the intended target was France\u2019s minister of defense, G\u00e9rard Longuet, who was scheduled to visit the compound later in the day. Soldiers shot the attacker before he could detonate his vest, said the Afghan military spokesman, Gen. Zahir Azimi.  The attack was the third in three days on government compounds by insurgents disguised as members of the Afghan national security forces. Their seemingly easy access to even the most heavily guarded locations has intensified concerns over Taliban infiltration of the police and military forces, just as they are preparing to take over security from the American-led coalition in some parts of the country this summer and the entire country by the end of 2014.  Zabiullah Mujaheed, a Taliban spokesman, said the insurgent was from Panjshir Province \u2014 the heartland of the Northern Alliance, which helped the United States oust the Taliban in 2001 \u2014 and had been serving in the Afghan Army for three years.  But General Azimi said such <em>assertions</em> were premature. \u201cWe don\u2019t know whether he was a member of the army or not,\u201d he said. \u201cAll I can say is that he was wearing an Afghan National Army uniform. It doesn\u2019t mean he was an army soldier. We are doing our investigation to find out.\u201d  General Azimi said the attacker entered the compound about 11:30 a.m. and opened fire, killing two soldiers and wounding seven close to the defense minister\u2019s office before being fatally shot. An explosives ordnance team then defused his vest. The defense minister, Abdul Rahim Wardak, was not present at the time, General Azimi said.  Soldiers continued searching the compound, which covers several city blocks in downtown Kabul, looking for other possible attackers late in the afternoon. Contrary to earlier reports, the general said no hostages had been taken. A doctor at Kabul\u2019s military hospital said three soldiers had been killed; there was no immediate explanation for the discrepancy in the death toll.  Mr. Longuet, who had arrived on Sunday to meet with French troops deployed here, was not in the ministry at the time of the attack, according to the military command in Paris. He had been scheduled to attend a joint news conference with Afghan military officials at 1:30 p.m.  It was the latest in a string of attacks aimed at Afghan government and military officials in what the Taliban has called the beginning of its spring offensive. On Saturday, a suicide bomber killed five NATO service members in eastern Afghanistan. A day earlier, a suicide bomber killed the police chief of Kandahar Province. In both attacks, the bombers were dressed in Afghan Army or police uniforms.  \u00a0\u201cUsing these kinds of attacks is very useful for us in recruiting someone and working inside Afghan forces,\u201d Mr. Mujaheed, the Taliban spokesman, said in a telephone interview after Saturday\u2019s attack. \u201cThis inflicts more casualties and does not cause any civilian casualties.\u201d  He added, \u201cWe have many more youths who are already in Afghan military ranks waiting for their chance to attack.\u201d  General Azimi said the government was working to root out insurgents from the army and police forces, but acknowledged that the task was daunting. \u201cWe have set up a security team who is watching suspicious people inside military forces, but it\u2019s hard to recognize them,\u201d he said.  Even when they are not in the military, insurgents have easy access to police and army uniforms, General Azimi said. An elder in a remote village in the eastern province of Paktika, along the Pakistan border, recently told a reporter for The New York Times that insurgents had been showing up in his village dressed in Afghan Army and police uniforms.  \u00a0\u201cYou know, finding uniforms is easy,\u201d General Azimi said. \u201cThey can find it anywhere, and they can make it. People sell military equipment in the bazaar. We have collected and confiscated uniforms several times, but again it\u2019s hard to collect all of them. Besides, you can find them in the provinces as well.\u201d  The attack on the Defense Ministry was just part of a bloody two days for Afghan security forces. In Ghazni Province, south of the capital, six police officers were killed when their vehicle struck a roadside bomb, said Musa Khan Akbar Zada, the provincial police chief.  Three more police officers were killed Sunday night in Oruzgan Province when their vehicle struck an improvised explosive device, said the provincial police chief, Fazal Ahmad Shirzad.",
