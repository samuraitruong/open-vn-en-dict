            "en": "7 REPETITION        22 FLIGHT DEMETRI LEFT US IN THE CHEERFULLY OPULENT RECEPTION area, where the woman Gianna was still at her post behind the polished counter. Bright, harmless music tinkled from hidden speakers. \"Do not leave until dark,\" he warned us. Edward nodded, and Demetri hurried away. Gianna did not seem at all surprised by the exchange, though she did eye Edward's borrowed cloak with shrewd speculation. \"Are you all right?\" Edward asked under his breath, too low for the human woman to hear. His voice was rough\u2014if velvet can be rough\u2014with anxiety. Still stressed by our situation, I imagined. \"You'd better make her sit before she falls,\" Alice said. \"She's going to pieces.\" It was only then that I realize I was shaking, shaking hard, my entire frame vibrating until my teeth chattered and the room around me seemed to wobble and blur in my eyes. For one wild second, I wondered if this was how Jacob felt just before exploding into a werewolf.  I heard a sound that didn't make sense, a strange, ripping counterpart to the otherwise cheery background music. Distracted by the shaking, I couldn't tell where it was coming from. \"Shh, Bella, shh,\" Edward said as he pulled me to the sofa farthest away from the curious human at the desk. \"I think she's having hysterics. Maybe you should slap her,\" Alice suggested. Edward threw a frantic glance at her. Then I understood. Oh. The noise was me. The ripping sound was the sobs coming from my chest. That's what was shaking me. \"It's all right, you're safe, it's all right,\" he chanted again and again. He pulled me onto his lap and tucked the thick wool cloak around me, protecting me from his cold skin. I knew it was stupid to react like this. Who knew how much time I had to look at his face? He was saved, and I was saved, and he could leave me as soon as we were free. To have my eyes so filled with tears that I could not see his features clearly was wasteful\u2014\u00a0 insanity. But, behind my eyes where the tears could not wash the image away, I could still see the panicked face of the tiny woman with the rosary. \"All those people,\" I sobbed. \"I know,\" he whispered. \"It's so horrible.\" \"Yes, it is. I wish you hadn't had to see that.\" I rested my head against his cold chest, using the thick cloak to wipe my eyes. I took a few deep breaths, trying to calm myself. \"Is there anything I can get you?\" a voice asked politely. It was Gianna, leaning over Edward's shoulder with a look that was both concerned and yet still professional and detached at the same time. It didn't seem to bother her that her face was inches from a hostile vampire. She was either totally oblivious, or very good at her job. \"No,\" Edward answered coldly. She nodded, smiled at me, and then disappeared. I waited until she was out of hearing range. \"Does she know what's going on here?\" I demanded, my voice low and hoarse. I was getting control of myself, my breathing evening out. \"Yes. She knows everything,\" Edward told me. \"Does she know they're going to kill her someday?\" \"She's knows it's a possibility,\" he said. That surprised me. Edward's face was hard to read. \"She's hoping they'll decide to keep her.\" I felt the blood leave my face. \"She wants to be one of them?\" He nodded once, his eyes sharp on my face, watching my reaction. I shuddered. \"How can she want that?\" I whispered, more to myself than really looking for an answer. \"How can she watch those people file through to that hideous room and want to be a part of that?\" Edward didn't answer. His expression twisted in response to something I'd said. As I stared at his too beautiful face, trying to understand the change, it suddenly struck me that I was really here, in Edward's arms, however fleetingly, and that we were not\u2014at this exact moment\u2014about to be killed. \"Oh, Edward,\" I cried, and I was sobbing again. It was such a stupid reaction. The tears were too thick for me to see his face again, and that was inexcusable. I only had until sunset for sure. Like a fairy tale again, with deadlines that ended the magic. \"What's wrong?\" he asked, still anxious, rubbing my back with gentle pats. I wrapped my arms around his neck\u2014what was the worst he could do? Just push me away\u2014and hugged myself closer to him. \"Is it really sick for me to be happy right now?\" I asked. My voice broke twice. He didn't push me away. He pulled me tight against his ice-hard chest, so tight it was hard to breathe, even with my lungs securely intact. \"I know exactly what you mean,\" he whispered. \"But we have lots of reasons to be happy. For one, we're alive.\" \"Yes,\" I agreed. \"That's a good one.\" \"And together,\" he breathed. His breath was so sweet it made my head swim. I just nodded, sure that he did not place the same weight on that consideration as I did. \"And, with any luck, we'll still be alive tomorrow.\" \"Hopefully,\" I said uneasily. \"The outlook is quite good,\" Alice assured me. She'd been so quiet, I'd almost forgotten her presence. \"I'll see Jasper in less than twenty-four hours,\" she added in a satisfied tone. Lucky Alice. She could trust her future. I couldn't keep my eyes off of Edward's face for long. I stared at him, wishing more than anything that the future would never happen. That this moment would last forever, or, if it couldn't, that I would stop existing when it did. Edward stared right back at me, his dark eyes soft, and it was easy to pretend that he felt the same way. So that's what I did. I pretended, to make the moment sweeter. His fingertips traced the circles under my eyes. \"You look so tired.\" \"And you look thirsty,\" I whispered back, studying the purple bruises under his black irises. He shrugged. \"It's nothing.\" \"Are you sure? I could sit with Alice,\" I offered, unwilling; I'd rather he killed me now than move one inch from where I was.  \"Don't be ridiculous.\" He sighed; his sweet breath caressed my face. \"I've never been in better control of that side of my nature than right now.\" I had a million questions for him. One of them bubbled to my lips now, but I held my tongue. I didn't want to ruin the moment, as imperfect as it was, here in this room that made me sick, under the eyes of the would-be monster. Here in his arms, it was so easy to fantasize that he wanted me. I didn't want to think about his motivations now\u2014about whether he acted this way to keep me calm while we were still in danger, or if he just felt guilty for where we were and relieved that he wasn't responsible for my death. Maybe the time apart had been enough that I didn't bore him for the moment. But it didn't matter. I was so much happier pretending. I lay quiet in his arms, re-memorizing his face, pretending\u2026 He stared at my face like he was doing the same, while he and Alice discussed how to get home. Their voices were so quick and low that I knew Gianna couldn't understand. I missed half of it myself. It sounded like more theft would be involved, though. I wondered idly if the yellow Porsche had made it back to its owner yet. \"What was all that talk about singers?\" Alice asked at one point. \"La tua cantante,\" Edward said. His voice made the words into music. \"Yes, that,\" Alice said, and I concentrated for a moment. I'd wondered about that, too, at the time. I felt Edward shrug around me. \"They have a name for someone who smells the way Bella does to me.\u00a0 They call her my singer\u2014because her blood sings for me.\" Alice laughed. I was tired enough to sleep, but I fought against the weariness. I wasn't going to miss a second of the time I had with him. Now and then, as he talked with Alice, he would lean down suddenly and kiss me\u2014his glass-smooth lips brushing against my hair, my forehead, the tip of my nose. Each time it was like an electric shock to my long dormant heart. The sound of its beating seemed to fill the entire room. It was heaven\u2014right smack in the middle of hell. I lost track of the time completely. So when Edward's arms tightened around me, and both he and Alice looked to the back of the room with wary eyes, I panicked. I cringed into Edward's chest as Alec\u2014his eyes now a vivid ruby, but still <em>spotless</em> in his light gray suit despite the afternoon meal\u2014walked through the double doors. It was good news. \"You're free to leave now,\" Alec told us, his tone so warm you'd think we were all lifelong friends. \"We ask that you don't linger in the city.\" Edward made no answering pretence; his voice was ice cold. \"That won't be a problem.\" Alec smiled, nodded, and disappeared again.  \"Follow the right hallway around the corner to the first set of elevators,\" Gianna told us as Edward helped me to my feet. \"The lobby is two floors down, and exits to the street. Goodbye, now,\" she added pleasantly. I wondered if her competence would be enough to save her.  Alice shot her a dark look. I was relieved there was another way out; I wasn't sure if I could handle another tour through the underground. We left through a tastefully luxurious lobby. I was the only one who glanced back at the medieval castle that housed the elaborate business facade. \u00a0I couldn't see the turret from here, for which I was grateful. The party was still in full swing in the streets. The street lamps were just coming on as we walked swiftly through the narrow, cobbled lanes. The sky was a dull, fading gray overhead, but the buildings crowded the streets so closely that it felt darker. The party was darker, too. Edward's long, trailing cloak did not stand out in the way it might have on a normal evening in Volterra. There were others in black satin cloaks now, and the plastic fangs I'd seen on the child in the square today seemed to be very popular with the adults. \"Ridiculous,\" Edward muttered once. I didn't notice when Alice disappeared from beside me. I looked over to ask her a question, and she was gone. \"Where's Alice?\" I whispered in a panic. \"She went to retrieve your bags from where she stashed them this morning.\" I'd forgotten that I had access to a toothbrush. It brightened my outlook considerably. \"She's stealing a car, too, isn't she?\" I guessed. He grinned. \"Not till we're outside.\" It seemed like a very long way to the entryway. Edward could see that I was spent; he wound his arm around my waist and supported most of my weight as we walked. I shuddered as he pulled me through the dark stone archway. The huge, ancient portcullis above was like a cage door, threatening to drop on us, to lock us in. He led me toward a dark car, waiting in a pool of shadow to the right of the gate with the engine running. To my surprise, he slid into the backseat with me, instead of insisting on driving. Alice was apologetic. \"I'm sorry.\" She gestured vaguely toward the dashboard. \"There wasn't much to choose from.\" \"It's fine, Alice.\" He grinned. \"They can't all be 911 Turbos.\" She sighed. \"I may have to acquire one of those legally. It was fabulous.\" \"I'll get you one for Christmas,\" Edward promised. Alice turned to beam at him, which worried me, as she was already speeding down the dark and curvy hillside at the same time. \"Yellow,\" she told him. Edward kept me tight in his arms. Inside the gray cloak, I was warm and comfortable. More than comfortable. \"You can sleep now, Bella,\" he murmured. \"It's over.\" I knew he meant the danger, the nightmare in the ancient city, but I still had to swallow hard before I could answer. \"I don't want to sleep. I'm not tired.\" Just the second part was a lie. I wasn't about to close my eyes. The car was only dimly lit by the dashboard controls, but it was enough that I could see his face. He pressed his lips to the hollow under my ear. \"Try,\" he encouraged. I shook my head. He sighed. \"You're still just as stubborn.\" I was stubborn; I fought with my heavy lids, and I won. The dark road was the hardest part; the bright lights at the airport in Florence made it easier, as did the chance to brush my teeth and change into clean clothes; Alice bought Edward new clothes, too, and he left the dark cloak on a pile of trash in an alley. The plane trip to Rome was so short that there wasn't really a chance for the fatigue to drag me under. I knew the flight from Rome to Atlanta would be another matter entirely, so I asked the flight attendant if she could bring me a Coke. \"Bella,\" Edward said disapprovingly. He knew my low tolerance for caffeine. Alice was behind us. I could hear her murmuring to Jasper on the phone. \"I don't want to sleep,\" I reminded him. I gave him an excuse that was believable because it was true. \"If I close my eyes now, I'll see things I don't want to see. I'll have nightmares.\" He didn't argue with me after that. It would have been a very good time to talk, to get the answers I needed\u2014needed but not really wanted; I was already despairing at the thought of what I might hear. We had an uninterrupted block of time ahead of us, and he couldn't escape me on an airplane\u2014well, not easily, at least. No one would hear us except Alice; it was late, and most of the passengers were turning off lights and asking for pillows in muted voices. Talk would help me fight off the exhaustion. But, perversely, I bit my tongue against the flood of questions. My reasoning was probably flawed by exhaustion, but I hoped that by postponing the discussion, I could buy a few more hours with him at some later time\u2014spin this out for another night, Scheherazade-style. So I kept drinking soda, and resisting even the urge to blink. Edward seemed perfectly content to hold me in his arms, his fingers tracing my face again and again. I touched his face, too. I couldn't stop myself, though I was afraid it would hurt me later, when I was alone again. He continued to kiss my hair, my forehead, my wrists\u2026 but never my lips, and that was good. After all, how many ways can one heart be mangled and still be expected to keep beating? I'd lived through a lot that should have finished me in the last few days, but it didn't make me feel strong. Instead, I felt horribly fragile, like one word could shatter me. Edward didn't speak. Maybe he was hoping I would sleep. Maybe he had nothing to say. I won the fight against my heavy lids. I was awake when we reached the airport in Atlanta, and I even watched the sun beginning to rise over Seattle's cloud cover before Edward slid the window shut. I was proud of myself. I hadn't missed one minute. Neither Alice nor Edward was surprised by the reception that waited for us at Sea-Tac airport, but it caught me off guard. Jasper was the first one I saw\u2014he didn't seem to see me at all. His eyes were only for Alice. She went quickly to his side; they didn't embrace like other couples meeting there. They only stared into each other's faces, yet, somehow, the moment was so private that I still felt the need to look away. Carlisle and Esme waited in a quiet corner far from the line for the metal detectors, in the shadow of a wide pillar. Esme reached for me, hugging me fiercely, yet awkwardly, because Edward kept his arms around me, too. \"Thank you so much,\" she said in my ear. Then she threw her arms around Edward, and she looked like she would be crying if that were possible. \"You will never put me through that again,\" she nearly growled. Edward grinned, repentant. \"Sorry, Mom.\" \"Thank you, Bella,\" Carlisle said. \"We owe you.\" \"Hardly,\" I mumbled. The sleepless night was suddenly overpowering. My head felt disconnected from my body. \"She's dead on her feet,\" Esme scolded Edward. \"Let's get her home.\" Not sure if home was what I wanted at this point, I stumbled, half-blind, through the airport, Edward dragging me on one side and Esme on the other. I didn't know if Alice and Jasper were behind us or not, and I was too exhausted to look. I think I was mostly asleep, though I was still walking, when we reached their car. The surprise of seeing Emmett and Rosalie leaning against the black sedan under the dim lights of the parking garage revived me some. Edward stiffened. \"Don't,\" Esme whispered. \"She feels awful.\" \"She should,\" Edward said, making no attempt to keep his voice down. \"It's not her fault,\" I said, my words garbled with exhaustion. \"Let her make amends,\" Esme pleaded.  \"We'll ride with Alice and Jasper.\"\u00a0 Edward glowered at the absurdly lovely blond vampire waiting for us. \"Please, Edward,\" I said. I didn't want to ride with Rosalie any more than he seemed to, but I'd caused more than enough discord in his family. He sighed, and towed me toward the car. Emmett and Rosalie got in the front seat without speaking, while Edward pulled me in the back again. I knew I wasn't going to be able to fight my eyelids anymore, and I laid my head against his chest in defeat, letting them close. I felt the car purr to life. \"Edward,\" Rosalie began. \"I know.\" Edward's brusque tone was not generous. \"Bella?\" Rosalie asked softly. My eyelids fluttered open in shock. It was the first time she'd ever spoken directly to me. \"Yes, Rosalie?\" I asked, hesitant. \"I'm so very sorry, Bella. I feel wretched about every part of this, and so grateful that you were brave enough to go save my brother after what I did. Please say you'll forgive me.\" The words were awkward, stilted because of her embarrassment, but they seemed sincere. \"Of course, Rosalie,\" I mumbled, grasping at any chance to make her hate me a little less. \"It's not your fault at all. I'm the one who jumped off the damn cliff. Of course I forgive you.\" The words came out like mush. \"It doesn't count until she's conscious, Rose,\" Emmett chuckled. \"I'm conscious,\" I said; it just sounded like a garbled sigh. \"Let her sleep,\" Edward insisted, but his voice was a little warmer. It was quiet then, except for the gentle thrum of the engine. I must have fallen asleep, because it seemed like seconds later when the door opened and Edward was carrying me from the car. My eyes wouldn't open. At first I thought we were still at the airport. And then I heard Charlie. \"Bella!\" he shouted from some distance. \"Charlie,\" I mumbled, trying to shake off the stupor. \"Shh,\" Edward whispered. \"It's okay; you're home and safe. Just sleep.\" \"I can't believe you have the nerve to show your face here.\" Charlie bellowed at Edward, his voice much closer now. \"Stop it, Dad,\" I groaned. He didn't hear me. \"What's wrong with her?\" Charlie demanded. \"She's just very tired, Charlie,\" Edward assured him quietly. \"Please let her rest.\" \"Don't tell me what to do!\" Charlie yelled. \"Give her to me. Get your hands off her!\" Edward tried to pass me to Charlie, but I clung to him with locked, tenacious fingers. I could feel my dad yanking on my arm. \"Cut it out, Dad,\" I said with more volume. I managed to drag my lids back to stare at Charlie with bleary eyes. \"Be mad at me.\" We were in front of my house. The front door was standing open. The cloud cover overhead was too thick to guess at a time of day. \"You bet I will be,\" Charlie promised. \"Get inside.\" \u201cO\u2019Kay. Let me down,\" I sighed. Edward set me on my feet. I could see that I was upright, but I couldn't feel my legs. I trudged forward anyway, until the sidewalk swirled up toward my face. Edward's arms caught me before I hit the concrete. \"Just let me get her upstairs,\" Edward said. \"Then I'll leave.\" \"No,\" I cried, panicking. I hadn't got my answers yet. He had to stay for at least that much, didn't he? \"I won't be far,\" Edward promised, whispering so low in my ear that Charlie didn't have a hope of hearing. I didn't hear Charlie answer, but Edward headed into the house. My open eyes only made it till the stairs. The last thing I felt was Edward's cool hands prying my fingers loose from his shirt.",

UNHAPPY ENDING Rosalie hesitated in the doorway, her breathtaking face unsure. \u201cOf course,\u201d I replied, my voice an octave high with surprise. \u201cCome on in.\u201d I sat up, sliding to the end of the sofa to make room. My stomach twisted nervously as the one Cullen who did not like me moved silently to sit down in the open space. I tried to come up with a reason why she would want to see me, but my mind was a blank on that point. \u201cDo you mind talking to me for a few minutes?\u201d she asked. \u201cI didn\u2019t wake you or anything, did I?\u201d Her eyes shifted to the stripped bed and back to my couch. \u201cNo, I was awake. Sure, we can talk.\u201d I wondered if she could hear the alarm in my voice as clearly as I could. She laughed lightly, and it sounded like a chorus of bells. \u201cHe so rarely leaves you alone,\u201d she said. \u201cI figured I\u2019d better make the best of this opportunity.\u201d What did she want to say that couldn\u2019t be said in front of Edward? My hands twisted and untwisted around the edge of the comforter. \u201cPlease don\u2019t think I\u2019m horribly interfering,\u201d Rosalie said, her voice gentle and almost pleading. She folded her hands in her lap and looked down at them as she spoke. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ve hurt your feelings enough in the past, and I don\u2019t want to do that again.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Rosalie. My feelings are great. What is it?\u201d She laughed again, sounding oddly embarrassed. \u201cI\u2019m going to try to tell you why I think you should stay human \u2014 why I would stay human if I were you.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d She smiled at the shocked tone of my voice, and then she sighed. \u201cDid Edward ever tell you what led to this?\u201d she asked, gesturing to her glorious immortal body. I nodded slowly, suddenly somber. \u201cHe said it was close to what happened to me that time in Port Angeles, only no one was there to save you .\u201d I shuddered at the memory. \u201cIs that really all he told you?\u201d she asked. \u201cYes,\u201d I said, my voice blank with confusion. \u201cWas there more?\u201d She looked up at me and smiled; it was a harsh, bitter \u2014 but still stunning \u2014 expression. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was more.\u201d I waited while she stared out the window. She seemed to be trying to calm herself. \u201cWould you like to hear my story, Bella? It doesn\u2019t have a happy ending \u2014 but which of ours does? If we had happy endings, we\u2019d all be under gravestones now.\u201d I nodded, though I was frightened by the edge in her voice. \u201cI lived in a different world than you do, Bella. My human world was a much simpler place. It was nineteen thirty-three. I was eighteen, and I was beautiful. My life was perfect.\u201d She stared out the window at the silver clouds, her expression far away. \u201cMy parents were thoroughly middle class. My father had a stable job in a bank, something I realize now that he was smug about \u2014 he saw his prosperity as a reward for talent and hard work, rather than acknowledging the luck involved. I took it all for granted then; in my home, it was as if the Great Depression was only a troublesome rumor. Of course I saw the poor people, the ones who weren\u2019t as lucky. My father left me with the impression that they\u2019d brought their troubles on themselves.  \u00a0\u201cIt was my mother\u2019s job to keep our house \u2014 and myself and my two younger brothers \u2014 in <em>spotless</em> order. It was clear that I was both her first priority and her favorite. I didn\u2019t fully understand at the time, but I was always vaguely aware that my parents weren\u2019t satisfied with what they had, even if it was so much more than most. They wanted more. They had social aspirations \u2014 social climbers, I suppose you could call them. My beauty was like a gift to them. They saw so much more potential in it than I did.  \u00a0\u201cThey weren\u2019t satisfied, but I was. I was thrilled to be me, to be Rosalie Hale. Pleased that men\u2019s eyes watched me everywhere I went, from the year I turned twelve. Delighted that my girlfriends sighed with envy when they touched my hair. Happy that my mother was proud of me and that my father liked to buy me pretty dresses.  \u00a0\u201cI knew what I wanted out of life, and there didn\u2019t seem to be any way that I wouldn\u2019t get exactly what I wanted. I wanted to be loved, to be adored. I wanted to have a huge, flowery wedding, where everyone in town would watch me walk down the aisle on my father\u2019s arm and think I was the most beautiful thing they\u2019d ever seen. Admiration was like air to me, Bella. I was silly and shallow, but I was content.\u201d She smiled, amused at her own evaluation. \u00a0\u201cMy parents\u2019 influence had been such that I also wanted the material things of life. I wanted a big house with elegant furnishings that someone else would clean and a modern kitchen that someone else would cook in. As I said, shallow. Young and very shallow. And I didn\u2019t see any reason why I wouldn\u2019t get these things. \u00a0\u201cThere were a few things I wanted that were more meaningful. One thing in particular. My very closest friend was a girl named Vera. She married young, just seventeen. She married a man my parents would never have considered for me \u2014 a carpenter. A year later she had a son, a beautiful little boy with dimples and curly black hair. It was the first time I\u2019d ever felt truly jealous of anyone else in my entire life.\u201d She looked at me with unfathomable eyes. \u201cIt was a different time. I was the same age as you, but I was ready for it all. I yearned for my own little baby. I wanted my own house and a husband who would kiss me when he got home from work \u2014 just like Vera. Only I had a very different kind of house in mind. . .\u201d It was hard for me to imagine the world that Rosalie had known. Her story sounded more like a fairy tale than history to me. With a slight shock, I realized that this was very close to the world that Edward would have experienced when he was human, the world he had grown up in. I wondered \u2014 while Rosalie sat silent for a moment \u2014 if my world seemed as baffling to him as Rosalie\u2019s did to me? Rosalie sighed, and when she spoke again her voice was different, the wistfulness gone. \u201cIn Rochester, there was one royal family \u2014 the Kings, ironically enough. Royce King owned the bank my father worked at, and nearly every other really profitable business in town. That\u2019s how his son, Royce King the Second\u201d \u2014 her mouth twisted around the name, it came out through her teeth \u2014 \u201csaw me the first time. He was going to take over at the bank, and so he began overseeing the different \u00a0positions. Two days later, my mother conveniently forgot to send my father\u2019s lunch to work with him. I remember being confused when she insisted that I wear my white organza and roll my hair up just to run over to the bank.\u201d Rosalie laughed without humor. \u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t notice Royce watching me particularly. Everyone watched me. But that night the first of the\u00a0 roses came. Every night of our courtship, he sent a bouquet of roses to me. My room was always overflowing with them. It got to the point that I would smell like roses when I left the house. \u201cRoyce was handsome, too. He had lighter hair than I did, and pale blue eyes. He said my eyes were like violets, and then those started showing up alongside the roses. \u00a0\u201cMy parents approved \u2014 that\u2019s putting it mildly. This was everything they\u2019d dreamed of. And Royce seemed to be everything I\u2019d dreamed of. The fairy tale prince, come to make me a princess. Everything I wanted, yet it was still no more than I expected. We were engaged before I\u2019d known him for two months. \u00a0\u201cWe didn\u2019t spend a great deal of time alone with each other. Royce told me he had many responsibilities at work, and, when we were together, he liked people to look at us, to see me on his arm. I liked that, too. There were lots of parties, dancing, and pretty dresses. When you were a King, every door was open for you, every red carpet rolled out to greet you. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a long engagement. Plans went ahead for the most lavish wedding. It was going to be everything I\u2019d ever wanted. I was completely happy. When I called at Vera\u2019s, I no longer felt jealous. I pictured my fair-haired children playing on the huge lawns of the Kings\u2019 estate, and I pitied her.\u201d Rosalie broke off suddenly, clenching her teeth together. It pulled me out of her story, and I realized that the horror was not far off. There would be no happy ending, as she\u2019d promised. I wondered if this was why she had so much more bitterness in her than the rest of them \u2014 because she\u2019d been within reach of everything she\u2019d wanted when her human life was cut short. \u201cI was at Vera\u2019s that night,\u201d Rosalie whispered. Her face was smooth as marble, and as hard. \u201cHer little Henry really was adorable, all smiles and dimples \u2014 he was just sitting up on his own. Vera walked me to the door as I was leaving, her baby in her arms and her husband at her side, his arm around her waist. He kissed her on the cheek when he thought I wasn\u2019t looking. That bothered me. When Royce kissed me, it wasn\u2019t quite the same \u2014 not so sweet somehow. . . . I shoved that thought aside. Royce was my prince. Someday, I would be queen.\u201d It was hard to tell in the moonlight, but it looked like her bone white face got paler. \u201cIt was dark in the streets, the lamps already on. I hadn\u2019t realized how late it was.\u201d  She continued to whisper almost inaudibly. \u201cIt was cold, too. Very cold for late April. The wedding was only a week away, and I was worrying about the weather as I hurried home \u2014 I can remember that clearly. I remember every detail about that night. I clung to it so hard . . . in the beginning. I thought of nothing else. And so I remember this, when so many pleasant memories have faded away completely. . . .\u201d She sighed, and began whispering again. \u201cYes, I was worrying about the weather. . . . I didn\u2019t want to have to move the wedding indoors. . . . \u201cI was a few streets from my house when I heard them. A cluster of men under a broken streetlamp, laughing too loud. Drunk. I wished I\u2019d called my father to escort me home, but the way was so short, it seemed silly. And then he called my name. \u00a0\u201c\u2018Rose!\u2019 he yelled, and the others laughed stupidly. \u201cI hadn\u2019t realized the drunks were so well dressed. It was Royce and some of his friends, sons of other rich men. \u201c\u2018Here\u2019s my Rose!\u2019 Royce shouted, laughing with them, sounding just as stupid. \u2018You\u2019re late. We\u2019re cold, you\u2019ve kept us waiting so long.\u2019\u201d \u201cI\u2019d never seen him drink before. A toast, now and then, at a party. He\u2019d told me he didn\u2019t like champagne. I hadn\u2019t realized that he preferred something much stronger. \u00a0\u201cHe had a new friend \u2014 the friend of a friend, come up from Atlanta. \u201c\u2018What did I tell you, John,\u2019 Royce crowed, grabbing my arm and pulling me closer. \u2018Isn\u2019t she lovelier than all your Georgia peaches?\u2019 \u201cThe man named John was dark-haired and suntanned. He looked me over like I was a horse he was buying. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s hard to tell,\u2019 he drawled slowly. \u2018She\u2019s all covered up.\u2019 \u201cThey laughed, Royce like the rest. \u00a0\u201cSuddenly, Royce ripped my jacket from my shoulders \u2014 it was a gift from him \u2014 popping the brass buttons off. They scattered all over the street. \u201c\u2018Show him what you look like, Rose!\u2019 He laughed again and then he tore my hat out of my hair. The pins wrenched my hair from the roots, and I cried out in pain. They seemed to enjoy that \u2014 the sound of my pain. . . .\u201d Rosalie looked at me suddenly, as if she\u2019d forgotten I was there. I was sure my face was as white as hers. Unless it was green. \u201cI won\u2019t make you listen to the rest,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cThey left me in the street, still laughing as they stumbled away. They thought I was dead. They were teasing Royce that he would have to find a new bride. He laughed and said he\u2019d have to learn some patience first. \u00a0\u201cI waited in the road to die. It was cold, though there was so much pain that I was surprised it bothered me. It started to snow, and I wondered why I wasn\u2019t dying. I was impatient for death to come, to end the pain. It was taking so long. . . . \u00a0\u201cCarlisle found me then. He\u2019d smelled the blood, and come to investigate. I remember being vaguely irritated as he worked over me, trying to save my life. I\u2019d never liked Dr. Cullen or his wife and her brother \u2014 as Edward pretended to be then. It had upset me that they were all more beautiful than I was, especially that the men were. But they didn\u2019t mingle in society, so I\u2019d only seen them once or twice. \u00a0\u201cI thought I\u2019d died when he pulled me from the ground and ran with me \u2014 because of the speed \u2014 it felt like I was flying. I remembered being horrified that the pain didn\u2019t stop. . . . \u00a0\u201cThen I was in a bright room, and it was warm. I was slipping away, and I was grateful as the pain began to dull. But suddenly something sharp was cutting me, my throat, my wrists, my ankles. I screamed in shock, thinking he\u2019d brought me there to hurt me more. Then fire started burning through me, and I didn\u2019t care about anything else. I begged him to kill me. When Esme and Edward returned home, I begged them to kill me, too. Carlisle sat with me. He held my hand and said that he was so sorry, promising that it would end. He told me everything, and sometimes I listened. He told me what he was, what I was becoming. I didn\u2019t believe him. He apologized each time I screamed. \u00a0\u201cEdward wasn\u2019t happy. I remember hearing them discuss me. I stopped screaming sometimes. It did no good to scream. \u201c\u2018What were you thinking, Carlisle?\u2019 Edward said. \u2018Rosalie Hale?\u2019\u201d Rosalie imitated Edward\u2019s irritated tone to perfection. \u201cI didn\u2019t like the way he said my name, like there was something wrong with me. \u201c\u2018I couldn\u2019t just let her die,\u2019 Carlisle said quietly. \u2018It was too much \u2014 too horrible, too much waste.\u2019 \u00a0\u201c\u2018I know,\u2019 Edward said, and I thought he sounded dismissive. It angered me. I didn\u2019t know then that he really could see exactly what Carlisle had seen. \u201c\u2018It was too much waste. I couldn\u2019t leave her,\u2019 Carlisle repeated in a whisper. \u201c\u2018Of course you couldn\u2019t,\u2019 Esme agreed. \u201c\u2018People die all the time,\u2019 Edward reminded him in a hard voice. \u2018Don\u2019t you think she\u2019s just a little recognizable, though? The Kings will have to put up a huge search \u2014 not that anyone suspects the fiend,\u2019 he growled. \u00a0\u201cIt pleased me that they seemed to know that Royce was guilty. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize that it was almost over \u2014 that I was getting stronger and that was why I was able to concentrate on what they were saying. The pain was beginning to fade from my fingertips. \u201c\u2018What are we going to do with her?\u2019 Edward said disgustedly \u2014 or that\u2019s how it sounded to me, at least. \u00a0\u201cCarlisle sighed. \u2018That\u2019s up to her, of course. She may want to go her own way.\u2019 \u201cI\u2019d believed enough of what he\u2019d told me that his words terrified me. I knew that my life was ended, and there was no going back for me. I couldn\u2019t stand the thought of being alone. . . . \u201cThe pain finally ended and they explained to me again what I was. This time I believed. I felt the thirst, my hard skin; I saw my brilliant red eyes. \u201cShallow as I was, I felt better when I saw my reflection in the mirror the first time. Despite the eyes, I was the most beautiful thing I\u2019d ever seen.\u201d She laughed at herself for a moment. \u201cIt took some time before I began to blame the beauty for what had happened to me \u2014 for me to see the curse of it. To wish that I had been . . . well, not ugly, but normal. Like Vera. So I could have been allowed to marry someone who loved me, and have pretty babies. That\u2019s what I\u2019d really wanted, all along. It still doesn\u2019t seem like too much to have asked for.\u201d She was thoughtful for a moment, and I wondered if she\u2019d forgotten my presence again. But then she smiled at me, her expression suddenly triumphant. \u201cYou know, my record is almost as clean as Carlisle\u2019s,\u201d she told me. \u201cBetter than Esme. A thousand times better than Edward. I\u2019ve never tasted human blood,\u201d she announced proudly. She understood my puzzled expression as I wondered why her record was only almost as clean. \u00a0\u201cI did murder five humans,\u201d she told me in a complacent tone. \u201cIf you can really call them human . But I was very careful not to spill their blood \u2014 I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to resist that, and I didn\u2019t want any part of them in me, you see. \u00a0\u201cI saved Royce for last. I hoped that he would hear of his friends\u2019 deaths and understand, know what was coming for him. I hoped the fear would make the end worse for him. I think it worked. He was hiding inside a windowless room behind a door as thick as a bank vault\u2019s, guarded outside by armed men, when I caught up with him. Oops \u2014 seven murders,\u201d she corrected herself. \u201cI forgot about his guards. They only took a second.\u201d \u00a0\u201cI was overly theatrical. It was kind of childish, really. I wore a wedding dress I\u2019d stolen for the occasion. He screamed when he saw me. He screamed a lot that night. Saving him for last was a good idea \u2014 it made it easier for me to control myself, to make it slower \u2014\u201d  She broke off suddenly, and she glanced down at me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said in a chagrined voice. \u201cI\u2019m frightening you, aren\u2019t I?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I lied. \u00a0\u201cI got carried away.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m surprised Edward didn\u2019t tell you more about it.\u201d \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like to tell other people\u2019s stories \u2014 he feels like he\u2019s betraying confidences, because he hears so much more than just the parts they mean for him to hear.\u201d She smiled and shook her head. \u201cI probably ought to give him more credit. He\u2019s really quite decent, isn\u2019t he?\u201d \u201cI think so.\u201d \u00a0\u201cI can tell.\u201d Then she sighed. \u201cI haven\u2019t been fair to you, either, Bella. Did he tell you why? Or was that too confidential?\u201d \u201cHe said it was because I was human. He said it was harder for you to have someone on the outside who knew.\u201d  Rosalie\u2019s musical laughter interrupted me. \u201cNow I really feel guilty. He\u2019s been much, much kinder to me than I deserve.\u201d She seemed warmer as she laughed, like she\u2019d let down some guard that had never been absent in my presence before. \u201cWhat a liar that boy is.\u201d She laughed again. \u00a0\u201cHe was lying?\u201d I asked, suddenly wary. \u201cWell, that\u2019s probably putting it too strongly. He just didn\u2019t tell you the whole story. What he told you was true, even truer now than it was before. However, at the time . . .\u201d She broke off, chuckling nervously. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing. You see, at first, I was mostly jealous because he wanted you and not me.\u201d Her words sent a thrill of fear through me. Sitting there in the silver light, she was more beautiful than anything else I could imagine. I could not compete with Rosalie. \u201cBut you love Emmett . . . ,\u201d I mumbled. She shook her head back and forth, amused. \u201cI don\u2019t want Edward that way, Bella. I never did \u2014 I love him as a brother, but he\u2019s irritated me from the first moment I heard him speak. You have to understand, though . . . I was so used to people wanting me . And Edward wasn\u2019t the least bit interested. It frustrated me, even offended me in the beginning. But he never wanted anyone, so it didn\u2019t bother me long. Even when we first met Tanya\u2019s clan in Denali \u2014 all those females! \u2014 Edward never showed the slightest preference. And then he met you.\u201d She looked at me with confused eyes. I was only half paying attention. I was thinking about Edward and Tanya and all those females, and my lips pressed together in a hard line. \u00a0\u201cNot that you aren\u2019t pretty, Bella,\u201d she said, misreading my expression. \u201cBut it just meant that he found you more attractive than me. I\u2019m vain enough that I minded.\u201d \u201cBut you said \u2018at first.\u2019 That doesn\u2019t still . . . bother you, does it? I mean, we both know you\u2019re the most beautiful person on the planet.\u201d I laughed at having to say the words \u2014 it was so obvious. How odd that Rosalie should need such reassurances. Rosalie laughed, too. \u201cThanks, Bella. And no, it doesn\u2019t really bother me anymore. Edward has always been a little strange.\u201d She laughed again. \u201cBut you still don\u2019t like me,\u201d I whispered. Her smile faded. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d We sat in silence for a moment, and she didn\u2019t seem inclined to go on. \u201cWould you tell me why? Did I do something . . . ?\u201d Was she angry that I\u2019d put her family \u2014 her Emmett \u2014 in danger? Time and time again. James, and now Victoria . . . \u00a0\u201cNo, you haven\u2019t done anything,\u201d she murmured. \u201cNot yet.\u201d I stared at her, perplexed. \u201cDon\u2019t you see, Bella?\u201d Her voice was suddenly more passionate than before, even while she\u2019d told her unhappy story. \u201cYou already have everything . You have a whole life ahead of you \u2014 everything I want.  And you\u2019re going to just throw it away . Can\u2019t you see that I\u2019d trade everything I have to be you? You have the choice that I didn\u2019t have, and you\u2019re choosing wrong !\u201d I flinched back from her fierce expression. I realized my mouth had fallen open and I snapped it shut. She stared at me for a long moment and, slowly, the fervor in her eyes dimmed. Abruptly, she was abashed. \u201cAnd I was so sure that I could do this calmly.\u201d She shook her head, seeming a little dazed by the flood of emotion. \u201cIt\u2019s just that it\u2019s harder now than it was then, when it was no more than vanity.\u201d She stared at the moon in silence. It was a few moments before I was brave enough to break into her reverie. \u201cWould you like me better if I chose to stay human?\u201d She turned back to me, her lips twitching into a hint of a smile. \u201cMaybe.\u201d \u201cYou did get some of your happy ending, though,\u201d I reminded her. \u201cYou got Emmett.\u201d \u201cI got half.\u201d She grinned. \u201cYou know that I saved Emmett from a bear that was mauling him, and carried him home to Carlisle. But can you guess why I stopped the bear from eating him?\u201d I shook my head. \u201cWith the dark curls . . . the dimples that showed even while he was grimacing in pain . . . the strange innocence that seemed so out of place on a grown man\u2019s face . . . he reminded me of Vera\u2019s little Henry. I didn\u2019t want him to die \u2014 so much that, even though I hated this life, I was selfish enough to ask Carlisle to change him for me. \u00a0\u201cI got luckier than I deserved. Emmett is everything I would have asked for if I\u2019d known myself well enough to know what to ask for. He\u2019s exactly the kind of person someone like me needs. And, oddly enough, he needs me, too. That part worked out better than I could have hoped. But there will never be more than the two of us. And I\u2019ll never sit on a porch somewhere, with him gray-haired by my side, surrounded by our grandchildren.\u201d Her smile was kind now. \u201cThat sounds quite bizarre to you, doesn\u2019t it? In some ways, you are much more mature than I was at eighteen. But in other ways . . . there are many things you\u2019ve probably never thought about seriously. You\u2019re too young to know what you\u2019ll want in ten years, fifteen years \u2014 and too young to give it all up without thinking it through. You don\u2019t want to be rash about \u00a0permanent things, Bella.\u201d She patted my head, but the gesture didn\u2019t feel condescending. I sighed. \u201cJust think about it a little. Once it\u2019s done, it can\u2019t be undone. Esme\u2019s made do with us as substitutes . . . and Alice doesn\u2019t remember anything human so she can\u2019t miss it. . . . You will remember, though. It\u2019s a lot to give up.\u201d But more to get in return, I didn\u2019t say aloud.  \u201cThanks, Rosalie. It\u2019s nice to understand . . . to know you better.\u201d \u00a0\u201cI apologize for being such a monster.\u201d She grinned. \u201cI\u2019ll try to behave myself from now on.\u201d I grinned back at her. We weren\u2019t friends yet, but I was pretty sure she wouldn\u2019t always hate me so much. \u201cI\u2019ll let you sleep now.\u201d Rosalie\u2019s eyes flickered to the bed, and her lips twitched. \u201cI know you\u2019re frustrated that he\u2019s keeping you locked up like this, but don\u2019t give him too bad a time when he gets back.  He loves you more than you know. It terrifies him to be away from you.\u201d She got up silently and ghosted to the door. \u201cGoodnight, Bella,\u201d she whispered as she shut it behind herself. \u201cGoodnight, Rosalie,\u201d I murmured a second too late. It took me a long time to fall asleep after that. When I did sleep, I had a nightmare. I was crawling across the dark, cold stones of an unfamiliar street, under lightly falling snow, leaving a trail of blood smeared behind me. A shadowy angel in a long white dress watched my progress with resentful eyes. The next morning, Alice drove me to school while I stared grumpily out the windshield. I was feeling sleep-deprived, and it made the irritation of my imprisonment that much stronger. \u201cTonight we\u2019ll go out to Olympia or something,\u201d she promised. \u201cThat would be fun, right?\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just lock me in the basement,\u201d I suggested, \u201cand forget the sugar coating?\u201d Alice frowned. \u201cHe\u2019s going to take the Porsche back. I\u2019m not doing a very good job. You\u2019re supposed to be having fun.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault,\u201d I muttered. I couldn\u2019t believe I actually felt guilty. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at lunch.\u201d I trudged off to English. Without Edward, the day was guaranteed to be unbearable. I sulked through my first class, well aware that my attitude wasn\u2019t helping anything. When the bell rang, I got up without much enthusiasm. Mike was there at the door, holding it open for me. \u201cEdward hiking this weekend?\u201d he asked sociably as we walked out into the light rain. \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cYou want to do something tonight?\u201d How could he still sound hopeful? \u201cCan\u2019t. I\u2019ve got a slumber party,\u201d I grumbled. He gave me a strange look as he processed my mood. \u00a0\u201cWho are you \u2014\u201d Mike\u2019s question was cut short as a loud, growling roar erupted from behind us in the parking lot. Everyone on the sidewalk turned to look, staring in disbelief as the noisy black motorcycle screeched to a stop on the edge of the concrete, the engine still snarling. Jacob waved to me urgently. \u201cRun, Bella!\u201d he yelled over the engine\u2019s roar. I was frozen for a second before I understood. I looked at Mike quickly. I knew I only had seconds. How far would Alice go to restrain me in public? \u201cI got really sick and went home, okay?\u201d I said to Mike, my voice filled with sudden excitement. \u201cFine,\u201d he muttered. I pecked Mike swiftly on the cheek. \u201cThanks, Mike. I owe you one!\u201d I called as I sprinted away. Jacob revved his engine, grinning. I jumped on the back of his seat, wrapping my arms tightly around his waist. I caught sight of Alice, frozen at the edge of the cafeteria, her eyes sparking with fury, her lip curled back over her teeth. I shot her one pleading glance. Then we were racing across the blacktop so fast that my stomach got lost somewhere behind me. \u201cHold on,\u201d Jacob shouted. I hid my face in his back as he sped down the highway. I knew he would slow down when we hit the Quileute border. I just had to hold on till then. I prayed silently and fervently that Alice wouldn\u2019t follow, and that Charlie wouldn\u2019t happen to see me. . . . It was obvious when we had reached the safe zone. The bike slowed, and Jacob straightened up and howled with laughter. I opened my eyes. \u201cWe made it,\u201d he shouted. \u201cNot bad for a prison break, eh?\u201d \u201cGood thinking, Jake.\u201d \u201cI remembered what you said about the psychic leech not being about to predict what I\u2019m going to do. I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t think of this \u2014 she wouldn\u2019t have let you go to school.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s why I didn\u2019t consider it.\u201d He laughed triumphantly. \u201cWhat do you want to do today?\u201d \u201cAnything!\u201d I laughed back. It felt great to be free.",

            "en": "7 REPETITION         15. PRESSURE It was spring break in Forks again. When i woke up on Monday morning, I lay in bed for a few seconds absorbing that. Last spring break, I'd been hunted by a vampire, too. I hoped this wasn't some kind of tradition forming. Already I was falling into the pattern of things in La Push. I'd spent Sunday mostly on the beach, while Charlie hung out with Billy at the Blacks' house. I was supposed to be with Jacob, but Jacob had other things to do, so I wandered alone, keeping the secret from Charlie. When Jacob dropped in to check on me, he apologized for ditching me so much. He told me his schedule wasn't always this crazy, but until Victoria was stopped, the wolves were on red alert. When we walked along the beach now, he always held my hand. This made me brood over what Jared had said, about Jacob involving his \"girlfriend.\" I supposed that that was exactly what it looked like from the outside. As long as Jake and I knew how it really was, I shouldn't let those kinds of assumptions bother me. And maybe they wouldn't, if I hadn't known that Jacob would have loved for things to be what they appeared. But his hand felt nice as it warmed mine, and I didn't protest. I worked Tuesday afternoon\u2014Jacob followed me on his bike to make sure I arrived safely\u2014and Mike noticed. \"Are you dating that kid from La Push? The sophomore?\" He asked, poorly disguising the resentment in his tone. I shrugged. \"Not in the technical sense of the word. I do spent most of my time with Jacob, though. He's my best friend.\" Mike's eyes narrowed shrewdly. \"Don't kid yourself, Bella. The guy's head over heels for you.\" \"I know,\" I sighed. \"Life is complicated.\" \"And girls are cruel,\" Mike said under his breath. I supposed that was an easy assumption to make, too. That night, Sam and Emily joined Charlie and me for dessert at Billy's house. Emily brought a cake that would have won over a harder man than Charlie. I could see, as the conversation flowed naturally through a range of casual subjects, that any worries Charlie might have harbored about gangs in La Push were being dissolved. Jake and I skipped out early, to get some privacy. We went out to his garage and sat in the Rabbit. Jacob leaned his head back, his face drawn with exhaustion. \"You need some sleep, Jake.\" \"I'll get around to it.\" He reached over and took my hand. His skin was blazing on mine. \"Is that one of those wolf things?\" I asked him. \"The heat, I mean.\" \"Yeah. We run a little warmer than the normal people. About one-oh-eight, one-oh-nine. I never get cold anymore. I could stand like this\"\u2014he gestured to his bare torso\u2014\"in a snowstorm and it wouldn't bother me. The flakes would turn to rain where I stood.\" \"And you all heal fast\u2014that's a wolf thing, too?\" \"Yeah, wanna see? It's pretty cool.\" His eyes flipped open and he grinned. He reached around me to the glove compartment and dug around for a minute. His hand came out with a pocketknife. \"No, I do not want to see!\" I shouted as soon as I realized what he was thinking. \"Put that away!\" Jacob chuckled, but shoved the knife back where it belonged. \"Fine. It's a good thing we heal, though.\u00a0 You can't go see just any doctor when you're running a temperature that should mean you're dead.\" \"No, I guess not.\" I thought about that for a minute. \"\u2026 And being so big\u2014that's part of it? Is that why you're all worried about Quil?\" \"That and the fact that Quil's grandfather says the kid could fry an egg on his forehead.\" Jacob's face turned hopeless. \"It won't be long now. There's no exact age\u2026 it just builds and builds and then suddenly\u2014\" He broke off, and it was a moment before he could speak again. \"Sometimes, if you get really upset or something, that can trigger it early. But I wasn't upset about anything\u2014I was happy.\" He laughed bitterly. \"Because of you, mostly. That's why it didn't happen to me sooner. Instead it just kept on building up inside me\u2014I was like a time bomb. You know what set me off? I got back from that movie and Billy said I looked weird. That was all, but I just snapped. And then I\u2014I exploded. I almost ripped his face off\u2014my own father!\" He shuddered, and his face paled. \"Is it really bad, Jake?\" I asked anxiously, wishing I had some way to help him. \"Are you miserable?\" \"No, I'm not miserable,\" he told me. \"Not anymore. Not now that you know. That was hard, before.\" He leaned over so that his cheek was resting on top of my head. He was quiet for a moment, and I wondered what he was thinking about. Maybe I didn't want to know. \"What's the hardest part?\" I whispered, still wishing I could help. \"The hardest part is feeling\u2026 out of control,\" he said slowly. \"Feeling like I can't be sure of myself\u2014like maybe you shouldn't be around me, like maybe nobody should. Like I'm a monster who might hurt somebody. You've seen Emily. Sam lost control of his temper for just one second\u2026 and she was standing too close. And now there's nothing he can ever do to put it right again. I hear his thoughts\u2014I know what that feels like\u2026 \"Who wants to be a nightmare, a monster? \"And then, the way it comes so easily to me, the way I'm better at it than the rest of them\u2014does that make me even less human than Enbry or Sam? Sometimes I'm afraid that I'm losing myself.\" \"Is it hard? To find yourself again?\" \"At first,\" he said. \"It takes some practice to phase back and forth. But it's easier for me.\" \"Why?\" I wondered. \"Because Ephraim Black was my father's grandfather, and Quil Ateara was my mother's grandfather.\" \"Quil?\" I asked in confusion. \"His great-grandfather,\" Jacob clarified. \"The Quil you know is my second cousin.\" \"But why does it matter who your great-grandfathers are?\" \"Because Ephraim and Quil were in the last pack. Levi Uley was the third. It's in my blood on both sides.\u00a0 I never had a chance. Like Quil doesn't have a chance.\" His expression was bleak. \"What's the very best part?\" I asked, hoping to cheer him up. \"The best part,\" he said, suddenly smiling again, \"is the speed.\" \"Better than the motorcycles?\" He nodded, enthusiastic. \"There's no comparison.\" \"How fast can you\u2026 ?\" \"Run?\" he finished my question. \"Fast enough. What can I measure it by? We caught\u2026 what was his name? Laurent? I imagine that means more to you than it would to someone else.\" It did mean something to me. I couldn't imagine that\u2014the wolves running faster than a vampire. When the Cullens ran, they all but turned invisible with speed. \"So, tell me something I don't know,\" he said. \"Something about vampires. How did you stand it, being around them? Didn't it creep you out?\" \"No,\" I said curtly. My tone made him thoughtful for a moment. \"Say, why'd your bloodsucker kill that James, anyway?\" he asked suddenly. \"James was trying to kill me\u2014it was like a game for him. He lost. Do you remember last spring when I was in the hospital down in Phoenix?\" Jacob sucked in a breath. \"He got that close?\" \"He got very, very close.\" I stroked my scar. Jacob noticed, because he held the hand I moved. \"What's that?\" He traded hands, examining my right. \"This is your funny scar, the cold one.\" He looked at it closer, with new eyes, and gasped. \"Yes, it's what you think it is,\" I said. \"James bit me.\" His eyes bulged, and his face turned a strange, sallow color under the russet surface. He looked like he was about to be sick. \"But if he bit you\u2026 ? Shouldn't you be\u2026 ?\" He choked. \"Edward saved me twice,\" I whispered. \"He sucked the venom out\u2014you know, like with a rattlesnake.\" I twitched as the pain lashed around the edges of the hole. But I wasn't the only one twitching. I could feel Jacob's whole body trembling next to mine. Even the car shook. \"Careful, Jake. Easy. Calm down.\" \"Yeah,\" he panted. \"Calm.\" He shook his head back and forth quickly. After a moment, only his hands were shaking. \"You okay?\" \"Yeah, almost. Tell me something else. Give me something else to think about.\" \"What do you want to know?\" \"I don't know.\" He had his eyes closed, concentrating. \"The extra stuff I guess. Did any of the other Cullens have\u2026 extra talents? Like the mind reading?\" I hesitated a second. This felt like a question he would ask of his spy, not his friend. But what was the point of hiding what I knew? It didn't matter now, and it would help him control himself. So I spoke quickly, the image of Emily's ruined face in my mind, and the hair rising on my arms. I couldn't imagine how the russet wolf would fit inside the Rabbit\u2014Jacob would tear the whole garage apart if he changed now. \"Jasper could\u2026 sort of control the emotions of the people around him. Not in a bad way, just to calm someone down, that kind of thing. It would probably help Paul a lot,\" I added, teasing weakly. \"And then Alice could see things that were going to happen. The future, you know, but not absolutely. The things she saw would change when someone changed the path they were on\u2026\" Like how she'd seen me dying\u2026 and she'd seen me becoming one of them. Two things that had not happened. And one that never would. My head started to spin\u2014I couldn't seem to pull in enough oxygen from the air. No lungs. Jacob was entirely in control now, very still beside me. \"Why do you do that?\" he asked. He tugged lightly at one of my arms, which was bound around my chest, and then gave up when it wouldn't come loose easily. I hadn't even realized I'd moved them. \"You do that when you're upset. Why?\" \"It hurts to think about them,\" I whispered. \"It's like I can't breathe\u2026 like I'm breaking into pieces\u2026\"It was bizarre how much I could tell Jacob now. We had no more secrets. He smoothed my hair. \"It's okay, Bella, it's okay. I won't bring it up again. I'm sorry.\" \"I'm fine.\" I gasped. \"Happens all the time. Not your fault.\" \"We're a pretty messed-up pair, aren't we?\" Jacob said. \"Neither one of us can hold our shape together right.\" \"Pathetic,\" I agreed, still breathless. \"At least we have each other,\" he said, clearly comforted by the thought. I was comforted, too. \"At least there's that,\" I agreed. And when we were together, it was fine. But Jacob had a horrible, dangerous job he felt compelled to do, and so I was often alone, stuck in La Push for safety, with nothing to do to keep my mind off any of my worries. I felt awkward, always taking up space at Billy's. I did some studying for another Calculus test that was coming up next week, but I could only look at math for so long. When I didn't have something obvious to do in my hands,\u00a0 I felt like I ought to be making conversation with Billy\u2014the pressure of normal societal rules. But Billy wasn't one for filling up the long silences, and so the awkwardness continued. I tried hanging out at Emily's place Wednesday afternoon, for a change. At first it was kind of nice. Emily was a cheerful person who never sat still. I drifted behind her while she flitted around her little house and yard, scrubbing at the <em>spotless</em> floor, pulling a tiny weed, fixing a broken hinge, tugging a string of wool through an ancient loom, and always cooking, too. She complained lightly about the increase in the boys' appetites from all their extra running, but it was easy to see she didn't mind taking care of them. It wasn't hard to be with her\u2014after all, we were both wolf girls now. But Sam checked in after I'd been there for a few hours. I only stayed long enough to ascertain that Jacob was fine and there was no news, and then I had to escape. The aura of love and contentment that surrounded them was harder to take in concentrated doses, with no one else around to dilute it. So that left me wandering the beach, pacing the length of the rocky crescent back and forth, again and again. Alone time wasn't good for me. Thanks to the new honesty with Jacob, I'd been talking and thinking about the Cullens way too much. No matter how I tried to distract myself\u2014and I had plenty to think of: I was honestly and desperately worried about Jacob and his wolf-brothers, I was terrified for Charlie and the others who thought they were hunting animals, I was getting in deeper and deeper with Jacob without ever having consciously decided to progress in that direction and I didn't know what to do about it\u2014none of these very real, very deserving of thought, very pressing concerns could take my mind off the pain in my chest for long. Eventually, I couldn't even walk anymore, because I couldn't breathe. I sat down on a patch of semidry rocks and curled up in a ball. Jacob found me like that, and I could tell from his expression that he understood. \"Sorry,\" he said right away. He pulled me up from the ground and wrapped both arms around my shoulders. I hadn't realized that I was cold until then. His warmth made me shudder, but at least I could breathe with him there. \"I'm ruining your spring break,\" Jacob accused himself as we walked back up the beach. \"No, you're not. I didn't have any plans. I don't think I like spring breaks, anyway.\" \"I'll take tomorrow morning off. The others can run without me. We'll do something fun.\" The word seemed out of place in my life right now, barely comprehensible, bizarre. \"Fun?\" \"Fun is exactly what you need. Hmm\u2026\" he gazed out across the heaving gray waves, deliberating. As his eyes scanned the horizon, he had a flash of inspiration. \"Got it!\" he crowed. \"Another promise to keep.\" \"What are you talking about?\" He let go of my hand and pointed toward the southern edge of the beach, where the flat, rocky half-moon dead-ended against the sheer sea cliffs. I stared, uncomprehending. \"Didn't I promise to take you cliff diving?\" I shivered. \"Yeah, it'll be pretty cold\u2014not as cold as it is today. Can you feel the weather changing? The pressure?\u00a0 It will be warmer tomorrow. You up for it?\" The dark water did not look inviting, and, from this angle, the cliffs looked even higher than before. But it had been days since I'd heard Edward's voice. That was probably part of the problem. I was addicted to the sound of my delusions. It made things worse if I went too long without them. Jumping off a cliff was certain to remedy that situation. \"Sure, I'm up for it. Fun.\" \"It's a date,\" he said, and draped his arm around my shoulders. \"Okay\u2014now let's go get you some sleep.\" I didn't like the way the circles under his eyes were beginning to look permanently etched onto his skin. I woke early the next morning and snuck a change of clothes out to the truck. I had a feeling that Charlie would approve of today's plan just about as much as he would approve of the motorcycle. The idea of a distraction from all my worries had me almost excited. Maybe it would be fun. A date with Jacob, a date with Edward\u2026 I laughed darkly to myself. Jake could say what he wanted about us being a messed-up pair\u2014I was the one who was truly messed up. I made the werewolf seem downright normal. I expected Jacob to meet me out front, the way he usually did when my noisy truck announced my arrival. When he didn't, I guessed that he might still be sleeping. I would wait\u2014let him get as much rest as he could. He needed his sleep, and that would give the day time to warm a bit more. Jake had been right about the weather, though; it had changed in the night. A thick layer of clouds pressed heavily on the atmosphere now, making it almost sultry; it was warm and close under the gray blanket. I left my sweater in the truck. I knocked quietly on the door. \"C'mon in, Bella,\" Billy said. He was at the kitchen table, eating cold cereal. \"Jake sleeping?\" \"Er, no.\" He set his spoon down, and his eyebrows pulled together. \"What happened?\" I demanded. I could tell from his expression that something had. \"Embry, Jared, and Paul crossed a fresh trail early this morning. Sam and Jake took off to help. Sam was hopeful\u2014she's hedged herself in beside the mountains. He thinks they have a good chance to finish this.\" \"Oh, no, Billy,\" I whispered. \"Oh, no.\" He chuckled, deep and low. \"Do you really like La Push so well that you want to extend your sentence here?\" \"Don't make jokes, Billy. This is too scary for that.\" \"You're right,\" he agreed, still complacent. His ancient eyes were impossible to read. \"This one's tricky.\" I bit my lip. \"It's not as dangerous for them as you think it is. Sam knows what he's doing. You're the one that you should worry about. The vampire doesn't want to fight them. She's just trying to find a way around them\u2026 to you.\" \"How does Sam know what he's doing?\" I demanded, brushing aside his concern for me. \"They've only killed just the one vampire\u2014that could have been luck.\" \"We take what we do very seriously, Bella. Nothing's been forgotten. Everything they need to know has been passed down from father to son for generations.\" That didn't comfort me the way he probably intended it to. The memory of Victoria, wild, catlike, lethal, was too strong in my head. If she couldn't get around the wolves, she would eventually try to go through them. Billy went back to his breakfast; I sat down on the sofa and flipped aimlessly though the TV channels. That didn't last long. I started to feel closed in by the small room, claustrophobic, upset by the fact that I couldn't see out the curtained windows. \"I'll be at the beach,\" I told Billy abruptly, and hurried out the door. Being outside didn't help as much as I'd hoped. The clouds pushed down with an invisible weight that kept the claustrophobia from easing. The forest seemed strangely vacant as I walked toward the beach. I didn't see any animals\u2014no birds, no squirrels. I couldn't hear any birds, either. The silence was eerie; there wasn't even the sound of wind in the trees.  I knew it was all just a product of the weather, but it still made me edgy. The heavy, warm pressure of the atmosphere was perceptible even to my weak human senses, and it hinted at something major in the storm department. A glance at the sky backed this up; the clouds were churning sluggishly despite the lack of breeze on the ground. The closest clouds were a smoky gray, but between the cracks I could see another layer that was a gruesome purple color. The skies had a ferocious plan in store for today. The animals must be bunkering down. As soon as I reached the beach, I wished I hadn't come\u2014I'd already had enough of this place. I'd been here almost every day, wandering alone. Was it so much different from my nightmares? But where else to go? I trudged down to the driftwood tree, and sat at the end so that I could lean against the tangled roots. I stared up at the angry sky broodingly, waiting for the first drops to break the stillness. I tried not to think about the danger Jacob and his friends were in. Because nothing could happen to Jacob. The thought was unendurable. I'd lost too much already\u2014would fate take the last few shreds of peace left behind? That seemed unfair, out of balance. But maybe I'd violated some unknown rule, crossed some line that had condemned me. Maybe it was wrong to be so involved with myths and legends, to turn my back on the human world. Maybe\u2026 No. Nothing would happen to Jacob. I had to believe that or I wouldn't be able to function. \"Argh!\" I groaned, and jumped off the log. I couldn't sit still; it was worse than pacing.  I'd really been counting on hearing Edward this morning. It seemed like that was the one thing that might make it bearable to live through this day. The hole had been festering lately, like it was getting revenge for the times that Jacob's presence had tamed it. The edges burned. The waves picked up as I paced, beginning to crash against the rocks, but there was still no wind. I felt pinned down by the pressure of the storm. Everything swirled around me, but it was perfectly still where I stood. The air had a faint electric charge\u2014I could feel the static in my hair. Farther out, the waves were angrier than they were along the shore. I could see them battering against the line of the cliffs, spraying big white clouds of sea foam into the sky. There was still no movement in the air, though the clouds roiled more quickly now. It was eerie looking\u2014like the clouds were moving by their own will. I shivered, though I knew it was just a trick of the pressure. The cliffs were a black knife edge against the livid sky. Staring at them, I remembered the day Jacob had told me about Sam and his \"gang.\" I thought of the boys\u2014the werewolves\u2014throwing themselves into the empty air. The image of the falling, spiraling figures was still vivid in my mind. I imagined the utter freedom of the fall\u2026 I imagined the way Edward's voice would have sounded in my head\u2014furious, velvet, perfect\u2026 The burning in my chest flared agonizingly. There had to be some way to quench it. The pain was growing more and more intolerable by the second. I glared at the cliffs and the crashing waves. Well, why not? Why not quench it right now? Jacob had promised me cliff diving, hadn't he? Just because he was unavailable, should I have to give up the distraction I needed so badly\u2014needed even worse because Jacob was out risking his life? Risking it, in essence, for me. If it weren't for me, Victoria would not be killing people here\u2026 just somewhere else, far away. If anything happened to Jacob, it would be my fault. That realization stabbed deep and had me jogging back up to the road toward Billy's house, where my truck waited. I knew my way to the lane that passed closest to the cliffs, but I had to hunt for the little path that would take me out to the ledge. As I followed it, I looked for turns or forks, knowing that Jake had planned to take me off the lower outcropping rather than the top, but the path wound in a thin single line toward the brink with no options. I didn't have time to find another way down\u2014the storm was moving in quickly now. The wind was finally beginning to touch me, the clouds pressing closer to the ground. Just as I reached the place where the dirt path fanned out into the stone precipice, the first drops broke through and splattered on my face. It was not hard to convince myself that I didn't have time to search for another way\u2014I wanted to jump from the top. This was the image that had lingered in my head. I wanted the long fall that would feel like flying. I knew that this was the stupidest, most reckless thing I had done yet. The thought made me smile. The pain was already easing, as if my body knew that Edward's voice was just seconds away\u2026 The ocean sounded very far away, somehow farther than before, when I was on the path in the trees. I grimaced when I thought of the probable temperature of the water. But I wasn't going to let that stop me. The wind blew stronger now, whipping the rain into eddies around me. I stepped out to the edge, keeping my eyes on the empty space in front of me. My toes felt ahead blindly, caressing the edge of the rock when they encountered it. I drew in a deep breath and held it . . waiting. \"Bella.\" I smiled and exhaled. Yes? I didn't answer out loud, for fear that the sound of my voice would shatter the beautiful illusion. He sounded so real, so close. It was only when he was disapproving like this that I could hear the true memory of his voice\u2014the velvet texture and the musical intonation that made up the most perfect of all voices. \"Don't do this,\" he pleaded. You wanted me to be human, I reminded him. Well, watch me. \"Please. For me.\" But you won't stay with me any other way. \"Please.\" It was just a whisper in the blowing rain that tossed my hair and drenched my clothes\u2014making me as wet as if this were my second jump of the day. I rolled up onto the balls of my feet. \"No, Bella!\" He was angry now, and the anger was so lovely. I smiled and raised my arms straight out, as if I were going to dive, lifting my face into the rain. But it was too ingrained from years of swimming at the public pool\u2014feet first, first time. I leaned forward, crouching to get more spring\u2026 And I flung myself off the cliff. I screamed as I dropped through the open air like a meteor, but it was a scream of exhilaration and not fear. The wind resisted, trying vainly to fight the\u00a0 unconquerable gravity, pushing against me and twirling me in spirals like a rocket crashing to the earth. Yes! The word echoed through my head as I sliced through the surface of the water. It was icy, colder than I'd feared, and yet the chill only added to the high. I was proud of myself as I plunged deeper into the freezing black water. I hadn't had one moment of terror\u2014just pure adrenaline. Really, the fall wasn't scary at all. Where was the challenge? That was when the current caught me. I'd been so preoccupied by the size of the cliffs, by the obvious danger of their high, sheer faces, that I hadn't worried at all about the dark water waiting. I never dreamed that the true menace was lurking far below me, under the heaving surf. It felt like the waves were fighting over me, jerking me back and forth between them as if determined to share by pulling me into halves. I knew the right way to avoid a riptide: swim parallel to the beach rather than struggling for the shore. But the knowledge did me little good when I didn't know which way the shore was. I couldn't even tell which way the surface was. The angry water was black in every direction; there was no brightness to direct me upward. Gravity was all-powerful when it competed with the air, but it had nothing on the waves\u2014I couldn't feel a downward pull, a sinking in any direction. Just the battering of the current that flung me round and round like a rag doll. I fought to keep my breath in, to keep my lips locked around my last store of oxygen. It didn't surprise me that my delusion of Edward was there. He owed me that much, considering that I was dying. I was surprised by how sure that knowledge was. I was going to drown. I was drowning. \"Keep swimming!\" Edward begged urgently in my head. Where? There was nothing but the darkness. There was no place to swim to. \"Stop that!\" he ordered. \"Don't you dare give up!\" The cold of the water was numbing my arms and legs. I didn't feel the buffeting so much as before. It was more of just a dizziness now, a helpless spinning in the water. But I listened to him. I forced my arms to continue reaching, my legs to kick harder, though every second I was facing a new direction. It couldn't be doing any good. What was the point? \"Fight!\" he yelled. \"Damn it, Bella, keep fighting.\" Why? I didn't want to fight anymore. And it wasn't the light-headedness, or the cold, or the failure of my arms as the muscles gave out in exhaustion, that made me content to stay where I was. I was almost happy that it was over. This was an easier death than others I'd faced. Oddly peaceful. I thought briefly of the clich\u00e9s, about how you were suppose to see your life flash before your eyes. I was so much luckier. Who wanted to see a rerun, anyway? I saw him, and I had no will to fight. It was so clear, so much more defined than any memory. My subconscious had stored Edward away in flawless detail, saving him for this final moment. I could see his perfect face as if he were really there; the exact shade of his icy skin, the shape of his lips, the line of his jaw, the gold glinting in his furious eyes. He was angry, naturally, that I was giving up. His teeth were clenched and his nostrils flared with rage. \"No! Bella, no!\" My ears were flooded with the freezing water, but his voice was clearer than ever. I ignored his words and concentrated on the sound of his voice. Why would I fight when I was so happy where I was? Even as my lungs burned for more air and my legs cramped in the icy cold, I was content. I'd forgotten what real happiness felt like. Happiness. It made the whole dying thing pretty bearable. The current won at that moment, shoving me abruptly against something hard, a rock invisible in the gloom. It hit me solidly across the chest, slamming into me like an iron bar, and the breath whooshed out of my lungs, escaping in a thick cloud of silver bubbles. Water flooded down my throat, choking and burning. The iron bar seemed to be dragging me, pulling me away from Edward, deeper into the dark, to the ocean floor. Goodbye, I love you, was my last thought.",

            "en": "3. MOTIVES THE SUN WAS SO DEEPLY BURIED BEHIND THE CLOUDS that there was no way to tell if it had set or not. After the long flight \u2014 chasing the sun westward so that it seemed unmoving in the sky \u2014 it was especially disorienting; time seemed oddly variable. It took me by surprise when the forest gave way to the first buildings, signaling that we were nearly home. \u201cYou\u2019ve been very quiet,\u201d Edward observed. \u201cDid the plane make you sick?\u201d \u201cNo, I\u2019m okay.\u201d \u201cAre you sad to leave?\u201d \u201cMore relieved than sad, I think.\u201d He raised one eyebrow at me. I knew it was useless and \u2014 much as I hated to admit it \u2014 unnecessary to ask him to keep his eyes on the road. \u201cRen\u00e9e is so much more . . .perceptive than Charlie in some ways. It was making me jumpy.\u201d Edward laughed. \u201cYour mother has a very interesting mind. Almost childlike, but very insightful. She sees things differently than other people.\u201d Insightful. It was a good description of my mother \u2014 when she was paying attention. Most of the time Ren\u00e9e was so bewildered by her own life that she didn\u2019t notice much else. But this weekend she\u2019d been paying plenty of attention to me. Phil was busy \u2014 the high school baseball team he coached was in the playoffs \u2014 and being alone with Edward and me had only sharpened Ren\u00e9e\u2019s focus. As soon as the hugs and squeals of delight were out of the way, Ren\u00e9e began to watch. And as she\u2019d watched, her wide blue eyes had become first confused and then concerned. This morning we\u2019d gone for a walk along the beach. She wanted to show off all the beauties of her new home, still hoping, I think, that the sun might lure me away from Forks. She\u2019d also wanted to talk with me alone, and that was easily arranged. Edward had fabricated a term paper to give himself an excuse to stay indoors during the day. In my head, I went through the conversation again. . . . Ren\u00e9e and I ambled along the sidewalk, trying to stay in the range of the infrequent palm tree shadows. Though it was early, the heat was smothering. The air was so heavy with moisture that just breathing in and out was giving my lungs a workout. \u201cBella?\u201d my mother asked, looking out past the sand to the lightly crashing waves as she spoke. \u201cWhat is it, Mom?\u201d She sighed, not meeting my gaze. \u201cI\u2019m worried. . . .\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked, anxious at once. \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not me.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m worried about you . . . and Edward.\u201d Ren\u00e9e finally looked at me when she said his name, her face apologetic. \u201cOh,\u201d I mumbled, fixing my eyes on a pair of joggers as they passed us, drenched with sweat. \u201cYou two are more serious than I\u2019d been thinking,\u201d she went on. I frowned, quickly reviewing the last two days in my head. Edward and I had barely touched \u2014 in front of her, at least. I wondered if Ren\u00e9e was about to give me a lecture on responsibility, too. I didn\u2019t mind that the way I had with Charlie. It wasn\u2019t embarrassing with my mom. After all, I\u2019d been the one giving her that lecture time and time again in the last ten years. \u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s something . . . strange about the way you two are together,\u201d she murmured, her forehead creasing over her troubled eyes. \u201cThe way he watches you \u2014 it\u2019s so . . . protective. Like he\u2019s about to throw himself in front of a bullet to save you or something.\u201d I laughed, though I was still not able to meet her gaze. \u201cThat\u2019s a bad thing?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d She frowned as she struggled for the words. \u201cIt\u2019s just different . He\u2019s very intense about you . . . and very careful. I feel like I don\u2019t really understand your relationship. Like there\u2019s some secret I\u2019m missing. . . .\u201d \u201cI think you\u2019re imagining things, Mom,\u201d I said quickly, struggling to keep my voice light. There was a flutter in my stomach. I\u2019d forgotten how much my mother saw . Something about her simple view of the world cut through all the distractions and pierced right to the truth of things. This had never been a problem before. Until now, there had never been a secret I couldn\u2019t tell her. \u201cIt\u2019s not just him.\u201d She set her lips defensively. \u201cI wish you could see how you move around him.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u00a0\u201cThe way you move \u2014 you orient yourself around him without even thinking about it. When he moves, even a little bit, you adjust your position at the same time. Like magnets . . . or gravity. You\u2019re like a . . . satellite, or something. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d She pursed her lips and stared down. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me,\u201d I teased, forcing a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re reading mysteries again, aren\u2019t you? Or is it sci-fi this time?\u201d Ren\u00e9e flushed a delicate pink. \u201cThat\u2019s beside the point.\u201d \u201cFound anything good?\u201d \u201cWell, there was one \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t matter. We\u2019re talking about you right now.\u201d \u201cYou should stick to romance, Mom. You know how you freak yourself out.\u201d Her lips turned up at the corners. \u201cI\u2019m being silly, aren\u2019t I?\u201d For half a second I couldn\u2019t answer. Ren\u00e9e was so easily swayed. Sometimes it was a good thing, because not all of her ideas were practical. But it pained me to see how quickly she caved in to my trivializing, especially since she was dead right this time. She looked up, and I controlled my expression. \u201cNot silly \u2014 just being a mom.\u201d She laughed and then gestured grandly toward the white sands stretching to the blue water. \u201cAnd all this isn\u2019t enough to get you to move back in with your silly mom?\u201d I wiped my hand dramatically across my forehead, and then pretended to wring my hair out. \u201cYou get used to the humidity,\u201d she promised. \u201cYou can get used to rain, too,\u201d I countered. She elbowed me playfully and then took my hand as we walked back to her car. Other than her worries about me, she seemed happy enough. Content. She still looked at Phil with goo-goo eyes, and that was comforting. Surely her life was full and satisfying. Surely she didn\u2019t miss me that much, even now. . . . Edward\u2019s icy fingers brushed my cheek. I looked up, blinking, coming back to the present. He leaned down and kissed my forehead. \u201cWe\u2019re home, Sleeping Beauty. Time to awake.\u201d We were stopped in front of Charlie\u2019s house. The porch light was on and the cruiser was parked in the driveway. As I examined the house, I saw the curtain twitch in the living room window, flashing a line of yellow light across the dark lawn. I sighed. Of course Charlie was waiting to pounce. Edward must have been thinking the same thing, because his expression was stiff and his eyes remote as he came to get my door for me. \u201cHow bad?\u201d I asked. \u201cCharlie\u2019s not going to be difficult,\u201d Edward promised, his voice level with no hint of humor. \u201cHe missed you.\u201d My eyes narrowed in doubt. If that was the case, then why was Edward tensed as if for a battle? My bag was small, but he insisted on carrying it into the house. Charlie held the door open for us. \u201cWelcome home, kid!\u201d Charlie shouted like he really meant it. \u201cHow was Jacksonville?\u201d \u201cMoist. And buggy.\u201d \u201cSo Ren\u00e9e didn\u2019t sell you on the University of Florida?\u201d \u201cShe tried. But I\u2019d rather drink water than inhale it.\u201d Charlie\u2019s eyes flickered unwillingly to Edward. \u201cDid you have a nice time?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d Edward answered in a serene voice. \u201cRen\u00e9e was very hospitable.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s . . . um, good. Glad you had fun.\u201d Charlie turned away from Edward and pulled me in for an unexpected hug. \u201cImpressive,\u201d I whispered in his ear. He rumbled a laugh. \u201cI really missed you, Bells. The food around here sucks when you\u2019re gone.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll get on it,\u201d I said as he let me go. \u201cWould you call Jacob first? He\u2019s been bugging me every five minutes since six o\u2019clock this morning. I promised I\u2019d have you call him before you even unpacked.\u201d I didn\u2019t have to look at Edward to feel that he was too still, too cold beside me. So this was the cause of his tension. \u201cJacob wants to talk to me?\u201d \u201cPretty bad, I\u2019d say. He wouldn\u2019t tell me what it was about \u2014 just said it was important.\u201d The phone rang then, shrill and demanding. \u201cThat\u2019s him again, I\u2019d bet my next paycheck,\u201d Charlie muttered. \u201cI got it.\u201d I hurried to the kitchen. Edward followed after me while Charlie disappeared into the living room. I grabbed the phone mid-ring, and twisted around so that I was facing the wall. \u201cHello?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re back,\u201d Jacob said. His familiar husky voice sent a wave of wistfulness through me. A thousand memories spun in my head, tangling together \u2014 a rocky beach strewn with driftwood trees, a garage made of plastic sheds, warm sodas in a paper bag, a tiny room with one too-small shabby loveseat. The laughter in his deep-set black eyes, the feverish heat of his big hand around mine, the flash of his white teeth against his dark skin, his face stretching into the wide smile that had always been like a key to a secret door where only kindred spirits could enter. It felt sort of like homesickness, this longing for the place and person who had sheltered me through my darkest night. I cleared the lump from my throat. \u201cYes,\u201d I answered. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call me?\u201d Jacob demanded. His angry tone instantly got my back up. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve been in the house for exactly four seconds and your call interrupted Charlie telling me that you\u2019d called.\u201d \u201cOh. Sorry.\u201d \u201cSure. Now, why are you harassing Charlie?\u201d \u201cI need to talk to you.\u201d \u201cYeah, I figured out that part all by myself. Go ahead.\u201d There was a short pause. \u201cYou going to school tomorrow?\u201d I frowned to myself, unable to make sense of this question. \u201cOf course I am. Why wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d \u201cI dunno. Just curious.\u201d Another pause. \u201cSo what did you want to talk about, Jake?\u201d He hesitated. \u201cNothing really, I guess. I . . . wanted to hear your voice.\u201d \u201cYeah, I know. I\u2019m so glad you called me, Jake. I . . .\u201d But I didn\u2019t know what more to say. I wanted to tell him I was on my way to La Push right now. And I couldn\u2019t tell him that. \u201cI have to go,\u201d he said abruptly. \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you soon, okay?\u201d \u201cBut Jake \u2014\u201d He was already gone. I listened to the dial tone with disbelief. \u201cThat was short,\u201d I muttered. \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d Edward asked. His voice was low and careful. I turned slowly to face him. His expression was perfectly smooth \u2014 impossible to read. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I wonder what that was about.\u201d It didn\u2019t make sense that Jacob had been hounding Charlie all day just to ask me if I was going to school. And if he\u2019d wanted to hear my voice, then why did he hang up so quickly? \u201cYour guess is probably better than mine,\u201d Edward said, the hint of a smile tugging at the corner of his mouth. \u201cMmm,\u201d I murmured. That was true. I knew Jake inside and out. It shouldn\u2019t be that complicated to figure out his motivations. With my thoughts miles away \u2014 about fifteen miles away, up the road to La Push \u2014 I started combing through the fridge, assembling ingredients for Charlie\u2019s dinner. Edward leaned against the counter, and I was distantly aware that his eyes were on my face, but too preoccupied to worry about what he saw there. The school thing seemed like the key to me. That was the only real question Jake had asked. And he had to be after an answer to something, or he wouldn\u2019t have been bugging Charlie so persistently. Why would my attendance record matter to him, though? I tried to think about it in a logical way. So, if I hadn\u2019t been going to school tomorrow, what would be the problem with that, from Jacob\u2019s perspective? Charlie had given me a little grief about missing a day of school so close to finals, but I\u2019d convinced him that one Friday wasn\u2019t going to derail my studies. Jake would hardly care about that. My brain refused to come up with any brilliant insights. Maybe I was missing some vital piece of information. What could have changed in the past three days that was so important that Jacob would break his long streak of refusing to answer my phone calls and contact me? What difference could three days make? I froze in the middle of the kitchen. The package of icy hamburger in my hands slipped through my numb fingers. It took me a slow second to miss the thud it should have made against the floor. Edward had caught it and thrown it onto the counter. His arms were already around me, his lips at my ear. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I shook my head, dazed. Three days could change everything. Hadn\u2019t I just been thinking about how impossible college was? How I couldn\u2019t be anywhere near people after I\u2019d gone through the painful three-day conversion that would set me free from mortality, so that I could spend eternity with Edward? The conversion that would make me forever a prisoner to my own thirst. . . . Had Charlie told Billy that I\u2019d vanished for three days? Had Billy jumped to conclusions? Had Jacob really been asking me if I was still human? Making sure that the werewolves\u2019 treaty was unbroken \u2014 that none of the Cullens had dared to bite a human . . . bite, not kill . . . ? But did he honestly think I would come home to Charlie if that was the case? Edward shook me. \u201cBella?\u201d he asked, truly anxious now. \u201cI think . . . I think he was checking,\u201d I mumbled. \u201cChecking to make sure. That I\u2019m human, I mean.\u201d Edward stiffened, and a low hiss sounded in my ear. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to leave,\u201d I whispered. \u201cBefore. So that it doesn\u2019t break the treaty. We won\u2019t ever be able to come back.\u201d His arms tightened around me. \u201cI know.\u201d \u201cAhem.\u201d Charlie cleared his voice loudly behind us. I jumped, and then pulled free of Edward\u2019s arms, my face getting hot. Edward leaned back against the counter. His eyes were tight. I could see worry in them, and anger. \u00a0\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to make dinner, I can call for a pizza,\u201d Charlie hinted. \u201cNo, that\u2019s okay, I\u2019m already started.\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d Charlie said. He propped himself against the doorframe, folding his arms. I sighed and got to work, trying to ignore my audience. \u201cIf I asked you to do something, would you trust me?\u201d Edward asked, an edge to his soft voice. We were almost to school. Edward had been relaxed and joking just a moment ago, and now suddenly his hands were clenched tight on the steering wheel, his knuckles straining in an effort not to snap it into pieces. I stared at his anxious expression \u2014 his eyes were far away, like he was listening to distant voices. My pulse sped in response to his stress, but I answered carefully. \u201cThat depends.\u201d We pulled into the school lot. \u201cI was afraid you would say that.\u201d \u201cWhat do you want me to do, Edward?\u201d \u201cI want you to stay in the car.\u201d He pulled into his usual spot and turned the engine off as he spoke. \u201cI want you to wait here until I come back for you.\u201d \u201cBut . . .why ?\u201d That was when I saw him. He would have been hard to miss, towering over the students the way he did, even if he hadn\u2019t been leaning against his black motorcycle, parked illegally on the sidewalk. \u201cOh.\u201d Jacob\u2019s face was a calm mask that I recognized well. It was the face he used when he was determined to keep his emotions in check, to keep himself under control. It made him look like Sam, the oldest of the wolves, the leader of the Quileute pack. But Jacob could never quite manage the perfect serenity Sam always exuded. I\u2019d forgotten how much this face bothered me. Though I\u2019d gotten to know Sam pretty well before the Cullens had come back \u2014 to like him, even \u2014 I\u2019d never been able to completely shake the resentment I felt when Jacob mimicked Sam\u2019s expression. It was a stranger\u2019s face. He wasn\u2019t my Jacob when he wore it. \u201cYou jumped to the wrong conclusion last night,\u201d Edward murmured. \u201cHe asked about school because he knew that I would be where you were. He was looking for a safe place to talk to me. A place with witnesses.\u201d So I\u2019d misinterpreted Jacob\u2019s motives last night. Missing information, that was the problem. Information like why in the world Jacob would want to talk to Edward. \u201cI\u2019m not staying in the car,\u201d I said. Edward groaned quietly. \u201cOf course not. Well, let\u2019s get this over with.\u201d Jacob\u2019s face hardened as we walked toward him, hand in hand. I noticed other faces, too \u2014 the faces of my classmates. I noticed how their eyes widened as they took in all six foot seven inches of Jacob\u2019s long body, muscled up the way no normal sixteen-and-a-half-year-old ever had been. I saw those eyes rake over his tight black t-shirt \u2014 short-sleeved, though the day was unseasonably cool \u2014 his ragged, grease-smeared jeans, and the glossy black bike he leaned against. Their eyes didn\u2019t linger on his face \u2014 something about his expression had them glancing quickly away. And I noticed the wide berth everyone gave him, the bubble of space that no one dared to encroach on. With a sense of astonishment, I realized that Jacob looked dangerous to them. How odd. Edward stopped a few yards away from Jacob, and I could tell that he was uncomfortable having me so close to a werewolf. He drew his hand back slightly, pulling me halfway behind his body. \u201cYou could have called us,\u201d Edward said in a steel-hard voice. \u201cSorry,\u201d Jacob answered, his face twisting into a sneer. \u201cI don\u2019t have any leeches on my speed dial.\u201d \u201cYou could have reached me at Bella\u2019s house, of course.\u201d Jacob\u2019s jaw flexed, and his brows pulled together. He didn\u2019t answer. \u201cThis is hardly the place, Jacob. Could we discuss this later?\u201d \u201cSure, sure. I\u2019ll stop by your crypt after school.\u201d Jacob snorted. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with now?\u201d Edward looked around pointedly, his eyes resting on the witnesses who were just barely out of hearing range. A few people were hesitating on the sidewalk, their eyes bright with expectation. Like they were hoping a fight might break out to alleviate the tedium of another Monday morning. I saw Tyler Crowley nudge Austin Marks, and they both paused on their way to class. \u201cI already know what you came to say,\u201d Edward reminded Jacob in voice so low that I could barely make it out. \u201cMessage delivered. Consider us warned.\u201d Edward glanced down at me for a fleeting second with worried eyes. \u201cWarned?\u201d I asked blankly. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell her?\u201d Jacob asked, his eyes widening with disbelief. \u201cWhat, were you afraid she\u2019d take our side?\u201d \u201cPlease drop it, Jacob,\u201d Edward said in an even voice. \u201cWhy?\u201d Jacob challenged. I frowned in confusion. \u201cWhat don\u2019t I know? Edward?\u201d Edward just glared at Jacob as if he hadn\u2019t heard me. \u201cJake?\u201d Jacob raised his eyebrow at me. \u201cHe didn\u2019t tell you that his big . . .brother crossed the line Saturday night?\u201d he asked, his tone thickly layered with sarcasm. Then his eyes flickered back to Edward. \u201cPaul was totally justified in \u2014\u201d \u201cIt was no-man\u2019s land!\u201d Edward hissed. \u201cWas not!\u201d Jacob was fuming visibly. His hands trembled. He shook his head and sucked in two deep lungfuls of air. \u201cEmmett and Paul?\u201d I whispered. Paul was Jacob\u2019s most volatile pack brother. He was the one who\u2019d lost control that day in the woods \u2014 the memory of the snarling gray wolf was suddenly vivid in my head. \u201cWhat happened? Were they fighting?\u201d My voice strained higher in panic. \u201cWhy? Did Paul get hurt?\u201d \u201cNo one fought,\u201d Edward said quietly, only to me. \u201cNo one got hurt. Don\u2019t be anxious.\u201d Jacob was staring at us with incredulous eyes. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell her anything at all, did you? Is that why you took her away? So she wouldn\u2019t know that \u2014?\u201d \u201cLeave now.\u201d Edward cut him off mid-sentence, and his face was abruptly frightening \u2014 truly frightening. For a second, he looked like . . . like a vampire . He glared at Jacob with vicious, unveiled loathing. Jacob raised his eyebrows, but made no other move. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you told her?\u201d They faced each other in silence for a long moment. More students gathered behind Tyler and Austin. I saw Mike next to Ben \u2014 Mike had one hand on Ben\u2019s shoulder, like he was holding him in place. In the dead silence, all the details suddenly fell into place for me with a burst of intuition. Something Edward didn\u2019t want me to know. Something that Jacob wouldn\u2019t have kept from me. Something that had the Cullens and the wolves both in the woods, moving in hazardous proximity to each other. Something that would cause Edward to insist that I fly across the country. Something that Alice had seen in a vision last week \u2014 a vision Edward had lied to me about. Something I\u2019d been waiting for anyway. Something I knew would happen again, as much as I might wish it never would. It was never going to end, was it? I heard the quick gasp, gasp, gasp, gasp of the air dragging through my lips, but I couldn\u2019t stop it. It looked like the school was shaking, like there was an earthquake, but I knew it was my own trembling that caused the illusion. \u201cShe came back for me,\u201d I choked out. Victoria was never going to give up till I was dead. She would keep repeating the same pattern \u2014 feint and run, feint and run \u2014 until she found a hole through my defenders. Maybe I\u2019d get lucky. Maybe the Volturi would come for me first \u2014 they\u2019d kill me quicker, at least. Edward held me tight to his side, angling his body so that he was still between me and Jacob, and stroked my face with anxious hands. \u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he whispered to me. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll never let her get close to you, it\u2019s fine.\u201d Then he glared at Jacob. \u201cDoes that answer your question, mongrel?\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t think Bella has a right to know?\u201d Jacob challenged. \u201cIt\u2019s her life.\u201d Edward kept his voice muted; even Tyler, edging forward by inches, would be unable to hear. \u201cWhy should she be frightened when she was never in danger?\u201d \u201cBetter frightened than lied to.\u201d I tried to pull myself together, but my eyes were swimming in moisture. I could see it behind my lids \u2014 I could see Victoria\u2019s face, her lips pulled back over her teeth, her crimson eyes glowing with the obsession of her vendetta; she held Edward responsible for the demise of her love, James. She wouldn\u2019t stop until his love was taken from him, too. Edward wiped the tears from my cheek with his fingertips. \u201cDo you really think hurting her is better than protecting her?\u201d he murmured. \u201cShe\u2019s tougher than you think,\u201d Jacob said. \u201cAnd she\u2019s been through worse.\u201d Abruptly, Jacob\u2019s expression shifted, and he was staring at Edward with an odd, speculative expression. His eyes narrowed like he was trying to do a difficult math problem in his head. I felt Edward cringe. I glanced up at him, and his face was contorted in what could only be pain. For one ghastly moment, I was reminded of our afternoon in Italy, in the macabre tower room of the Volturi, where Jane had tortured Edward with her malignant gift, burning him with her thoughts alone. . . . The memory snapped me out of my near hysteria and put everything in perspective. Because I\u2019d rather Victoria killed me a hundred times over than watch Edward suffer that way again. \u201cThat\u2019s funny,\u201d Jacob said, laughing as he watched Edward\u2019s face. Edward winced, but smoothed his expression with a little effort. He couldn\u2019t quite hide the agony in his eyes. I glanced, wide-eyed, from Edward\u2019s grimace to Jacob\u2019s sneer. \u201cWhat are you doing to him?\u201d I demanded. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, Bella,\u201d Edward told me quietly. \u201cJacob just has a good memory, that\u2019s all.\u201d Jacob grinned, and Edward winced again. \u201cStop it! Whatever you\u2019re doing.\u201d \u201cSure, if you want.\u201d Jacob shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s his own fault if he doesn\u2019t like the things I remember, though.\u201d I glared at him, and he smiled back impishly \u2014 like a kid caught doing something he knows he shouldn\u2019t by someone who he knows won\u2019t punish him. \u201cThe principal\u2019s on his way to discourage loitering on school property,\u201d Edward murmured to me. \u201cLet\u2019s get to English, Bella, so you\u2019re not involved.\u201d \u201cOverprotective, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Jacob said, talking just to me. \u201cA little trouble makes life fun. Let me guess, you\u2019re not allowed to have fun, are you?\u201d Edward glowered, and his lips pulled back from his teeth ever so slightly. \u201cShut up, Jake,\u201d I said. Jacob laughed. \u201cThat sounds like a no . Hey, if you ever feel like having a life again, you could come see me. I\u2019ve still got your motorcycle in my garage.\u201d \u1eea  This news distracted me. \u201cYou were supposed to sell that. You promised Charlie you would.\u201d If I hadn\u2019t begged on Jake\u2019s behalf \u2014 after all, he\u2019d put weeks of labor into both motorcycles, and he deserved some kind of payback \u2014 Charlie would have thrown my bike in a Dumpster. And possibly set that Dumpster on fire. \u201cYeah, right. Like I would do that. It belongs to you, not me. Anyway, I\u2019ll hold on to it until you want it back.\u201d A tiny hint of the smile I remembered was suddenly playing around the edges of his lips. \u201cJake . . .\u201d He leaned forward, his face earnest now, the bitter sarcasm fading. \u201cI think I might have been wrong before, you know, about not being able to be friends. Maybe we could manage it, on my side of the line.\u00a0 Come see me.\u201d I was vividly conscious of Edward, his arms still wrapped protectively around me, motionless as a stone. I shot a look at his face \u2014 it was calm, patient. \u201cI, er, don\u2019t know about that, Jake.\u201d Jacob dropped the antagonistic fa\u00e7ade completely. It was like he\u2019d forgotten Edward was there, or at least he was determined to act that way. \u201cI miss you every day, Bella. It\u2019s not the same without you.\u201d \u201cI know and I\u2019m sorry, Jake, I just . . .\u201d He shook his head, and sighed. \u201cI know. Doesn\u2019t matter, right? I guess I\u2019ll survive or something. Who needs friends?\u201d He grimaced, trying to cover the pain with a thin attempt at bravado. Jacob\u2019s suffering had always triggered my protective side. It was not entirely rational \u2014 Jacob was hardly in need of any physical protection I could offer. But my arms, pinned beneath Edward\u2019s, yearned to reach out to him. To wrap around his big, warm waist in a silent promise of acceptance and comfort. Edward\u2019s shielding arms had become restraints. \u201cOkay, get to class,\u201d a stern voice sounded behind us. \u201cMove along, Mr. Crowley.\u201d \u201cGet to school, Jake,\u201d I whispered, anxious as soon as I recognized the principal\u2019s voice. Jacob went to the Quileute school, but he might still get in trouble for trespassing or the equivalent. Edward released me, taking just my hand and pulling me behind his body again. Mr. Greene pushed through the circle of spectators, his brows pressing down like ominous storm clouds over his small eyes. \u201cI mean it,\u201d he was threatening. \u201cDetention for anyone who\u2019s still standing here when I turn around again.\u201d The audience melted away before he was finished with his sentence. \u201cAh, Mr. Cullen. Do we have a problem here?\u201d \u201cNot at all, Mr. Greene. We were just on our way to class.\u201d \u201cExcellent. I don\u2019t seem to recognize your friend.\u201d Mr. Greene turned his glower on Jacob. \u201cAre you a new student here?\u201d Mr. Greene\u2019s eyes scrutinized Jacob, and I could see that he\u2019d come to the same conclusion everyone else had: dangerous. A troublemaker. \u201cNope,\u201d Jacob answered, half a smirk on his broad lips. \u201cThen I suggest you remove yourself from school property at once, young man, before I call the police.\u201d Jacob\u2019s little smirk became a full-blown grin, and I knew he was picturing Charlie showing up to arrest him. This grin was too bitter, too full of mocking to satisfy me. This wasn\u2019t the smile I\u2019d been waiting to see. Jacob said, \u201cYes, sir,\u201d and snapped a military salute before he climbed on his bike and kicked it to a start right there on the sidewalk. The engine snarled and then the tires squealed as he spun it sharply around. In a matter of seconds, Jacob raced out of sight. Mr. Greene gnashed his teeth together while he watched the performance. \u201cMr. Cullen, I expect you to ask your friend to refrain from trespassing again.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s no friend of mine, Mr. Greene, but I\u2019ll pass along the warning.\u201d Mr. Greene pursed his lips. Edward\u2019s perfect grades and <em>spotless</em> record were clearly a factor in Mr. Greene\u2019s assessment of the incident. \u201cI see. If you\u2019re worried about any trouble, I\u2019d be happy to \u2014\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to worry about, Mr. Greene. There won\u2019t be any trouble.\u201d \u201cI hope that\u2019s correct. Well, then. On to class. You, too, Miss Swan.\u201d Edward nodded, and pulled me quickly along toward the English building. \u201cDo you feel well enough to go to class?\u201d he whispered when we were past the principal. \u201cYes,\u201d I whispered back, not quite sure if this was a lie. Whether I felt well or not was hardly the most important consideration. I needed to talk to Edward right away, and English class wasn\u2019t the ideal place for the conversation I had in mind. But with Mr. Greene right behind us, there weren\u2019t a lot of other options. We got to class a little late and took our seats quickly. Mr. Berty was reciting a Frost poem. He ignored our entrance, refusing to let us break his rhythm. I yanked a blank page out of my notebook and started writing, my handwriting more illegible than normal thanks to my agitation. What happened? Tell me everything . And screw the protecting me crap, please. I shoved the note at Edward. He sighed, and then began writing. It took him less time than me, though he wrote an entire paragraph in his own personal calligraphy before he slipped the paper back. Alice saw that Victoria was coming back. I took you out of town merely as a precaution \u2014 there was never a chance that she would have gotten anywhere close to you. Emmett and Jasper very nearly had her, but Victoria seems to have some instinct for evasion. She escaped right down the Quileute boundary line as if she were reading it from a map. It didn\u2019t help that Alice\u2019s abilities were nullified by the Quileutes\u2019 involvement. To be fair, the Quileutes might have had her, too, if we hadn\u2019t gotten in the way. The big gray one thought Emmett was over the line, and he got defensive. Of course Rosalie reacted to that, and everyone left the chase to protect their companions. Carlisle and Jasper got things calmed down before it got out of hand. But by then, Victoria had slipped away. That\u2019s everything.  I frowned at the letters on the page. All of them had been in on it \u2014 Emmett, Jasper, Alice, Rosalie, and Carlisle. Maybe even Esme, though he hadn\u2019t mentioned her. And then Paul and the rest of the Quileute pack. It might so easily have turned into a fight, pitting my future family and my old friends against each other. Any one of them could have been hurt. I imagined the wolves would be in the most danger, but picturing tiny Alice next to one of the huge werewolves, fighting . . . I shuddered. Carefully, I scrubbed out the entire paragraph with my eraser and then I wrote over the top:\u00a0  What about Charlie? She could have been after him. Edward was shaking his head before I finished, obviously going to downplay any danger on Charlie\u2019s behalf. He held a hand out, but I ignored that and started again. You can\u2019t know that she wasn\u2019t thinking that, because you weren\u2019t here. Florida was a bad idea. He took the paper from underneath my hand. I wasn\u2019t about to send you off alone. With your luck, not even the black box would survive. That wasn\u2019t what I\u2019d meant at all; I hadn\u2019t thought of going without him. I\u2019d meant that we should have stayed here together. But I was sidetracked by his response, and a little miffed. Like I couldn\u2019t fly cross country without bringing the plane down. Very funny. So let\u2019s say my bad luck did crash the plane. What exactly were you going to do about it? Why is the plane crashing? He was trying to hide a smile now. The pilots are passed out drunk. Easy. I\u2019d fly the plane. Of course. I pursed my lips and tried again. Both engines have exploded and we\u2019re falling in a death spiral toward the earth. I\u2019d wait till we were close enough to the ground, get a good grip on you, kick out the wall, and jump. Then I\u2019d run you back to the scene of the accident, and we\u2019d stumble around like the two luckiest survivors in history. I stared at him wordlessly. \u201cWhat?\u201d he whispered. I shook my head in awe. \u201cNothing,\u201d I mouthed. I scrubbed out the disconcerting conversation and wrote one more line. You will tell me next time. I knew there would be a next time. The pattern would continue until someone lost. Edward stared into my eyes for a long moment. I wondered what my face looked like \u2014 it felt cold, so the blood hadn\u2019t returned to my cheeks. My eyelashes were still wet. He sighed and then nodded once. Thanks. The paper disappeared from under my hand. I looked up, blinking in surprise, just as Mr. Berty came down the aisle. \u201cIs that something you\u2019d like to share there, Mr. Cullen?\u201d Edward looked up innocently and held out the sheet of paper on top of his folder. \u201cMy notes?\u201d he asked, sounding confused. Mr. Berty scanned the notes \u2014 no doubt a perfect transcription of his lecture \u2014 and then walked away frowning. It was later, in Calculus \u2014 my one class without Edward \u2014 that I heard the gossip. \u201cMy money\u2019s on the big Indian,\u201d someone was saying. I peeked up to see that Tyler, Mike, Austin, and Ben had their heads bent together, deep in conversation. \u201cYeah,\u201d Mike whispered. \u201cDid you see the size of that Jacob kid? I think he could take Cullen down.\u201d Mike sounded pleased by the idea. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Ben disagreed. \u201cThere\u2019s something about Edward. He\u2019s always so . . . confident. I have a feeling he can take care of himself.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m with Ben,\u201d Tyler agreed. \u201cBesides, if that other kid messed Edward up, you know those big brothers of his would get involved.\u201d \u201cHave you been down to La Push lately?\u201d Mike asked. \u201cLauren and I went to the beach a couple of weeks ago, and believe me, Jacob\u2019s friends are all just as big as he is.\u201d \u201cHuh,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cToo bad it didn\u2019t turn into anything. Guess we\u2019ll never know how it would have turned out.\u201d \u201cIt didn\u2019t look over to me,\u201d Austin said. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll get to see.\u201d Mike grinned. \u201cAnyone in the mood for a bet?\u201d \u201cTen on Jacob,\u201d Austin said at once. \u201cTen on Cullen,\u201d Tyler chimed in. \u201cTen on Edward,\u201d Ben agreed. \u201cJacob,\u201d Mike said. \u201cHey, do you guys know what it was about?\u201d Austin wondered. \u201cThat might affect the odds.\u201d \u201cI can guess,\u201d Mike said, and then he shot a glance at me at the same time that Ben and Tyler did.
