            "en": "9      9. THEORY \"Can I ask just one more?\" I pleaded as Edward accelerated much too quickly down the quiet street. He didn't seem to be paying any attention to the road. He sighed. \"One,\" he agreed. His lips pressed together into a cautious line. \"Well\u2026 you said you knew I hadn't gone into the bookstore, and that I had gone south. I was just wondering how you knew that.\" He looked away, deliberating. \"I thought we were past all the evasiveness,\" I grumbled. He almost smiled. \"Fine, then. I followed your scent.\" He looked at the road, giving me time to compose my face. I couldn't think of an acceptable response to that, but I filed it carefully away for future study. I tried to refocus. I wasn't ready to let him be finished, now that he was finally explaining things. \"And then you didn't answer one of my first questions\u2026\" I stalled. He looked at me with disapproval. \"Which one?\" \"How does it work \u2014 the mind-reading thing? Can you read anybody's mind, anywhere? How do you do it? Can the rest of your family\u2026 ?\" I felt silly, asking for clarification on make-believe. \"That's more than one,\" he pointed out. I simply intertwined my fingers and gazed at him, waiting. \"No, it's just me. And I can't hear anyone, anywhere. I have to be fairly close. The more familiar someone's\u2026 'voice' is, the farther away I can hear them. But still, no more than a few miles.\" He paused thoughtfully. \"It's a little like being in a huge hall filled with people, everyone talking at once. It's just a hum \u2014 a buzzing of voices in the background. Until I focus on one voice, and then what they're thinking is clear. \u00a0\"Most of the time I tune it all out \u2014 it can be very distracting. And then it's easier to seem normal\" \u2014 he frowned as he said the word \u2014 \"when I'm not accidentally answering someone's thoughts rather than their words.\" \"Why do you think you can't hear me?\" I asked curiously. He looked at me, his eyes enigmatic. \"I don't know,\" he murmured. \"The only guess I have is that maybe your mind doesn't work the same way the rest of theirs do. Like your thoughts are on the AM frequency and I'm only getting FM.\" He grinned at me, suddenly amused. \"My mind doesn't work right? I'm a freak?\" The words bothered me more than they should \u2014 probably because his speculation hit home. I'd always suspected as much, and it embarrassed me to have it confirmed. \"I hear voices in my mind and you're worried that you're the freak,\" he laughed. \"Don't worry, it's just a theory\u2026\" His face tightened. \"Which brings us back to you.\" I sighed. How to begin? \"Aren't we past all the evasions now?\" he reminded me softly. I looked away from his face for the first time, trying to find words. I happened to notice the speedometer. \"Holy crow!\" I shouted. \"Slow down!\" \"What's wrong?\" He was startled. But the car didn't decelerate. \"You're going a hundred miles an hour!\" I was still shouting. I shot a panicky glance out the window, but it was too dark to see much. The road was only visible in the long patch of bluish brightness from the headlights. The forest along both sides of the road was like a black wall \u2014 as hard as a wall of steel if we veered off the road at this speed. \"Relax, Bella.\" He rolled his eyes, still not slowing. \"Are you trying to kill us?\" I demanded. \"We're not going to crash.\" I tried to modulate my voice. \"Why are you in such a hurry?\" \"I always drive like this.\" He turned to smile crookedly at me. \"Keep your eyes on the road!\" \"I've never been in an accident, Bella \u2014 I've never even gotten a ticket.\" He grinned and tapped his forehead. \"Built-in radar detector.\" \"Very funny.\" I fumed. \"Charlie's a cop, remember? I was raised to abide by traffic laws. Besides, if you turn us into a Volvo pretzel around a tree trunk, you can probably just walk away.\" \"Probably,\" he agreed with a short, hard laugh. \"But you can't.\" He sighed, and I watched with relief as the needle gradually drifted toward eighty. \"Happy?\" \"Almost.\" \"I hate driving slow,\" he muttered. \"This is slow?\" \"Enough commentary on my driving,\" he snapped. \"I'm still waiting for your latest theory.\" I bit my lip. He looked down at me, his honey eyes unexpectedly gentle. \"I won't laugh,\" he promised. \"I'm more afraid that you'll be angry with me.\" \"Is it that bad?\" \"Pretty much, yeah.\" He waited. I was looking down at my hands, so I couldn't see his expression. \"Go ahead.\" His voice was calm. \"I don't know how to start,\" I admitted. \"Why don't you start at the beginning\u2026 you said you didn't come up with this on your own.\" \"No.\" \"What got you started \u2014 a book? A movie?\" he probed. \"No \u2014 it was Saturday, at the beach.\" I risked a glance up at his face. He looked puzzled. \"I ran into an old family friend \u2014Jacob Black,\" I continued. \"His dad and Charlie have been friends since I was a baby.\" He still looked confused. \"His dad is one of the Quileute elders.\" I watched him carefully. His confused expression froze in place. \"We went for a walk \u2014\" I edited all my scheming out of the story \"\u2014 and he was telling me some old legends \u2014 trying to scare me, I think. He told me one\u2026\" I hesitated. \"Go on,\" he said. \"About vampires.\" I realized I was whispering. I couldn't look at his face now. But I saw his knuckles tighten convulsively on the wheel. \"And you immediately thought of me?\" Still calm. \"No. He\u2026 mentioned your family.\" He was silent, staring at the road. I was worried suddenly, worried about protecting Jacob. \"He just thought it was a silly superstition,\" I said quickly. \"He didn't expect me to think anything of it.\" It didn't seem like enough; I had to confess. \"It was my fault, I forced him to tell me.\" \"Why?\" \"Lauren said something about you \u2014 she was trying to provoke me. And an older boy from the tribe said your family didn't come to the reservation, only it sounded like he meant something different. So I got Jacob alone and I tricked it out of him,\" I admitted, hanging my head.  He startled me by laughing. I glared up at him. He was laughing, but his eyes were fierce, staring ahead. \"Tricked him how?\" he asked. \"I tried to flirt \u2014 it worked better than I thought it would.\" Disbelief colored my tone as I remembered. \"I'd like to have seen that.\" He chuckled darkly. \"And you accused me of dazzling people \u2014 poor Jacob Black.\" I blushed and looked out my window into the night. \"What did you do then?\" he asked after a minute. \"I did some research on the Internet.\" \"And did that convince you?\" His voice sounded barely interested. But his hands were clamped hard onto the steering wheel. \"No. Nothing fit. Most of it was kind of silly. And then\u2026\" I stopped. \"What?\" \"I decided it didn't matter,\" I whispered. \"It didn't matter?\" His tone made me look up \u2014 I had finally broken through his carefully composed mask. His face was incredulous, with just a hint of the anger I'd feared. \"No,\" I said softly. \"It doesn't matter to me what you are.\" A hard, mocking edge entered his voice. \"You don't care if I'm a monster? If I'm not human!\" \"No.\" He was silent, staring straight ahead again. His face was bleak and cold. \"You're angry,\" I sighed. \"I shouldn't have said anything.\" \"No,\" he said, but his tone was as hard as his face. \"I'd rather know what you're thinking \u2014 even if what you're thinking is insane.\" \"So I'm wrong again?\" I challenged. \"That's not what I was referring to. 'It doesn't matter'!\" he quoted, gritting his teeth together.  \"I'm right?\" I gasped. \"Does it matter?\" I took a deep breath. \"Not really.\" I paused. \"But I am curious.\" My voice, at least, was composed. He was suddenly resigned. \"What are you curious about?\" \"How old are you?\" \"Seventeen,\" he answered promptly. \"And how long have you been seventeen?\" His lips twitched as he stared at the road. \"A while,\" he admitted at last. \"Okay.\" I smiled, pleased that he was still being honest with me. He stared down at me with watchful eyes, much as he had before, when he was worried I would go into shock. I smiled wider in encouragement, and he frowned. \"Don't laugh \u2014 but how can you come out during the daytime?\" He laughed anyway. \"Myth.\" \"Burned by the sun?\" \"Myth.\" \"Sleeping in coffins?\" \"Myth.\" He hesitated for a moment, and a peculiar tone entered his voice. \"I can't sleep.\" It took me a minute to absorb that. \"At all?\" \"Never,\" he said, his voice nearly inaudible. He turned to look at me with a wistful expression. The golden eyes held mine, and I lost my train of thought. I stared at him until he looked away. \"You haven't asked me the most important question yet.\" His voice was hard now, and when he looked at me again his eyes were cold. I blinked, still dazed. \"Which one is that?\" \"You aren't concerned about my diet?\" he asked sarcastically. \"Oh,\" I murmured, \"that.\" \"Yes, that.\" His voice was bleak. \"Don't you want to know if I drink blood?\" I flinched. \"Well, Jacob said something about that.\" \"What did Jacob say?\" he asked flatly. \"He said you didn't\u2026 hunt people. He said your family wasn't supposed to be dangerous because you only hunted animals.\" \"He said we weren't dangerous?\" His voice was deeply skeptical. \"Not exactly. He said you weren't supposed to be dangerous. But the Quileutes still didn't want you on their land, just in case.\" He looked forward, but I couldn't tell if he was watching the road or not. \"So was he right? About not hunting people?\" I tried to keep my voice as even as possible. \"The Quileutes have a long memory,\" he whispered. I took it as a confirmation. \"Don't let that make you complacent, though,\" he warned me. \"They're right to keep their distance from us. We are still dangerous.\" \"I don't understand.\" \"We try,\" he explained slowly. \"We're usually very good at what we do. Sometimes we make mistakes. Me, for example, allowing myself to be alone with you.\" \"This is a mistake?\" I heard the sadness in my voice, but I didn't know if he could as well. \"A very dangerous one,\" he murmured. We were both silent then. I watched the headlights twist with the curves of the road. They moved too fast; it didn't look real, it looked like a video game. I was aware of the time slipping away so quickly, like the black road beneath us, and I was hideously afraid that I would never have another chance to be with him like this again \u2014 openly, the walls between us gone for once. His words hinted at an end, and I recoiled from the idea. I couldn't waste one minute I had with him. \"Tell me more,\" I asked desperately, not caring what he said, just so I could hear his voice again. He looked at me quickly, startled by the change in my tone. \"What more do you want to know?\" \"Tell me why you hunt animals instead of people,\" I suggested, my voice still tinged with desperation. I realized my eyes were wet, and I fought against the grief that was trying to overpower me. \"I don't want to be a monster.\" His voice was very low. \"But animals aren't enough?\" He paused. \"I can't be sure, of course, but I'd compare it to living on tofu and soy milk; we call ourselves vegetarians, our little inside joke. It doesn't completely satiate the hunger \u2014 or rather thirst. But it keens us strong enough to resist. Most of the time.\" His tone turned ominous. \"Sometimes it's more difficult than others.\" \"Is it very difficult for you now?\" I asked. He sighed. \"Yes.\" \"But you're not hungry now,\" I said confidently \u2014 stating, not asking. \"Why do you think that?\" \"Your eyes. I told you I had a theory. I've noticed that people \u2014 men in particular \u2014 are crabbier when they're hungry.\" He chuckled. \"You are observant, aren't you?\" I didn't answer; I just listened to the sound of his laugh, committing it to memory. \"Were you hunting this weekend, with Emmett?\" I asked when it was quiet again. \"Yes.\" He paused for a second, as if deciding whether or not to say something. \"I didn't want to leave, but it was necessary. It's a bit easier to be around you when I'm not thirsty.\" \"Why didn't you want to leave?\" \"It makes me\u2026 anxious\u2026 to be away from you.\" His eyes were gentle but intense, and they seemed to be making my bones turn soft. \"I wasn't joking when I asked you to try not to fall in the ocean or get run over last Thursday. I was distracted all weekend, worrying about you. And after what happened tonight, I'm surprised that you did make it through a whole weekend unscathed.\" He shook his head, and then seemed to remember something. \"Well, not totally unscathed.\" \"What?\" \"Your hands,\" he reminded me. I looked down at my palms, at the almost-healed scrapes across the heels of my hands. His eyes missed nothing. \"I fell,\" I sighed. \"That's what I thought.\" His lips curved up at the corners. \"I suppose, being you, it could have been much worse \u2014 and that possibility tormented me the entire time I was away. It was a very long three days. I really got on Emmett's nerves.\" He smiled ruefully at me. \"Three days? Didn't you just get back today?\" \"No, we got back Sunday.\" \"Then why weren't any of you in school?\" I was frustrated, almost angry as I thought of how much disappointment I had suffered because of his absence. \"Well, you asked if the sun hurt me, and it doesn't. But I can't go out in the sunlight \u2014 at least, not where anyone can see.\" \"Why?\" \"I'll show you sometime,\" he promised.  I thought about it for a moment. \"You might have called me,\" I decided. He was puzzled. \"But I knew you were safe.\" \"But I didn't know where you were. I \u2014\" I hesitated, dropping my eyes. \"What?\" His velvety voice was compelling. \"I didn't like it. Not seeing you. It makes me anxious, too.\" I blushed to be saying this out loud. He was quiet. I glanced up, apprehensive, and saw that his expression was pained. \"Ah,\" he groaned quietly. \"This is wrong.\" I couldn't understand his response. \"What did I say?\" \"Don't you see, Bella? It's one thing for me to make myself miserable, but a wholly other thing for you to be so involved.\" He turned his anguished eyes to the road, his words flowing almost too fast for me to understand. \"I don't want to hear that you feel that way.\" His voice was low but urgent. His words cut me. \"It's wrong. It's not safe. I'm dangerous, Bella \u2014 please, grasp that.\" \" No.\" I tried very hard not to look like a sulky child. \"I'm serious,\" he growled. \"So am I. I told you, it doesn't matter what you are. It's too late.\" His voice whipped out, low and harsh. \"Never say that.\" I bit my lip and was glad he couldn't know how much that hurt. I stared out at the road. We must be close now. He was driving much too fast.  \"What are you thinking?\" he asked, his voice still raw. I just shook my head, not sure if I could speak. I could feel his gaze on my face, but I kept my eyes forward. \"Are you crying?\" He sounded appalled. I hadn't realized the moisture in my eyes had brimmed over. I quickly rubbed my hand across my cheek, and sure enough, traitor tears were there, betraying me.  \"No,\" I said, but my voice cracked. I saw him reach toward me hesitantly with his right hand, but then he stopped and placed it slowly back on the steering wheel. \"I'm sorry.\" His voice burned with regret. I knew he wasn't just apologizing for the words that had upset me. The darkness slipped by us in silence. \"Tell me something,\" he asked after another minute, and I could hear him struggle to use a lighter tone. \"Yes?\" \"What were you thinking tonight, just before I came around the corner? I couldn't understand your expression \u2014 you didn't look that scared, you looked like you were concentrating very hard on something.\" \"I was trying to remember how to incapacitate an attacker \u2014 you know, self-defense. I was going to smash his nose into his brain.\" I thought of the dark-haired man with a surge of hate. \"You were going to fight them?\" This upset him. \"Didn't you think about running?\" \"I fall down a lot when I run,\" I admitted. \"What about screaming for help?\" \"I was getting to that part.\" He shook his head. \"You were right \u2014 I'm definitely fighting fate trying to keep you alive.\" I sighed. We were slowing, passing into the boundaries of Forks. It had taken less than twenty minutes. \"Will I see you tomorrow?\" I demanded. \"Yes \u2014 I have a paper due, too.\" He smiled. \"I'll save you a seat at lunch.\" It was silly, after everything we'd been through tonight, how that little promise sent flutters through my stomach, and made me unable to speak. We were in front of Charlie's house. The lights were on, my truck in its place, everything utterly normal. It was like waking from a dream. He stopped the car, but I didn't move. \"Do you promise to be there tomorrow?\" \"I promise.\" I considered that for a moment, then nodded. I pulled his jacket off, taking one last whiff. \"You can keep it \u2014 you don't have a jacket for tomorrow,\" he reminded me. I handed it back to him. \"I don't want to have to explain to Charlie.\" \"Oh, right.\" He grinned. I hesitated, my hand on the door handle, trying to prolong the moment. \"Bella?\" he asked in a different tone \u2014 serious, but hesitant. \"Yes?\" I turned back to him too eagerly. \"Will you promise me something?\" \"Yes,\" I said, and instantly regretted my unconditional agreement. What if he asked me to stay away from him? I couldn't keep that promise. \"Don't go into the woods alone.\" I stared at him in blank confusion. \"Why?\" He frowned, and his eyes were tight as he stared past me out the window. \"I'm not always the most dangerous thing out there. Let's leave it at that.\" I shuddered slightly at the sudden <em>bleakness</em> in his voice, but I was relieved. This, at least, was an easy promise to honor. \"Whatever you say.\" \"I'll see you tomorrow,\" he sighed, and I knew he wanted me to leave now. \"Tomorrow, then.\" I opened the door unwillingly. \"Bella?\" I turned and he was leaning toward me, his pale, glorious face just inches from mine. My heart stopped beating. \"Sleep well,\" he said. His breath blew in my face, stunning me. It was the same exquisite scent that clung to his jacket, but in a more concentrated form. I blinked, thoroughly dazed. He leaned away. I was unable to move until my brain had somewhat unscrambled itself. Then I stepped out of the car awkwardly, having to use the frame for support. I thought I heard him chuckle, but the sound was too quiet for me to be certain. He waited till I had stumbled to the front door, and then I heard his engine quietly rev. I turned to watch the silver car disappear around the corner. I realized it was very cold. I reached for the key mechanically, unlocked the door, and stepped inside. Charlie called from the living room. \"Bella?\" \"Yeah, Dad, it's me.\" I walked in to see him. He was watching a baseball game. \"You're home early.\" \"Am I?\" I was surprised. \"It's not even eight yet,\" he told me. \"Did you girls have fun?\" \"Yeah \u2014 it was lots of fun.\" My head was spinning as I tried to remember all the way back to the girls' night out I had planned. \"They both found dresses.\" \"Are you all right?\" \"I'm just tired. I did a lot of walking.\" \"Well, maybe you should go lie down.\" He sounded concerned. I wondered what my face looked like. \"I'm just going to call Jessica first.\" \"Weren't you just with her?\" he asked, surprised. \"Yes \u2014 but I left my jacket in her car. I want to make sure she brings it tomorrow.\" \"Well, give her a chance to get home first.\" \"Right,\" I agreed. I went to the kitchen and fell, exhausted, into a chair. I was really feeling dizzy now. I wondered if I was going to go into shock after all. Get a grip, I told myself. The phone rang suddenly, startling me. I yanked it off the hook. \"Hello?\" I asked breathlessly. \"Bella?\" \"Hey, Jess, I was just going to call you.\" \"You made it home?\" Her voice was relieved\u2026 and surprised. \"Yes. I left my jacket in your car \u2014 could you bring it to me tomorrow?\" \"Sure. But tell me what happened!\" she demanded. \"Um, tomorrow \u2014 in Trig, okay?\" She caught on quickly. \"Oh, is your dad there?\" \"Yes, that's right.\" \"Okay, I'll talk to you tomorrow, then. Bye!\" I could hear the impatience in her voice. \"Bye, Jess.\" I walked up the stairs slowly, a heavy stupor clouding my mind. I went through the motions of getting ready for bed without paying any attention to what I was doing. It wasn't until I was in the shower \u2014 the water too hot, burning my skin \u2014 that I realized I was freezing. I shuddered violently for several minutes before the steaming spray could finally relax my rigid muscles. Then I stood in the shower, too tired to move, until the hot water began to run out. I stumbled out, wrapping myself securely in a towel, trying to hold the heat from the water in so the aching shivers wouldn't return. I dressed for bed swiftly and climbed under my quilt, curling into a ball, hugging myself to keep warm. A few small shudders trembled through me. My mind still swirled dizzily, full of images I couldn't understand, and some I fought to repress. Nothing seemed clear at first, but as I fell gradually closer to unconsciousness, a few certainties became evident. About three things I was absolutely positive. First, Edward was a vampire. Second, there was part of him \u2014 and I didn't know how potent that part might be \u2014 that thirsted for my blood. And third, I was unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him.",

            "en": "24           24. AN IMPASSE My eyes opened to a bright, white light. I was in an unfamiliar room, a white room. The wall beside me was covered in long vertical blinds; over my head, the glaring lights blinded me. I was propped up on a hard, uneven bed \u2014 a bed with rails. The pillows were flat and lumpy. There was an annoying beeping sound somewhere close by. I hoped that meant I was still alive. Death shouldn't be this uncomfortable.  My hands were all twisted up with clear tubes, and something was taped across my face, under my nose. I lifted my hand to rip it off. \"No, you don't.\" And cool fingers caught my hand. \"Edward?\" I turned my head slightly, and his exquisite face was just inches from mine, his chin resting on the edge of my pillow. I realized again that I was alive, this time with gratitude and elation. \"Oh, Edward, I'm so sorry!\" \"Shhhh,\" he shushed me. \"Everything's all right now.\" \"What happened?\" I couldn't remember clearly, and my mind rebelled against me as I tried to recall. \"I was almost too late. I could have been too late,\" he whispered, his voice tormented. \"I was so stupid, Edward. I thought he had my mom.\" \"He tricked us all.\" \"I need to call Charlie and my mom,\" I realized through the haze. \"Alice called them. Ren\u00e9e is here \u2014 well, here in the hospital. She's getting something to eat right now.\" \"She's here?\" I tried to sit up, but the spinning in my head accelerated, and his hand pushed me gently down onto the pillows. \"She'll be back soon,\" he promised. \"And you need to stay still.\" \"But what did you tell her?\" I panicked. I had no interest in being soothed. My mom was here and I was recovering from a vampire attack. \"Why did you tell her I'm here?\" \"You fell down two flights of stairs and through a window.\" He paused.\u00a0 \"You have to admit, it could happen.\" I sighed, and it hurt. I stared down at my body under the sheet, the huge lump that was my leg. \"How bad am I?\" I asked. \"You have a broken leg, four broken ribs, some cracks in your skull, bruises covering every inch of your skin, and you've lost a lot of blood.  They gave you a few transfusions. I didn't like it \u2014 it made you smell all wrong for a while.\" \"That must have been a nice change for you.\" \"No, I like how you smell.\" \"How did you do it?\" I asked quietly. He knew what I meant at once. \"I'm not sure.\" He looked away from my wondering eyes, lifting my gauze-wrapped hand from the bed and holding it gently in his, careful not to disrupt the wire connecting me to one of the monitors. I waited patiently for the rest. He sighed without returning my gaze. \"It was impossible\u2026 to stop,\" he whispered. \"Impossible. But I did.\" He looked up finally, with half a smile. \"I must love you.\" \"Don't I taste as good as I smell?\" I smiled in response. That hurt my face. \"Even better \u2014 better than I'd imagined.\" \"I'm sorry,\" I apologized. He raised his eyes to the ceiling. \"Of all the things to apologize for.\" \"What should I apologize for?\" \"For very nearly taking yourself away from me forever.\" \"I'm sorry,\" I apologized again. \"I know why you did it.\" His voice was comforting. \"It was still irrational, of course. You should have waited for me, you should have told me.\" \"You wouldn't have let me go.\" \"No,\" he agreed in a grim tone, \"I wouldn't.\" Some very unpleasant memories were beginning to come back to me. I shuddered, and then winced. He was instantly anxious. \"Bella, what's wrong?\" \"What happened to James?\" \"After I pulled him off you, Emmett and Jasper took care of him.\" There was a fierce note of regret in his voice. This confused me. \"I didn't see Emmett and Jasper there.\" \"They had to leave the room\u2026 there was a lot of blood.\" \"But you stayed.\" \"Yes, I stayed.\" \"And Alice, and Carlisle\u2026\" I said in wonder. \"They love you, too, you know.\" A flash of painful images from the last time I'd seen Alice reminded me of something. \"Did Alice see the tape?\" I asked anxiously. \"Yes.\" A new sound darkened his voice, a tone of sheer hatred. \"She was always in the dark, that's why she didn't remember.\" \"I know. She understands now.\" His voice was even, but his face was black with fury. I tried to reach his face with my free hand, but something stopped me. I glanced down to see the IV pulling at my hand. \"Ugh.\" I winced. \"What is it?\" he asked anxiously \u2014 distracted, but not enough. The <em>bleakness</em> did not entirely leave his eyes. \"Needles,\" I explained, looking away from the one in my hand. I concentrated on a warped ceiling tile and tried to breathe deeply despite the ache in my ribs. \"Afraid of a needle,\" he muttered to himself under his breath, shaking his head. \"Oh, a sadistic vampire, intent on torturing her to death, sure, no problem, she runs off to meet him. An IV, on the other hand\u2026\" I rolled my eyes. I was pleased to discover that this reaction, at least, was pain-free. I decided to change the subject. \"Why are you here?\" I asked. He stared at me, first confusion and then hurt touching his eyes. His brows pulled together as he frowned. \"Do you want me to leave?\" \"No!\" I protested, horrified by the thought. \"No, I meant, why does my mother think you're here? I need to have my story straight before she gets back.\" \"Oh,\" he said, and his forehead smoothed back into marble. \"I came to Phoenix to talk some sense into you, to convince you to come back to Forks.\" His wide eyes were so earnest and sincere, I almost believed him myself. \"You agreed to see me, and you drove out to the hotel where I was staying with Carlisle and Alice \u2014 of course I was here with parental supervision,\" he inserted virtuously, \"but you tripped on the stairs on the way to my room and\u2026 well, you know the rest. You don't need to remember any details, though; you have a good excuse to be a little muddled about the finer points.\" I thought about it for a moment. \"There are a few flaws with that story. Like no broken windows.\" \"Not really,\" he said. \"Alice had a little bit too much fun fabricating evidence. It's all been taken care of very convincingly \u2014 you could probably sue the hotel if you wanted to. You have nothing to worry about,\" he promised, stroking my cheek with the lightest of touches. \"Your only job now is to heal.\" I wasn't so lost to the soreness or the fog of medication that I didn't respond to his touch. The beeping of the monitor jumped around erratically \u2014 now he wasn't the only one who could hear my heart misbehave. \"That's going to be embarrassing,\" I muttered to myself. He chuckled, and a speculative look came into his eye. \"Hmm, I wonder\u2026\" He leaned in slowly; the beeping noise accelerated wildly before his lips even touched me. But when they did, though with the most gentle of pressure, the beeping stopped altogether. He pulled back abruptly, his anxious expression turning to relief as the monitor reported the restarting of my heart. \"It seems that I'm going to have to be even more careful with you than usual.\" He frowned. \"I was not finished kissing you,\" I complained. \"Don't make me come over there.\" He grinned, and bent to press his lips lightly to mine. The monitor went wild. But then his lips were taut. He pulled away. \"I think I hear your mother,\" he said, grinning again. \"Don't leave me,\" I cried, an irrational surge of panic flooding through me. I couldn't let him go \u2014 he might disappear from me again. He read the terror in my eyes for a short second. \"I won't,\" he promised solemnly, and then he smiled. \"I'll take a nap.\" He moved from the hard plastic chair by my side to the turquoise faux-leather recliner at the foot of my bed, leaning it all the way back, and closing his eyes. He was perfectly still. \"Don't forget to breathe,\" I whispered sarcastically. He took a deep breath, his eyes still closed. I could hear my mother now. She was talking to someone, maybe a nurse, and she sounded tired and upset. I wanted to jump out of the bed and run to her, to calm her, promise that everything was fine. But I wasn't in any sort of shape for jumping, so I waited impatiently. The door opened a crack, and she peeked through. \"Mom!\" I whispered, my voice full of love and relief. She took in Edward's still form on the recliner, and tiptoed to my bedside. \"He never leaves, does he?\" she mumbled to herself. \"Mom, I'm so glad to see you!\" She bent down to hug me gently, and I felt warm tears falling on my cheeks. \"Bella, I was so upset!\" \"I'm sorry, Mom. But everything's fine now, it's okay,\" I comforted her. \"I'm just glad to finally see your eyes open.\" She sat on the edge of my bed. I suddenly realized I didn't have any idea when it was. \"How long have they been closed?\" \"It's Friday, hon, you've been out for a while.\" \"Friday?\" I was shocked. I tried to remember what day it had been when\u2026 but I didn't want to think about that. \"They had to keep you sedated for a while, honey \u2014 you've got a lot of injuries.\" \"I know.\" I could feel them. \"You're lucky Dr. Cullen was there. He's such a nice man\u2026 very young, though. And he looks more like a model than a doctor\u2026\" \"You met Carlisle?\" \"And Edward's sister Alice. She's a lovely girl.\" \"She is,\" I agreed wholeheartedly. She glanced over her shoulder at Edward, lying with his eyes closed in the chair. \"You didn't tell me you had such good friends in Forks.\" I cringed, and then moaned. \"What hurts?\" she demanded anxiously, turning back to me. Edward's eyes flashed to my face. \"It's fine,\" I assured them. \"I just have to remember not to move.\" He lapsed back into his phony slumber. I took advantage of my mother's momentary distraction to keep the subject from returning to my less-than-candid behavior. \"Where's Phil?\" I asked quickly. \"Florida \u2014 oh, Bella! You'll never guess! Just when we were about to leave, the best news!\" \"Phil got signed?\" I guessed. \"Yes! How did you guess! The Suns, can you believe it?\" \"That's great, Mom,\" I said as enthusiastically as I could manage, though I had little idea what that meant. \"And you'll like Jacksonville so much,\" she gushed while I stared at her vacantly. \"I was a little bit worried when Phil started talking about Akron, what with the snow and everything, because you know how I hate the cold, but now Jacksonville! It's always sunny, and the humidity really isn't that bad. We found the cutest house, yellow, with white trim, and a porch just like in an old movie, and this huge oak tree, and it's just a few minutes from the ocean, and you'll have your own bathroom \u2014\" \"Wait, Mom!\" I interrupted. Edward still had his eyes closed, but he looked too tense to pass as asleep. \"What are you talking about? I'm not going to Florida. I live in Forks.\" \"But you don't have to anymore, silly,\" she laughed. \"Phil will be able to be around so much more now\u2026 we've talked about it a lot, and what I'm going to do is trade off on the away games, half the time with you, half the time with him.\" \"Mom.\" I hesitated, wondering how best to be diplomatic about this. \"I want to live in Forks. I'm already settled in at school, and I have a couple of girlfriends\" \u2014 she glanced toward Edward again when I reminded her of friends, so I tried another direction \u2014 \"and Charlie needs me. \u00a0He's just all alone up there, and he can't cook at all.\" \"You want to stay in Forks?\" she asked, bewildered. The idea was inconceivable to her. And then her eyes flickered back toward Edward.  \"Why?\" \"I told you \u2014 school, Charlie \u2014 ouch!\" I'd shrugged. Not a good idea. .  Her hands fluttered helplessly over me, trying to find a safe place to pat. She made do with my forehead; it was unbandaged. \"Bella, honey, you hate Forks,\" she reminded me. \"It's not so bad.\" She frowned and looked back and forth between Edward and me, this time very deliberately. \"Is it this boy?\" she whispered. I opened my mouth to lie, but her eyes were scrutinizing my face, and I knew she would see through that. \"He's part of it,\" I admitted. No need to confess how big a part. \"So, have you had a chance to talk with Edward?\" I asked. \"Yes.\" She hesitated, looking at his perfectly still form. \"And I want to talk to you about that.\" Uh-oh. \"What about?\" I asked. \"I think that boy is in love with you,\" she accused, keeping her voice low. \"I think so, too,\" I confided. \"And how do you feel about him?\" She only poorly concealed the raging curiosity in her voice. I sighed, looking away. As much as I loved my mom, this was not a conversation I wanted to have with her. \"I'm pretty crazy about him.\" There \u2014 that sounded like something a teenager with her first boyfriend might say. \"Well, he seems very nice, and, my goodness, he's incredibly good-looking, but you're so young, Bella\u2026\" Her voice was unsure; as far as I could remember, this was the first time since I was eight that she'd come close to trying to sound like a parental authority. I recognized the reasonable-but-firm tone of voice from talks I'd had with her about men. \"I know that, Mom. Don't worry about it. It's just a crush,\" I soothed her. \"That's right,\" she agreed, easily pleased. Then she sighed and glanced guiltily over her shoulder at the big, round clock on the wall. \"Do you need to go?\" She bit her lip. \"Phil's supposed to call in a little while\u2026 I didn't know you were going to wake up\u2026\" \"No problem, Mom.\" I tried to tone down the relief so she wouldn't get her feelings hurt. \"I won't be alone.\" \"I'll be back soon. I've been sleeping here, you know,\" she announced, proud of herself. \"Oh, Mom, you don't have to do that! You can sleep at home \u2014 I'll never notice.\" The swirl of painkillers in my brain was making it hard to concentrate even now, though, apparently, I'd been sleeping for days. \"I was too nervous,\" she admitted sheepishly. \"There's been some crime in the \u00a0neighborhood, and I don't like being there alone.\" \"Crime?\" I asked in alarm. \"Someone broke into that dance studio around the corner from the house and burned it to the ground \u2014 there's nothing left at all! And they left a stolen car right out front. Do you remember when you used to dance there, honey?\" \"I remember.\" I shivered, and winced. \"I can stay, baby, if you need me.\" \"No, Mom, I'll be fine. Edward will be with me.\" She looked like that might be why she wanted to stay. \"I'll be back tonight.\" It sounded as much like a warning as it sounded like a promise, and she glanced at Edward again as she said it. \"I love you, Mom.\" \"I love you, too, Bella. Try to be more careful when you walk, honey, I don't want to lose you.\" Edward's eyes stayed closed, but a wide grin flashed across his face. A nurse came bustling in then to check all my tubes and wires. My mother kissed my forehead, patted my gauze-wrapped hand, and left. The nurse was checking the paper readout on my heart monitor. \"Are you feeling anxious, honey? Your heart rate got a little high there.\" \"I'm fine,\" I assured her. \"I'll tell your RN that you're awake. She'll be in to see you in a minute.\" As soon as she closed the door, Edward was at my side. \"You stole a car?\" I raised my eyebrows. He smiled, unrepentant. \"It was a good car, very fast.\" \"How was your nap?\" I asked. \"Interesting.\" His eyes narrowed. \"What?\" He looked down while he answered. \"I'm surprised. I thought Florida\u2026 and your mother\u2026 well, I thought that's what you would want.\" I stared at him uncomprehendingly. \"But you'd be stuck inside all day in Florida. You'd only be able to come out at night, just like a real vampire.\" He almost smiled, but not quite. And then his face was grave. \"I would stay in Forks, Bella. Or somewhere like it,\" he explained. \"Someplace where I couldn't hurt you anymore.\" It didn't sink in at first. I continued to stare at him blankly as the words one by one clicked into place in my head like a ghastly puzzle. I was barely conscious of the sound of my heart accelerating, though, as my breathing became hyperventilation, I was aware of the sharp aching in my protesting ribs. He didn't say anything; he watched my face warily as the pain that had nothing to do with broken bones, pain that was infinitely worse, threatened to crush me. And then another nurse walked purposefully into the room. Edward sat still as stone as she took in my expression with a practiced eye before turning to the monitors. \"Time for more pain meds, sweetheart?\" she asked kindly, tapping the IV feed. \"No, no,\" I mumbled, trying to keep the agony out of my voice. \"I don't need anything.\" I couldn't afford to close my eyes now. \"No need to be brave, honey. It's better if you don't get too stressed out; you need to rest.\" She waited, but I just shook my head. \"Okay,\" she sighed. \"Hit the call button when you're ready.\" She gave Edward a stern look, and threw one more anxious glance at the machinery, before leaving. His cool hands were on my face; I stared at him with wild eyes. \"Shhh, Bella, calm down.\" \"Don't leave me,\" I begged in a broken voice. \"I won't,\" he promised. \"Now relax before I call the nurse back to sedate you.\" But my heart couldn't slow. \"Bella.\" He stroked my face anxiously. \"I'm not going anywhere. I'll be right here as long as you need me.\" \"Do you swear you won't leave me?\" I whispered. I tried to control the gasping, at least. My ribs were throbbing. He put his hands on either side of my face and brought his face close to mine. His eyes were wide and serious. \"I swear.\" The smell of his breath was soothing. It seemed to ease the ache of my breathing. He continued to hold my gaze while my body slowly relaxed and the beeping returned to a normal pace. His eyes were dark, closer to black than gold today. \"Better?\" he asked. \"Yes,\" I said cautiously. He shook his head and muttered something unintelligible. I thought I picked out the word \"overreaction.\" \"Why did you say that?\" I whispered, trying to keep my voice from shaking. \"Are you tired of having to save me all the time? Do you want me to go away?\" \"No, I don't want to be without you, Bella, of course not. Be rational.  And I have no problem with saving you, either \u2014 if it weren't for the fact that I was the one putting you in danger\u2026 that I'm the reason that you're here.\" \"Yes, you are the reason.\" I frowned. \"The reason I'm here \u2014 alive.\" \"Barely.\" His voice was just a whisper. \"Covered in gauze and plaster and hardly able to move.\" \"I wasn't referring to my most recent near-death experience,\" I said, growing irritated. \"I was thinking of the others \u2014 you can take your pick. If it weren't for you, I would be rotting away in the Forks cemetery.\" He winced at my words, but the haunted look didn't leave his eyes. \"That's not the worst part, though,\" he continued to whisper. He acted as if I hadn't spoken. \"Not seeing you there on the floor\u2026 crumpled and broken.\" His voice was choked. \"Not thinking I was too late. Not even hearing you scream in pain \u2014 all those unbearable memories that I'll carry with me for the rest of eternity. No, the very worst was feeling\u2026 knowing that I couldn't stop. Believing that I was going to kill you myself.\" \"But you didn't.\" \"I could have. So easily.\" I knew I needed to stay calm\u2026 but he was trying to talk himself into leaving me, and the panic fluttered in my lungs, trying to get out.  \"Promise me,\" I whispered. \"What?\" \"You know what.\" I was starting to get angry now. He was so stubbornly determined to dwell on the negative. He heard the change in my tone. His eyes tightened. \"I don't seem to be strong enough to stay away from you, so I suppose that you'll get your way\u2026 whether it kills you or not,\" he added roughly. \"Good.\" He hadn't promised, though \u2014 a fact that I had not missed. The panic was only barely contained; I had no strength left to control the anger. \"You told me how you stopped\u2026 now I want to know why,\" I demanded. \"Why?\" he repeated warily. \"Why you did it. Why didn't you just let the venom spread? By now I would be just like you.\" Edward's eyes seemed to turn flat black, and I remembered that this was something he'd never intended me to know. Alice must have been preoccupied by the things she'd learned about herself\u2026 or she'd been very careful with her thoughts around him \u2014 clearly, he'd had no idea that she'd filled me in on the mechanics of vampire conversions. He was surprised, and infuriated. His nostrils flared, his mouth looked as if it was chiseled from stone. He wasn't going to answer, that much was clear. \"I'll be the first to admit that I have no experience with relationships,\" I said. \"But it just seems logical\u2026 a man and woman have to be somewhat equal\u2026 as in, one of them can't always be swooping in and saving the other one. They have to save each other equally.\" He folded his arms on the side of my bed and rested his chin on his arms. His expression was smooth, the anger reined in. Evidently he'd decided he wasn't angry with me. I hoped I'd get a chance to warn Alice before he caught up with her. \"You have saved me,\" he said quietly. \"I can't always be Lois Lane,\" I insisted. \"I want to be Superman, too.\" \"You don't know what you're asking.\" His voice was soft; he stared intently at the edge of the pillowcase. \"I think I do.\" \"Bella, you don't know. I've had almost ninety years to think about this, and I'm still not sure.\" \"Do you wish that Carlisle hadn't saved you?\" \"No, I don't wish that.\" He paused before continuing. \"But my life was over. I wasn't giving anything up.\" \"You are my life. You're the only thing it would hurt me to lose.\" I was getting better at this. It was easy to admit how much I needed him. He was very calm, though. Decided. \"I can't do it, Bella. I won't do that to you.\" \"Why not?\" My throat rasped and the words weren't as loud as I'd meant them to be. \"Don't tell me it's too hard! After today, or I guess it was a few days ago\u2026 anyway, after that, it should be nothing.\" He glared at me. \"And the pain?\" he asked. I blanched. I couldn't help it. But I tried to keep my expression from showing how clearly I remembered the feeling\u2026 the fire in my veins. \"That's my problem,\" I said. \"I can handle it.\" \"It's possible to take bravery to the point where it becomes insanity.\" \"It's not an issue. Three days. Big deal.\" Edward grimaced again as my words reminded him that I was more informed than he had ever intended me to be. I watched him repress the anger, watched as his eyes grew speculative. \"Charlie?\" he asked curtly. \"Ren\u00e9e?\" Minutes passed in silence as I struggled to answer his question. I opened my mouth, but no sound came out. I closed it again. He waited, and his expression became triumphant because he knew I had no true answer. \"Look, that's not an issue either,\" I finally muttered; my voice was as unconvincing as it always was when I lied. \"Ren\u00e9e has always made the choices that work for her \u2014 she'd want me to do the same. And Charlie's resilient, he's used to being on his own. I can't take care of them forever. I have my own life to live.\" \"Exactly,\" he snapped. \"And I won't end it for you.\" \"If you're waiting for me to be on my deathbed, I've got news for you! I was just there!\" \"You're going to recover,\" he reminded me. I took a deep breath to calm myself, ignoring the spasm of pain it triggered. I stared at him, and he stared back. There was no compromise in his face. \"No,\" I said slowly. \"I'm not.\" His forehead creased. \"Of course you are. You may have a scar or two\u2026\" \"You're wrong,\" I insisted. \"I'm going to die.\" \"Really, Bella.\" He was anxious now. \"You'll be out of here in a few days. Two week at most.\" I glared at him. \"I may not die now\u2026 but I'm going to die sometime. Every minute of the day, I get closer. And I'm going to get old.\" He frowned as what I was saying sunk in, pressing his long fingers to his temples and closing his eyes. \"That's how it's supposed to happen. How it should happen. How it would have happened if I didn't exist \u2014 and I shouldn't exist.\" I snorted. He opened his eyes in surprise. \"That's stupid. That's like going to someone who's just won the lottery, taking their money, and saying, 'Look, let's just go back to how things should be. It's better that way.' And I'm not buying it.\" \"I'm hardly a lottery prize,\" he growled. \"That's right. You're much better.\" He rolled his eyes and set his lips. \"Bella, we're not having this discussion anymore. I refuse to damn you to an eternity of night and that's the end of it.\" \"If you think that's the end, then you don't know me very well,\" I warned him. \"You're not the only vampire I know.\" His eyes went black again. \"Alice wouldn't dare.\" And for a moment he looked so frightening that I couldn't help but believe it \u2014 I couldn't imagine someone brave enough to cross him. \"Alice already saw it, didn't she?\" I guessed. \"That's why the things she says upset you. She knows I'm going to be like you\u2026 someday.\" \"She's wrong. She also saw you dead, but that didn't happen, either.\" \"You'll never catch me betting against Alice.\" We stared at each other for a very long time. It was quiet except for the whirring of the machines, the beeping, the dripping, the ticking of the big clock on the wall. Finally, his expression softened. \"So where does that leave us?\" I wondered. He chuckled humorlessly. \"I believe it's called an impasse.\" I sighed. \"Ouch,\" I muttered. \"How are you feeling?\" he asked, eyeing the button for the nurse. \"I'm fine,\" I lied. \"I don't believe you,\" he said gently. \"I'm not going back to sleep.\" \"You need rest. All this arguing isn't good for you.\" \"So give in,\" I hinted. \"Nice try.\" He reached for the button. \"No!\" He ignored me. \"Yes?\" the speaker on the wall squawked. \"I think we're ready for more pain medication,\" he said calmly, ignoring my furious expression. \"I'll send in the nurse.\" The voice sounded very bored. \"I won't take it,\" I promised. He looked toward the sack of fluids hanging beside my bed. \"I don't think they're going to ask you to swallow anything.\" My heart rate started to climb. He read the fear in my eyes, and sighed in frustration. \"Bella, you're in pain. You need to relax so you can heal. Why are you being so difficult?  They're not going to put any more needles in you now.\" \"I'm not afraid of the needles,\" I mumbled. \"I'm afraid to close my eyes.\" Then he smiled his crooked smile, and took my face between his hands. \"I told you I'm not going anywhere. Don't be afraid. As long as it makes you happy, I'll be here.\" I smiled back, ignoring the ache in my cheeks. \"You're talking about forever, you know.\" \"Oh, you'll get over it \u2014 it's just a crush.\" I shook my head in disbelief\u2014 it made me dizzy. \"I was shocked when Ren\u00e9e swallowed that one. I know you know better.\" \"That's the beautiful thing about being human,\" he told me. \"Things change.\" My eyes narrowed. \"Don't hold your breath.\" He was laughing when the nurse came in, brandishing a syringe. \"Excuse me,\" she said brusquely to Edward. He got up and crossed to the end of the small room, leaning against the wall. He folded his arms and waited. I kept my eyes on him, still apprehensive. He met my gaze calmly. \"Here you go, honey.\" The nurse smiled as she injected the medicine into my tube. \"You'll feel better now.\" \"Thanks,\" I mumbled, unenthusiastic. It didn't take long. I could feel the drowsiness trickling through my bloodstream almost immediately. \"That ought to do it,\" she muttered as my eyelids drooped. She must have left the room, because something cold and smooth touched my face. \"Stay.\" The word was slurred. \"I will,\" he promised. His voice was beautiful, like a lullaby. \"Like I said, as long as it makes you happy\u2026 as long as it's what's best for you.\" I tried to shake my head, but it was too heavy. \"S not the same thing,\" I mumbled. He laughed. \"Don't worry about that now, Bella. You can argue with me when you wake up.\" I think I smiled. '\"Kay.\" I could feel his lips at my ear. \"I love you,\" he whispered. \"Me, too.\" \"I know,\" he laughed quietly. I turned my head slightly\u2026 searching. He knew what I was after. His lips touched mine gently. \"Thanks,\" I sighed. \"Anytime.\" I wasn't really there at all anymore. But I fought against the stupor weakly. There was just one more thing I wanted to tell him. \"Edward?\" I struggled to pronounce his name clearly. \"Yes?\" \"I'm betting on Alice,\" I mumbled. And then the night closed over me.",
