            "en": "One hundred years later, a prince was out hunting. He asked his companions, \u201cWhat are those towers above the treetops?\u201d  Some said that an ogre lived there, others said that witches danced there at full moon, and a third theory went that it was home to a sleeping princess.  The curious prince pointed his horse towards the tower and rode through the trees. He soon came to a dark place where the thorn bushes were so thick and sharp that no one could pass through them. But for him alone, the <em>brambles</em> parted and made way. On he rode, through the gates of the palace itself, where he found that every lord and master, every horse and hound, lay fast asleep. He saw food on plates, glasses half full, fire\u2019s still burning, everything exactly as it had been.",
