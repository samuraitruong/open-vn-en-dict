A private funeral was expected to be held at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale. Pop icon Michael Jackson, a friend of Taylor's, is one of a number of stars also buried at the cemetery. Taylor, one of the 20th Century's biggest movie stars, died in Los Angeles on Wednesday of congestive heart failure. She was 79.  Police spokesman Tom Lorenz told the Associated Press that about four dozen family members were expected to attend the funeral, and there would be no procession. Officials at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park had requested police assistance for the ceremony, he said. Taylor's most famous films included National Velvet, Cleopatra and Who's Afraid of Virginia <em>Woolf</em>? She was equally well-known for her glamour and film partnership with Richard Burton, one of seven husbands. The peak of her film career came in the 1950s and 1960s, with four Oscar nominations in a row from 1958 to 1961. Taylor's Hollywood contemporaries have been paying tribute to her as an actress, friend, and activist on HIV/Aids.",
