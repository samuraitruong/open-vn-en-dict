            "en": "13        13. CONFESSIONS Edward in the sunlight was shocking. I couldn't get used to it, though I'd been staring at him all afternoon. His skin, white despite the faint flush from yesterday's hunting trip, literally sparkled, like thousands of tiny diamonds were embedded in the surface. He lay perfectly still in the grass, his shirt open over his sculpted, incandescent chest, his scintillating arms bare. His glistening, pale lavender lids were shut, though of course he didn't sleep. A perfect statue, carved in some unknown stone, smooth like marble, glittering like crystal. Now and then, his lips would move, so fast it looked like they were trembling. But, when I asked, he told me he was singing to himself; it was too low for me to hear. I enjoyed the sun, too, though the air wasn't quite dry enough for my taste. I would have liked to lie back, as he did, and let the sun warm my face. But I stayed curled up, my chin resting on my knees, unwilling to take my eyes off him. The wind was gentle; it tangled my hair and ruffled the grass that swayed around his motionless form. The meadow, so spectacular to me at first, paled next to his magnificence. Hesitantly, always afraid, even now, that he would disappear like a mirage, too beautiful to be real\u2026 hesitantly, I reached out one finger and stroked the back of his shimmering hand, where it lay within my reach. I marveled again at the perfect texture, satin smooth, cool as stone. When I looked up again, his eyes were open, watching me. Butterscotch today, lighter, warmer after hunting. His quick smile turned up the corners of his flawless lips. \"I don't scare you?\" he asked playfully, but I could hear the real curiosity in his soft voice. \"No more than usual.\" He smiled wider; his teeth flashed in the sun. I inched closer, stretched out my whole hand now to trace the contours of his forearm with my fingertips. I saw that my fingers trembled, and knew it wouldn't escape his notice. \"Do you mind?\" I asked, for he had closed his eyes again. \"No,\" he said without opening his eyes. \"You can't imagine how that feels.\" He sighed. I lightly trailed my hand over the perfect muscles of his arm, followed\u00a0 the faint pattern of bluish veins inside the crease at his elbow. With my other hand, I reached to turn his hand over. Realizing what I wished, he flipped his palm up in one of those blindingly fast, disconcerting movements of his. It startled me; my fingers froze on his arm for a brief second. \"Sorry,\" he murmured. I looked up in time to see his golden eyes close again. \"It's too easy to be myself with you.\" I lifted his hand, turning it this way and that as I watched the sun glitter on his palm. I held it closer to my face, trying to see the hidden facets in his skin. \"Tell me what you're thinking,\" he whispered. I looked to see his eyes watching me, suddenly intent. \"It's still so strange for me, not knowing.\" \"You know, the rest of us feel that way all the time.\" \"It's a hard life.\" Did I imagine the hint of regret in his tone? \"But you didn't tell me.\" \"I was wishing I could know what you were thinking\u2026\" I hesitated. \"And?\" \"I was wishing that I could believe that you were real. And I was wishing that I wasn't afraid.\" \"I don't want you to be afraid.\" His voice was just a soft murmur. I heard what he couldn't truthfully say, that I didn't need to be afraid, that there was nothing to fear. \"Well, that's not exactly the fear I meant, though that's certainly something to think about.\" So quickly that I missed his movement, he was half sitting, propped up on his right arm, his left palm still in my hands. His angel's face was only a few inches from mine. I might have \u2014 should have \u2014 flinched away from his unexpected closeness, but I was unable to move.  His golden eyes mesmerized me. \"What are you afraid of, then?\" he whispered intently. But I couldn't answer. As I had just that once before, I smelled his cool breath in my face. Sweet, delicious, the scent made my mouth water. It was unlike anything else. Instinctively, unthinkingly, I leaned closer, inhaling. And he was gone, his hand ripped from mine. In the time it took my eyes to focus, he was twenty feet away, standing at the edge of the small meadow, in the deep shade of a huge fir tree. He stared at me, his eyes dark in the shadows, his expression unreadable. I could feel the hurt and shock on my face. My empty hands stung. \"I'm\u2026 sorry\u2026 Edward,\" I whispered. I knew he could hear. \"Give me a moment,\" he called, just loud enough for my less sensitive ears. I sat very still. After ten incredibly long seconds, he walked back, slowly for him. He stopped, still several feet away, and sank gracefully to the ground, crossing his legs. His eyes never left mine.  He took two deep breaths, and then smiled in apology. \"I am so very sorry.\" He hesitated. \"Would you understand what I meant if I said I was only human?\" I nodded once, not quite able to smile at his joke. Adrenaline pulsed through my veins as the realization of danger slowly sank in. He could smell that from where he sat. His smile turned mocking. \"I'm the world's best predator, aren't I? Everything about me invites you in \u2014 my voice, my face, even my smell. As if I need any of that!\" Unexpectedly, he was on his feet, bounding away, instantly out of sight, only to appear beneath the same tree as before, having circled the meadow in half a second. \"As if you could outrun me,\" he laughed bitterly. He reached up with one hand and, with a deafening crack, effortlessly ripped a two-foot-thick branch from the trunk of the spruce. He balanced it in that hand for a moment, and then threw it with blinding speed, shattering it against another huge tree, which shook and trembled at the blow. And he was in front of me again, standing two feet away, still as a stone. \"As if you could fight me off,\" he said gently. I sat without moving, more frightened of him than I had ever been. I'd never seen him so completely freed of that carefully cultivated facade. He'd never been less human\u2026 or more beautiful. Face ashen, eyes wide, I sat like a bird locked in the eyes of a snake. His lovely eyes seem to glow with rash excitement. Then, as the seconds passed, they dimmed. His expression slowly folded into a mask of ancient sadness. \"Don't be afraid,\" he murmured, his velvet voice unintentionally seductive. \"I promise\u2026\" He hesitated. \"I swear not to hurt you.\" He seemed more concerned with convincing himself than me. \"Don't be afraid,\" he whispered again as he stepped closer, with exaggerated slowness. He sat sinuously, with deliberately unhurried movements, till our faces were on the same level, just a foot apart. \"Please forgive me,\" he said formally. \"I can control myself. You caught me off guard. But I'm on my best behavior now.\" He waited, but I still couldn't speak. \"I'm not thirsty today, honestly.\" He winked. At that I had to laugh, though the sound was shaky and breathless. \"Are you all right?\" he asked tenderly, reaching out slowly, carefully, to place his marble hand back in mine. I looked at his smooth, cold hand, and then at his eyes. They were soft, repentant. I looked back at his hand, and then deliberately returned to tracing the lines in his hand with my fingertip. I looked up and smiled timidly. His answering smile was dazzling. \"So where were we, before I behaved so rudely?\" he asked in the gentle cadences of an earlier century. \"I honestly can't remember.\" He smiled, but his face was ashamed. \"I think we were talking about why you were afraid, besides the obvious reason.\" \"Oh, right.\" \"Well?\" I looked down at his hand and doodled aimlessly across his smooth, iridescent palm. The seconds ticked by. \"How easily frustrated I am,\" he sighed. I looked into his eyes, abruptly grasping that this was every bit as new to him as it was to me. As many years of unfathomable experience as he had, this was hard for him, too. I took courage from that thought. \"I was afraid\u2026 because, for, well, obvious reasons, I can't stay with you. And I'm afraid that I'd like to stay with you, much more than I should.\" I looked down at his hands as I spoke. It was difficult for me to say this aloud. \"Yes,\" he agreed slowly. \"That is something to be afraid of, indeed. Wanting to be with me. That's really not in your best interest.\" I frowned. \"I should have left long ago,\" he sighed. \"I should leave now. But I don't know if I can.\" \"I don't want you to leave,\" I mumbled pathetically, staring down again. \"Which is exactly why I should. But don't worry. I'm essentially a selfish creature. I crave your company too much to do what I should.\" \"I'm glad.\" \"Don't be!\" He withdrew his hand, more gently this time; his voice was harsher than usual. Harsh for him, still more beautiful than any human voice. It was hard to keep up \u2014 his sudden mood changes left me always a step behind, dazed. \"It's not only your company I crave! Never forget that. Never forget I am more dangerous to you than I am to anyone else.\" He stopped, and I looked to see him gazing unseeingly into the forest. I thought for a moment. \"I don't think I understand exactly what you mean \u2014 by that last part anyway,\" I said. He looked back at me and smiled, his mood shifting yet again. \"How do I explain?\" he mused. \"And without frightening you again\u2026 hmmmm.\" Without seeming to think about it, he placed his hand back in mine; I held it tightly in both of mine. He looked at our hands. \"That's amazingly pleasant, the warmth.\" He sighed. A moment passed as he assembled his thoughts. \"You know how everyone enjoys different flavors?\" he began. \"Some people love chocolate ice cream, others prefer strawberry?\" I nodded. \"Sorry about the food analogy \u2014 I couldn't think of another way to explain.\" I smiled. He smiled ruefully back. \"You see, every person smells different, has a different essence. If you locked an alcoholic in a room full of stale beer, he'd gladly drink it. But he could resist, if he wished to, if he were a recovering alcoholic. Now let's say you placed in that room a glass of hundred-year-old brandy, the rarest, finest cognac \u2014 and filled the room with its warm aroma \u2014 how do you think he would fare then?\" We sat silently, looking into each other's eyes \u2014 trying to read each other's thoughts. He broke the silence first. \"Maybe that's not the right comparison. Maybe it would be too easy to turn down the brandy. Perhaps I should have made our alcoholic a heroin addict instead.\" \"So what you're saying is, I'm your brand of heroin?\" I teased, trying to lighten the mood. He smiled swiftly, seeming to appreciate my effort. \"Yes, you are exactly my brand of heroin.\" \"Does that happen often?\" I asked. He looked across the treetops, thinking through his response. \"I spoke to my brothers about it.\" He still stared into the distance. \"To Jasper, every one of you is much the same. He's the most recent to join our family. It's a struggle for him to abstain at all. He hasn't had time to grow sensitive to the differences in smell, in flavor.\" He glanced swiftly at me, his expression apologetic. \"Sorry,\" he said. \"I don't mind. Please don't worry about offending me, or frightening me, or whichever. That's the way you think. I can understand, or I can try to at least. Just explain however you can.\" He took a deep breath and gazed at the sky again. \"So Jasper wasn't sure if he'd ever come across someone who was as\" \u2014 he hesitated, looking for the right word \u2014 \"appealing as you are to me.\u00a0 Which makes me think not. Emmett has been on the wagon longer, so to speak, and he understood what I meant. He says twice, for him, once stronger than the other.\" \"And for you?\" \"Never.\" The word hung there for a moment in the warm breeze. \"What did Emmett do?\" I asked to break the silence. It was the wrong question to ask. His face grew dark, his hand clenched into a fist inside mine. He looked away. I waited, but he wasn't going to answer. \"I guess I know,\" I finally said. He lifted his eyes; his expression was wistful, pleading. \"Even the strongest of us fall off the wagon, don't we?\" \"What are you asking? My permission?\" My voice was sharper than I'd intended. I tried to make my tone kinder \u2014 I could guess what his honesty must cost him. \"I mean, is there no hope, then?\" How calmly I could discuss my own death! \"No, no!\" He was instantly contrite. \"Of course there's hope! I mean, of course I won't\u2026\" He left the sentence hanging. His eyes burned into mine. \"It's different for us. Emmett\u2026 these were strangers he happened across. It was a long time ago, and he wasn't as\u2026 practiced, as careful, as he is now.\" He fell silent and watched me intently as I thought it through. \"So if we'd met\u2026 oh, in a dark alley or something\u2026\" I trailed off. \"It took everything I had not to jump up in the middle of that class full of children and \u2014\" He stopped abruptly, looking away. \"When you walked past me, I could have ruined everything Carlisle has built for us, right then and there. If I hadn't been denying my thirst for the last, well, too many years, I wouldn't have been able to stop myself.\" He paused, scowling at the trees. He glanced at me grimly, both of us remembering. \"You must have thought I was possessed.\" \"I couldn't understand why. How you could hate me so quickly\u2026\" \"To me, it was like you were some kind of demon, summoned straight from my own personal hell to ruin me. The fragrance coming off your skin\u2026 I thought it would make me deranged that first day. In that one hour, I thought of a hundred different ways to lure you from the room with me, to get you alone. And I fought them each back, thinking of my family, what I could do to them. I had to run out, to get away before I could speak the words that would make you follow\u2026\" He looked up then at my staggered expression as I tried to absorb his bitter memories. His golden eyes scorched from under his lashes, hypnotic and deadly. \"You would have come,\" he promised. I tried to speak calmly. \"Without a doubt.\" He frowned down at my hands, releasing me from the force of his stare. \"And then, as I tried to rearrange my schedule in a pointless attempt to avoid you, you were there \u2014 in that close, warm little room, the scent was maddening. I so very nearly took you then. There was only one other frail human there \u2014 so easily dealt with.\" I shivered in the warm sun, seeing my memories anew through his eyes, only now grasping the danger. Poor Ms. Cope; I shivered again at how close I'd come to being inadvertently responsible for her death. \"But I resisted. I don't know how. I forced myself not to wait for you, not to follow you from the school. It was easier outside, when I couldn't smell you anymore, to think clearly, to make the right decision. I left the others near home \u2014 I was too ashamed to tell them how weak I was, they only knew something was very wrong \u2014 and then I went straight to Carlisle, at the hospital, to tell him I was leaving.\" I stared in surprise.  \"I traded cars with him \u2014 he had a full tank of gas and I didn't want to stop. I didn't dare to go home, to face Esme. She wouldn't have let me go without a scene. She would have tried to convince me that it wasn't necessary\u2026 \"By the next morning I was in Alaska.\" He sounded ashamed, as if admitting a great cowardice. \"I spent two days there, with some old acquaintances\u2026 but I was homesick. I hated knowing I'd upset Esme, and the rest of them, my adopted family. In the pure air of the mountains it was hard to believe you were so irresistible. I convinced myself it was weak to run away. I'd dealt with temptation before, not of this magnitude, not even close, but I was strong. Who were you, an insignificant little girl\" \u2014 he grinned suddenly \u2014 \"to chase me from the place I wanted to be? So I came back\u2026\" He stared off into space. I couldn't speak. \"I took precautions, hunting, feeding more than usual before seeing you again. I was sure that I was strong enough to treat you like any other human. I was arrogant about it. \"It was unquestionably a complication that I couldn't simply read your thoughts to know what your reaction was to me. I wasn't used to having to go to such circuitous measures, listening to your words in Jessica's mind\u2026 her mind isn't very original, and it was annoying to have to stoop to that. And then I couldn't know if you really meant what you said. It was all extremely irritating.\" He frowned at the memory. \"I wanted you to forget my behavior that first day, if possible, so I tried to talk with you like I would with any person. I was eager actually, hoping to decipher some of your thoughts. But you were too interesting, I found myself caught up in your expressions\u2026 and every now and then you would stir the air with your hand or your hair, and the scent would stun me again\u2026 \"Of course, then you were nearly crushed to death in front of my eyes. Later I thought of a perfectly good excuse for why I acted at that moment \u2014 because if I hadn't saved you, if your blood had been spilled there in front of me, I don't think I could have stopped myself from exposing us for what we are. But I only thought of that excuse later. At the time, all I could think was, 'Not her.'\" He closed his eyes, lost in his <em>agonized</em> confession. I listened, more eager than rational. Common sense told me I should be terrified. Instead, I was relieved to finally understand. And I was filled with compassion for his suffering, even now, as he confessed his craving to take my life. I finally was able to speak, though my voice was faint. \"In the hospital?\" His eyes flashed up to mine. \"I was appalled. I couldn't believe I had put us in danger after all, put myself in your power \u2014 you of all people. As if I needed another motive to kill you.\"  We both flinched as that word slipped out. \"But it had the opposite effect,\" he continued quickly. \"I fought with Rosalie, Emmett, and Jasper when they suggested that now was the time\u2026 the worst fight we've ever had. Carlisle sided with me, and Alice.\" He grimaced when he said her name. I couldn't imagine why. \"Esme told me to do whatever I had to in order to stay.\" He shook his head indulgently. \"All that next day I eavesdropped on the minds of everyone you spoke to, shocked that you kept your word. I didn't understand you at all. But I knew that I couldn't become more involved with you. I did my very best to stay as far from you as possible. And every day the perfume of your skin, your breath, your hair\u2026 it hit me as hard as the very first day.\" He met my eyes again, and they were surprisingly tender. \"And for all that,\" he continued, \"I'd have fared better if I had exposed us all at that first moment, than if now, here \u2014 with no witnesses and nothing to stop me \u2014 I were to hurt you.\" I was human enough to have to ask. \"Why?\" \"Isabella.\" He pronounced my full name carefully, then playfully ruffled my hair with his free hand. A shock ran through my body at his casual touch. \"Bella, I couldn't live with myself if I ever hurt you. You don't know how it's tortured me.\" He looked down, ashamed again. \"The thought of you, still, white, cold\u2026 to never see you blush scarlet again, to never see that flash of intuition in your eyes when you see through my pretenses\u2026 it would be unendurable.\" He lifted his glorious, <em>agonized</em> eyes to mine. \"You are the most important thing to me now. The most important thing to me ever.\" My head was spinning at the rapid change in direction our conversation had taken. From the cheerful topic of my impending demise, we were suddenly declaring ourselves. He waited, and even though I looked down to study our hands between us, I knew his golden eyes were on me.  \"You already know how I feel, of course,\" I finally said. \"I'm here\u2026 which, roughly translated, means I would rather die than stay away from you.\" I frowned. \"I'm an idiot.\" \"You are an idiot,\" he agreed with a laugh. Our eyes met, and I laughed, too. We laughed together at the idiocy and sheer impossibility of such a moment. \"And so the lion fell in love with the lamb\u2026\" he murmured. I looked away, hiding my eyes as I thrilled to the word. \"What a stupid lamb,\" I sighed. \"What a sick, masochistic lion.\" He stared into the shadowy forest for a long moment, and I wondered where his thoughts had taken him. \"Why\u2026 ?\" I began, and then paused, not sure how to continue. He looked at me and smiled; sunlight glinted off his face, his teeth.  \"Yes?\" \"Tell me why you ran from me before.\" His smile faded. \"You know why.\" \"No, I mean, exactly what did I do wrong? I'll have to be on my guard, you see, so I better start learning what I shouldn't do. This, for example\" \u2014 I stroked the back of his hand \u2014 \"seems to be all right.\" He smiled again. \"You didn't do anything wrong, Bella. It was my fault.\" \"But I want to help, if I can, to not make this harder for you.\" \"Well\u2026\" He contemplated for a moment. \"It was just how close you were. Most humans instinctively shy away from us, are repelled by our alienness\u2026 I wasn't expecting you to come so close. And the smell of your throat.\" He stopped short, looking to see if he'd upset me. \"Okay, then,\" I said flippantly, trying to alleviate the suddenly tense atmosphere. I tucked my chin. \"No throat exposure.\" It worked; he laughed. \"No, really, it was more the surprise than anything else.\" He raised his free hand and placed it gently on the side of my neck. I sat very still, the chill of his touch a natural warning \u2014 a warning telling me to be terrified. But there was no feeling of fear in me. There were, however, other feelings\u2026 \"You see,\" he said. \"Perfectly fine.\" My blood was racing, and I wished I could slow it, sensing that this must make everything so much more difficult \u2014 the thudding of my pulse in my veins. Surely he could hear it. \"The blush on your cheeks is lovely,\" he murmured. He gently freed his other hand. My hands fell limply into my lap. Softly he brushed my cheek, then held my face between his marble hands. \"Be very still,\" he whispered, as if I wasn't already frozen. Slowly, never moving his eyes from mine, he leaned toward me. Then abruptly, but very gently, he rested his cold cheek against the hollow at the base of my throat. I was quite unable to move, even if I'd wanted to. I listened to the sound of his even breathing, watching the sun and wind play in his bronze hair, more human than any other part of him. With deliberate slowness, his hands slid down the sides of my neck. I shivered, and I heard him catch his breath. But his hands didn't pause as they softly moved to my shoulders, and then stopped. His face drifted to the side, his nose skimming across my collarbone. He came to rest with the side of his face pressed tenderly against my chest. Listening to my heart. \"Ah,\" he sighed. I don't know how long we sat without moving. It could have been hours.  Eventually the throb of my pulse quieted, but he didn't move or speak again as he held me. I knew at any moment it could be too much, and my life could end \u2014 so quickly that I might not even notice. And I couldn't make myself be afraid. I couldn't think of anything, except that he was touching me. And then, too soon, he released me.  His eyes were peaceful. \"It won't be so hard again,\" he said with satisfaction. \"Was that very hard for you?\" \"Not nearly as bad as I imagined it would be. And you?\" \"No, it wasn't bad\u2026 for me.\" He smiled at my inflection. \"You know what I mean.\" I smiled. \"Here.\" He took my hand and placed it against his cheek. \"Do you feel how warm it is?\" And it was almost warm, his usually icy skin. But I barely noticed, for I was touching his face, something I'd dreamed of constantly since the first day I'd seen him. \"Don't move,\" I whispered. No one could be still like Edward. He closed his eyes and became as immobile as stone, a carving under my hand. I moved even more slowly than he had, careful not to make one unexpected move. I caressed his cheek, delicately stroked his eyelid, the purple shadow in the hollow under his eye. I traced the shape of his perfect nose, and then, so carefully, his flawless lips. His lips parted under my hand, and I could feel his cool breath on my fingertips. I wanted to lean in, to inhale the scent of him. So I dropped my hand and leaned away, not wanting to push him too far. He opened his eyes, and they were hungry. Not in a way to make me fear, but rather to tighten the muscles in the pit of my stomach and send my pulse hammering through my veins again. \"I wish,\" he whispered, \"I wish you could feel the\u2026 complexity\u2026 the confusion\u2026 I feel. That you could understand.\" He raised his hand to my hair, then carefully brushed it across my face. \"Tell me,\" I breathed. \"I don't think I can. I've told you, on the one hand, the hunger \u2014 the thirst \u2014 that, deplorable creature that I am, I feel for you. And I think you can understand that, to an extent. Though\" \u2014 he half-smiled \u2014 \"as you are not addicted to any illegal substances, you probably can't empathize completely. \"But\u2026\" His fingers touched my lips lightly, making me shiver again. \"There are other hungers. Hungers I don't even understand, that are foreign to me.\" \"I may understand that better than you think.\" \"I'm not used to feeling so human. Is it always like this?\" \"For me?\" I paused. \"No, never. Never before this.\" He held my hands between his. They felt so feeble in his iron strength. \"I don't know how to be close to you,\" he admitted. \"I don't know if I can.\" I leaned forward very slowly, cautioning him with my eyes. I placed my cheek against his stone chest. I could hear his breath, and nothing else. \"This is enough,\" I sighed, closing my eyes. In a very human gesture, he put his arms around me and pressed his face against my hair. \"You're better at this than you give yourself credit for,\" I noted. \"I have human instincts \u2014 they may be buried deep, but they're there.\" We sat like that for another immeasurable moment; I wondered if he could be as unwilling to move as I was. But I could see the light was fading, the shadows of the forest beginning to touch us, and I sighed. \"You have to go.\" \"I thought you couldn't read my mind.\" \"It's getting clearer.\" I could hear a smile in his voice. He took my shoulders and I looked into his face. \"Can I show you something?\" he asked, sudden excitement flaring in his eyes. \"Show me what?\" \"I'll show you how I travel in the forest.\" He saw my expression. \"Don't worry, you'll be very safe, and we'll get to your truck much faster.\" His mouth twitched up into that crooked smile so beautiful my heart nearly stopped. \"Will you turn into a bat?\" I asked warily. He laughed, louder than I'd ever heard. \"Like I haven't heard that one before!\" \"Right, I'm sure you get that all the time.\" \"Come on, little coward, climb on my back.\" I waited to see if he was kidding, but, apparently, he meant it. He smiled as he read my hesitation, and reached for me. My heart reacted; even though he couldn't hear my thoughts, my pulse always gave me away. He then proceeded to sling me onto his back, with very little effort on my part, besides, when in place, clamping my legs and arms so tightly around him that it would choke a normal person. It was like clinging to a stone. \"I'm a bit heavier than your average backpack,\" I warned.  \"Hah!\" he snorted. I could almost hear his eyes rolling. I'd never seen him in such high spirits before. He startled me, suddenly grabbing my hand, pressing my palm to his face, and inhaling deeply. \"Easier all the time,\" he muttered. And then he was running. If I'd ever feared death before in his presence, it was nothing compared to how I felt now. He streaked through the dark, thick underbrush of the forest like a bullet, like a ghost. There was no sound, no evidence that his feet touched the earth. His breathing never changed, never indicated any effort. But the trees flew by at deadly speeds, always missing us by inches. I was too terrified to close my eyes, though the cool forest air whipped against my face and burned them. I felt as if I were stupidly sticking my head out the window of an airplane in flight. And, for the first time in my life, I felt the dizzy faintness of motion sickness. Then it was over. We'd hiked hours this morning to reach Edward's meadow, and now, in a matter of minutes, we were back to the truck. \"Exhilarating, isn't it?\" His voice was high, excited. He stood motionless, waiting for me to climb down. I tried, but my muscles wouldn't respond. My arms and legs stayed locked around him while my head spun uncomfortably. \"Bella?\" he asked, anxious now. \"I think I need to lie down,\" I gasped. \"Oh, sorry.\" He waited for me, but I still couldn't move. \"I think I need help,\" I admitted. He laughed quietly, and gently unloosened my stranglehold on his neck. There was no resisting the iron strength of his hands. Then he pulled me around to face him, cradling me in his arms like a small child. He held me for a moment, then carefully placed me on the springy ferns. \"How do you feel?\" he asked. I couldn't be sure how I felt when my head was spinning so crazily. \"Dizzy, I think.\" \"Put your head between your knees.\" I tried that, and it helped a little. I breathed in and out slowly, keeping my head very still. I felt him sitting beside me. The moments passed, and eventually I found that I could raise my head. There was a hollow ringing sound in my ears. \"I guess that wasn't the best idea,\" he mused. I tried to be positive, but my voice was weak. \"No, it was very interesting.\" \"Hah! You're as white as a ghost \u2014 no, you're as white as me!\" \"I think I should have closed my eyes.\" \"Remember that next time.\" \"Next time!\" I groaned. He laughed, his mood still radiant. \"Show-off,\" I muttered. \"Open your eyes, Bella,\" he said quietly. And he was right there, his face so close to mine. His beauty stunned my mind \u2014 it was too much, an excess I couldn't grow accustomed to. \"I was thinking, while I was running\u2026\" He paused. \"About not hitting the trees, I hope.\" \"Silly Bella,\" he chuckled. \"Running is second nature to me, it's not something I have to think about.\" \"Show-off,\" I muttered again. He smiled. \"No,\" he continued, \"I was thinking there was something I wanted to try.\" And he took my face in his hands again. I couldn't breathe. He hesitated \u2014 not in the normal way, the human way. Not the way a man might hesitate before he kissed a woman, to gauge her reaction, to see how he would be received. Perhaps he would hesitate to prolong the moment, that ideal moment of anticipation, sometimes better than the kiss itself. Edward hesitated to test himself, to see if this was safe, to make sure he was still in control of his need. And then his cold, marble lips pressed very softly against mine. What neither of us was prepared for was my response. Blood boiled under my skin, burned in my lips. My breath came in a wild gasp. My fingers knotted in his hair, clutching him to me. My lips parted as I breathed in his heady scent. Immediately I felt him turn to unresponsive stone beneath my lips. His hands gently, but with irresistible force, pushed my face back. I opened my eyes and saw his guarded expression. \"Oops,\" I breathed. \"That's an understatement.\" His eyes were wild, his jaw clenched in acute restraint, yet he didn't lapse from his perfect articulation. He held my face just inches from his. He dazzled my eyes. \"Should I\u2026 ?\" I tried to disengage myself, to give him some room. His hands refused to let me move so much as an inch. \"No, it's tolerable. Wait for a moment, please.\" His voice was polite, controlled. I kept my eyes on his, watched as the excitement in them faded and gentled. Then he smiled a surprisingly impish grin. \"There,\" he said, obviously pleased with himself. \"Tolerable?\" I asked. He laughed aloud. \"I'm stronger than I thought. It's nice to know.\" \"I wish I could say the same. I'm sorry.\" \"You are only human, after all.\" \"Thanks so much,\" I said, my voice acerbic. He was on his feet in one of his lithe, almost invisibly quick movements. He held out his hand to me, an unexpected gesture. I was so used to our standard of careful non-contact. I took his icy hand, needing the support more than I thought. My balance had not yet returned. \"Are you still faint from the run? Or was it my kissing expertise?\" How lighthearted, how human he seemed as he laughed now, his seraphic face untroubled. He was a different Edward than the one I had known. And I felt all the more besotted by him. It would cause me physical pain to be separated from him now. \"I can't be sure, I'm still woozy,\" I managed to respond. \"I think it's some of both, though.\" \"Maybe you should let me drive.\" \"Are you insane?\" I protested. \"I can drive better than you on your best day,\" he teased. \"You have much slower reflexes.\" \"I'm sure that's true, but I don't think my nerves, or my truck, could take it.\" \"Some trust, please, Bella.\" My hand was in my pocket, curled tightly around the key. I pursed my lips, deliberated, then shook my head with a tight grin. \"Nope. Not a chance.\" He raised his eyebrows in disbelief. I started to step around him, heading for the driver's side. He might have let me pass if I hadn't wobbled slightly. Then again, he might not have. His arm created an inescapable snare around my waist. \"Bella, I've already expended a great deal of personal effort at this point to keep you alive. I'm not about to let you behind the wheel of a vehicle when you can't even walk straight. Besides, friends don't let friends drive drunk,\" he quoted with a chuckle. I could smell the unbearably sweet fragrance coming off his chest. \"Drunk?\" I objected. \"You're intoxicated by my very presence.\" He was grinning that playful smirk again. \"I can't argue with that,\" I sighed.; I couldn't resist him in anything. I held the key high and dropped it, watching his hand flash like lightning to catch it soundlessly. \"Take it easy \u2014 my truck is a senior citizen.\" \"Very sensible,\" he approved. \"And are you not affected at all?\" I asked, irked. \"By my presence?\" Again his mobile features transformed, his expression became soft, warm. He didn't answer at first; he simply bent his face to mine, and brushed his lips slowly along my jaw, from my ear to my chin, back and forth. I trembled. \"Regardless,\" he finally murmured, \"I have better reflexes.\"",

            "en": "7 REPETITION         16. PARIS AT THAT MOMENT, MY HEAD BROKE THE SURFACE. How disorienting. I'd been sure I was sinking. The current wouldn't let up. It was slamming me against more rocks; they beat against the center of my back sharply, rhythmically, pushing the water from my lungs. It gushed out in amazing volume, absolute torrents pouring from my mouth and nose. The salt burned and my lungs burned and my throat was too full of water to catch a breath and the rocks were hurting my back. Somehow I stayed in one place, though the waves still heaved around me. I couldn't see anything but water everywhere, reaching for my face. \"Breathe!\" a voice, wild with anxiety, ordered, and I felt a cruel stab of pain when I recognized the voice\u2014because it wasn't Edward's. I could not obey. The waterfall pouring from my mouth didn't stop long enough for me to catch a breath. The black, icy water filled my chest, burning. The rock smacked into my back again, right between my shoulder blades, and another volley of water choked its way out of my lungs. \"Breathe, Bella! C'mon!\" Jacob begged. Black spots bloomed across my vision, getting wider and wider, blocking out the light. The rock struck me again. The rock wasn't cold like the water; it was hot on my skin. I realized it was Jacob's hand, trying to beat the water from my lungs. The iron bar that had dragged me from the sea was also\u2026 warm\u2026 My head whirled, the black spots covered everything\u2026 Was I dying again, then? I didn't like it\u2014this wasn't as good as the last time. It was only dark now, nothing worth looking at here. The sound of the crashing waves faded into the black and became a quiet, even whoosh that sounded like it was coming from the inside of my ears\u2026 \"Bella?\" Jacob asked, his voice still tense, but not as wild as before. \"Bells, honey, can you hear me?\" The contents of my head swished and rolled sickeningly, like they'd joined the rough water\u2026 \"How long has she been unconscious?\" someone else asked. The voice that was not Jacob's shocked me, jarred me into a more focused awareness. I realized that I was still. There was no tug of the current on me\u2014the heaving was inside my head. The surface under me was flat and motionless. It felt grainy against my bare arms. \"I don't know,\" Jacob reported, still frantic. His voice was very close. Hands\u2014so warm they had to be his\u2014brushed wet hair from my cheeks. \"A few minutes? It didn't take long to tow her to the beach.\" The quiet whooshing inside my ears was not the waves\u2014it was the air moving in and out of my lungs again. Each breath burned\u2014the passageways were as raw as if I'd scrubbed them out with steel wool. But I was breathing. And I was freezing. A thousand sharp, icy beads were striking my face and arms, making the cold worse. \"She's breathing. She'll come around. We should get her out of the cold, though. I don't like the color she's turning\u2026\" I recognized Sam's voice this time. \"You think it's okay to move her?\" \"She didn't hurt her back or anything when she fell?\" \"I don't know.\" They hesitated. I tried to open my eyes. It took me a minute, but then I could see the dark, purple clouds, flinging the freezing rain down at me. \"Jake?\" I croaked. Jacob's face blocked out the sky. \"Oh!\" he gasped, relief washing over his features. His eyes were wet from the rain. \"Oh, Bella! Are you okay? Can you hear me? Do you hurt anywhere?\" \"J-Just m-my throat,\" I stuttered, my lips quivering from the cold. \"Let's get you out of here, then,\" Jacob said. He slid his arms under me and lifted me without effort\u2014like picking up an empty box. His chest was bare and warm; he hunched his shoulders to keep the rain off of me. My head lolled over his arm. I stared vacantly back toward the furious water, beating the sand behind him. \"You got her?\" I heard Sam ask. \"Yeah, I'll take it from here. Get back to the hospital. I'll join you later. Thanks, Sam.\" My head was still rolling. None of his words sunk in at first. Sam didn't answer. There was no sound, and I wondered if he were already gone. The water licked and writhed up the sand after us as Jacob carried me away, like it was angry that I'd escaped. As I stared wearily, a spark of color caught my unfocused eyes\u2014a small flash of fire was dancing on the black water, far out in the bay. The image made no sense, and I wondered how conscious I really was. My head swirled with the memory of the black, churning water\u2014of being so lost that I couldn't find up or down. So lost\u2026 but somehow Jacob\u2026 \"How did you find me?\" I rasped. \"I was searching for you,\" he told me. He was half-jogging through the rain, up the beach toward the road. \"I followed the tire tracks to your truck, and then I heard you scream\u2026\" He shuddered. \"Why would you jump, Bella? Didn't you notice that it's turning into a hurricane out here? Couldn't you have waited for me?\" Anger filled his tone as the relief faded. \"Sorry,\" I muttered. \"It was stupid.\" \"Yeah, it was really stupid,\" he agreed, drops of rain shaking free of his hair as he nodded. \"Look, do you mind saving the stupid stuff for when I'm around? I won't be able to concentrate if I think you're jumping off cliffs behind my back.\" \"Sure,\" I agreed. \"No problem.\" I sounded like a chain-smoker. I tried to clear my throat\u2014and then winced; the throat-clearing felt like stabbing a knife down there. \"What happened today? Did you\u2026 find her?\" It was my turn to shudder, though I wasn't so cold here, right next to his ridiculous body heat. Jacob shook his head. He was still more running than walking as he headed up the road to his house. \"No. She took off into the water\u2014the bloodsuckers have the advantage there. That's why I raced home\u2014I was afraid she was going to double back swimming. You spend so much time on the beach\u2026\" He trailed off, a catch in his throat. \"Sam came back with you\u2026 is everyone else home, too?\" I hoped they weren't still out searching for her. \"Yeah. Sort of.\" I tried to read his expression, squinting into the hammering rain. His eyes were tight with worry or pain. The words that hadn't made sense before suddenly did. \"You said\u2026 hospital. Before, to Sam. Is someone hurt? Did she fight you?\" My voice jumped up an octave, sounding strange with the hoarseness. \"No, no. When we got back, Em was waiting with the news. It's Harry Clearwater. Harry had a heart attack this morning.\" \"Harry?\" I shook my head, trying to absorb what he was saying. \"Oh, no! Does Charlie know?\" \"Yeah. He's over there, too, with my dad.\" \"Is Harry going to be okay?\" Jacob's eyes tightened again. \"It doesn't look so great right now.\" Abruptly, I felt really sick with guilt\u2014felt truly horrible about the brainless cliff dive. Nobody needed to be worrying about me right now. What a stupid time to be reckless. \"What can I do?\" I asked. At that moment the rain stopped. I hadn't realized we were already back to Jacob's house until he walked through the door. The storm pounded against the roof. \"You can stay here,\" Jacob said as he dumped me on the short couch. \"I mean it\u2014right here I'll get you some dry clothes.\" I let my eyes adjust to the dark room while Jacob banged around in his bedroom. The cramped front room seemed so empty without Billy, almost desolate. It was strangely ominous\u2014probably just because I knew where he was. Jacob was back in seconds. He threw a pile of gray cotton at me. \"These will be huge on you, but it's the best I've got. I'll, er, step outside so you can change.\" \"Don't go anywhere. I'm too tired to move yet. Just stay with me.\" Jacob sat on the floor next to me, his back against the couch. I wondered when he'd slept last. He looked as exhausted as I felt. He leaned his head on the cushion next to mine and yawned. \"Guess I could rest for a minute\u2026\" His eyes closed. I let mine slide shut, too. Poor Harry. Poor Sue. I knew Charlie was going to be beside himself. Harry was one of his best friends. Despite Jake's negative take on things, I hoped fervently that Harry would pull through. For Charlie's sake. For Sue's and Leah's and Seth's\u2026 Billy's sofa was right next to the radiator, and I was warm now, despite my soaked clothes. My lungs ached in a way that pushed me toward unconsciousness rather than keeping me awake. I wondered vaguely if it was wrong to sleep\u2026 or was I getting drowning mixed up with concussions\u2026 ? Jacob began softly snoring, and the sound of it soothed like a lullaby. I fell asleep quickly. For the first time in a very long time, my dream was just a normal dream. Just a blurred wandering through old memories\u2014blinding bright visions of the Phoenix sun, my mother's face, a ramshackle tree house, a faded quilt, a wall of mirrors, a flame on the black water\u2026 I forgot each of them as soon as the picture changed. The last picture was the only one that stuck in my head. It was meaningless\u2014just a set on a stage. A balcony at night, a painted moon hanging in the sky. I watched the girl in her nightdress lean on the railing and talk to herself. Meaningless\u2026 but when I slowly struggled back to consciousness, Juliet was on my mind. Jacob was still asleep; he'd slumped down to the floor and his breathing was deep and even. The house was darker now than before, it was black outside the window. I was stiff, but warm and almost dry. The inside of my throat burned with every breath I took. I was going to have to get up\u2014at least to get a drink. But my body just wanted to be here limp, to never move again. Instead of moving, I thought about Juliet some more. I wondered what she would have done if Romeo had left her, not because he was banished, but because he lost interests. \u00a0\u00a0What if Rosaline had given him the time of day, and he'd changed his mind? What if, instead of marrying Juliet, he'd just disappeared? I thought I knew how Juliet would feel. She wouldn't go back to her old life, not really. She wouldn't ever have moved on, I was sure of that.  Even if she'd lived until she was old and gray, every time she closed her eyes, it would have been Romeo's face she saw behind her lids. She would have accepted that, eventually. I wondered if she would have married Paris in the end, just to please her parents, to keep the peace. No, probably not, I decided. But then, the story didn't say much about Paris. He was just a stick figure\u2014a placeholder, a threat, a deadline to force her hand. What if there were more to Paris? What if Paris had been Juliet's friend? Her very best friend? What if he was the only one she could confide in about the whole devastating thing with Romeo? The one person who really understood her and made her feel halfway human again? What if he was patient and kind? What if he took care of her? What if Juliet knew she couldn't survive without him? What if he really loved her, and wanted her to be happy? And\u2026 what if she loved Paris? Not like Romeo. Nothing like that, of course. But enough that she wanted him to be happy, too? Jacob's slow, deep breathing was the only sound in the room\u2014like a lullaby hummed to a child, like the whisper of a rocking chair, like the ticking of an old clock when you had nowhere you needed to go\u2026It was the sound of comfort. If Romeo was really gone, never coming back, would it have mattered whether or not Juliet had taken Paris up on his offer? Maybe she should have tried to settle into the leftover scraps of life that were left behind. Maybe that would have been as close to happiness as she could get. I sighed, and then groaned when the sigh scraped my throat. I was reading too much into the story. Romeo wouldn't change his mind. That's why people still remembered his name, always twined with hers: Romeo and Juliet. That's why it was a good story. \"Juliet gets dumped and ends up with Paris\" would have never been a hit. I closed my eyes and drifted again, letting my mind wander away from the stupid play I didn't want to think about anymore. I thought about reality instead\u2014about jumping off the cliff and what a brainless mistake that had been. And not just the cliff, but the\u00a0\u00a0 motorcycles and the whole irresponsible Evel Knievel bit. What if something bad happened to me? What would that do to Charlie? Harry's heart attack had pushed everything suddenly into perspective for me. Perspective that I didn't want to see, because\u2014if I admitted to the truth of it\u2014it would mean that I would have to change my ways. Could I live like that? Maybe. It wouldn't be easy; in fact, it would be downright miserable to give up my hallucinations and try to be a grown-up. But maybe I should do it. And maybe I could. If I had Jacob. I couldn't make that decision right now. It hurt too much. I'd think about something else. Images from my ill-considered afternoon stunt rolled through my head while I tried to come up with something pleasant to think about\u2026 the feel of the air as I fell, the\u00a0 blackness of the water, the thrashing of the current\u2026 Edward's face\u2026 I lingered there for a long time. Jacob's warm hands, trying to beat life back into me\u2026 the stinging rain flung down by the purple clouds\u2026 the strange fire on the waves\u2026 There was something familiar about that flash of color on top of the water. Of course it couldn't really be fire\u2014 My thoughts were interrupted by the sound of a car squelching through the mud on the road outside. I heard it stop in front of the house, and doors started opening and closing. I thought about sitting up, and then decided against that idea. Billy's voice was easily identifiable, but he kept it uncharacteristically low, so that it was only a gravelly grumble. The door opened, and the light flicked on. I blinked, momentarily blind. Jake startled awake, gasping and jumping to his feet. \"Sorry,\" Billy grunted. \"Did we wake you?\" My eyes slowly focused on his face, and then, as I could read his expression, they filled with tears. \"Oh, no, Billy!\" I moaned. He nodded slowly, his expression hard with grief. Jake hurried to his father and took one of his hands. The pain made his face suddenly childlike\u2014it looked odd on top of the man's body. Sam was right behind Billy, pushing his chair through the door. His normal composure was absent from his <em>agonized</em> face. \"I'm so sorry,\" I whispered. Billy nodded. \"It's gonna be hard all around.\" \"Where's Charlie?\" \"Your dad is still at the hospital with Sue. There are a lot of\u2026 arrangements to be made.\" I swallowed hard. \"I'd better get back there,\" Sam mumbled, and he ducked hastily out the door. Billy pulled his hand away from Jacob, and then he rolled himself through the kitchen toward his room. Jake stared after him for a minute, then came to sit on the floor beside me again. He put his face in his hands. I rubbed his shoulder, wishing I could think of anything to say. After a long moment, Jacob caught my hand and held it to his face. \"How are you feeling? Are you okay? I probably should have taken you to a doctor or something.\" He sighed. \"Don't worry about me,\" I croaked. He twisted his head to look at me. His eyes were rimmed in red. \"You don't look so good.\" \"I don't feel so good, either, I guess.\" \"I'll go get your truck and then take you home\u2014you probably ought to be there when Charlie gets back.\" \"Right.\" I lay listlessly on the sofa while I waited for him. Billy was silent in the other room. I felt like a peeping torn, peering through the cracks at a private sorrow that wasn't mine. It didn't take Jake long. The roar of my truck's engine broke the silence before I expected it. He helped me up from the couch without speaking, keeping his arm around my shoulder when the cold air outside made me shiver. He took the driver's seat without asking, and then pulled me next to his side to keep his arm tight around me. I leaned my head against his chest. \"How will you get home?\" I asked. \"I'm not going home. We still haven't caught the bloodsucker, remember?\" My next shudder had nothing to do with cold. It was a quiet ride after that. The cold air had woken me up. My mind was alert, and it was working very hard and very fast. What if? What was the right thing to do? I couldn't imagine my life without Jacob now\u2014I cringed away from the idea of even trying to imagine that. Somehow, he'd become essential to my survival. But to leave things the way they were\u2026 was that cruel, as Mike had accused? I remembered wishing that Jacob were my brother. I realized now that all I really wanted was a claim on him. It didn't feel brotherly when he held me like this. It just felt nice\u2014warm and comforting and familiar. Safe. Jacob was a safe harbor. I could stake a claim. I had that much within my power. I'd have to tell him everything, I knew that. It was the only way to be fair. I'd have to explain it right, so that he'd know I wasn't settling, that he was much too good for me. He already knew I was broken, that part wouldn't surprise him, but he'd need to know the extent of it. I'd even have to admit that I was crazy\u2014explain about the voices I heard. He'd need to know everything before he made a decision. But, even as I recognized that necessity, I knew he would take me in spite of it all. He wouldn't even pause to think it through. I would have to commit to this\u2014commit as much of me as there was left, every one of the broken pieces. It was the only way to be fair to him. Would I? Could I? Would it be so wrong to try to make Jacob happy? Even if the love I felt for him was no more than a weak echo of what I was capable of, even if my heart was far away, wandering and grieving after my fickle Romeo, would it be so very wrong? Jacob stopped the truck in front of my dark house, cutting the engine so it was suddenly silent. Like so many other times, he seemed to be in tune with my thoughts now. He threw his other arm around me, crushing me against his chest, binding me to him. Again, this felt nice. Almost like being a whole person again. I thought he would be thinking of Harry, but then he spoke, and his tone was apologetic. \"Sorry. I know you don't feel exactly the way I do, Bella. I swear I don't mind. I'm just so glad you're okay that I could sing\u2014and that's something no one wants to hear.\" He laughed his throaty laugh in my ear. My breathing kicked up a notch, sanding the walls of my throat. Wouldn't Edward, indifferent as he might be, want me to be as happy as possible under the circumstances? Wouldn't enough friendly emotion linger for him to want that much for me? I thought he would. He wouldn't begrudge me this: giving just a small bit of love he didn't want to my friend Jacob. After all, it wasn't the same love at all. Jake pressed his warm cheek against the top of my hair. If I turned my face to the side\u2014if I pressed my lips against his bare shoulder... I knew without any doubt what would follow. It would be very easy. There would be no need for explanations tonight. But could I do it? Could I betray my absent heart to save my pathetic life? Butterflies assaulted my stomach as I thought of turning my head. And then, as clearly as if I were in immediate danger, Edward's velvet voice whispered in my ear. \"Be happy,\" he told me. I froze. Jacob felt me stiffen and released me automatically, reaching for the door. Wait, I wanted to say. Just a minute. But I was still locked in place, listening to the echo of Edward's voice in my head. Storm-cooled air blew through the cab of the truck. \"OH!\" The breath whooshed out of Jacob like someone had punched him in the gut. \"Holy crap!\" He slammed the door and twisted the keys in the ignition at the same moment. His hands were shaking so hard I didn't know how he managed it. \"What's wrong?\" He revved the engine too fast; it sputtered and faltered. \"Vampire,\" he spit out. The blood rushed from my head and left me dizzy. \"How do you know?\" \"Because I can smell it. Dammit!\" Jacob's eyes were wild, raking the dark street. He barely seemed aware of the tremors that were rolling through his body. \"Phase or get her out of here?\" he hissed at himself. He looked down at me for a split second, taking in my horror-struck eyes and white face, and then he was scanning the street again. \"Right. Get you out.\" The engine caught with a roar. The tires squealed as he spun the truck around, turning toward our only escape. The headlights washed across the pavement, lit the front line of the black forest, and finally glinted off a car parked across the street from my house. \"Stop!\" I gasped. It was a black car\u2014a car I knew. I might be the furthest thing from an autophile, but I could tell you everything about that particular car. It was a Mercedes S55 AMG. I knew the horsepower and the color of the interior. I knew the feel of the powerful engine purring through the frame. I knew the rich smell of the leather seats and the way the extra-dark tint made noon look like dusk through those windows. It was Carlisle's car. \"Stop!\" I cried again, louder this time, because Jacob was gunning the truck down the street. \"What?!\" \"It's not Victoria. Stop, stop! I want to go back.\" He stomped on the brake so hard I had to catch myself against the dashboard. \"What?\" he asked again, aghast. He stared at me with horror in his eyes. \"It's Carlisle's car! It's the Cullens. I know it.\" He watched dawn break across my face, and a violent tremor rocked his frame. \"Hey, calm down, Jake. It's okay. No danger, see? Relax.\" \"Yeah, calm,\" he panted, putting his head down and closing his eyes. While he concentrated on not exploding into a wolf, I stared out the back window at the black car. It was just Carlisle, I told myself. Don't expect anything more. Maybe Esme\u2026 Stop right there, I told myself. Just Carlisle. That was plenty. More than I'd ever hoped to have again. \"There's a vampire in your house,\" Jacob hissed. \"And you want to go back?\" I glanced at him, ripping my unwilling eyes off the Mercedes\u2014terrified that it would disappear the second I looked away. \"Of course,\" I said, my voice blank with surprise at his question. Of course I wanted to go back. Jacob's face hardened while I stared at him, congealing into the bitter mask that I'd thought was gone for good. Just before he had the mask in place, I caught the spasm of betrayal that flashed in his eyes. His hands were still shaking. He looked ten years older than me. He took a deep breath. \"You're sure it's not a trick?\" he asked in a slow, heavy voice. \"It's not a trick. It's Carlisle. Take me back!\" A shudder rippled through his wide shoulders, but his eyes were flat and emotionless. \"No.\" \"Jake, it's okay\u2014\" \"No. Take yourself back, Bella.\" His voice was a slap\u2014I flinched as the sound of it struck me. His jaw clenched and unclenched. \"Look, Bella,\" he said in the same hard voice. \"I can't go back. Treaty or no treaty, that's my enemy in there.\" \"It's not like that\u2014\" \"I have to tell Sam right away. This changes things. We can't be caught on their territory.\" \"Jake, it's not a war!\" He didn't listen. He put the truck in neutral and jumped out the door, leaving it running. \"Bye, Bella,\" he called back over his shoulder. \"I really hope you don't die.\" He sprinted into the darkness, shaking so hard that his shape seemed blurred; he disappeared before I could open my mouth to call him back. Remorse pinned me against the seat for one long second. What had I just done to Jacob'? But remorse couldn't hold me very long. I slid across the seat and put the truck back in drive. My hands were shaking almost as hard as Jake's had been, and this took a minute of concentration. Then I carefully turned the truck around and drove it back to my house. It was very dark when I turned off the headlights. Charlie had left in such a hurry that he'd forgotten to leave the porch lamp on. I felt a pang of doubt, staring at the house, deep in shadow. What if it was a trick? I looked back at the black car, almost invisible in the night. No. I knew that car. Still, my hands were shaking even worse than before as I reached for the key above the door. When I grabbed the doorknob to unlock it, it twisted easily under my hand. I let the door fall open. The hallway was black. I wanted to call out a greeting, but my throat was too dry. I couldn't quite seem to catch my breath. I took a step inside and fumbled for the light switch. It was so black\u2014like the black water\u2026 Where was that switch? Just like the black water, with the orange flame flickering impossibly on top of it. Flame that couldn't be a fire, but what then\u2026 ? My fingers traced the wall, still searching, still shaking\u2014 Suddenly, something Jacob had told me this afternoon echoed in my head, finally sinking in\u2026 She took off into the water, he'd said. The bloodsuckers have the advantage there. That's why I raced home \u2014I was afraid she was going to double back swimming. My hand froze in its searching, my whole body froze into place, as I realized why I recognized the strange orange color on the water. Victoria's hair, blowing wild in the wind, the color of fire\u2026 She'd been right there. Right there in the harbor with me and Jacob. If Sam hadn't been there, if it had been just the two of us\u2026 ? I couldn't breathe or move. The light flicked on, though my frozen hand had still not found the switch. I blinked into the sudden light, and saw that someone was there, waiting for me.",

            "en": "10        10. INTERROGATIONS It was very hard, in the morning, to argue with the part of me that was sure last night was a dream. Logic wasn't on my side, or common sense. I clung to the parts I couldn't have imagined \u2014 like his smell. I was sure I could never have dreamed that up on my own. It was foggy and dark outside my window, absolutely perfect. He had no reason not to be in school today. I dressed in my heavy clothes, remembering I didn't have a jacket. Further proof that my memory was real. When I got downstairs, Charlie was gone again \u2014 I was running later than I'd realized. I swallowed a granola bar in three bites, chased it down with milk straight from the carton, and then hurried out the door. Hopefully the rain would hold off until I could find Jessica. It was unusually foggy; the air was almost smoky with it. The mist was ice cold where it clung to the exposed skin on my face and neck. I couldn't wait to get the heat going in my truck. It was such a thick fog that I was a few feet down the driveway before I realized there was a car in it: a silver car. My heart thudded, stuttered, and then picked up again in double time. I didn't see where he came from, but suddenly he was there, pulling the door open for me. \"Do you want to ride with me today?\" he asked, amused by my expression as he caught me by surprise yet again. There was uncertainty in his voice. He was really giving me a choice \u2014 I was free to refuse, and part of him hoped for that. It was a vain hope. \"Yes, thank you,\" I said, trying to keep my voice calm. As I stepped into the warm car, I noticed his tan jacket was slung over the headrest of the passenger seat. The door closed behind me, and, sooner than should be possible, he was sitting next to me, starting the car. \"I brought the jacket for you. I didn't want you to get sick or something.\" His voice was guarded. I noticed that he wore no jacket himself, just a light gray knit V-neck shirt with long sleeves. Again, the fabric clung to his perfectly muscled chest. It was a colossal tribute to his face that it kept my eyes away from his body. \"I'm not quite that delicate,\" I said, but I pulled the jacket onto my lap, pushing my arms through the too-long sleeves, curious to see if the scent could possibly be as good as I remembered. It was better. \"Aren't you?\" he contradicted in a voice so low I wasn't sure if he meant for me to hear. We drove through the fog-shrouded streets, always too fast, feeling awkward. I was, at least. Last night all the walls were down\u2026 almost all. I didn't know if we were still being as candid today. It left me tongue-tied. I waited for him to speak. He turned to smirk at me. \"What, no twenty questions today?\" \"Do my questions bother you?\" I asked, relieved. \"Not as much as your reactions do.\" He looked like he was joking, but I couldn't be sure. I frowned. \"Do I react badly?\" \"No, that's the problem. You take everything so coolly \u2014 it's unnatural.\u00a0 It makes me wonder what you're really thinking.\" \"I always tell you what I'm really thinking.\" \"You edit,\" he accused. \"Not very much.\" \"Enough to drive me insane.\" \"You don't want to hear it,\" I mumbled, almost whispered. As soon as the words were out, I regretted them. The pain in my voice was very faint; I could only hope he hadn't noticed it. He didn't respond, and I wondered if I had ruined the mood. His face was unreadable as we drove into the school parking lot. Something occurred to me belatedly. \"Where's the rest of your family?\" I asked \u2014 more than glad to be alone with him, but remembering that his car was usually full. \"They took Rosalie's car.\" He shrugged as he parked next to a glossy red convertible with the top up. \"Ostentatious, isn't it?\" \"Um, wow,\" I breathed. \"If she has that, why does she ride with you?\" \"Like I said, it's ostentatious. We try to blend in.\" \"You don't succeed.\" I laughed and shook my head as we got out of the car. I wasn't late anymore; his lunatic driving had gotten me to school in plenty of time. \"So why did Rosalie drive today if it's more conspicuous?\" \"Hadn't you noticed? I'm breaking all the rules now.\" He met me at the front of the car, staying very close to my side as we walked onto campus. I wanted to close that little distance, to reach out and touch him, but I was afraid he wouldn't like me to. \"Why do you have cars like that at all?\" I wondered aloud. \"If you're looking for privacy?\" \"An indulgence,\" he admitted with an impish smile. \"We all like to drive fast.\" \"Figures,\" I muttered under my breath. Under the shelter of the cafeteria roof's overhang, Jessica was waiting, her eyes about to bug out of their sockets. Over her arm, bless her, was my jacket. \"Hey, Jessica,\" I said when we were a few feet away. \"Thanks for remembering.\" She handed me my jacket without speaking. \"Good morning, Jessica,\" Edward said politely. It wasn't really his fault that his voice was so irresistible. Or what his eyes were capable of.  \"Er\u2026 hi.\" She shifted her wide eyes to me, trying to gather her jumbled thoughts. \"I guess I'll see you in Trig.\" She gave me a meaningful look, and I suppressed a sigh. What on earth was I going to tell her? \"Yeah, I'll see you then.\" She walked away, pausing twice to peek back over her shoulder at us. \"What are you going to tell her?\" Edward murmured. \"Hey, I thought you couldn't read my mind!\" I hissed. \"I can't,\" he said, startled. Then understanding brightened his eyes. \"However, I can read hers \u2014 she'll be waiting to ambush you in class.\" I groaned as I pulled off his jacket and handed it to him, replacing it with my own. He folded it over his arm. \"So what are you going to tell her?\" \"A little help?\" I pleaded. \"What does she want to know?\" He shook his head, grinning wickedly. \"That's not fair.\" \"No, you not sharing what you know \u2014 now that's not fair.\" He deliberated for a moment as we walked. We stopped outside the door to my first class. \"She wants to know if we're secretly dating. And she wants to know how you feel about me,\" he finally said. \"Yikes. What should I say?\" I tried to keep my expression very innocent. People were passing us on their way to class, probably staring, but I was barely aware of them. \"Hmmm.\" He paused to catch a stray lock of hair that was escaping the twist on my neck and wound it back into place. My heart spluttered hyperactively. \"I suppose you could say yes to the first\u2026 if you don't mind \u2014 it's easier than any other explanation.\" \"I don't mind,\" I said in a faint voice. \"And as for her other question\u2026 well, I'll be listening to hear the answer to that one myself.\" One side of his mouth pulled up into my favorite uneven smile. I couldn't catch my breath soon enough to respond to that remark. He turned and walked away. \"I'll see you at lunch,\" he called over his shoulder. Three people walking in the door stopped to stare at me. I hurried into class, flushed and irritated. He was such a cheater. Now I was even more worried about what I was going to say to Jessica. I sat in my usual seat, slamming my bag down in aggravation. \"Morning, Bella,\" Mike said from the seat next to me. I looked up to see an odd, almost resigned look on his face. \"How was Port Angeles?\" \"It was\u2026\" There was no honest way to sum it up. \"Great,\" I finished lamely. \"Jessica got a really cute dress.\" \"Did she say anything about Monday night?\" he asked, his eyes brightening. I smiled at the turn the conversation had taken. \"She said she had a really good time,\" I assured him. \"She did?\" he said eagerly. \"Most definitely.\" Mr. Mason called the class to order then, asking us to turn in our papers. English and then Government passed in a blur, while I worried about how to explain things to Jessica and <em>agonized</em> over whether Edward would really be listening to what I said through the medium of Jess's thoughts. How very inconvenient his little talent could be \u2014 when it wasn't saving my life. The fog had almost dissolved by the end of the second hour, but the day was still dark with low, oppressing clouds. I smiled up at the sky. Edward was right, of course. When I walked into Trig Jessica was sitting in the back row, nearly bouncing off her seat in agitation. I reluctantly went to sit by her, trying to convince myself it would be better to get it over with as soon as possible. \"Tell me everything!\" she commanded before I was in the seat. \"What do you want to know?\" I hedged. \"What happened last night?\" \"He bought me dinner, and then he drove me home.\" She glared at me, her expression stiff with skepticism. \"How did you get home so fast?\" \"He drives like a maniac. It was terrifying.\" I hoped he heard that. \"Was it like a date \u2014 did you tell him to meet you there?\" I hadn't thought of that. \"No \u2014 I was very surprised to see him there.\" Her lips puckered in disappointment at the transparent honesty in my voice. \"But he picked you up for school today?\" she probed. \"Yes \u2014 that was a surprise, too. He noticed I didn't have a jacket last night,\" I explained. \"So are you going out again?\" \"He offered to drive me to Seattle Saturday because he thinks toy truck isn't up to it \u2014 does that count?\" \"Yes.\" She nodded. \"Well, then, yes.\" \"W-o-w.\" She exaggerated the word into three syllables. \"Edward Cullen.\" \"I know,\" I agreed. \"Wow\" didn't even cover it. \"Wait!\" Her hands flew up, palms toward me like she was stopping traffic. \"Has he kissed you?\" \"No,\" I mumbled. \"It's not like that.\" She looked disappointed. I'm sure I did, too. \"Do you think Saturday\u2026 ?\" She raised her eyebrows. \"I really doubt it.\" The discontent in my voice was poorly disguised. \"What did you talk about?\" She pushed for more information in a whisper. Class had started but Mr. Varner wasn't paying close attention and we weren't the only ones still talking. \"I don't know, Jess, lots of stuff,\" I whispered back. \"We talked about the English essay a little.\" A very, very little. I think \u00a0he mentioned it in passing. \"Please, Bella,\" she begged. \"Give me some details.\" \"Well\u2026 okay, I've got one. You should have seen the waitress flirting with him \u2014 it was over the top. But he didn't pay any attention to her at all.\" Let him make what he could of that. \"That's a good sign,\" she nodded. \"Was she pretty?\" \"Very \u2014 and probably nineteen or twenty.\" \"Even better. He must like you.\" \"I think so, but it's hard to tell. He's always so cryptic,\" I threw in for his benefit, sighing. \"I don't know how you're brave enough to be alone with him,\" she breathed. \"Why?\" I was shocked, but she didn't understand my reaction. \"He's so\u2026 intimidating. I wouldn't know what to say to him.\" She made a face, probably remembering this morning or last night, when he'd turned the overwhelming force of his eyes on her. \"I do have some trouble with incoherency when I'm around him,\" I admitted. \"Oh well. He is unbelievably gorgeous.\" Jessica shrugged as if this excused any flaws. Which, in her book, it probably did. \"There's a lot more to him than that.\" \"Really? Like what?\" I wished I had let it go. Almost as much as I was hoping he'd been kidding about listening in. \"I can't explain it right\u2026 but he's even more unbelievable behind the face.\" The vampire who wanted to be good \u2014 who ran around saving people's lives so he wouldn't be a monster\u2026 I stared toward the front of the room. \"Is that possible?\" She giggled. I ignored her, trying to look like I was paying attention to Mr. Varner. \"So you like him, then?\" She wasn't about to give up. \"Yes,\" I said curtly. \"I mean, do you really like him?\" she urged. \"Yes,\" I said again, blushing. I hoped that detail wouldn't register in her thoughts. She'd had enough with the single syllable answers. \"How much do you like him?\" \"Too much,\" I whispered back. \"More than he likes me. But I don't see how I can help that.\" I sighed, one blush blending into the next. Then, thankfully, Mr. Varner called on Jessica for an answer. She didn't get a chance to start on the subject again during class, and as soon as the bell rang, I took evasive action. \"In English, Mike asked me if you said anything about Monday night,\" I told her. \"You're kidding! What did you say?!\" she gasped, completely sidetracked. \"I told him you said you had a lot of fun \u2014 he looked pleased.\" \"Tell me exactly what he said, and your exact answer!\" We spent the rest of the walk dissecting sentence structures and most of Spanish on a minute description of Mike's facial expressions. I wouldn't have helped draw it out for as long as I did if I wasn't worried about the subject returning to me. And then the bell rang for lunch. As I jumped up out of my seat, shoving my books roughly in my bag, my uplifted expression must have tipped Jessica off. \"You're not sitting with us today, are you?\" she guessed. \"I don't think so.\" I couldn't be sure that he wouldn't disappear inconveniently again. But outside the door to our Spanish class, leaning against the wall \u2014 looking more like a Greek god than anyone had a right to \u2014 Edward was waiting for me. Jessica took one look, rolled her eyes, and departed. \"See you later, Bella.\" Her voice was thick with implications. I might have to turn off the ringer on the phone. \"Hello.\" His voice was amused and irritated at the same time. He had been listening, it was obvious. \"Hi.\" I couldn't think of anything else to say, and he didn't speak \u2014 biding his time, I presumed \u2014 so it was a quiet walk to the cafeteria. Walking with Edward through the crowded lunchtime rush was a lot like my first day here; everyone stared. He led the way into the line, still not speaking, though his eyes returned to my face every few seconds, their expression speculative. It seemed to me that irritation was winning out over amusement as the dominant emotion in his face. I fidgeted nervously with the zipper on my jacket. He stepped up to the counter and filled a tray with food. \"What are you doing?\" I objected. \"You're not getting all that for me?\" He shook his head, stepping forward to buy the food. \"Half is for me, of course.\" I raised one eyebrow. He led the way to the same place we'd sat that one time before. From the other end of the long table, a group of seniors gazed at us in amazement as we sat across from each other. Edward seemed oblivious. \"Take whatever you want,\" he said, pushing the tray toward me. \"I'm curious,\" I said as I picked up an apple, turning it around in my hands, \"what would you do if someone dared you to eat food?\" \"You're always curious.\" He grimaced, shaking his head. He glared at me, holding my eyes as he lifted the slice of pizza off the tray, and deliberately bit off a mouthful, chewed quickly, and then swallowed. I watched, eyes wide. \"If someone dared you to eat dirt, you could, couldn't you?\" he asked condescendingly. I wrinkled my nose. \"I did once\u2026 on a dare,\" I admitted. \"It wasn't so bad.\" He laughed. \"I suppose I'm not surprised.\" Something over my shoulder seemed to catch his attention. \"Jessica's analyzing everything I do \u2014 she'll break it down for you later.\" He pushed the rest of the pizza toward me. The mention of Jessica brought a hint of his former irritation back to his features. I put down the apple and took a bite of the pizza, looking away, knowing he was about to start. \"So the waitress was pretty, was she?\" he asked casually. \"You really didn't notice?\" \"No. I wasn't paying attention. I had a lot on my mind.\" \"Poor girl.\" I could afford to be generous now. \"Something you said to Jessica\u2026 well, it bothers me.\" He refused to be distracted. His voice was husky, and he glanced up from under his lashes with troubled eyes. \"I'm not surprised you heard something you didn't like. You know what they say about eavesdropners,\" I reminded him. \"I warned you I would be listening.\" \"And I warned you that you didn't want to know everything I was thinking.\" \"You did,\" he agreed, but his voice was still rough. \"You aren't precisely right, though. I do want to know what you're thinking \u2014 everything. I just wish\u2026 that you wouldn't be thinking some things.\" I scowled. \"That's quite a distinction.\" \"But that's not really the point at the moment.\" \"Then what is?\" We were inclined toward each other across the table now. He had his large white hands folded under his chin; I leaned forward, my right hand cupped around my neck. I had to remind myself that we were in a crowded lunchroom, with probably many curious eyes on us. It was too easy to get wrapped up in our own private, tense little bubble. \"Do you truly believe that you care more for me than I do for you?\" he murmured, leaning closer to me as he spoke, his dark golden eyes piercing. I tried to remember how to exhale. I had to look away before it came back to me. \"You're doing it again,\" I muttered. His eyes opened wide with surprise. \"What?\" \"Dazzling me,\" I admitted, trying to concentrate as I looked back at him. \"Oh.\" He frowned. \"It's not your fault,\" I sighed. \"You can't help it.\" \"Are you going to answer the question?\" I looked down. \"Yes.\" \"Yes, you are going to answer, or yes, you really think that?\" He was irritated again. \"Yes, I really think that.\" I kept my eyes down on the table, my eyes tracing the pattern of the faux wood grains printed on the laminate. The silence dragged on. I stubbornly refused to be the first to break it this time, fighting hard against the temptation to peek at his expression. Finally he spoke, voice velvet soft. \"You're wrong.\" I glanced up to see that his eyes were gentle. \"You can't know that,\" I disagreed in a whisper. I shook my head in doubt, though my heart throbbed at his words and I wanted so badly to believe them. \"What makes you think so?\" His liquid topaz eyes were penetrating \u2014 trying futilely, I assumed, to lift the truth straight from my mind. I stared back, struggling to think clearly in spite of his face, to find some way to explain. As I searched for the words, I could see him getting impatient; frustrated by my silence, he started to scowl. I lifted my hand from my neck, and held up one finger. \"Let me think,\" I insisted. His expression cleared, now that he was satisfied that I was planning to answer. I dropped my hand to the table, moving my left hand so that my palms were pressed together. I stared at my hands, twisting and untwisting my fingers, as I finally spoke. \"Well, aside from the obvious, sometimes\u2026\" I hesitated. \"I can't be sure \u2014 I don't know how to read minds \u2014 but sometimes it seems like you're trying to say goodbye when you're saying something else.\" That was the best I could sum up the sensation of anguish that his words triggered in me at times. \"Perceptive,\" he whispered. And there was the anguish again, surfacing as he confirmed my fear. \"That's exactly why you're wrong, though,\" he began to explain, but then his eyes narrowed. \"What do you mean, 'the obvious'?\" \"Well, look at me,\" I said, unnecessarily as he was already staring. \"I'm absolutely ordinary \u2014 well, except for bad things like all the near-death experiences and being so clumsy that I'm almost disabled. And look at you.\" I waved my hand toward him and all his bewildering perfection. His brow creased angrily for a moment, then smoothed as his eyes took on a knowing look. \"You don't see yourself very clearly, you know. I'll admit you're dead-on about the bad things,\" he chuckled blackly, \"but you didn't hear what every human male in this school was thinking on your first day.\" I blinked, astonished. \"I don't believe it\u2026\" I mumbled to myself. \"Trust me just this once \u2014 you are the opposite of ordinary.\" My embarrassment was much stronger than my pleasure at the look that came into his eyes when he said this. I quickly reminded him of my original argument. \"But I'm not saying goodbye,\" I pointed out. \"Don't you see? That's what proves me right. I care the most, because if I can do it\" \u2014 he shook his head, seeming to struggle with the thought \u2014 \"if leaving is the right thing to do, then I'll hurt myself to keep from hurting you, to keep you safe.\" I glared. \"And you don't think I would do the same?\" \"You'd never have to make the choice.\" Abruptly, his unpredictable mood shifted again; a mischievous, devastating smile rearranged his features. \"Of course, keeping you safe is beginning to feel like a full-time occupation that requires my constant presence.\" \"No one has tried to do away with me today,\" I reminded him, grateful for the lighter subject. I didn't want him to talk about goodbyes anymore. If I had to, I supposed I could purposefully put myself in danger to keep him close\u2026 I banished that thought before his quick eyes read it on my face. That idea would definitely get me in trouble. \"Yet,\" he added. \"Yet,\" I agreed; I would have argued, but now I wanted him to be expecting disasters. \"I have another question for you.\" His face was still casual. \"Shoot.\" \"Do you really need to go to Seattle this Saturday, or was that just an excuse to get out of saying no to all your admirers?\" I made a face at the memory. \"You know, I haven't forgiven you for the Tyler thing yet,\" I warned him. \"It's your fault that he's deluded himself into thinking I'm going to prom with him.\" \"Oh, he would have found a chance to ask you without me \u2014 I just really wanted to watch your face,\" he chuckled, I would have been angrier if his laughter wasn't so fascinating. \"If I'd asked you, would you have turned me down?\" he asked, still laughing to himself. \"Probably not,\" I admitted. \"But I would have canceled later \u2014 faked an illness or a sprained ankle.\" He was puzzled. \"Why would you do that?\" I shook my head sadly. \"You've never seen me in Gym, I guess, but I would have thought you would understand.\" \"Are you referring to the fact that you can't walk across a flat, stable surface without finding something to trip over?\" \"Obviously.\" \"That wouldn't be a problem.\" He was very confident. \"It's all in the leading.\" He could see that I was about to protest, and he cut me off. \"But you never told me \u2014 are you resolved on going to Seattle, or do you mind if we do something different?\" As long as the \"we\" part was in, I didn't care about anything else. \"I'm open to alternatives,\" I allowed. \"But I do have a favor to ask.\" He looked wary, as he always did when I asked an open-ended question. \"What?\" \"Can I drive?\" He frowned. \"Why?\" \"Well, mostly because when I told Charlie I was going to Seattle, he specifically asked if I was going alone and, at the time, I was. If he asked again, I probably wouldn't lie, but I don't think he will ask again, and leaving my truck at home would just bring up the subject unnecessarily. And also, because your driving frightens me.\" He rolled his eyes. \"Of all the things about me that could frighten you, you worry about my driving.\" He shook his head in disgust, but then his eyes were serious again. \"Won't you want to tell your father that you're spending the day with me?\" There was an undercurrent to his question that I didn't understand. \"With Charlie, less is always more.\" I was definite about that. \"Where are we going, anyway?\" \"The weather will be nice, so I'll be staying out of the public eye\u2026 and you can stay with me, if you'd like to.\" Again, he was leaving the choice up to me. \"And you'll show me what you meant, about the sun?\" I asked, excited by the idea of unraveling another of the unknowns. \"Yes.\" He smiled, and then paused. \"But if you don't want to be\u2026 alone with me, I'd still rather you didn't go to Seattle by yourself. I shudder to think of the trouble you could find in a city that size.\" I was miffed. \"Phoenix is three times bigger than Seattle \u2014 just in population. In physical size \u2014\" \"But apparently,\" he interrupted me, \"your number wasn't up in Phoenix. So I'd rather you stayed near me.\" His eyes did that unfair smoldering thing again. I couldn't argue, with the eyes or the motivation, and it was a moot point anyway. \"As it happens, I don't mind being alone with you.\" \"I know,\" he sighed, brooding. \"You should tell Charlie, though.\" \"Why in the world would I do that?\" His eyes were suddenly fierce. \"To give me some small incentive to bring you back.\" I gulped. But, after a moment of thought, I was sure. \"I think I'll take my chances.\" He exhaled angrily, and looked away. \"Let's talk about something else,\" I suggested. \"What do you want to talk about?\" he asked. He was still annoyed. I glanced around us, making sure we were well out of anyone's hearing. As I cast my eyes around the room, I caught the eyes of his sister, Alice, staring at me. The others were looking at Edward. I looked away swiftly, back to him, and I asked the first thing that came to mind. \"Why did you go to that Goat Rocks place last weekend\u2026 to hunt? Charlie said it wasn't a good place to hike, because of bears.\" He stared at me as if I was missing something very obvious. \"Bears?\" I gasped, and he smirked. \"You know, bears are not in season,\" I added sternly, to hide my shock. \"If you read carefully, the laws only cover hunting with weapons,\" he informed me. He watched my face with enjoyment as that slowly sank in. \"Bears?\" I repeated with difficulty. \"Grizzly is Emmett's favorite.\" His voice was still offhand, but his eyes were scrutinizing my reaction. I tried to pull myself together. \"Hmmm,\" I said, taking another bite of pizza as an excuse to look down. I chewed slowly, and then took a long drink of Coke without looking up. \"So,\" I said after a moment, finally meeting his now-anxious gaze. \"What's your favorite?\" He raised an eyebrow and the corners of his mouth turned down in disapproval. \"Mountain lion.\" \"Ah,\" I said in a politely disinterested tone, looking for my soda again. \"Of course,\" he said, and his tone mirrored mine, \"we have to be careful not to impact the environment with injudicious hunting. We try to focus on areas with an overpopulation of predators \u2014 ranging as far away as we need. There's always plenty of deer and elk here, and they'll do, but where's the fun in that?\" He smiled teasingly. \"Where indeed,\" I murmured around another bite of pizza. \"Early spring is Emmett's favorite bear season \u2014 they're just coming out of hibernation, so they're more irritable.\" He smiled at some remembered joke. \"Nothing more fun than an irritated grizzly bear,\" I agreed, nodding. He snickered, shaking his head. \"Tell me what you're really thinking, please.\" \"I'm trying to picture it \u2014 but I can't,\" I admitted. \"How do you hunt a bear without weapons?\" \"Oh, we have weapons.\" He flashed his bright teeth in a brief, threatening smile. I fought back a shiver before it could expose me. \"Just not the kind they consider when writing hunting laws. If you've ever seen a bear attack on television, you should be able to visualize Emmett hunting.\" I couldn't stop the next shiver that flashed down my spine. I peeked across the cafeteria toward Emmett, grateful that he wasn't looking my way. The thick bands of muscle that wrapped his arms and torso were somehow even more menacing now. Edward followed my gaze and chuckled. I stared at him, unnerved. \"Are you like a bear, too?\" I asked in a low voice. \"More like the lion, or so they tell me,\" he said lightly. \"Perhaps our preferences are indicative.\" I tried to smile. \"Perhaps,\" I repeated. But my mind was filled with opposing images that I couldn't merge together. \"Is that something I might get to see?\" \"Absolutely not!\" His face turned even whiter than usual, and his eyes were suddenly furious. I leaned back, stunned and \u2014 though I'd never admit it to him \u2014 frightened by his reaction. He leaned back as well, folding his arms across his chest. \"Too scary for me?\" I asked when I could control my voice again. \"If that were it, I would take you out tonight,\" he said, his voice cutting. \"You need a healthy dose of fear. Nothing could be more beneficial for you.\" \"Then why?\" I pressed, trying to ignore his angry expression. He glared at me for a long minute. \"Later,\" he finally said. He was on his feet in one lithe movement. \"We're going to be late.\" I glanced around, startled to see that he was right and the cafeteria was nearly vacant. When I was with him, the time and the place were such a muddled blur that I completely lost track of both. I jumped up, grabbing my bag from the back of my chair. \"Later, then,\" I agreed. I wouldn't forget.",

            "en": "7 REPETITION         3. The truth I had the sense that i'd been asleep for a very long time\u2014my body was stiff, like i hadn't moved once through all that time, either. My mind was dazed and slow; strange, colorful dreams\u2014dreams and nightmares\u2014swirled dizzily around the inside of my head. They were so vivid. The horrible and the heavenly, all mixed together into a bizarre jumble. There was sharp impatience and fear, both part of that frustrating dream where your feet can't move fast enough\u2026 and there were plenty of monsters, red-eyed fiends that were all the more ghastly for their genteel civility. The dream was still strong\u2014i could even remember the names. But the strongest, clearest part of the dream was not the horror. It was the angel that was most clear. It was hard to let him go and wake up. This dream did not want to be shoved away into the vault of dreams I refused to revisit. I struggled with it as my mind became more alert, focusing on reality. I couldn't remember what day of the week it was, but I was sure Jacob or school or work or something was waiting for me. I inhaled deeply, wondering how to face another day. Something cold touched my forehead with the softest pressure. I squeezed my eyes more tightly shut. I was still dreaming, it seemed, and it felt \u00a0abnormally real. I was so close to waking\u2026 any second now, and it would be gone. But I realized that it felt too real, too real to be good for me. The stone arms I imagined wrapped around me were far too substantial. If I let this go any further, I'd be sorry for it later. With a resigned sigh, I wrenched back my eyelids to dispel the illusion. \"Oh!\" I gasped, and threw my fists over my eyes. Well, clearly, I'd gone too far; it must have been a mistake to let my imagination get so out of hand. Okay, so \"let\" was the wrong word. I'd forced it to get out of hand\u2014pretty much stalked my hallucinations\u2014and now my mind had snapped. It took less than half a second for me to realize that, as long as I was truly insane now, I might as well enjoy the delusions while they were pleasant. I opened my eyes again\u2014and Edward was still there, his perfect face just inches away from mine. \"Did I frighten you?\" His low voice was anxious. This was very good, as delusions went. The face, the voice, the scent, everything\u2014it was so much better than drowning. The beautiful figment of my imagination watched my changing expressions, with alarm. His irises were pitch-black, with bruise-like shadows under them. This surprised me; my hallucinatory Edwards were usually better fed. I blinked twice, desperately trying to remember the last thing that I was sure was real. Alice was part of my dream, and I wondered if she had really come back at all, or if that was just the preamble. I thought she'd returned the day I'd nearly drowned\u2026 \"Oh, crap\" I croaked. My throat was thick with sleeping. \"What's wrong, Bella?\" I frowned at him unhappily. His face was even more anxious than before. \"I'm dead, right?\" I moaned. \"I did drown. Crap, crap, crap! This is gonna kill Charlie.\" Edward frowned, too. \"You're not dead.\" \"Then why am I not waking up?\" I challenged, raising my eyebrows. \"You are awake, Bella.\" I shook my head. \"Sure, sure. That's what you want me to think. And then it will be worse when I do wake up. If I wake up, which I won't, because I'm dead. This is awful. Poor Charlie. And Renee and Jake\u2026\" I trailed off in horror at what I had done. \"I can see where you might confuse me with a nightmare.\" His short-lived smile was grim. \"But I can't imagine what you could have done to wind up in hell. Did you commit many murders while I was away?\" I grimaced. \"Obviously not. If I was in hell, you wouldn't be with me.\" He sighed. My head was getting clearer. My eyes flickered away from his face\u2014unwillingly\u2014for one second, to the dark, open window, and then back to him. I started to remember details\u2026 and I felt a faint, unfamiliar blush warm the skin over my cheekbones as I slowly realized that Edward was really, truly here with me, and I was wasting time being an idiot. \"Did all of that really happen, then?\" It was almost impossible to reassign my dream as reality. I couldn't wrap my head around the concept. \"That depends.\" Edward's smile was still hard. \"If you're referring to us nearly being massacred in Italy, then, yes.\" \"How strange,\" I mused. \"I really went to Italy. Did you know I'd never been farther east than Albuquerque?\" He rolled his eyes. \"Maybe you should go back to sleep. You're not coherent.\" \"I'm not tired anymore.\" It was all coming clear now. \"What time is it? How long have I been sleeping?\" \"It's just after one in the morning. So, about fourteen hours.\" I stretched as he spoke. I was so stiff. \"Charlie?\" I asked. Edward frowned. \"Sleeping. You should probably know that I'm breaking the rules right now. Well, not technically, since he said I was never to walk through his door again, and I came in the window\u2026 But, still, the intent was clear.\" \"Charlie banned you from the house?\" I asked, disbelief quickly melting into fury. His eyes were sad. \"Did you expect anything else?\" My eyes were mad. I was going to have a few words with my father\u2014perhaps it would be a good time to remind him that I was over the legal age of adulthood. It didn't matter so much, of course, except in principle. All too soon there would be no reason for the prohibition. I turned my thoughts to less painful avenues. \"What's the story?\" I asked, genuinely curious, but also trying desperately to keep the conversation casual, to keep a firm grip on myself, so I wouldn't scare him away with the frantic, gnawing craving that was raging inside me. \"What do you mean?\" \"What am I telling Charlie? What's my excuse for disappearing for\u2026 how long was I gone, anyway?\" I tried to count the hours in my head. \"Just three days.\" His eyes tightened, but he smiled more naturally this time. \"Actually, I was hoping you might have a good explanation. I've got nothing.\" I groaned. \"Fabulous.\" \"Well, maybe Alice will come up with something,\" he offered, trying to comfort me. And I was comforted. Who cared what I had to deal with later? Every second that he was here\u2014so close, his flawless face glowing in the dim light from the numbers on my alarm clock\u2014was precious and not to be wasted. \"So,\" I began, picking the least important\u2014though still vitally interesting\u2014question to start with. I was safely delivered home, and he might decide to leave at any moment. I had to keep him talking. Besides, this temporary heaven wasn't entirely complete without the sound of his voice. \"What have you been doing, up until three days ago?\" His face turned wary in an instant. \"Nothing terribly exciting.\" \"Of course not,\" I mumbled. \"Why are you making that face?\" \"Well\u2026\" I pursed my lips, considering. \"If you were, after all, just a dream, that's exactly the kind of thing you would say. My imagination must be used up.\" He sighed. \"If I tell you, will you finally believe that you're not having a nightmare?\" \"Nightmare!\" I repeated scornfully. He waited for my answer. \"Maybe,\" I said after a second of thought. \"If you tell me.\" \"I was\u2026 hunting.\" \"Is that the best you can do?\" I criticized. \"That definitely doesn't prove I'm awake.\" He hesitated, and then spoke slowly, choosing his words with care. \"I wasn't hunting for food\u2026 I was actually trying my hand at\u2026 tracking. I'm not very good at it.\" \"What were you tracking?\" I asked, intrigued. \"Nothing of consequence.\" His words didn't match his expression; he looked upset, uncomfortable. \"I don't understand.\" He hesitated; his face, shining with an odd green cast from the light of the clock, was torn. \"I\u2014\" He took a deep breath. \"I owe you an apology. No, of course I owe you much, \u00a0much more than that. But you have to know,\"\u2014the words began to flow so fast, the way I remembered he spoke sometimes when he was agitated, that I really had to concentrate to catch them all\u2014\"that I had no idea. I didn't realize the mess I was leaving behind. I thought it was safe for you here. So safe. I had no idea that Victoria,\"\u2014his lips curled back when he said the name\u2014\"would come back. I'll admit, when I saw her that one time, I was paying much more attention to James's thoughts. But I just didn't see that she had this kind of response in her. That she even had such a tie to him. I think I realize why now\u2014she was so sure of him, the thought of him failing never occurred to her. It was her overconfidence that clouded her feelings about him\u2014that kept me from seeing the depth of them, the bond there. \"Not that there's any excuse for what I left you to face. When I heard what you told Alice\u2014what she saw herself\u2014when I realized that you had to put your life in the hands of werewolves, immature, volatile, the worst thing out there besides Victoria herself\u2014he shuddered and the gush of words halted for a short second. \"Please know that I had no idea of any of this. I feel sick, sick to my core, even now, when I can see and feel you safe in my arms. I am the most miserable excuse for\u2014\" \"Stop,\" I interrupted him. He stared at me with <em>agonized</em> eyes, and I tried to find the right words\u2014the words that would free him from this imagined obligation that caused him so much pain. They were very hard words to say. I didn't know if I could get them out without breaking down. But I had to try to do it right. I didn't want to be a source of guilt and anguish in his life. He should be happy, no matter what it cost me. I'd really been hoping to put off this part of our last conversation. It was going to bring things to an end so much sooner. Drawing on all my months of practice with trying to be normal for Charlie, I kept my face smooth.  \"Edward,\" I said. His name burned my throat a little on the way out. I could feel the ghost of the hole, waiting to rip itself wide again as soon as he disappeared. I didn't quite see how I was going to survive it this time. \"This has to stop now. You can't think about things that way. You can't let this\u2026 this guilt\u2026 rule your life. You can't take responsibility for the things that happen to me here. None of it is your fault, it's just part of how life is for me. So, if I trip in front of a bus or whatever it is next time, you have to realize that it's not your job to take the blame. You can't just go running off to Italy \u00a0because you feel bad that you didn't save me. Even if I had jumped off that cliff to die, that would have been my choice, and not your fault. I know it's your\u2026 your nature to shoulder the blame for everything, but you really can't let that make you go to such extremes! It's very irresponsible\u2014think of Esme and Carlisle and\u2014\" I was on the edge of losing it. I stopped to take a deep breath, hoping to calm myself. I had to set him free. I had to make sure this never happened again. \"Isabella Marie Swan,\" he whispered, the strangest expression crossing his face. He almost looked mad. \"Do you believe that I asked the Volturi to kill me because I felt guilty?\" I could feel the blank incomprehension on my face. \"Didn't you?\" \"Feel guilty? Intensely so. More than you can comprehend.\" \"Then\u2026 what are you saying? I don't understand.\" \"Bella, I went to the Volturi because I thought you were dead,\" he said, voice soft, eyes fierce. \"Even if I'd had no hand in your death\"\u2014he shuddered as he whispered the last word\u2014\"even if it wasn't my fault, I would have gone to Italy. Obviously, I should have been more careful\u2014I should have spoken to Alice directly, rather than accepting it secondhand from Rosalie. But, really, what was I supposed to think when the boy said Charlie was at the funeral? What are the odds? \"The odds\u2026\" he muttered then, distracted. His voice was so low I wasn't sure I heard it right. \"The odds are always stacked against us. Mistake after mistake. I'll never criticize Romeo again.\" \"But I still don't understand,\" I said. \"That's my whole point. So what?\" \"Excuse me?\" \"So what if I was dead?\" He stared at me dubiously for a long moment before answering. \"Don't you remember anything I told you before?\" \"I remember everything that you told me.\" Including the words that had negated all the rest. He brushed the tip of his cool finger against my lower lip. \"Bella, you seem to be under a misapprehension.\" He closed his eyes, shaking his head back and forth with half a smile on his beautiful face. It wasn't a happy smile. \"I thought I'd explained it clearly before. Bella, I can't live in a world where you don't exist.\" \"I am\u2026\" My head swam as I looked for the appropriate word. \"Confused.\" That worked. I couldn't make sense of what he was saying. He stared deep into my eyes with his sincere, earnest gaze. \"I'm a good liar, Bella, I have to be.\" I froze, my muscles locking down as if for impact. The fault line in my chest rippled; the pain of it took my breath away. He shook my shoulder, trying to loosen my rigid pose. \"Let me finish! I'm a good liar, but still, for you to believe me so quickly.\" He winced. \"That was\u2026 excruciating.\" I waited, still frozen. \"When we were in the forest, when I was telling you goodbye\u2014\" I didn't allow myself to remember. I fought to keep myself in the present second only. \"You weren't going to let go,\" he whispered. \"I could see that. I didn't want to do it\u2014it felt like it would kill me to do it\u2014but I knew that if I couldn't convince you that I didn't love you anymore, it would just take you that much longer to get on with your life. I hoped that, if you thought I'd moved on, so would you.\" \"A clean break,\" I whispered through unmoving lips. \"Exactly. But I never imagined it would be so easy to do! I thought it would be next to impossible\u2014that you would be so sure of the truth that I would have to lie through my teeth for hours to even plant the seed of doubt in your head. I lied, and I'm so sorry\u2014sorry because I hurt you, sorry because it was a worthless effort. Sorry that I couldn't protect you from what I an. I lied to save you, and it didn't work. I'm sorry. \"But how could you believe me? After all the thousand times I've told you I love you, how could you let one word break your faith in me?\" I didn't answer. I was too shocked to form a rational response. \"I could see it in your eyes, that you honestly believed that I didn't want you anymore. The most absurd, ridiculous concept\u2014as if there were any way that I could exist without needing you!\" I was still frozen. His words were incomprehensible, because they were impossible. He shook my shoulder again, not hard, but enough that my teeth rattled a little. \"Bella,\" he sighed. \"Really, what were you thinking!\" And so I started to cry. The tears welled up and then gushed miserably down my cheeks. \"I knew it,\" I sobbed. \"I knew I was dreaming.\" \"You're impossible,\" he said, and he laughed once\u2014a hard laugh, frustrated. \"How can I put this so that you'll believe me? You're not asleep, and you're not dead. I'm here, and I love you. I have always loved you, and I will always love you. I was thinking of you, seeing your face in my mind, every second that I was away. When I told you that I didn't want you, it was the very blackest kind of blasphemy.\" I shook my head while the tears continued to ooze from the corners of my eyes. \"You don't believe me, do you?\" he whispered, his face paler than his usual pale\u2014I could see that even in the dim light. \"Why can you believe the lie, but not the truth?\" \"It never made sense for you to love me,\" I explained, my voice breaking twice. \"I always knew that.\" His eyes narrowed, his jaw tightened. \"I'll prove you're awake,\" he promised. He caught my face securely between his iron hands, ignoring my struggles when I tried to turn my head away. \"Please don't,\" I whispered. He stopped, his lips just half an inch from mine. \"Why not?\" he demanded. His breath blew into my face, making my head whirl. \"When I wake up\"\u2014He opened his mouth to protest, so I revised\u2014\"okay, forget that one\u2014when you leave again, it's going to be hard enough without this, too.\" He pulled back an inch, to stare at my face. \"Yesterday, when I would touch you, you were so\u2026 hesitant, so careful, and yet still the same. I need to know why. Is it because I'm too late? Because I've hurt you too much? Because you have moved on, as I meant for you to? That would be\u2026 quite fair. I won't contest your decision. So don't try to spare my feelings, please\u2014just tell me now whether or not you can still love me, after everything I've done to you.\u00a0 Can you?\" he whispered. \"What kind of an idiotic question is that?\" \"Just answer it. Please.\" I stared at him darkly for a long moment. \"The way I feel about you will never change. Of course I love you\u2014and there's nothing you can do about it!\" \"That's all I needed to hear.\" His mouth was on mine then, and I couldn't fight him. Not because he was so many thousand times stronger than me, but because my will crumbled into dust the second our lips met. This kiss was not quite as careful as others I remembered, which suited me just fine. If I was going to rip myself up further, I might as well get as much in trade as possible. So I kissed him back, my heart pounding out a jagged, disjointed rhythm while my breathing turned to panting and my fingers moved greedily to his face. I could feel his marble body against every line of mine, and I was so glad he hadn't listened to me\u2014there was no pain in the world that would have justified missing this. His hands memorized my face, the same way mine were tracing his, and, in the brief seconds when his lips were free, he whispered my name. When I was starting to get dizzy, he pulled away, only to lay his ear against my heart. I lay there, dazed, waiting for my gasping to slow and quiet. \"By the way,\" he said in a casual tone. \"I'm not leaving you.\" I didn't say anything, and he seemed to hear skepticism in my silence. He lifted his face to lock my gaze in his. \"I'm not going anywhere. Not without you,\" he added more seriously. \"I only left you in the first place because I wanted you to have a chance at a normal, happy, human life. I could see what I was doing to you\u2014keeping you constantly on the edge of danger, taking you away from the world you belonged in, risking your life every moment I was with you. So I had to try. I had to do something, and it seemed like leaving was the only way. If I hadn't thought you would be better off, I could have never made myself leave. I'm much too selfish. Only you could be more important than what I wanted\u2026 what I needed. What I want and need is to be with you, and I know I'll never be strong enough to leave again. I have too many excuses to stay\u2014thank heaven for that! It seems you can't be safe, no matter how many miles I put between us.\" \"Don't promise me anything,\" I whispered. If I let myself hope, and it came to nothing\u2026 that would kill me. Where all those merciless vampires had not been able to finish me off, hope would do the job. Anger glinted metallic in his black eyes. \"You think I'm lying to you now?\" \"No\u2014not lying.\" I shook my head, trying to think it through coherently. To examine the hypothesis that he did love me, while staying objective, clinical, so I wouldn't fall into the trap of hoping. \"You could mean it\u2026 now. But what about tomorrow, when you think about all the reasons you left in the first place? Or next month, when Jasper takes a snap at me?\" He flinched. I thought back over those last days of my life before he left me, tried to see them through the filter of what he was telling me now. From that perspective, imagining that he'd left me while loving me, left me for me, his brooding and cold silences took on a different meaning. \"It isn't as if you hadn't thought the first decision through, is it?\" I guessed. \"You'll end up doing what you think is right.\" \"I'm not as strong as you give me credit for,\" he said. \"Right and wrong have ceased to mean much to me; I was coming back anyway. Before Rosalie told me the news, I was already past trying to live through one week at a time, or even one day. I was fighting to make it through a single hour. It was only a matter of time before I showed up at your window and begged you to take me back. I'd be happy to beg now, if you'd like that.\" I grimaced. \"Be serious, please.\" \"Oh, I am,\" he insisted, glaring now. \"Will you please try to hear what I'm telling you? Will you let me attempt to explain what you mean to me?\" He waited, studying my face as he spoke to make sure I was really listening. \"Before you, Bella, my life was like a moonless night. Very dark, but there were stars\u2014points of light and reason\u2026 And then you shot across my sky like a meteor. Suddenly everything was on fire; there was brilliancy, there was beauty. When you were gone, when the meteor had fallen over the horizon, everything went black. Nothing had changed, but my eyes were blinded by the light. I couldn't see the stars anymore. And there was no more reason for anything.\" I wanted to believe him. But this was my life without him that he was describing, not the other way around. \"Your eyes will adjust,\" I mumbled. \"That's just the problem\u2014they can't.\" \"What about your distractions?\" He laughed without a trace of humor. \"Just part of the lie, love. There was no distraction from the\u2026 the agony. My heart hasn't beat in almost ninety years, but this was different. It was like my heart was gone\u2014like I was hollow. Like I'd left everything that was inside me here with you.\" \"That's funny,\" I muttered. He arched one perfect eyebrow. \"Funny? \" \"I meant strange\u2014I thought it was just me. Lots of pieces of me went missing, too. I haven't been able to really breathe in so long.\" I filled my lungs, luxuriating in the sensation. \"And my heart. That was definitely lost.\" He closed his eyes and laid his ear over my heart again. I let my cheek press against his hair, felt the texture of it on my skin, smelled the delicious scent of him. \"Tracking wasn't a distraction then?\" I asked, curious, and also needing to distract myself. I was very much in danger of hoping. I wouldn't be able to stop myself for long. My heart throbbed, singing in my chest. \"No.\" He sighed. \"That was never a distraction. It was an obligation.\" \"What does that mean?\" \"It means that, even though I never expected any danger from Victoria, I wasn't going to let her get away with\u2026 Well, like I said, I was horrible at it. I traced her as far as Texas, but then I followed a false lead down to Brazil\u2014and really she came here.\" He groaned. \"I wasn't even on the right continent! And all the while, worse than my worst fears\u2014\" \"You were hunting Victoria?\" I half-shrieked as soon as I could find my voice, shooting through two octaves. Charlie's distant snores stuttered, and then picked up a regular rhythm again. \"Not well,\" Edward answered, studying my outraged expression with a confused look. \"But I'll do better this time. She won't be tainting perfectly good air by breathing in and out for much longer.\" \"That is\u2026 out of the question,\" I managed to choke out. Insanity. Even if he had Emmett or Jasper help him. Even if he had Emmett and Jasper help. It was worse than my other imaginings: Jacob Black standing across a small space from Victoria's vicious and feline figure. I couldn't bear to picture Edward there, even though he was so much more durable than my half-human best friend.  \"It's too late for her. I might have let the other time slide, but not now, not after\u2014\" I interrupted him again, trying to sound calm. \"Didn't you just promise that you weren't going to leave?\" I asked, fighting the words as I said them, nor letting them plant themselves in my heart. \"That isn't exactly compatible with an extended tracking expedition, is it?\" He frowned. A snarl began to build low in his chest. \"I will keep my promise, Bella. But Victoria\"\u2014the snarl became more pronounced\u2014\"is going to die. Soon.\" \"Let's not be hasty,\" I said, trying to hide my panic. \"Maybe she's not coming back. Jake's pack probably scared her off. There's really no reason to go looking for her. Besides, I've got bigger problems than Victoria.\" Edward's eyes narrowed, but he nodded. \"It's true. The werewolves are a problem.\" I snorted. \"I wasn't talking about Jacob. My problems are a lot worse that a handful of adolescent wolves getting themselves into trouble.\" Edward looked as if he were about to say something, and then thought better of it. His teeth clicked together, and he spoke through them. \"Really?\" he asked. \"Then what would be your greatest problem? That would make Victoria's returning for you seem like such an inconsequential matter in comparison?\" \"How about the second greatest?\" I hedged. \"All right,\" he agreed, suspicious. I paused. I wasn't sure I could say the name. \"There are others who are coming to look for me,\" I reminded him in a subdued whisper. He sighed, but the reaction was not as strong as I would have imagined after his response to Victoria. \"The Volturi are only the second greatest?\" \"You don't seem that upset about it,\" I noted. \"Well, we have plenty of time to think it through. Time means something very different to them than it does to you, or even me. They count years the way you count days. I wouldn't be surprised if you were thirty before you crossed their minds again,\" he added lightly. Horror washed through me. Thirty. So his promises meant nothing, in the end. If I were going to turn thirty someday, then he couldn't be planning on staying long. The harsh pain of this knowledge made me realize that I'd already begun to hope, without giving myself permission to do so. \"You don't have to be afraid,\" he said, anxious as he watched the tears dew up again on the rims of my eyes. \"I won't let them hurt you.\" \"While you're here.\" Not that I cared what happened to me when he left. He took my face between his two stone hands, holding it tightly while his midnight eyes glared into mine with the gravitational force of a black hole. \"I will never leave you again.\" \"But you said thirty,\" I whispered. The tears leaked over the edge. \"What? You're going to stay, but let me get all old anyway? Right.\" His eyes softened, while his mouth went hard. \"That's exactly what I'm going to do. What choice have I?\u00a0 I cannot be without you, but I will not destroy your soul.\" \"Is this really\u2026\" I tried to keep my voice even, but this question was too hard. I remembered his face when Aro had almost begged him to consider making me immortal. The sick look there. Was this fixation with keeping me human really about my soul, or was it because he wasn't sure that he wanted me around that long? \"Yes?\" he asked, waiting for my question. I asked a different one. Almost\u2014but not quite\u2014as hard. \"But what about when I get so old that people think I'm your mother? Your \u00a0grandmother?\" My voice was pale with revulsion\u2014I could see Gran's face again in the dream mirror. His whole face was soft now. He brushed the tears from my cheek with his lips. \"That doesn't mean anything to me,\" he breathed against my skin. \"You will always be the most beautiful thing in my world.\u00a0 Of course\u2026\" He hesitated, flinching slightly. \"If you outgrew me\u2014if you wanted something more\u2014I would understand that, Bella. I promise I wouldn't stand in your way if you wanted to leave me.\" His eyes were liquid onyx and utterly sincere. He spoke as if he'd put endless amounts of thought into this asinine plan. \"You do realize that I'll die eventually, right?\" I demanded. He'd thought about this part, too. \"I'll follow after as soon as I can.\" \"That is seriously\u2026\"I looked for the right word. \"Sick.\" \"Bella, it's the only right way left\u2014\" \"Let's just back up for a minute,\" I said; feeling angry made it so much easier to be clear, decisive. \"You do remember the Volturi, right? I can't stay human forever. They'll kill me. Even if they don't think of me till I'm thirty\"\u2014I hissed the word\u2014\"do you really think they'll forget?\" \"No,\" he answered slowly, shaking his head. \"They won't forget. But\u2026\" \"But?\" He grinned while I stared at him warily. Maybe I wasn't the only crazy one. \"I have a few plans.\" \"And these plans,\" I said, my voice getting more acidic with each word. \"These plans all center around me staying human.\" My attitude hardened his expression. \"Naturally.\" His tone was brusque, his divine face arrogant. We glowered at each other for a long minute. Then I took a deep breath, squared my shoulders, I pushed his arms away so that I could sit up. \"Do you want me to leave?\" he asked, and it made my heart flutter to see that this idea hurt him, though he tried not to show it. \"No,\" I told him. \"I'm leaving.\" He watched me suspiciously as I climbed out of the bed and fumbled around in the dark room, looking for my shoes. \"May I ask where you are going.'\" he asked. \"I'm going to your house,\" I told him, still feeling around blindly. He got up and came to my side. \"Here are your shoes. How did you plan to get there?\" \"My truck.\" \"That will probably wake Charlie,\" he offered as a deterrent. I sighed. \"I know. But honestly, I'll be grounded for weeks as it is. How much more trouble can I really get in?\" \"None. He'll blame me, not you.\" \"If you have a better idea, I'm all ears.\" \"Stay here,\" he suggested, but his expression wasn't hopeful. \"No dice. But you go ahead and make yourself at home,\" I encouraged, surprised at how natural my teasing sounded, and headed for the door. He was there before me, blocking my way. I frowned, and turned for the window. It wasn't really that far to the ground, and it was mostly grass beneath\u2026 \"Okay,\" he sighed. \"I'll give you a ride.\" I shrugged. \"Either way. But you probably should be there, too.\" \"And why is that?\" \"Because you're extraordinarily opinionated, and I'm sure you'll want a chance to air your views.\" \"My views on which subject?\" He asked through his teeth. \"This isn't just about you anymore. You're not the center of the universe, you know.\" My own personal universe was, of course, a different story. \"If you're going to bring the Volturi down on us over something as stupid as leaving me human, then your family ought to have a say.\" \"A say in what?\" he asked, each word distinct. \"My mortality. I'm putting it to a vote.\"",

            "en": "7          7. NIGHTMARE I told Charlie I had a lot of homework to do, and that I didn't want anything to eat. There was a basketball game on that he was excited about, though of course I had no idea what was special about it, so he wasn't aware of anything unusual in my face or tone. Once in my room, I locked the door. I dug through my desk until I found my old headphones, and I plugged them into my little CD player. I picked up a CD that Phil had given to me for Christmas. It was one of his favorite bands, but they used a little too much bass and shrieking for my tastes. I popped it into place and lay down on my bed. I put on the headphones, hit Play, and turned up the volume until it hurt my ears. I closed my eyes, but the light still intruded, so I added a pillow over the top half of my face. I concentrated very carefully on the music, trying to understand the lyrics, to unravel the complicated drum patterns. By the third time I'd listened through the CD, I knew all the words to the choruses, at least.  I was surprised to find that I really did like the band after all, once I got past the blaring noise. I'd have to thank Phil again.  And it worked. The shattering beats made it impossible for me to think \u2014 which was the whole purpose of the exercise. I listened to the CD again and again, until I was singing along with all the songs, until, finally, I fell asleep. I opened my eyes to a familiar place. Aware in some corner of my consciousness that I was dreaming, I recognized the green light of the forest. I could hear the waves crashing against the rocks somewhere nearby. And I knew that if I found the ocean, I'd be able to see the sun.  I was trying to follow the sound, but then Jacob Black was there, tugging on my hand, pulling me back toward the blackest part of the forest. \"Jacob? What's wrong?\" I asked. His face was frightened as he yanked with all his strength against my resistance; I didn't want to go into the dark. \"Run, Bella, you have to run!\" he whispered, terrified. \"This way, Bella!\" I recognized Mike's voice calling out of the gloomy heart of the trees, but I couldn't see him. \"Why?\" I asked, still pulling against Jacob's grasp, desperate now to find the sun. But Jacob let go of my hand and yelped, suddenly shaking, falling to the dim forest floor. He twitched on the ground as I watched in horror.  \"Jacob!\" I screamed. But he was gone. In his place was a large red-brown wolf with black eyes. The wolf faced away from me, pointing toward the shore, the hair on the back of his shoulders bristling, low growls issuing from between his exposed fangs. \"Bella, run!\" Mike cried out again from behind me. But I didn't turn. I was watching a light coming toward me from the beach. And then Edward stepped out from the trees, his skin faintly glowing, his eyes black and dangerous. He held up one hand and beckoned me to come to him. The wolf growled at my feet. I took a step forward, toward Edward. He smiled then, and his teeth were sharp, pointed. \"Trust me,\" he purred. I took another step. The wolf launched himself across the space between me and the vampire, fangs aiming for the jugular. \"No!\" I screamed, wrenching upright out of my bed. My sudden movement caused the headphones to pull the CD player off the bedside table, and it clattered to the wooden floor. My light was still on, and I was sitting fully dressed on the bed, with my shoes on. I glanced, disoriented, at the clock on my dresser. It was five-thirty in the morning. I groaned, fell back, and rolled over onto my face, kicking off my boots. I was too uncomfortable to get anywhere near sleep, though. I rolled back over and unbuttoned my jeans, yanking them off awkwardly as I tried to stay horizontal. I could feel the braid in my hair, an uncomfortable ridge along the back of my skull. I turned onto my side and ripped the rubber band out, quickly combing through the plaits with my fingers. I pulled the pillow back over my eyes.  It was all no use, of course. My subconscious had dredged up exactly the images I'd been trying so desperately to avoid. I was going to have to face them now. I sat up, and my head spun for a minute as the blood flowed downward. First things first, I thought to myself, happy to put it off as long as possible. I grabbed my bathroom bag. The shower didn't last nearly as long as I hoped it would, though. Even taking the time to blow-dry my hair, I was soon out of things to do in the bathroom. Wrapped in a towel, I crossed back to my room. I couldn't tell if Charlie was still asleep, or if he had already left. I went to look out my window, and the cruiser was gone. Fishing again. I dressed slowly in my most comfy sweats and then made my bed \u2014 something I never did. I couldn't put it off any longer. I went to my desk and switched on my old computer. I hated using the Internet here. My modem was sadly outdated, my free service substandard; just dialing up took so long that I decided to go get myself a bowl of cereal while I waited. I ate slowly, chewing each bite with care. When I was done, I washed the bowl and spoon, dried them, and put them away. My feet dragged as I climbed the stairs. I went to my CD player first, picking it up off the floor and placing it precisely in the center of the table. I pulled out the headphones, and put them away in the desk drawer. Then I turned the same CD on, turning it down to the point where it was background noise.  With another sigh, I turned to my computer. Naturally, the screen was covered in pop-up ads. I sat in my hard folding chair and began closing all the little windows. Eventually I made it to my favorite search engine. I shot down a few more pop-ups and then typed in one word. Vampire. It took an infuriatingly long time, of course. When the results came up, there was a lot to sift through \u2014 everything from movies and TV shows to role-playing games, underground metal, and gothic cosmetic companies. Then I found a promising site \u2014 Vampires A\u2014Z. I waited impatiently for it to load, quickly clicking closed each ad that flashed across the screen. Finally the screen was finished \u2014 simple white background with black text, academic-looking. Two quotes greeted me on the home page: Throughout the vast shadowy world of ghosts and demons there is no figure so terrible, no figure so dreaded and abhorred, yet dight with such fearful fascination, as the vampire, who is himself neither ghost nor demon, but yet who partakes the dark natures and possesses the mysterious and terrible qualities of both. \u2014 Rev. Montague Summers If there is in this world a well-attested account, it is that of the vampires. Nothing is lacking: official reports, affidavits of well-known people, of surgeons, of priests, of magistrates; the judicial proof is most complete. And with all that, who is there who believes in vampires? \u2014 Rousseau The rest of the site was an alphabetized listing of all the different myths of vampires held throughout the world. The first I clicked on, the Danag, was a Filipino vampire supposedly responsible for planting taro on the islands long ago. The myth continued that the Danag worked with humans for many years, but the partnership ended one day when a woman cut her finger and a Danag sucked her wound, enjoying the taste so much that it drained her body completely of blood. I read carefully through the descriptions, looking for anything that sounded familiar, let alone plausible. It seemed that most vampire myths centered around beautiful women as demons and children as victims; they also seemed like constructs created to explain away the high mortality rates for young children, and to give men an excuse for infidelity. Many of the stories involved bodiless spirits and warnings against improper burials. There wasn't much that sounded like the movies I'd seen, and only a very few, like the Hebrew Estrie and the Polish Upier, who were even preoccupied with drinking blood. Only three entries really caught my attention: the Romanian Varacolaci, a powerful undead being who could appear as a beautiful, pale-skinned human, the Slovak Nelapsi, a creature so strong and fast it could massacre an entire village in the single hour after midnight, and one other, the Stregoni benefici. About this last there was only one brief sentence.  Stregoni benefici: An Italian vampire, said to be on the side of goodness, and a mortal enemy of all evil vampires. It was a relief, that one small entry, the one myth among hundreds that claimed the existence of good vampires. Overall, though, there was little that coincided with Jacob's stories or my own observations. I'd made a little catalogue in my mind as I'd read and carefully compared it with each myth. Speed, strength, beauty, pale skin, eyes that shift color; and then Jacob's criteria: blood drinkers, enemies of the werewolf, cold-skinned, and immortal. There were very few myths that matched even one factor. And then another problem, one that I'd remembered from the small number of scary movies that I'd seen and was backed up by today's reading \u2014 vampires couldn't come out in the daytime, the sun would burn them to a cinder. They slept in coffins all day and came out only at night. Aggravated, I snapped off the computer's main power switch, not waiting to shut things down properly. Through my irritation, I felt overwhelming embarrassment. It was all so stupid. I was sitting in my room, researching vampires. What was wrong with me? I decided that most of the blame belonged on the doorstep of the town of Forks \u2014 and the entire sodden Olympic Peninsula, for that matter. I had to get out of the house, but there was nowhere I wanted to go that didn't involve a three-day drive. I pulled on my boots anyway, unclear where I was headed, and went downstairs. I shrugged into my raincoat without checking the weather and stomped out the door.  It was overcast, but not raining yet. I ignored my truck and started east on foot, angling across Charlie's yard toward the ever-encroaching forest. It didn't take long till I was deep enough for the house and the road to be invisible, for the only sound to be the squish of the damp earth under my feet and the sudden cries of the jays. There was a thin ribbon of a trail that led through the forest here, or I wouldn't risk wandering on my own like this. My sense of direction was hopeless; I could get lost in much less helpful surroundings. The trail wound deeper and deeper into the forest, mostly east as far as I could tell. It snaked around the Sitka spruces and the hemlocks, the yews and the maples. I only vaguely knew the names of the trees around me, and all I knew was due to Charlie pointing them out to me from the cruiser window in earlier days. There were many I didn't know, and others I couldn't be sure about because they were so covered in green parasites. I followed the trail as long as my anger at myself pushed me forward. As that started to ebb, I slowed. A few drops of moisture trickled down from the canopy above me, but I couldn't be certain if it was beginning to rain or if it was simply pools left over from yesterday, held high in the leaves above me, slowly dripping their way back to the earth. A recently fallen tree \u2014 I knew it was recent because it wasn't entirely carpeted in moss \u2014 rested against the trunk of one of her sisters, creating a sheltered little bench just a few safe feet off the trail. I stepped over the ferns and sat carefully, making sure my jacket was between the damp seat and my clothes wherever they\u00a0 touched, and leaned my hooded head back against the living tree. This was the wrong place to have come. I should have known, but where else was there to go? The forest was deep green and far too much like the scene in last night's dream to allow for peace of mind. Now that there was no longer the sound of my soggy footsteps, the silence was piercing.  The birds were quiet, too, the drops increasing in frequency, so it must be raining above. The ferns stood higher than my head, now that I was seated, and I knew someone could walk by on the path, three feet away, and not see me. Here in the trees it was much easier to believe the absurdities that embarrassed me indoors. Nothing had changed in this forest for thousands of years, and all the myths and legends of a hundred different lands seemed much more likely in this green haze than they had in my clear-cut bedroom. I forced myself to focus on the two most vital questions I had to answer, but I did so unwillingly.  First, I had to decide if it was possible that what Jacob had said about the Cullens could be true. Immediately my mind responded with a resounding negative. It was silly and morbid to entertain such ridiculous notions. But what, then? I asked myself. There was no rational explanation for how I was alive at this moment. I listed again in my head the things I'd observed myself: the impossible speed and strength, the eye color shifting from black to gold and back again, the inhuman beauty, the pale, frigid skin. And more \u2014 small things that registered slowly \u2014 how they never seemed to eat, the disturbing grace with which they moved. And the way be sometimes spoke, with unfamiliar cadences and phrases that better fit the style of a turn-of-the-century novel than that of a twenty-first-century classroom. He had skipped class the day we'd done blood typing. He hadn't said no to the beach trip till he heard where we were going. He seemed to know what everyone around him was thinking\u2026 except me. He had told me he was the villain, dangerous\u2026 Could the Cullens be vampires? Well, they were something. Something outside the possibility of rational justification was taking place in front of my incredulous eyes. Whether it be Jacob's cold ones or my own superhero theory, Edward Cullen was not\u2026 human. He was something more.  So then \u2014 maybe. That would have to be my answer for now.  And then the most important question of all. What was I going to do if it was true? If Edward was a vampire \u2014 I could hardly make myself think the words \u2014 then what should I do? Involving someone else was definitely out. I couldn't even believe myself; anyone I told would have me committed.  Only two options seemed practical. The first was to take his advice: to be smart, to avoid him as much as possible. To cancel our plans, to go back to ignoring him as far as I was able. To pretend there was an impenetrably thick glass wall between us in the one class where we were forced together. To tell him to leave me alone \u2014 and mean it this time.  I was gripped in a sudden agony of despair as I considered that alternative. My mind rejected the pain, quickly skipping on to the next option. I could do nothing different. After all, if he was something\u2026 sinister, he'd done nothing to hurt me so far. In fact, I would be a dent in Tyler's fender if he hadn't acted so quickly. So quickly, I argued with myself, that it might have been sheer reflexes. But if it was a reflex to save lives, how bad could he be? I retorted. My head spun around in answerless circles. There was one thing I was sure of, if I was sure of anything. The dark Edward in my dream last night was a reflection only of my fear of the word Jacob had spoken, and not Edward himself. Even so, when I'd screamed out in terror at the werewolf's lunge, it wasn't fear for the wolf that brought the cry of \"no\" to my lips. It was fear that he would be harmed \u2014 even as he called to me with sharp-edged fangs, I feared for him. And I knew in that I had my answer. I didn't know if there ever was a choice, really. I was already in too deep. Now that I knew \u2014 if I knew \u2014 I could do nothing about my frightening secret. Because when I thought of him, of his voice, his hypnotic eyes, the magnetic force of his personality, I wanted nothing more than to be with him right now. Even if\u2026 but I couldn't think it. Not here, alone in the darkening forest. Not while the rain made it dim as twilight under the canopy and pattered like footsteps across the matted earthen floor. I shivered and rose quickly from my place of concealment, worried that somehow the path would have disappeared with the rain. But it was there, safe and clear, winding its way out of the dripping green maze. I followed it hastily, my hood pulled close around my face, becoming surprised, as I nearly ran through the trees, at how far I had come. I started to wonder if I was heading out at all, or following the path farther into the confines of the forest. Before I could get too panicky, though, I began to glimpse some open spaces through the webbed branches. And then I could hear a car passing on the street, and I was free, Charlie's lawn stretched out in front of me, the house beckoning me, promising warmth and dry socks. It was just noon when I got back inside. I went upstairs and got dressed for the day, jeans and a t-shirt, since I was staying indoors. It didn't take too much effort to concentrate on my task for the day, a paper on Macbeth that was due Wednesday. I settled into outlining a rough draft contentedly, more serene than I'd felt since\u2026 well, since Thursday afternoon, if I was being honest.  That had always been my way, though. Making decisions was the painful part for me, the part I <em>agonized</em> over. But once the decision was made, I simply followed through \u2014 usually with relief that the choice was made. Sometimes the relief was tainted by despair, like my decision to come to Forks. But it was still better than wrestling with the alternatives.  This decision was ridiculously easy to live with. Dangerously easy.  And so the day was quiet, productive \u2014 I finished my paper before eight. Charlie came home with a large catch, and I made a mental note to pick up a book of recipes for fish while I was in Seattle next week. The chills that flashed up my spine whenever I thought of that trip were no different than the ones I'd felt before I'd taken my walk with Jacob Black. They should be different, I thought. I should be afraid \u2014 I knew I should be, but I couldn't feel the right kind of fear. I slept dreamlessly that night, exhausted from beginning my day so early, and sleeping so poorly the night before. I woke, for the second time since arriving in Forks, to the bright yellow light of a sunny day. I skipped to the window, stunned to see that there was hardly a cloud in the sky, and those there were just fleecy little white puffs that couldn't possibly be carrying any rain. I opened the window \u2014 surprised when it opened silently, without sticking, not having opened it in who knows how many years \u2014 and sucked in the relatively dry air. It was nearly warm and hardly windy at all. My blood was electric in my veins.  Charlie was finishing breakfast when I came downstairs, and he picked up on my mood immediately. \"Nice day out,\" he commented. \"Yes,\" I agreed with a grin. He smiled back, his brown eyes crinkling around the edges. When Charlie smiled, it was easier to see why he and my mother had jumped too quickly into an early marriage. Most of the young romantic he'd been in those days had faded before I'd known him, as the curly brown hair \u2014 the same color, if not the same texture, as mine \u2014 had dwindled, slowly revealing more and more of the shiny skin of his forehead. But when he smiled I could see a little of the man who had run away with Ren\u00e9e when she was just two years older than I was now. I ate breakfast cheerily, watching the dust moats stirring in the sunlight that streamed in the back window. Charlie called out a goodbye, and I heard the cruiser pull away from the house. I hesitated on my way out the door, hand on my rain jacket. It would be tempting fate to leave it home. With a sigh, I folded it over my arm and stepped out into the brightest light I'd seen in months. By dint of much elbow grease, I was able to get both windows in the truck almost completely rolled down. I was one of the first ones to school; I hadn't even checked the clock in my hurry to get outside. I parked and headed toward the seldom-used picnic benches on the south side of the cafeteria. The benches were still a little damp, so I sat on my jacket, glad to have a use for it. My homework was done \u2014 the product of a slow social life \u2014 but there were a few Trig problems I wasn't sure I had right. I took out my book industriously, but halfway through rechecking the first problem I was daydreaming, watching the sunlight play on the red-barked trees. I sketched inattentively along the margins of my homework. After a few minutes, I suddenly realized I'd drawn five pairs of dark eyes staring out of the page at me. I scrubbed them out with the eraser. \"Bella!\" I heard someone call, and it sounded like Mike. I looked around to realize that the school had become populated while I'd been sitting there, absentminded. Everyone was in t-shirts, some even in shorts though the temperature couldn't be over sixty. Mike was coming toward me in khaki shorts and a striped Rugby shirt, waving.  \"Hey, Mike,\" I called, waving back, unable to be halfhearted on a morning like this. He came to sit by me, the tidy spikes of his hair shining golden in the light, his grin stretching across his face. He was so delighted to see me, I couldn't help but feel gratified. \"I never noticed before \u2014 your hair has red in it,\" he commented, catching between his fingers a strand that was fluttering in the light breeze. \"Only in the sun.\" I became just a little uncomfortable as he tucked the lock behind my ear. \"Great day, isn't it?\" \"My kind of day,\" I agreed.  \"What did you do yesterday?\" His tone was just a bit too proprietary. \"I mostly worked on my essay.\" I didn't add that I was finished with it \u2014 no need to sound smug. He hit his forehead with the heel of his hand. \"Oh yeah \u2014 that's due Thursday, right?\" \"Um, Wednesday, I think.\" \"Wednesday?\" He frowned. \"That's not good\u2026 What are you writing yours on?\" \"Whether Shakespeare's treatment of the female characters is misogynistic.\" He stared at me like I'd just spoken in pig Latin. \"I guess I'll have to get to work on that tonight,\" he said, deflated. \"I was going to ask if you wanted to go out.\" \"Oh.\" I was taken off guard. Why couldn't I ever have a pleasant\u00a0 conversation with Mike anymore without it getting awkward? \"Well, we could go to dinner or something\u2026 and I could work on it later.\" He smiled at me hopefully. \"Mike\u2026\" I hated being put on the spot. \"I don't think that would be the best idea.\" His face fell. \"Why?\" he asked, his eyes guarded. My thoughts flickered to Edward, wondering if that's where his thoughts were as well. \"I think\u2026 and if you ever repeat what I'm saying right now I will cheerfully beat you to death,\" I threatened, \"but I think that would hurt Jessica's feelings.\" He was bewildered, obviously not thinking in that direction at all.  \"Jessica?\" \"Really, Mike, are you blind?\" \"Oh,\" he exhaled \u2014 clearly dazed. I took advantage of that to make my escape. \"It's time for class, and I can't be late again.\" I gathered my books up and stuffed them in my bag. We walked in silence to building three, and his expression was distracted. I hoped whatever thoughts he was immersed in were leading him in the right direction. When I saw Jessica in Trig, she was bubbling with enthusiasm. She, Angela, and Lauren were going to Port Angeles tonight to go dress shopping for the dance, and she wanted me to come, too, even though I didn't need one. I was indecisive. It would be nice to get out of town with some girlfriends, but Lauren would be there. And who knew what I could be doing tonight\u2026 But that was definitely the wrong path to let my mind wander down. Of course I was happy about the sunlight. But that wasn't completely responsible for the euphoric mood I was in, not even close. So I gave her a maybe, telling her I'd have to talk with Charlie first. She talked of nothing but the dance on the way to Spanish, continuing as if without an interruption when class finally ended, five minutes late, and we were on our way to lunch. I was far too lost in my own frenzy of anticipation to notice much of what she said. I was painfully eager to see not just him but all the Cullens \u2014 to compare them with the new suspicions that plagued my mind. As I crossed the threshold of the cafeteria, I felt the first true tingle of fear slither down my spine and settle in my stomach. Would they be able to know what I was thinking? And then a different feeling jolted through me \u2014 would Edward be waiting to sit with me again? As was my routine, I glanced first toward the Cullens' table. A shiver of panic trembled in my stomach as I realized it was empty. With dwindling hope, my eyes scoured the rest of the cafeteria, hoping to find him alone, waiting for me. The place was nearly filled \u2014 Spanish had made us late \u2014 but there was no sign of Edward or any of his family. Desolation hit me with crippling strength. I shambled along behind Jessica, not bothering to pretend to listen anymore. We were late enough that everyone was already at our table. I avoided the empty chair next to Mike in favor of one by Angela. I vaguely noticed that Mike held the chair out politely for Jessica, and that her face lit up in response. Angela asked a few quiet questions about the Macbeth paper, which I answered as naturally as I could while spiraling downward in misery. She, too, invited me to go with them tonight, and I agreed now, grasping at anything to distract myself. I realized I'd been holding on to a last shred of hope when I entered Biology, saw his empty seat, and felt a new wave of disappointment. The rest of the day passed slowly, dismally. In Gym, we had a lecture on the rules of badminton, the next torture they had lined up for me. But at least it meant I got to sit and listen instead of stumbling around on the court. The best part was the coach didn't finish, so I got another day off tomorrow. Never mind that the day after they would arm me with a racket before unleashing me on the rest of the class. I was glad to leave campus, so I would be free to pout and mope before I went out tonight with Jessica and company. But right after I walked in the door of Charlie's house, Jessica called to cancel our plans. I tried to be happy that Mike had asked her out to dinner \u2014 I really was relieved that he finally seemed to be catching on \u2014 but my enthusiasm sounded false in my own ears. She rescheduled our shopping trip for tomorrow night. Which left me with little in the way of distractions. I had fish marinating for dinner, with a salad and bread left over from the night before, so there was nothing to do there. I spent a focused half hour on homework, but then I was through with that, too. I checked my e-mail, reading the backlog of letters from my mother, getting snippier as they progressed to the present. I sighed and typed a quick response.  Mom, Sorry. I've been out. I went to the beach with some friends. And I had to write a paper. My excuses were fairly pathetic, so I gave up on that. It's sunny outside today - I know, I'm shocked, too - so I'm going to go outside and soak up as much vitamin D as I can. I love you, Bella. I decided to kill an hour with non-school-related reading. I had a small collection of books that came with me to Forks, the shabbiest volume being a compilation of the works of Jane Austen. I selected that one and headed to the backyard, grabbing a ragged old quilt from the linen cupboard at the top of the stairs on my way down. Outside in Charlie's small, square yard, I folded the quilt in half and laid it out of the reach of the trees' shadows on the thick lawn that would always be slightly wet, no matter how long the sun shone. I lay on my stomach, crossing my ankles in the air, flipping through the different novels in the book, trying to decide which would occupy my mind the most thoroughly. My favorites were Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility. I'd read the first most recently, so I started into Sense and Sensibility, only to remember after I began three that the hero of the story happened to be named Edward. Angrily, I turned to Mansfield Park, but the hero of that piece was named Edmund, and that was just too close. Weren't there any other names available in the late eighteenth century? I snapped the book shut, annoyed, and rolled over onto my back.  I pushed my sleeves up as high as they would go, and closed my eyes. I would think of nothing but the warmth on my skin, I told myself severely. The breeze was still light, but it blew tendrils of my hair around my face, and that tickled a bit. I pulled all my hair over my head, letting it fan out on the quilt above me, and focused again on the heat that touched my eyelids, my cheekbones, my nose, my lips, my forearms, my neck, soaked through my light shirt\u2026 The next thing I was conscious of was the sound of Charlie's cruiser turning onto the bricks of the driveway. I sat up in surprise, realizing the light was gone, behind the trees, and I had fallen asleep. I looked around, muddled, with the sudden feeling that I wasn't alone.  \"Charlie?\" I asked. But I could hear his door slamming in front of the house. I jumped up, foolishly edgy, gathering the now-damp quilt and my book. I ran inside to get some oil heating on the stove, realizing that dinner would be late. Charlie was hanging up his gun belt and stepping out of his boots when I came in. \"Sorry, Dad, dinner's not ready yet \u2014 I fell asleep outside.\" I stifled a yawn. \"Don't worry about it,\" he said. \"I wanted to catch the score on the game, anyway.\" I watched TV with Charlie after dinner, for something to do. There wasn't anything on I wanted to watch, but he knew I didn't like baseball, so he turned it to some mindless sitcom that neither of us enjoyed. He seemed happy, though, to be doing something together. And it felt good, despite my depression, to make him happy. \"Dad,\" I said during a commercial, \"Jessica and Angela are going to look at dresses for the dance tomorrow night in Port Angeles, and they wanted me to help them choose\u2026 do you mind if I go with them?\" \"Jessica Stanley?\" he asked. \"And Angela Weber.\" I sighed as I gave him the details. He was confused. \"But you're not going to the dance, right?\" \"No, Dad, but I'm helping them find dresses \u2014 you know, giving them constructive criticism.\" I wouldn't have to explain this to a woman. \"Well, okay.\" He seemed to realize that he was out of his depth with the girlie stuff. \"It's a school night, though.\" \"We'll leave right after school, so we can get back early. You'll be okay for dinner, right?\" \"Bells, I fed myself for seventeen years before you got here,\" he reminded me. \"I don't know how you survived,\" I muttered, then added more clearly, \"I'll leave some things for cold-cut sandwiches in the fridge, okay? Right on top.\" It was sunny again in the morning. I awakened with renewed hope that I grimly tried to suppress. I dressed for the warmer weather in a deep blue V-neck blouse \u2014 something I'd worn in the dead of winter in Phoenix.  I had planned my arrival at school so that I barely had time to make it to class. With a sinking heart, I circled the full lot looking for a space, while also searching for the silver Volvo that was clearly not there. I parked in the last row and hurried to English, arriving breathless, but subdued, before the final bell.  It was the same as yesterday \u2014 I just couldn't keep little sprouts of hope from budding in my mind, only to have them squashed painfully as I searched the lunchroom in vain and sat at my empty Biology table. The Port Angeles scheme was back on again for tonight and made all the more attractive by the fact that Lauren had other obligations. I was anxious to get out of town so I could stop glancing over my shoulder, hoping to see him appearing out of the blue the way he always did. I vowed to myself that I would be in a good mood tonight and not ruin Angela's or Jessica's enjoyment in the dress hunting. Maybe I could do a little clothes shopping as well. I refused to think that I might be shopping alone in Seattle this weekend, no longer interested in the earlier arrangement. Surely he wouldn't cancel without at least telling me. After school, Jessica followed me home in her old white Mercury so that I could ditch my books and truck. I brushed through my hair quickly when I was inside, feeling a slight lift of excitement as I contemplated getting out of Forks. I left a note for Charlie on the table, explaining again where to find dinner, switched my scruffy wallet from my school bag to a purse I rarely used, and ran out to join Jessica. We went to Angela's house next, and she was waiting for us. My excitement increased exponentially as we actually drove out of the town limits.",
