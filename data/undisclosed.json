A BBC correspondent said Saif al-Islam seemed confident and full of adrenalin. On Monday the rebels met strong resistance from pro-Gaddafi forces as they continued their push. Both sides say they control most of Tripoli. Saif al-Islam Gaddafi turned up at Hotel Rixos in the early hours of Tuesday. He told the BBC's Matthew Price: \"We have broken the backbone of the rebels.\" He added that by moving into Tripoli, the rebels had fallen into \"a trap\". \"We gave them a hard time, so we're winning,\" he said. Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, 39, had been widely regarded as a likely successor to his father. On Sunday the rebels claimed they had captured him, along with other members of his family. Asked if Col Gaddafi was safe and in Tripoli, Saif al-Islam replied: \"Of course.\" The Libyan leader's whereabouts are still unclear. His sprawling Bab al-Azizia compound is being defended by loyalist troops A diplomatic source told AFP news agency that Col Gaddafi could still be there. He has not been seen in public for months, although he has broadcast audio messages from <em>undisclosed</em> locations.  In a broadcast late on Sunday, he urged residents to \"save Tripoli\" from the rebels. In other developments: \u009f Pro-Gaddafi forces fire a suspected Scud missile from near their stronghold city of Sirte, US defence officials tell Reuters news agency  \u009f Col Gaddafi's eldest son Muhammad reportedly escaped from rebel custody hours after being detained  \u009f China and Russia issue statements urging Gaddafi forces to stop fighting  \u009f UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon says leaders of regional blocs will meet in New York later this week  \u009f Egypt formally recognises the rebel National Transitional Council as the legitimate representative of the Libyan people Ambush  The rebels swept into Tripoli from several direction following an uprising in the capital at the weekend. They who were greeted by jubilant crowds in central Green Square when they arrived on Sunday. Rebel fighters have set up checkpoints in parts of the city, and say reinforcements are arriving by boat. But they have met stiff resistance in a number of areas. There was sustained gunfire near the Bab al-Azizia compound in western Tripoli throughout Monday. Gaddafi loyalists also remain in control of the area further south around the Rixos Hotel, where many Western journalists are based. A rebel convoy coming in from the west was ambushed by Gaddafi loyalists using anti-aircraft fire on Monday. The convoy forced to pull out of the city. As night fell the fighting appeared to die down in many areas. Both sides insist they have the upper hand. Government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim claimed late pro-Gaddafi had control of at least 75% of the city, while the rebels said they were holding about 80%. Our correspondents says it is impossible to determine who is telling the truth. World leaders have urged Col Gaddafi to step down. US President Barack Obama said elements of the Gaddafi regime continued to pose a threat. \"But this much is clear: the Gaddafi regime is coming to an end and the future of Libya is in the hands of its people,\" he said. He appealed to Col Gaddafi to reduce further bloodshed by \"explicitly relinquishing power to the people of Libya and calling on those forces that continue to fight to lay down their arms\".",

            "en": "Mr Jobs, who underwent a liver transplant following pancreatic cancer, said he could no longer meet his chief executive's duties and expectations.The Silicon Valley legend will become chairman of the firm.\nThe 56-year-old has been on medical leave for an <em>undisclosed</em> condition since 17 January.\nIn a short letter to the board of Apple, Mr Jobs wrote: \"I have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple's chief executive, I would be the first to let you know.\n\"Unfortunately, that day has come. I hereby resign as chief executive of Apple.\n\"I believe Apple's brightest and most innovative days are ahead of it. And I look forward to watching and contributing to its success in a new role.\n\"I have made some of the best friends of my life at Apple, and I thank you all for the many years of being able to work alongside you.\"\nApple board member Art Levinson paid tribute to Mr Job's contribution to the company: \"Steve's extraordinary vision and leadership saved Apple and guided it to its position as the world's most innovative and valuable technology company.\"\n'Hugely successful'\"Steve is [still] going to be able to provide the input he would do as a chief executive,\" said Colin Gillis at BGC Financial.Analysts said the move was not unexpected, and would have little impact on the day-to-day running of the company.\n\"But Tim has been de facto chief executive for some time and the company has been hugely successful. The vision and the roadmap is intact.\"\nNor will customers see any real difference, analysts said.\n\"At the end of the day, consumers don't buy products from Apple because they're from Steve Jobs, they buy them because they meet their needs and they're good products, and they'll continue to do that,\" Michael Gartenberg from Gartner told the BBC.\nHowever, Apple shares slid more than 5% in after-hours trading, suggesting that some investors were less confident of the company's prospects without Mr Jobs at the helm.\nAt the same time, shares in two of Apple's main Asian rivals gained. Taiwan-based phone maker HTC rose 4.1%, while South Korea's Samsung Electronics gained 3.2%.\nThe firms compete with Apple in the smartphone and tablet-PC sector, and have been involved in legal battles with Apple over patent rights. Analysts said that Mr Jobs' departure may make life easier for rivals.\n\"Maybe this will make the playing field a bit more level,\" Bryan Ma of IDC Asia-Pacific told the BBC's Asia Business Report.\nRevolutionary productsMr Jobs is widely seen as the creative force that has driven Apple to become one of the world's biggest companies.In the three months to the end of June, the company made a profit of $7.3bn on revenues of $28.6bn. It sold more than 20 million iPhones in the period and 9.25 million iPads.Thanks to innovative and hugely popular products such as the iPod, the iPhone and more recently the iPad, Apple has become one of the most sought after brands in the world.\nThe company recently became the valuable US firm after its market capitalisation overtook that of oil company Exxon Mobil.\nMr Jobs started Apple in the 1970s and its Macintosh computers became hugely popular in the 1980s.\nIn 1985, Mr Jobs left the company after falling out with colleagues, only to return in 1997 and begin Apple's transformation by launching the colourful iMac computer.\nThe iPod, which revolutionised the personal music-player market and spawned myriad copycat devices, was launched in 2002 and lay the foundations for the company's success over the past decade.\nNext came the iPhone, which similarly revolutionised the smartphone market, while the iPad confounded some initial scepticism to prove hugely popular.\nMany versions of these products have been launched while Mr Jobs has been on medical leave, and new versions that have been planned for months will not be affected by his departure, analysts said.\n\"In the near term, at least the next two three years, Apple will continue to have a fantastic run because it's got its entire roadmap in place which will continue to work seamlessly,\" Manoj Menon at Frost and Sullivan told the BBC",
