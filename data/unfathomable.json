He met his longtime friend and fellow Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak when he was 16 years old thanks to an introduction from a mutual friend. That was in 1971\u2014years before the two roped in a couple more friends to begin working on their first computers for Apple.  \u00a0 Jobs founded Apple in 1976 along with Wozniak, Ronald Wayne, and A.C. Markkula Jr. in order to create personal computers that regular people could use at home\u2014a young but budding market back in the late '70s. Apple saw some success with its first series of Apple II computers, but the first Macintosh was released to the public in 1984 and became a wild success. Although Jobs was ousted from Apple in 1985 following a power struggle between him and who would become the new CEO, John Sculley, he was never forgotten by the Apple faithful. Jobs made a triumphant return to the struggling company in in 1997 following Apple's purchase of Jobs' other company, NeXT Computer. \u00a0 Since then, Apple has been doing (almost) nothing but going gangbusters on the technology world thanks to Jobs' ambitious-yet-ruthless management style. The original iMac, followed by the iPod, iPhone, MacBook Air, and now the iPad have all seen levels of success that were <em>unfathomable</em> in the mid-'90s. Jobs has arguably positioned himself as one of the most important people in personal technology between the late-1970s and today\u2014a difficult title to strive for during such a technologically innovative time period.  \u00a0 But the legend of Steve Jobs goes much further\u2014and will live much longer\u2014than any single piece of technology that Apple has produced. From stories of Jobs firing people in elevators to recollections of him going to a neighborhood pool party with his son, Jobs somehow managed to maintain a personal reputation as chilled out Buddhist with a type A personality. His high standards, combined with his eye for simplicity, will certainly live on in Apple's future creations. But for now, we must say goodbye to the man who worked tirelessly to make it all possible: Steve Jobs.",

            "en": "15          15. THE CULLENS The muted light of yet another cloudy day eventually woke me. I lay with my arm across my eyes, groggy and dazed. Something, a dream trying to be remembered, struggled to break into my consciousness. I moaned and rolled on my side, hoping more sleep would come. And then the previous day flooded back into my awareness. \"Oh!\" I sat up so fast it made my head spin. \"Your hair looks like a haystack\u2026 but I like it.\u201dHis unruffled voice came from the rocking chair in the corner. \"Edward! You stayed!\" I rejoiced, and thoughtlessly threw myself across the room and into his lap. In the instant that my thoughts caught up with my actions, I froze, shocked by my own uncontrolled enthusiasm. I stared up at him, afraid that I had crossed the wrong line. But he laughed. \"Of course,\u201dHe answered, startled, but seeming pleased by my reaction. His hands rubbed my back. I laid my head cautiously against his shoulder, breathing in the smell of his skin. \"I was sure it was a dream.\" \"You're not that creative,\u201dHe scoffed. \"Charlie!\" I remembered, thoughtlessly jumping up again and heading to the door. \"He left an hour ago \u2014 after reattaching your battery cables, I might add. I have to admit I was disappointed. Is that really all it would take to stop you, if you were determined to go?\" I deliberated where I stood, wanting to return to him badly, but afraid I might have morning breath. \"You're not usually this confused in the morning,\u201dHe noted. He held his arms open for me to return. A nearly irresistible invitation. \"I need another human minute,\" I admitted. \"I'll wait.\" I skipped to the bathroom, my emotions unrecognizable. I didn't know myself, inside or out. The face in the mirror was practically a stranger \u2014 eyes too bright, hectic spots of red across my cheekbones. After I brushed my teeth, I worked to straighten out the tangled chaos that was my hair. I splashed my face with cold water, and tried to breathe normally, with no noticeable success. I half-ran back to my room.  It seemed like a miracle that he was there, his arms still waiting for me. He reached out to me, and my heart thumped unsteadily. \"Welcome back,\u201dHe murmured, taking me into his arms. He rocked me for a while in silence, until I noticed that his clothes were changed, his hair smooth. \"You left?\" I accused, touching the collar of his fresh shirt. \"I could hardly leave in the clothes I came in \u2014 what would the neighbors think?\"  I pouted. \"You were very deeply asleep; I didn't miss anything.\u201dHis eyes gleamed. \"The talking came earlier.\" I groaned. \"What did you hear?\" His gold eyes grew very soft. \"You said you loved me.\" \"You knew that already,\" I reminded him, ducking my head. \"It was nice to hear, just the same.\" I hid my face against his shoulder. \"I love you,\" I whispered. \"You are my life now,\u201dHe answered simply. There was nothing more to say for the moment. He rocked us back and forth as the room grew lighter. \"Breakfast time,\u201dHe said eventually, casually \u2014 to prove, I'm sure, that he remembered all my human frailties. So I clutched my throat with both hands and stared at him with wide eyes. Shock crossed his face. \"Kidding!\" I snickered. \"And you said I couldn't act!\" He frowned in disgust. \"That wasn't funny.\" \"It was very funny, and you know it.\" But I examined his gold eyes carefully, to make sure that I was forgiven. Apparently, I was. \"Shall I rephrase?\u201dHe asked. \"Breakfast time for the human.\" \"Oh, okay.\" He threw me over his stone shoulder, gently, but with a swiftness that left me breathless. I protested as he carried me easily down the stairs, but he ignored me. He sat me right side up on a chair. The kitchen was bright, happy, seeming to absorb my mood. \"What's for breakfast?\" I asked pleasantly. That threw him for a minute. \"Er, I'm not sure. What would you like?\u201dHis marble brow puckered. I grinned, hopping up. \"That's all right, I fend for myself pretty well. Watch me hunt.\" I found a bowl and a box of cereal. I could feel his eyes on me as I poured the milk and grabbed a spoon. I sat my food on the table, and then paused. \"Can I get you anything?\" I asked, not wanting to be rude. He rolled his eyes. \"Just eat, Bella.\" I sat at the table, watching him as I took a bite. He was gazing at me, studying my every movement. It made me self-conscious. I cleared my mouth to speak, to distract him. \"What's on the agenda for today?\" I asked. \"Hmmm\u2026\" I watched him frame his answer carefully. \"What would you say to meeting my family?\" I gulped. \"Are you afraid now?\u201dHe sounded hopeful. \"Yes,\" I admitted; how could I deny it \u2014 he could see my eyes. \"Don't worry.\u201dHe smirked. \"I'll protect you.\" \"I'm not afraid of them,\" I explained. \"I'm afraid they won't\u2026 like me. Won't they be, well, surprised that you would bring someone\u2026 like me\u2026 home to meet them? Do they know that I know about them?\" \"Oh, they already know everything. They'd taken bets yesterday, you know\" \u2014 he smiled, but his voice was harsh \u2014 \"on whether I'd bring you back, though why anyone would bet against Alice, I can't imagine. At any rate, we don't have secrets in the family. It's not really feasible, what with my mind reading and Alice seeing the future and all that.\" \"And Jasper making you feel all warm and fuzzy about spilling your guts, don't forget that.\" \"You paid attention,\u201dHe smiled approvingly. \"I've been known to do that every now and then.\" I grimaced. \"So did Alice see me coming?\" His reaction was strange. \"Something like that,\u201dHe said uncomfortably, turning away so I couldn't see his eyes. I stared at him curiously. \"Is that any good?\u201dHe asked, turning back to me abruptly and eyeing my breakfast with a teasing look on his face. \"Honestly, it doesn't look very appetizing.\" \"Well, it's no irritable grizzly\u2026\" I murmured, ignoring him when he glowered. I was still wondering why he responded that way when I mentioned Alice. I hurried through my cereal, speculating. He stood in the middle of the kitchen, the statue of Adonis again, staring abstractedly out the back windows. Then his eyes were back on me, and he smiled his heartbreaking smile. \"And you should introduce me to your father, too, I think.\" \"He already knows you,\" I reminded him. \"As your boyfriend, I mean.\" I stared at him with suspicion. \"Why?\" \"Isn't that customary?\u201dHe asked innocently. \"I don't know,\" I admitted. My dating history gave me few reference points to work with. Not that any normal rules of dating applied here. \"That's not necessary, you know. I don't expect you to\u2026 I mean, you don't have to pretend for me.\" His smile was patient. \"I'm not pretending.\" I pushed the remains of my cereal around the edges of the bowl, biting my lip. \"Are you going to tell Charlie I'm your boyfriend or not?\u201dHe demanded. \"Is that what you are?\" I suppressed my internal cringing at the thought of Edward and Charlie and the word boy friend all in the same room at the same time. \"It's a loose interpretation of the word 'boy,' I'll admit.\"  \"I was under the impression that you were something more, actually,\" I confessed, looking at the table. \"Well, I don't know if we need to give him all the gory details.\u201dHe reached across the table to lift my chin with a cold, gentle finger. \"But he will need some explanation for why I'm around here so much. I don't want Chief Swan getting a restraining order put on me.\" \"Will you be?\" I asked, suddenly anxious. \"Will you really be here?\" \"As long as you want me,\u201dHe assured me. \"I'll always want you,\" I warned him. \"Forever.\" He walked slowly around the table, and, pausing a few feet away, he reached out to touch his fingertips to my cheek. His expression was <em>unfathomable</em>. \"Does that make you sad?\" I asked. He didn't answer. He stared into my eyes for an immeasurable period of time. \"Are you finished?\u201dHe finally asked. I jumped up. \"Yes.\" \"Get dressed \u2014 I'll wait here.\" It was hard to decide what to wear. I doubted there were any etiquette books detailing how to dress when your vampire sweetheart takes you home to meet his vampire family. It was a relief to think the word to myself. I knew I shied away from it intentionally. I ended up in my only skirt \u2014 long, khaki-colored, still casual. I put on the dark blue blouse he'd once complimented. A quick glance in the mirror told me my hair was entirely impossible, so I pulled it back into a pony tail. \"Okay.\" I bounced down the stairs. \"I'm decent.\" He was waiting at the foot of the stairs, closer than I'd thought, and I bounded right into him. He steadied me, holding me a careful distance away for a few seconds before suddenly pulling me closer. \"Wrong again,\u201dHe murmured in my ear. \"You are utterly indecent \u2014 no one should look so tempting, it's not fair.\" \"Tempting how?\" I asked. \"I can change\u2026\" He sighed, shaking his head. \"You are so absurd.\u201dHe pressed his cool lips delicately to my forehead, and the room spun. The smell of his breath made it impossible to think.  \"Shall I explain how you are tempting me?\u201dHe said. It was clearly a rhetorical question. His fingers traced slowly down my spine, his breath coming more quickly against my skin. My hands were limp on his chest, and I felt lightheaded again. He tilted his head slowly and touched his cool lips to mine for the second time, very carefully, parting them slightly. And then I collapsed. \"Bella?\u201dHis voice was alarmed as he caught me and held me up. \"You\u2026 made\u2026 me\u2026 faint,\" I accused him dizzily. \"What am I going to do with you?\u201dHe groaned in exasperation. \"Yesterday I kiss you, and you attack me! Today you pass out on me!\" I laughed weakly, letting his arms support me while my head spun. \"So much for being good at everything,\u201dHe sighed. \"That's the problem.\" I was still dizzy. \"You're too good. Far, far too good.\" \"Do you feel sick?\u201dHe asked; he'd seen me like this before. \"No \u2014 that wasn't the same kind of fainting at all. I don't know what happened.\" I shook my head apologetically, \"I think I forgot to breathe.\" \"I can't take you anywhere like this.\" \"I'm fine,\" I insisted. \"Your family is going to think I'm insane anyway, what's the difference?\" He measured my expression for a moment. \"I'm very partial to that color with your skin,\u201dHe offered unexpectedly. I flushed with pleasure, and looked away. \"Look, I'm trying really hard not to think about what I'm about to do, so can we go already?\" I asked. \"And you're worried, not because you're headed to meet a houseful of vampires, but because you think those vampires won't approve of you, correct?\" \"That's right,\" I answered immediately, hiding my surprise at his casual use of the word. He shook his head. \"You're incredible.\" I realized, as he drove my truck out of the main part of town, that I had no idea where he lived. We passed over the bridge at the Calawah River, the road winding northward, the houses flashing past us growing farther apart, getting bigger. And then we were past the other houses altogether, driving through misty forest. I was trying to decide whether to ask or be patient, when he turned abruptly onto an unpaved road. It was unmarked, barely visible among the ferns. The forest encroached on both sides, leaving the road ahead only discernible for a few meters as it twisted, serpentlike, around the ancient trees. And then, after a few miles, there was some thinning of the woods, and we were suddenly in a small meadow, or was it actually a lawn? The gloom of the forest didn't relent, though, for there were six primordial cedars that shaded an entire acre with their vast sweep of branches. The trees held their protecting shadow right up to the walls of the house that rose among them, making obsolete the deep porch that wrapped around the first story. I don't know what I had expected, but it definitely wasn't this. The house was timeless, graceful, and probably a hundred years old. It was painted a soft, faded white, three stories tall, \u00a0\u00a0rectangular and well proportioned. The windows and doors were either part of the original structure or a perfect restoration. My truck was the only car in sight. I could hear the river close by, hidden in the obscurity of the forest. \"Wow.\" \"You like it?\u201dHe smiled. \"It\u2026 has a certain charm.\" He pulled the end of my ponytail and chuckled. \"Ready?\u201dHe asked, opening my door. \"Not even a little bit \u2014 let's go.\" I tried to laugh, but it seemed to get stuck in my throat. I smoothed my hair nervously. \"You look lovely.\u201dHe took my hand easily, without thinking about it. We walked through the deep shade up to the porch. I knew he could feel my tension; his thumb rubbed soothing circles into the back of my hand. He opened the door for me. The inside was even more surprising, less predictable, than the exterior. It was very bright, very open, and very large. This must have originally been several rooms, but the walls had been removed from most of the first floor to create one wide space. The back, south-facing wall had been entirely replaced with glass, and, beyond the shade of the cedars, the lawn stretched bare to the wide river. A massive curving staircase dominated the west side of the room. The walls, the high-beamed ceiling, the wooden floors, and the thick carpets were all varying shades of white. Waiting to greet us, standing just to the left of the door, on a raised portion of the floor by a spectacular grand piano, were Edward's parents. I'd seen Dr. Cullen before, of course, yet I couldn't help but be struck again by his youth, his outrageous perfection. At his side was Esme, I assumed, the only one of the family I'd never seen before. She had the same pale, beautiful features as the rest of them. Something about her heart-shaped face, her billows of soft, caramel-colored hair, reminded me of the ing\u00e9nues of the silent-movie era. She was small, slender, yet less angular, more rounded than the others. They were both dressed casually, in light colors that matched the inside of the house. They smiled in welcome, but made no move to approach us. Trying not to frighten me, I guessed. \"Carlisle, Esme,\u201dEdward's voice broke the short silence, \"this is Bella.\" \"You're very welcome, Bella.\u201dCarlisle's step was measured, careful as he approached me. He raised his hand tentatively, and I stepped forward to shake hands with him. \"It's nice to see you again, Dr. Cullen.\" \"Please, call me Carlisle.\" \"Carlisle.\" I grinned at him, my sudden confidence surprising me. I could feel Edward's relief at my side. Esme smiled and stepped forward as well, reaching for my hand. Her cold, stone grasp was just as I expected. \"It's very nice to know you,\" she said sincerely. \"Thank you. I'm glad to meet you, too.\u201dAnd I was. It was like meeting a fairy tale \u2014 Snow White, in the flesh. \"Where are Alice and Jasper?\u201dEdward asked, but no one answered, as they had just appeared at the top of the wide staircase. \"Hey, Edward!\u201dAlice called enthusiastically. She ran down the stairs, a streak of black hair and white skin, coming to a sudden and graceful stop in front of me. Carlisle and Esme shot warning glances at her, but I liked it. It was natural \u2014 for her, anyway. \"Hi, Bella!\u201dAlice said, and she bounced forward to kiss my cheek. If Carlisle and Esme had looked cautious before, they now looked staggered. There was shock in my eyes, too, but I was also very pleased that she seemed to approve of me so entirely. I was startled to feel Edward stiffen at my side. I glanced at his face, but his expression was unreadable. \"You do smell nice, I never noticed before,\" she commented, to my extreme embarrassment. No one else seemed to know quite what to say, and then Jasper was there \u2014 tall and leonine. A feeling of ease spread through me, and I was suddenly comfortable despite where I was. Edward stared at Jasper, raising one eyebrow, and I remembered what Jasper could do.  \"Hello, Bella,\" Jasper said. He kept his distance, not offering to shake my hand. But it was impossible to feel awkward near him. \"Hello, Jasper.\" I smiled at him shyly, and then at the others. \"It's nice to meet you all \u2014 you have a very beautiful home,\" I added conventionally. \"Thank you,\u201dEsme said. \"We're so glad that you came.\" She spoke with feeling, and I realized that she thought I was brave. I also realized that Rosalie and Emmett were nowhere to be seen, and I remembered Edward's too-innocent denial when I'd asked him if the others didn't like me. Carlisle's expression distracted me from this train of thought; he was gazing meaningfully at Edward with an intense expression. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Edward nod once. I looked away, trying to be polite. My eyes wandered again to the beautiful instrument on the platform by the door. I suddenly remembered my childhood fantasy that, should I ever win a lottery, I would buy a grand piano for my mother. She wasn't really good \u2014 she only played for herself on our secondhand upright \u2014 but I loved to watch her play. She was happy, absorbed \u2014 she seemed like a new, mysterious being to me then, someone outside the \"mom\" persona I took for granted. She'd put me through lessons, of course, but like most kids, I whined until she let me quit. Esme noticed my preoccupation. \"Do you play?\" she asked, inclining her head toward the piano. I shook my head. \"Not at all. But it's so beautiful. Is it yours?\" \"No,\" she laughed. \"Edward didn't tell you he was musical?\" \"No.\" I glared at his suddenly innocent expression with narrowed eyes. \"I should have known, I guess.\" Esme raised her delicate eyebrows in confusion. \"Edward can do everything, right?\" I explained. Jasper snickered and Esme gave Edward a reproving look. \"I hope you haven't been showing off\u2014 it's rude,\" she scolded. \"Just a bit,\u201dHe laughed freely. Her face softened at the sound, and they shared a brief look that I didn't understand, though Esme's face seemed almost smug. \"He's been too modest, actually,\" I corrected. \"Well, play for her,\u201dEsme encouraged. \"You just said showing off was rude,\u201dHe objected. \"There are exceptions to every rule,\" she replied. \"I'd like to hear you play,\" I volunteered. \"It's settled then.\u201dEsme pushed him toward the piano. He pulled me along, sitting me on the bench beside him. He gave me a long, exasperated look before he turned to the keys. And then his fingers flowed swiftly across the ivory, and the room was filled with a composition so complex, so luxuriant, it was impossible to believe only one set of hands played. I felt my chin drop, my mouth open in astonishment, and heard low chuckles behind me at my reaction. Edward looked at me casually, the music still surging around us without a break, and winked. \"Do you like it?\" \"You wrote this?\" I gasped, understanding. He nodded. \"It's Esme's favorite.\" I closed my eyes, shaking my head. \"What's wrong?\" \"I'm feeling extremely insignificant.\" The music slowed, transforming into something softer, and to my surprise I detected the melody of his lullaby weaving through the profusion of notes. \"You inspired this one,\u201dHe said softly. The music grew unbearably sweet. I couldn't speak. \"They like you, you know,\u201dHe said conversationally. \"Esme especially.\" I glanced behind me, but the huge room was empty now. \"Where did they go?\" \"Very subtly giving us some privacy, I suppose.\" I sighed. \"They like me. But Rosalie and Emmett\u2026\" I trailed off, not sure how to express my doubts. He frowned. \"Don't worry about Rosalie,\u201dHe said, his eyes wide and persuasive. \"She'll come around.\" I pursed my lips skeptically. \"Emmett?\" \"Well, he thinks I'm a lunatic, it's true, but he doesn't have a problem with you. He's trying to reason with Rosalie.\" \"What is it that upsets her?\" I wasn't sure if I wanted to know the answer. He sighed deeply. \"Rosalie struggles the most with\u2026 with what we are.\u00a0 It's hard for her to have someone on the outside know the truth. And she's a little jealous.\" \"Rosalie is jealous of me?\" I asked incredulously. I tried to imagine a universe in which someone as breathtaking as Rosalie would have any possible reason to feel jealous of someone like me. \"You're human.\u201dHe shrugged. \"She wishes that she were, too.\" \"Oh,\" I muttered, still stunned. \"Even Jasper, though\u2026\" \"That's really my fault,\u201dHe said. \"I told you he was the most recent to try our way of life. I warned him to keep his distance.\" I thought about the reason for that, and shuddered. \"Esme and Carlisle\u2026 ?\" I continued quickly, to keep him from noticing. \"Are happy to see me happy. Actually, Esme wouldn't care if you had a third eye and webbed feet. All this time she's been worried about me, afraid that there was something missing from my essential makeup, that I was too young when Carlisle changed me\u2026 She's ecstatic. Every time I touch you, she just about chokes with satisfaction.\" \"Alice seems very\u2026 enthusiastic.\" \"Alice has her own way of looking at things,\u201dHe said through tight lips. \"And you're not going to explain that, are you?\" A moment of wordless communication passed between us. He realized that I knew he was keeping something from me. I realized that he wasn't going to give anything away. Not now. \"So what was Carlisle telling you before?\" His eyebrows pulled together. \"You noticed that, did you?\" I shrugged. \"Of course.\" He looked at me thoughtfully for a few seconds before answering. \"He wanted to tell me some news \u2014 he didn't know if it was something I would share with you.\" \"Will you?\" \"I have to, because I'm going to be a little\u2026 overbearingly protective over the next few days \u2014 or weeks \u2014 and I wouldn't want you to think I'm naturally a tyrant.\" \"What's wrong?\" \"Nothing's wrong, exactly. Alice just sees some visitors coming soon. They know we're here, and they're curious.\" \"Visitors?\" \"Yes\u2026 well, they aren't like us, of course \u2014 in their hunting habits, I mean. They probably won't come into town at all, but I'm certainly not going to let you out of my sight till they're gone.\" I shivered. \"Finally, a rational response!\u201dHe murmured. \"I was beginning to think you had no sense of self-preservation at all.\" I let that one pass, looking away, my eyes wandering again around the spacious room. He followed my gaze. \"Not what you expected, is it?\u201dHe asked, his voice smug. \"No,\" I admitted. \"No coffins, no piled skulls in the corners; I don't even think we have cobwebs\u2026 what a disappointment this must be for you,\u201dHe continued slyly. I ignored his teasing. \"It's so light\u2026 so open.\" He was more serious when he answered. \"It's the one place we never have to hide.\" ,  The song he was still playing, my song, drifted to an end, the final chords shifting to a more melancholy key. The last note hovered poignantly in the silence. \"Thank you,\" I murmured. I realized there were tears in my eyes. I dabbed at them, embarrassed. He touched the corner of my eye, trapping one I missed. He lifted his finger, examining the drop of moisture broodingly. Then, so quickly I couldn't be positive that he really did, he put his finger to his mouth to taste it. I looked at him questioningly, and he gazed back for a long moment before he finally smiled. \"Do you want to see the rest of the house?\" \"No coffins?\" I verified, the sarcasm in my voice not entirely masking the slight but genuine anxiety I felt. He laughed, taking my hand, leading me away from the piano. \"No coffins,\u201dHe promised. We walked up the massive staircase, my hand trailing along the satin-smooth rail. The long hall at the top of the stairs was paneled with a honey-colored wood, the same as the floorboards. \"Rosalie and Emmett's room\u2026 Carlisle's office\u2026 Alice's room\u2026\u201dHe gestured as he led me past the doors. He would have continued, but I stopped dead at the end of the hall, staring incredulously at the ornament hanging on the wall above my head. Edward chuckled at my bewildered expression. \"You can laugh,\u201dHe said. \"It is sort of ironic.\" I didn't laugh. My hand raised automatically, one finger extended as if to touch the large wooden cross, its dark patina contrasting with the lighter tone of the wall. I didn't touch it, though I was curious if the aged wood would feel as silky as it looked. \"It must be very old,\" I guessed. He shrugged. \"Early sixteen-thirties, more or less.\" I looked away from the cross to stare at him. \"Why do you keep this here?\" I wondered. \"Nostalgia. It belonged to Carlisle's father.\" \"He collected antiques?\" I suggested doubtfully. \"No. He carved this himself. It hung on the wall above the pulpit in the vicarage where he preached.\" I wasn't sure if my face betrayed my shock, but I returned to gazing at the simple, ancient cross, just in case. I quickly did the mental math; the cross was over three hundred and seventy years old. The silence stretched on as I struggled to wrap my mind around the concept of so many years. \"Are you all right?\u201dHe sounded worried. \"How old is Carlisle?\" I asked quietly, ignoring his question, still staring up. \"He just celebrated his three hundred and sixty-second birthday,\u201dEdward said. I looked back at him, a million questions in my eyes. He watched me carefully as he spoke. \"Carlisle was born in London, in the sixteen-forties, he believes. Time wasn't marked as accurately then, for the common people anyway. It was just before Cromwell's rule, though.\" I kept my face composed, aware of his scrutiny as I listened. It was easier if I didn't try to believe. \"He was the only son of an Anglican pastor. His mother died giving birth to him. His father was an intolerant man. As the Protestants came into power, he was enthusiastic in his persecution of Roman Catholics and other religions. He also believed very strongly in the reality of evil. He led hunts for witches, werewolves\u2026 and vampires.\" I grew very still at the word. I'm sure he noticed, but he went on without pausing. \"They burned a lot of innocent people \u2014 of course the real creatures that he sought were not so easy to catch. \"When the pastor grew old, he placed his obedient son in charge of the raids. At first Carlisle was a disappointment; he was not quick to accuse, to see demons where they did not exist. But he was persistent, and more clever than his father. He actually discovered a coven of true vampires that lived hidden in the sewers of the city, only coming out by night to hunt. In those days, when monsters were not just myths and legends, that was the way many lived. \"The people gathered their pitchforks and torches, of course\" \u2014 his brief laugh was darker now \u2014 \"and waited where Carlisle had seen the monsters exit into the street. Eventually one emerged.\" His voice was very quiet; I strained to catch the words. \"He must have been ancient, and weak with hunger. Carlisle heard him call out in Latin to the others when he caught the scent of the mob. He ran through the streets, and Carlisle \u2014 he was twenty-three and very fast \u2014 was in the lead of the pursuit. The creature could have easily outrun them, but Carlisle thinks he was too hungry, so he turned and attacked. He fell on Carlisle first, but the others were close behind, and he turned to defend himself. He killed two men, and made off with a third, leaving Carlisle bleeding in the street.\" He paused. I could sense he was editing something, keeping something from me. \"Carlisle knew what his father would do. The bodies would be burned \u2014 anything infected by the monster must be destroyed. Carlisle acted instinctively to save his own life. He crawled away from the alley while the mob followed the fiend and his victim. He hid in a cellar, buried himself in rotting potatoes for three days. It's a miracle he was able to keep silent, to stay undiscovered. \"It was over then, and he realized what he had become.\" I'm not sure what my face was revealing, but he suddenly broke off. \"How are you feeling?\u201dHe asked. \"I'm fine,\" I assured him. And, though I bit my lip in hesitation, he must have seen the curiosity burning in my eyes. He smiled. \"I expect you have a few more questions for me.\" \"A few.\" His smile widened over his brilliant teeth. He started back down the hall, pulling me along by the hand. \"Come on, then,\u201dHe encouraged. \"I'll show you.\"",

            "en": "7         7. UNHAPPY ENDING Rosalie hesitated in the doorway, her breathtaking face unsure. \u201cOf course,\u201d I replied, my voice an octave high with surprise. \u201cCome on in.\u201d I sat up, sliding to the end of the sofa to make room. My stomach twisted nervously as the one Cullen who did not like me moved silently to sit down in the open space. I tried to come up with a reason why she would want to see me, but my mind was a blank on that point. \u201cDo you mind talking to me for a few minutes?\u201d she asked. \u201cI didn\u2019t wake you or anything, did I?\u201d Her eyes shifted to the stripped bed and back to my couch. \u201cNo, I was awake. Sure, we can talk.\u201d I wondered if she could hear the alarm in my voice as clearly as I could. She laughed lightly, and it sounded like a chorus of bells. \u201cHe so rarely leaves you alone,\u201d she said. \u201cI figured I\u2019d better make the best of this opportunity.\u201d What did she want to say that couldn\u2019t be said in front of Edward? My hands twisted and untwisted around the edge of the comforter. \u201cPlease don\u2019t think I\u2019m horribly interfering,\u201d Rosalie said, her voice gentle and almost pleading. She folded her hands in her lap and looked down at them as she spoke. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ve hurt your feelings enough in the past, and I don\u2019t want to do that again.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Rosalie. My feelings are great. What is it?\u201d She laughed again, sounding oddly embarrassed. \u201cI\u2019m going to try to tell you why I think you should stay human \u2014 why I would stay human if I were you.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d She smiled at the shocked tone of my voice, and then she sighed. \u201cDid Edward ever tell you what led to this?\u201d she asked, gesturing to her glorious immortal body. I nodded slowly, suddenly somber. \u201cHe said it was close to what happened to me that time in Port Angeles, only no one was there to save you .\u201d I shuddered at the memory. \u201cIs that really all he told you?\u201d she asked. \u201cYes,\u201d I said, my voice blank with confusion. \u201cWas there more?\u201d She looked up at me and smiled; it was a harsh, bitter \u2014 but still stunning \u2014 expression. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was more.\u201d I waited while she stared out the window. She seemed to be trying to calm herself. \u201cWould you like to hear my story, Bella? It doesn\u2019t have a happy ending \u2014 but which of ours does? If we had happy endings, we\u2019d all be under gravestones now.\u201d I nodded, though I was frightened by the edge in her voice. \u201cI lived in a different world than you do, Bella. My human world was a much simpler place. It was nineteen thirty-three. I was eighteen, and I was beautiful. My life was perfect.\u201d She stared out the window at the silver clouds, her expression far away. \u201cMy parents were thoroughly middle class. My father had a stable job in a bank, something I realize now that he was smug about \u2014 he saw his prosperity as a reward for talent and hard work, rather than acknowledging the luck involved. I took it all for granted then; in my home, it was as if the Great Depression was only a troublesome rumor. Of course I saw the poor people, the ones who weren\u2019t as lucky. My father left me with the impression that they\u2019d brought their troubles on themselves.  \u00a0\u201cIt was my mother\u2019s job to keep our house \u2014 and myself and my two younger brothers \u2014 in spotless order. It was clear that I was both her first priority and her favorite. I didn\u2019t fully understand at the time, but I was always vaguely aware that my parents weren\u2019t satisfied with what they had, even if it was so much more than most. They wanted more. They had social aspirations \u2014 social climbers, I suppose you could call them. My beauty was like a gift to them. They saw so much more potential in it than I did.  \u00a0\u201cThey weren\u2019t satisfied, but I was. I was thrilled to be me, to be Rosalie Hale. Pleased that men\u2019s eyes watched me everywhere I went, from the year I turned twelve. Delighted that my girlfriends sighed with envy when they touched my hair. Happy that my mother was proud of me and that my father liked to buy me pretty dresses.  \u00a0\u201cI knew what I wanted out of life, and there didn\u2019t seem to be any way that I wouldn\u2019t get exactly what I wanted. I wanted to be loved, to be adored. I wanted to have a huge, flowery wedding, where everyone in town would watch me walk down the aisle on my father\u2019s arm and think I was the most beautiful thing they\u2019d ever seen. Admiration was like air to me, Bella. I was silly and shallow, but I was content.\u201d She smiled, amused at her own evaluation. \u00a0\u201cMy parents\u2019 influence had been such that I also wanted the material things of life. I wanted a big house with elegant furnishings that someone else would clean and a modern kitchen that someone else would cook in. As I said, shallow. Young and very shallow. And I didn\u2019t see any reason why I wouldn\u2019t get these things. \u00a0\u201cThere were a few things I wanted that were more meaningful. One thing in particular. My very closest friend was a girl named Vera. She married young, just seventeen. She married a man my parents would never have considered for me \u2014 a carpenter. A year later she had a son, a beautiful little boy with dimples and curly black hair. It was the first time I\u2019d ever felt truly jealous of anyone else in my entire life.\u201d She looked at me with <em>unfathomable</em> eyes. \u201cIt was a different time. I was the same age as you, but I was ready for it all. I yearned for my own little baby. I wanted my own house and a husband who would kiss me when he got home from work \u2014 just like Vera. Only I had a very different kind of house in mind. . .\u201d It was hard for me to imagine the world that Rosalie had known. Her story sounded more like a fairy tale than history to me. With a slight shock, I realized that this was very close to the world that Edward would have experienced when he was human, the world he had grown up in. I wondered \u2014 while Rosalie sat silent for a moment \u2014 if my world seemed as baffling to him as Rosalie\u2019s did to me? Rosalie sighed, and when she spoke again her voice was different, the wistfulness gone. \u201cIn Rochester, there was one royal family \u2014 the Kings, ironically enough. Royce King owned the bank my father worked at, and nearly every other really profitable business in town. That\u2019s how his son, Royce King the Second\u201d \u2014 her mouth twisted around the name, it came out through her teeth \u2014 \u201csaw me the first time. He was going to take over at the bank, and so he began overseeing the different \u00a0positions. Two days later, my mother conveniently forgot to send my father\u2019s lunch to work with him. I remember being confused when she insisted that I wear my white organza and roll my hair up just to run over to the bank.\u201d Rosalie laughed without humor. \u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t notice Royce watching me particularly. Everyone watched me. But that night the first of the\u00a0 roses came. Every night of our courtship, he sent a bouquet of roses to me. My room was always overflowing with them. It got to the point that I would smell like roses when I left the house. \u201cRoyce was handsome, too. He had lighter hair than I did, and pale blue eyes. He said my eyes were like violets, and then those started showing up alongside the roses. \u00a0\u201cMy parents approved \u2014 that\u2019s putting it mildly. This was everything they\u2019d dreamed of. And Royce seemed to be everything I\u2019d dreamed of. The fairy tale prince, come to make me a princess. Everything I wanted, yet it was still no more than I expected. We were engaged before I\u2019d known him for two months. \u00a0\u201cWe didn\u2019t spend a great deal of time alone with each other. Royce told me he had many responsibilities at work, and, when we were together, he liked people to look at us, to see me on his arm. I liked that, too. There were lots of parties, dancing, and pretty dresses. When you were a King, every door was open for you, every red carpet rolled out to greet you. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a long engagement. Plans went ahead for the most lavish wedding. It was going to be everything I\u2019d ever wanted. I was completely happy. When I called at Vera\u2019s, I no longer felt jealous. I pictured my fair-haired children playing on the huge lawns of the Kings\u2019 estate, and I pitied her.\u201d Rosalie broke off suddenly, clenching her teeth together. It pulled me out of her story, and I realized that the horror was not far off. There would be no happy ending, as she\u2019d promised. I wondered if this was why she had so much more bitterness in her than the rest of them \u2014 because she\u2019d been within reach of everything she\u2019d wanted when her human life was cut short. \u201cI was at Vera\u2019s that night,\u201d Rosalie whispered. Her face was smooth as marble, and as hard. \u201cHer little Henry really was adorable, all smiles and dimples \u2014 he was just sitting up on his own. Vera walked me to the door as I was leaving, her baby in her arms and her husband at her side, his arm around her waist. He kissed her on the cheek when he thought I wasn\u2019t looking. That bothered me. When Royce kissed me, it wasn\u2019t quite the same \u2014 not so sweet somehow. . . . I shoved that thought aside. Royce was my prince. Someday, I would be queen.\u201d It was hard to tell in the moonlight, but it looked like her bone white face got paler. \u201cIt was dark in the streets, the lamps already on. I hadn\u2019t realized how late it was.\u201d  She continued to whisper almost inaudibly. \u201cIt was cold, too. Very cold for late April. The wedding was only a week away, and I was worrying about the weather as I hurried home \u2014 I can remember that clearly. I remember every detail about that night. I clung to it so hard . . . in the beginning. I thought of nothing else. And so I remember this, when so many pleasant memories have faded away completely. . . .\u201d She sighed, and began whispering again. \u201cYes, I was worrying about the weather. . . . I didn\u2019t want to have to move the wedding indoors. . . . \u201cI was a few streets from my house when I heard them. A cluster of men under a broken streetlamp, laughing too loud. Drunk. I wished I\u2019d called my father to escort me home, but the way was so short, it seemed silly. And then he called my name. \u00a0\u201c\u2018Rose!\u2019 he yelled, and the others laughed stupidly. \u201cI hadn\u2019t realized the drunks were so well dressed. It was Royce and some of his friends, sons of other rich men. \u201c\u2018Here\u2019s my Rose!\u2019 Royce shouted, laughing with them, sounding just as stupid. \u2018You\u2019re late. We\u2019re cold, you\u2019ve kept us waiting so long.\u2019\u201d \u201cI\u2019d never seen him drink before. A toast, now and then, at a party. He\u2019d told me he didn\u2019t like champagne. I hadn\u2019t realized that he preferred something much stronger. \u00a0\u201cHe had a new friend \u2014 the friend of a friend, come up from Atlanta. \u201c\u2018What did I tell you, John,\u2019 Royce crowed, grabbing my arm and pulling me closer. \u2018Isn\u2019t she lovelier than all your Georgia peaches?\u2019 \u201cThe man named John was dark-haired and suntanned. He looked me over like I was a horse he was buying. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s hard to tell,\u2019 he drawled slowly. \u2018She\u2019s all covered up.\u2019 \u201cThey laughed, Royce like the rest. \u00a0\u201cSuddenly, Royce ripped my jacket from my shoulders \u2014 it was a gift from him \u2014 popping the brass buttons off. They scattered all over the street. \u201c\u2018Show him what you look like, Rose!\u2019 He laughed again and then he tore my hat out of my hair. The pins wrenched my hair from the roots, and I cried out in pain. They seemed to enjoy that \u2014 the sound of my pain. . . .\u201d Rosalie looked at me suddenly, as if she\u2019d forgotten I was there. I was sure my face was as white as hers. Unless it was green. \u201cI won\u2019t make you listen to the rest,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cThey left me in the street, still laughing as they stumbled away. They thought I was dead. They were teasing Royce that he would have to find a new bride. He laughed and said he\u2019d have to learn some patience first. \u00a0\u201cI waited in the road to die. It was cold, though there was so much pain that I was surprised it bothered me. It started to snow, and I wondered why I wasn\u2019t dying. I was impatient for death to come, to end the pain. It was taking so long. . . . \u00a0\u201cCarlisle found me then. He\u2019d smelled the blood, and come to investigate. I remember being vaguely irritated as he worked over me, trying to save my life. I\u2019d never liked Dr. Cullen or his wife and her brother \u2014 as Edward pretended to be then. It had upset me that they were all more beautiful than I was, especially that the men were. But they didn\u2019t mingle in society, so I\u2019d only seen them once or twice. \u00a0\u201cI thought I\u2019d died when he pulled me from the ground and ran with me \u2014 because of the speed \u2014 it felt like I was flying. I remembered being horrified that the pain didn\u2019t stop. . . . \u00a0\u201cThen I was in a bright room, and it was warm. I was slipping away, and I was grateful as the pain began to dull. But suddenly something sharp was cutting me, my throat, my wrists, my ankles. I screamed in shock, thinking he\u2019d brought me there to hurt me more. Then fire started burning through me, and I didn\u2019t care about anything else. I begged him to kill me. When Esme and Edward returned home, I begged them to kill me, too. Carlisle sat with me. He held my hand and said that he was so sorry, promising that it would end. He told me everything, and sometimes I listened. He told me what he was, what I was becoming. I didn\u2019t believe him. He apologized each time I screamed. \u00a0\u201cEdward wasn\u2019t happy. I remember hearing them discuss me. I stopped screaming sometimes. It did no good to scream. \u201c\u2018What were you thinking, Carlisle?\u2019 Edward said. \u2018Rosalie Hale?\u2019\u201d Rosalie imitated Edward\u2019s irritated tone to perfection. \u201cI didn\u2019t like the way he said my name, like there was something wrong with me. \u201c\u2018I couldn\u2019t just let her die,\u2019 Carlisle said quietly. \u2018It was too much \u2014 too horrible, too much waste.\u2019 \u00a0\u201c\u2018I know,\u2019 Edward said, and I thought he sounded dismissive. It angered me. I didn\u2019t know then that he really could see exactly what Carlisle had seen. \u201c\u2018It was too much waste. I couldn\u2019t leave her,\u2019 Carlisle repeated in a whisper. \u201c\u2018Of course you couldn\u2019t,\u2019 Esme agreed. \u201c\u2018People die all the time,\u2019 Edward reminded him in a hard voice. \u2018Don\u2019t you think she\u2019s just a little recognizable, though? The Kings will have to put up a huge search \u2014 not that anyone suspects the fiend,\u2019 he growled. \u00a0\u201cIt pleased me that they seemed to know that Royce was guilty. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize that it was almost over \u2014 that I was getting stronger and that was why I was able to concentrate on what they were saying. The pain was beginning to fade from my fingertips. \u201c\u2018What are we going to do with her?\u2019 Edward said disgustedly \u2014 or that\u2019s how it sounded to me, at least. \u00a0\u201cCarlisle sighed. \u2018That\u2019s up to her, of course. She may want to go her own way.\u2019 \u201cI\u2019d believed enough of what he\u2019d told me that his words terrified me. I knew that my life was ended, and there was no going back for me. I couldn\u2019t stand the thought of being alone. . . . \u201cThe pain finally ended and they explained to me again what I was. This time I believed. I felt the thirst, my hard skin; I saw my brilliant red eyes. \u201cShallow as I was, I felt better when I saw my reflection in the mirror the first time. Despite the eyes, I was the most beautiful thing I\u2019d ever seen.\u201d She laughed at herself for a moment. \u201cIt took some time before I began to blame the beauty for what had happened to me \u2014 for me to see the curse of it. To wish that I had been . . . well, not ugly, but normal. Like Vera. So I could have been allowed to marry someone who loved me, and have pretty babies. That\u2019s what I\u2019d really wanted, all along. It still doesn\u2019t seem like too much to have asked for.\u201d She was thoughtful for a moment, and I wondered if she\u2019d forgotten my presence again. But then she smiled at me, her expression suddenly triumphant. \u201cYou know, my record is almost as clean as Carlisle\u2019s,\u201d she told me. \u201cBetter than Esme. A thousand times better than Edward. I\u2019ve never tasted human blood,\u201d she announced proudly. She understood my puzzled expression as I wondered why her record was only almost as clean. \u00a0\u201cI did murder five humans,\u201d she told me in a complacent tone. \u201cIf you can really call them human . But I was very careful not to spill their blood \u2014 I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to resist that, and I didn\u2019t want any part of them in me, you see. \u00a0\u201cI saved Royce for last. I hoped that he would hear of his friends\u2019 deaths and understand, know what was coming for him. I hoped the fear would make the end worse for him. I think it worked. He was hiding inside a windowless room behind a door as thick as a bank vault\u2019s, guarded outside by armed men, when I caught up with him. Oops \u2014 seven murders,\u201d she corrected herself. \u201cI forgot about his guards. They only took a second.\u201d \u00a0\u201cI was overly theatrical. It was kind of childish, really. I wore a wedding dress I\u2019d stolen for the occasion. He screamed when he saw me. He screamed a lot that night. Saving him for last was a good idea \u2014 it made it easier for me to control myself, to make it slower \u2014\u201d  She broke off suddenly, and she glanced down at me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said in a chagrined voice. \u201cI\u2019m frightening you, aren\u2019t I?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I lied. \u00a0\u201cI got carried away.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m surprised Edward didn\u2019t tell you more about it.\u201d \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like to tell other people\u2019s stories \u2014 he feels like he\u2019s betraying confidences, because he hears so much more than just the parts they mean for him to hear.\u201d She smiled and shook her head. \u201cI probably ought to give him more credit. He\u2019s really quite decent, isn\u2019t he?\u201d \u201cI think so.\u201d \u00a0\u201cI can tell.\u201d Then she sighed. \u201cI haven\u2019t been fair to you, either, Bella. Did he tell you why? Or was that too confidential?\u201d \u201cHe said it was because I was human. He said it was harder for you to have someone on the outside who knew.\u201d  Rosalie\u2019s musical laughter interrupted me. \u201cNow I really feel guilty. He\u2019s been much, much kinder to me than I deserve.\u201d She seemed warmer as she laughed, like she\u2019d let down some guard that had never been absent in my presence before. \u201cWhat a liar that boy is.\u201d She laughed again. \u00a0\u201cHe was lying?\u201d I asked, suddenly wary. \u201cWell, that\u2019s probably putting it too strongly. He just didn\u2019t tell you the whole story. What he told you was true, even truer now than it was before. However, at the time . . .\u201d She broke off, chuckling nervously. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing. You see, at first, I was mostly jealous because he wanted you and not me.\u201d Her words sent a thrill of fear through me. Sitting there in the silver light, she was more beautiful than anything else I could imagine. I could not compete with Rosalie. \u201cBut you love Emmett . . . ,\u201d I mumbled. She shook her head back and forth, amused. \u201cI don\u2019t want Edward that way, Bella. I never did \u2014 I love him as a brother, but he\u2019s irritated me from the first moment I heard him speak. You have to understand, though . . . I was so used to people wanting me . And Edward wasn\u2019t the least bit interested. It frustrated me, even offended me in the beginning. But he never wanted anyone, so it didn\u2019t bother me long. Even when we first met Tanya\u2019s clan in Denali \u2014 all those females! \u2014 Edward never showed the slightest preference. And then he met you.\u201d She looked at me with confused eyes. I was only half paying attention. I was thinking about Edward and Tanya and all those females, and my lips pressed together in a hard line. \u00a0\u201cNot that you aren\u2019t pretty, Bella,\u201d she said, misreading my expression. \u201cBut it just meant that he found you more attractive than me. I\u2019m vain enough that I minded.\u201d \u201cBut you said \u2018at first.\u2019 That doesn\u2019t still . . . bother you, does it? I mean, we both know you\u2019re the most beautiful person on the planet.\u201d I laughed at having to say the words \u2014 it was so obvious. How odd that Rosalie should need such reassurances. Rosalie laughed, too. \u201cThanks, Bella. And no, it doesn\u2019t really bother me anymore. Edward has always been a little strange.\u201d She laughed again. \u201cBut you still don\u2019t like me,\u201d I whispered. Her smile faded. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d We sat in silence for a moment, and she didn\u2019t seem inclined to go on. \u201cWould you tell me why? Did I do something . . . ?\u201d Was she angry that I\u2019d put her family \u2014 her Emmett \u2014 in danger? Time and time again. James, and now Victoria . . . \u00a0\u201cNo, you haven\u2019t done anything,\u201d she murmured. \u201cNot yet.\u201d I stared at her, perplexed. \u201cDon\u2019t you see, Bella?\u201d Her voice was suddenly more passionate than before, even while she\u2019d told her unhappy story. \u201cYou already have everything . You have a whole life ahead of you \u2014 everything I want.  And you\u2019re going to just throw it away . Can\u2019t you see that I\u2019d trade everything I have to be you? You have the choice that I didn\u2019t have, and you\u2019re choosing wrong !\u201d I flinched back from her fierce expression. I realized my mouth had fallen open and I snapped it shut. She stared at me for a long moment and, slowly, the fervor in her eyes dimmed. Abruptly, she was abashed. \u201cAnd I was so sure that I could do this calmly.\u201d She shook her head, seeming a little dazed by the flood of emotion. \u201cIt\u2019s just that it\u2019s harder now than it was then, when it was no more than vanity.\u201d She stared at the moon in silence. It was a few moments before I was brave enough to break into her reverie. \u201cWould you like me better if I chose to stay human?\u201d She turned back to me, her lips twitching into a hint of a smile. \u201cMaybe.\u201d \u201cYou did get some of your happy ending, though,\u201d I reminded her. \u201cYou got Emmett.\u201d \u201cI got half.\u201d She grinned. \u201cYou know that I saved Emmett from a bear that was mauling him, and carried him home to Carlisle. But can you guess why I stopped the bear from eating him?\u201d I shook my head. \u201cWith the dark curls . . . the dimples that showed even while he was grimacing in pain . . . the strange innocence that seemed so out of place on a grown man\u2019s face . . . he reminded me of Vera\u2019s little Henry. I didn\u2019t want him to die \u2014 so much that, even though I hated this life, I was selfish enough to ask Carlisle to change him for me. \u00a0\u201cI got luckier than I deserved. Emmett is everything I would have asked for if I\u2019d known myself well enough to know what to ask for. He\u2019s exactly the kind of person someone like me needs. And, oddly enough, he needs me, too. That part worked out better than I could have hoped. But there will never be more than the two of us. And I\u2019ll never sit on a porch somewhere, with him gray-haired by my side, surrounded by our grandchildren.\u201d Her smile was kind now. \u201cThat sounds quite bizarre to you, doesn\u2019t it? In some ways, you are much more mature than I was at eighteen. But in other ways . . . there are many things you\u2019ve probably never thought about seriously. You\u2019re too young to know what you\u2019ll want in ten years, fifteen years \u2014 and too young to give it all up without thinking it through. You don\u2019t want to be rash about \u00a0permanent things, Bella.\u201d She patted my head, but the gesture didn\u2019t feel condescending. I sighed. \u201cJust think about it a little. Once it\u2019s done, it can\u2019t be undone. Esme\u2019s made do with us as substitutes . . . and Alice doesn\u2019t remember anything human so she can\u2019t miss it. . . . You will remember, though. It\u2019s a lot to give up.\u201d But more to get in return, I didn\u2019t say aloud.  \u201cThanks, Rosalie. It\u2019s nice to understand . . . to know you better.\u201d \u00a0\u201cI apologize for being such a monster.\u201d She grinned. \u201cI\u2019ll try to behave myself from now on.\u201d I grinned back at her. We weren\u2019t friends yet, but I was pretty sure she wouldn\u2019t always hate me so much. \u201cI\u2019ll let you sleep now.\u201d Rosalie\u2019s eyes flickered to the bed, and her lips twitched. \u201cI know you\u2019re frustrated that he\u2019s keeping you locked up like this, but don\u2019t give him too bad a time when he gets back.  He loves you more than you know. It terrifies him to be away from you.\u201d She got up silently and ghosted to the door. \u201cGoodnight, Bella,\u201d she whispered as she shut it behind herself. \u201cGoodnight, Rosalie,\u201d I murmured a second too late. It took me a long time to fall asleep after that. When I did sleep, I had a nightmare. I was crawling across the dark, cold stones of an unfamiliar street, under lightly falling snow, leaving a trail of blood smeared behind me. A shadowy angel in a long white dress watched my progress with resentful eyes. The next morning, Alice drove me to school while I stared grumpily out the windshield. I was feeling sleep-deprived, and it made the irritation of my imprisonment that much stronger. \u201cTonight we\u2019ll go out to Olympia or something,\u201d she promised. \u201cThat would be fun, right?\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just lock me in the basement,\u201d I suggested, \u201cand forget the sugar coating?\u201d Alice frowned. \u201cHe\u2019s going to take the Porsche back. I\u2019m not doing a very good job. You\u2019re supposed to be having fun.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault,\u201d I muttered. I couldn\u2019t believe I actually felt guilty. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at lunch.\u201d I trudged off to English. Without Edward, the day was guaranteed to be unbearable. I sulked through my first class, well aware that my attitude wasn\u2019t helping anything. When the bell rang, I got up without much enthusiasm. Mike was there at the door, holding it open for me. \u201cEdward hiking this weekend?\u201d he asked sociably as we walked out into the light rain. \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cYou want to do something tonight?\u201d How could he still sound hopeful? \u201cCan\u2019t. I\u2019ve got a slumber party,\u201d I grumbled. He gave me a strange look as he processed my mood. \u00a0\u201cWho are you \u2014\u201d Mike\u2019s question was cut short as a loud, growling roar erupted from behind us in the parking lot. Everyone on the sidewalk turned to look, staring in disbelief as the noisy black motorcycle screeched to a stop on the edge of the concrete, the engine still snarling. Jacob waved to me urgently. \u201cRun, Bella!\u201d he yelled over the engine\u2019s roar. I was frozen for a second before I understood. I looked at Mike quickly. I knew I only had seconds. How far would Alice go to restrain me in public? \u201cI got really sick and went home, okay?\u201d I said to Mike, my voice filled with sudden excitement. \u201cFine,\u201d he muttered. I pecked Mike swiftly on the cheek. \u201cThanks, Mike. I owe you one!\u201d I called as I sprinted away. Jacob revved his engine, grinning. I jumped on the back of his seat, wrapping my arms tightly around his waist. I caught sight of Alice, frozen at the edge of the cafeteria, her eyes sparking with fury, her lip curled back over her teeth. I shot her one pleading glance. Then we were racing across the blacktop so fast that my stomach got lost somewhere behind me. \u201cHold on,\u201d Jacob shouted. I hid my face in his back as he sped down the highway. I knew he would slow down when we hit the Quileute border. I just had to hold on till then. I prayed silently and fervently that Alice wouldn\u2019t follow, and that Charlie wouldn\u2019t happen to see me. . . . It was obvious when we had reached the safe zone. The bike slowed, and Jacob straightened up and howled with laughter. I opened my eyes. \u201cWe made it,\u201d he shouted. \u201cNot bad for a prison break, eh?\u201d \u201cGood thinking, Jake.\u201d \u201cI remembered what you said about the psychic leech not being about to predict what I\u2019m going to do.

            "en": "These violent delights have violent ends And in their triumph die, like fire and powder, Which, as they kiss, consume        These violent delights have violent ends, And in their triumph die, like fire and powder, Which, as they kiss, consume. Romeo and Juliet, Act II, Scene VI PREFACE I FELT LIKE I WAS TRAPPED IN ONE OF THOSE TERRIFYING nightmares, the one where you have to run, run till your lungs burst, but you can't make your body move fast enough. My legs seemed to move slower and slower as I fought my way through the callous crowd, but the hands on the huge clock tower didn't slow. With relentless, uncaring force, they turned inexorably toward the end \u2014the end of everything. But this was no dream, and, unlike the nightmare, I wasn't running for my life; I was racing to save something infinitely more precious. My own life meant little to me today. Alice had said there was a good chance we would both die here. Perhaps the outcome would be different if she weren't trapped by the brilliant sunlight; only I was free to run across this bright, crowded square. And I couldn't run fast enough. So it didn't matter to me that we were surrounded by our extraordinarily dangerous enemies. As the clock began to toll out the hour, vibrating under the soles of my sluggish feet, I knew I was too late\u2014and I was glad something bloodthirsty waited in the wings. For in failing at this, I forfeited any desire to live. The clock tolled again, and the sun beat down from the exact center point of the sky. 1. PARTY I WAS NINETY-NINE POINT NINE PERCENT SURE I WAS dreaming. The reasons I was so certain were that, first, I was standing in a bright shaft of sunlight\u2014the kind of blinding clear sun that never shone on my drizzly new hometown in Forks, Washington\u2014and second, I was looking at my Grandma Marie. Gran had been dead for six years now, so that was solid evidence toward the dream theory. Gran hadn't changed much; her face looked just the same as I remembered it. The skin was soft and withered, bent into a thousand tiny creases that clung gently to the bone underneath. Like a dried apricot, but with a puff of thick white hair standing out in a cloud around it. Our mouths\u2014hers a wizened picker \u2014spread into the same surprised half-smile at just the same time. Apparently, she hadn't been expecting to see me, either. I was about to ask her a question; I had so many\u2014What was she doing here in my dream? What had she been up to in the past six years? Was Pop okay, and had they found each other, wherever they were?\u2014but she opened her mouth when I did, so I stopped to let her go first. She paused, too, and then we both smiled at the little awkwardness. \"Bella!\" It wasn't Gran who called my name, and we both turned to see the addition to our small reunion. I didn't have to look to know who it was; this was a voice I would know anywhere\u2014know, and respond to, whether I was awake or asleep\u2026 or even dead, I'd bet. The voice I'd walk through fire for\u2014or, less dramatically, slosh every day through the cold and endless rain for. Edward. Even though I was always thrilled to see him\u2014 conscious or otherwise\u2014and even though I was almost positive that I was dreaming, I panicked as Edward walked toward us through the glaring sunlight. I panicked because Gran didn't know that I was in love with a vampire\u2014nobody knew that\u2014so how was I supposed to explain the fact that the brilliant sunbeams were shattering off his skin into a thousand rainbow shards like he was made of crystal or diamond? Well, Gran, you might have noticed that my boyfriend glitters. It's just something he does in the sun. Don't worry about it\u2026 What was he doing? The whole reason he lived in Forks, the rainiest place in the world, was so that he could be outside in the daytime without exposing his family's secret. Yet here he was, strolling gracefully toward me\u2014with the most beautiful smile on his angel's face\u2014as if I were the only one here. In that second, I wished that I was not the one exception to his mysterious talent; I usually felt grateful that I was the only person whose thoughts he couldn't hear just as clearly as if they were spoken aloud. But now I wished he could hear me, too, so that he could hear the warning I was screaming in my head. I shot a panicked glance back at Gran, and saw that it was too late. She was just turning to stare back at me, her eyes as alarmed as mine. Edward\u2014still smiling so beautifully that my heart felt like it was going to swell up and burst through my chest\u2014put his arm around my shoulder and turned to face my grandmother. Gran's expression surprised me. Instead of looking horrified, she was staring at me sheepishly, as if waiting for a scolding. And she was standing in such a strange position\u2014one arm held awkwardly away from her body, stretched out and then curled around the air. Like she had her arm around someone I couldn't see, someone invisible\u2026 Only then, as I looked at the bigger picture, did I notice the huge gilt frame that enclosed my grandmother's form. Uncomprehending, I raised the hand that wasn't wrapped around Edward's waist and reached out to touch her. She mimicked the movement exactly, mirrored it. But where our fingers should have met, there was nothing but cold glass\u2026 With a dizzying jolt, my dream abruptly became a nightmare. There was no Gran. That was me. Me in a mirror. Me\u2014ancient, creased, and withered. Edward stood beside me, casting no reflection, excruciatingly lovely and forever\u00a0 seventeen. He pressed his icy, perfect lips against my wasted cheek. \"Happy birthday,\" he whispered. I woke with a start \u2014my eyelids popping open wide\u2014and gasped. Dull gray light, the familiar light of an overcast morning, took the place of the blinding sun in my dream. Just a dream, I told myself. It was only a dream. I took a deep breath, and then jumped again when my alarm went off. The little calendar in the corner of the clock's display informed me that today was September thirteenth. Only a dream, but prophetic enough in one way, at least. Today was my birthday. I was officially eighteen years old. I'd been dreading this day for months. All through the perfect summer\u2014the happiest summer I had ever had, the happiest summer anyone anywhere had ever had, and the rainiest summer in the history of the Olympic Peninsula\u2014this bleak date had lurked in ambush, waiting to spring. And now that it had hit, it was even worse than I'd feared it would be. I could feel it\u2014I was older. Every day I got older, but this was different, worse, quantifiable. I was eighteen.  And Edward never would be. When I went to brush my teeth, I was almost surprised that the face in the mirror hadn't changed. I stared at myself, looking for some sign of impending wrinkles in my ivory skin. The only creases were the ones on my forehead, though, and I knew that if I could manage to relax, they would disappear. I couldn't. My eyebrows stayed lodged in a worried line over my anxious brown eyes. It was just a dream, I reminded myself again. Just a dream\u2026 but also my worst\u00a0 nightmare. I skipped breakfast, in a hurry to get out of the house as quickly as possible. I wasn't entirely able to avoid my dad, and so I had to spend a few minutes acting cheerful. I honestly tried to be excited about the gifts I'd asked him not to get me, but every time I had to smile, it felt like I might start crying. I struggled to get a grip on myself as I drove to school. The vision of Gran\u2014I would not think of it as me\u2014was hard to get out of my head. I couldn't feel anything but despair until I pulled into the familiar parking lot behind Forks High School and spotted Edward leaning motionlessly against his polished silver Volvo, like a marble tribute to some forgotten pagan god of beauty. The dream had not done him justice. And he was waiting there for me, just the same as every other day. Despair momentarily vanished; wonder took its place. Even after half a year with him, I still couldn't believe that I deserved this degree of good fortune. His sister Alice was standing by his side, waiting for me, too. Of course Edward and Alice weren't really related (in Forks the story was that all the Cullen siblings were adopted by Dr. Carlisle Culler and his wife, Esme, both plainly too young to have teenage children), but their skin was precisely the same pale shade, their eyes had the same strange golden tint, with the same deep, bruise-like shadows beneath them. Her face, like his, was also startlingly beautiful. To someone in the know\u2014someone like me\u2014these similarities marked them for what they were. The sight of Alice waiting there\u2014her tawny eyes brilliant with excitement, and a small silver-wrapped square in her hands\u2014made me frown. I'd told Alice I didn't want anything, anything, not gifts or even attention, for my birthday. Obviously, my wishes were being ignored. I slammed the door of my '53 Chevy truck\u2014a shower of rust specks fluttered down to the wet blacktop \u2014and walked slowly toward where they waited. Alice skipped forward to meet me, her pixie face glowing under her spiky black hair. \"Happy birthday, Bella!\" \"Shh!\" I hissed, glancing around the lot to make sure no one had heard her. The last thing I wanted was some kind of celebration of the black event. She ignored me. \"Do you want to open your present now or later?\" she asked eagerly as we made our way to where Edward still waited. \"No presents,\" I protested in a mumble. She finally seemed to process my mood. \"Okay\u2026 later, then. Did you like the scrapbook your mom sent you? And the camera from Charlie?\" I sighed. Of course she would know what my birthday presents were. Edward wasn't the only member of his family with unusual skills. Alice would have \"seen\" what my parents were planning as soon as they'd decided that themselves. \"Yeah. They're great.\" \"I think it's a nice idea. You're only a senior once. Might as well document the\u00a0 experience.\" \"How many times have you been a senior?\" \"That's different.\" We reached Edward then, and he held out his hand for mine. I took it eagerly, forgetting, for a moment, my glum mood. His skin was, as always, smooth, hard, and very cold. He gave my fingers a gentle squeeze. I looked into his liquid topaz eyes, and my heart gave a not-quite-so-gentle squeeze of its own. Hearing the stutter in my heartbeats, he smiled again. He lifted his free hand and traced one cool fingertip around the outside of my lips as he spoke. \"So, as discussed, I am not allowed to wish you a happy birthday, is that correct?\" \"Yes. That is correct.\" I could never quite mimic the flow of his perfect, formal articulation. It was something that could only be picked up in an earlier century. \"Just checking.\" He ran his hand through his tousled bronze hair. \"You might have changed your mind.\u00a0 Most people seem to enjoy things like birthdays and gifts.\" Alice laughed, and the sound was all silver, a wind chime. \"Of course you'll enjoy it. Everyone is supposed to be nice to you today and give you your way, Bella. What's the worst that could happen?\" She meant it as a rhetorical question. \"Getting older,\" I answered anyway, and my voice was not as steady as I wanted it to be. Beside me, Edward's smile tightened into a hard line. \"Eighteen isn't very old,\" Alice said. \"Don't women usually wait till they're twenty-nine to get upset over birthdays?\" \"It's older than Edward,\" I mumbled. He sighed. \"Technically,\" she said, keeping her tone light. \"Just by one little year, though.\" And I supposed\u2026 if I could be sure of the future I wanted, sure that I would get to spend forever with Edward, and Alice and the rest of the Cullens (preferably not as a wrinkled little old lady)\u2026 then a year or two one direction or the other wouldn't matter to me so much. But Edward was dead set against any future that changed me. Any future that made me like him\u2014that made me immortal, too. An impasse, he called it. I couldn't really see Edward's point, to be honest. What was so great about mortality? Being a vampire didn't look like such a terrible thing\u2014not the way the Cullens did it, anyway. \"What time will you be at the house?\" Alice continued, changing the subject. From her expression, she was up to exactly the kind of thing I'd been hoping to avoid. \"I didn't know I had plans to be there.\" \"Oh, be fair, Bella!\" she complained. \"You aren't going to ruin all our fun like that, are you?\" \"I thought my birthday was about what I want.\" \"I'll get her from Charlie's right after school,\" Edward told her, ignoring me altogether. \"I have to work,\" I protested. \"You don't, actually,\" Alice told me smugly. \"I already spoke to Mrs. Newton about it. She's trading your shifts. She said to tell you 'Happy Birthday.'\" \"I\u2014I still can't come over,\" I stammered, scrambling for an excuse. \"I, well, I haven't watched Romeo and Juliet yet for English.\" Alice snorted. \"You have Romeo and Juliet memorized.\" \"But Mr. Berty said we needed to see it performed to fully appreciate it\u2014that's how Shakespeare intended it to be presented.\" Edward rolled his eyes. \"You've already seen the movie,\" Alice accused. \"But not the nineteen-sixties version. Mr. Berty said it was the best.\" Finally, Alice lost the smug smile and glared at me. \"This can be easy, or this can be hard, Bella, but one way or the other\u2014\" Edward interrupted her threat. \"Relax, Alice. If Bella wants to watch a movie, then she can. It's her birthday.\" \"So there,\" I added. \u00a0\"I'll bring her over around seven,\" he continued. \"That will give you more time to set up.\" Alice's laughter chimed again. \"Sounds good. See you tonight, Bella! It'll be fun, you'll see.\" She grinned\u2014the wide smile exposed all her perfect, glistening teeth\u2014then pecked me on the cheek and danced off toward her first class before I could respond. \"Edward, please\u2014\" I started to beg, but he pressed one cool finger to my lips. \"Let's discuss it later. We're going to be late for class.\" No one bothered to stare at us as we took our usual seats in the back of the classroom (we had almost every class together now\u2014it was amazing the favors Edward could get the female administrators to do for him). Edward and I had been together too long now to be an object of gossip anymore. Even Mike Newton didn't bother to give me the glum stare that used to make me feel a little guilty. He smiled now instead, and I was glad he seemed to have accepted that we could only be friends. Mike had changed over the summer\u2014his face had lost some of the roundness, making his cheekbones more prominent, and he was wearing his pale blond hair a new way; instead of bristly, it was longer and gelled into a carefully casual disarray. It was easy to see where his inspiration came from\u2014but Edward's look wasn't something that could be achieved through imitation. As the day progressed, I considered ways to get out of whatever was going down at the Cullen house tonight. It would be bad enough to have to celebrate when I was in the mood to mourn. But, worse than that, this was sure to involve attention and gifts. Attention is never a good thing, as any other accident-prone klutz would agree. No one wants a spotlight when they're likely to fall on their face. And I'd very pointedly asked\u2014well, ordered really\u2014that no one give me any presents this year. It looked like Charlie and Renee weren't the only ones who had decided to overlook that. I'd never had much money, and that had never bothered me. Renee had raised me on a kindergarten teacher's salary. Charlie wasn't getting rich at his job, either\u2014he was the police chief here in the tiny town of Forks. My only personal income came from the three days a week I worked at the local sporting goods store. In a town this small, I was lucky to have a job. Every penny I made went into my microscopic college fund. (College was Plan B. I was still hoping for Plan A, but Edward was just so stubborn about leaving me human\u2026) Edward had a lot of money\u2014I didn't even want to think about how much. Money meant next to nothing to Edward or the rest of the Cullens. It was just something that accumulated when you had unlimited time on your hands and a sister who had an uncanny ability to predict trends in the stock market. Edward didn't seem to understand why I objected to him spending money on me\u2014why it made me uncomfortable if he took me to an expensive restaurant in Seattle, why he wasn't allowed to buy me a car that could reach speeds over fifty-five miles an hour, or why I wouldn't let him pay my college tuition (he was ridiculously enthusiastic about Plan B). Edward thought I was being unnecessarily difficult. But how could I let him give me things when I had nothing to reciprocate with? He, for some <em>unfathomable</em> reason, wanted to be with me. Anything he gave me on top of that just threw us more out of balance. As the day went on, neither Edward nor Alice brought my birthday up again, and I began to relax a little. We sat at our usual table for lunch. A strange kind of truce existed at that table. The three of us\u2014Edward, Alice, and I\u2014sat on the extreme southern end of the table. Now that the \"older\" and somewhat scarier (in Emmett's case, certainly) Cullen siblings had graduated, Alice and Edward did not seem quite so intimidating, and we did not sit here alone. My other friends, Mike and Jessica (who were in the awkward post-breakup friendship phase), Angela and Ben (whose relationship had survived the summer), Eric, Conner, Tyler, and Lauren (though that last one didn't really count in the friend category) all sat at the same table, on the other side of an invisible line. That line dissolved on sunny days when Edward and Alice always skipped school, and then the conversation would swell out effortlessly to include me.  Edward and Alice didn't find this minor ostracism odd or hurtful the way I would have. They barely noticed it. People always felt strangely ill at ease with the Cullens, almost afraid for some reason they couldn't explain to themselves. I was a rare exception to that rule. Sometimes it bothered Edward how very comfortable I was with being close to him. He thought he was hazardous to my health\u2014an opinion I rejected vehemently whenever he voiced it. \u00a0The afternoon passed quickly. School ended, and Edward walked me to my truck as he usually did. But this time, he held the passenger door open for me. Alice must have been taking his car home so that he could keep me from making a run for it. I folded my arms and made no move to get out of the rain. \"It's my birthday, don't I get to drive?\" \"I'm pretending it's not your birthday, just as you wished.\" \"If it's not my birthday, then I don't have to go to your house tonight\u2026\" \"All right.\" He shut the passenger door and walked past me to open the driver's side. \"Happy birthday.\" \"Shh,\" I shushed him halfheartedly. I climbed in the opened door, wishing he'd taken the other offer. Edward played with the radio while I drove, shaking his head in disapproval. \"Your radio has horrible reception.\" I frowned. I didn't like it when he picked on my truck. The truck was great\u2014it had\u00a0 personality. \"You want a nice stereo? Drive your own car.\" I was so nervous about Alice's plans, on top of my already gloomy mood, that the words came out sharper than I'd meant them. I was hardly ever bad-tempered with Edward, and my tone made him press his lips together to keep from smiling. When I parked in front of Charlie's house, he reached over to take my face in his hands. He handled me very carefully, pressing just the tips of his fingers softly against my temples, my cheekbones, my jaw line. Like I was especially breakable. Which was exactly the case\u2014compared with him, at least. \"You should be in a good mood, today of all days,\" he whispered. His sweet breath fanned across my face. \"And if I don't want to be in a good mood?\" I asked, my breathing uneven. His golden eyes smoldered. \"Too bad.\" My head was already spinning by the time he leaned closer and pressed his icy lips against mine. As he intended, no doubt, I forgot all about my worries, and concentrated on remembering how to inhale and exhale. His mouth lingered on mine, cold and smooth and gentle, until I wrapped my arms around his neck and threw myself into the kiss with a little too much enthusiasm. I could feel his lips curve upward as he let go of my face and reached back to unlock my grip on him. Edward had drawn many careful lines for our physical relationship, with the intent being to keep me alive. Though I respected the need for maintaining a safe distance between my skin and his razor-sharp, venom-coated teeth, I tended to forget about trivial things like that when he was kissing me. \"Be good, please,\" he breathed against my cheek. He pressed his lips gently to mine one more time and then pulled away, folding my arms across my stomach. My pulse was thudding in my ears. I put one hand over my heart. It drummed hyperactively under my palm. \u00a0\"Do you think I'll ever get better at this?\" I wondered, mostly to myself. \"That my heart might someday stop trying to jump out of my chest whenever you touch me?\" \"I really hope not,\" he said, a bit smug. I rolled my eyes. \"Let's go watch the Capulets and Montagues hack each other up, all right?\" \"Your wish, my command.\" Edward sprawled across the couch while I started the movie, fast-forwarding through the opening credits. When I perched on the edge of the sofa in front of him, he wrapped his arms around my waist and pulled me against his chest. It wasn't exactly as comfortable as a sofa cushion would be, what with his chest being hard and cold\u2014and perfect\u2014as an ice sculpture, but it was definitely preferable. He pulled the old afghan off the back of the couch and draped it over me so I wouldn't freeze beside his body. \"You know, I've never had much patience with Romeo,\" he commented as the movie started. \"What's wrong with Romeo?\" I asked, a little offended. Romeo was one of my favorite fictional characters. Until I'd met Edward, I'd sort of had a thing for him. \"Well, first of all, he's in love with this Rosaline\u2014don't you think it makes him seem a little fickle? And then, a few minutes after their wedding, he kills Juliet's cousin. That's not very brilliant. Mistake after mistake. Could he have destroyed his own happiness any more thoroughly?\" I sighed. \"Do you want me to watch this alone?\" \"No, I'll mostly be watching you, anyway.\" His fingers traced patterns across the skin of my arm, raising goose bumps. \"Will you cry?\" \"Probably,\" I admitted, \"if I'm paying attention.\" \"I won't distract you then.\" But I felt his lips on my hair, and it was very distracting. The movie eventually captured my interest, thanks in large part to Edward whispering Romeo's lines in my ear\u2014his irresistible, velvet voice made the actor's voice sound weak and coarse by comparison. And I did cry, to his amusement, when Juliet woke and found her new husband dead. \"I'll admit, I do sort of envy him here,\" Edward said, drying the tears with a lock of my hair. \"She's very pretty.\" He made a disgusted sound. \"I don't envy him the girl\u2014just the ease of the suicide,\" he clarified in a teasing tone. \"You humans have it so easy! All you have to do is throw down one tiny vial of plant extracts\u2026\" \"What?\" I gasped. \"It's something I had to think about once, and I knew from Carlisle's experience that it wouldn't be simple. I'm not even sure how many ways Carlisle tried to kill himself in the beginning\u2026 after he realized what he'd become\u2026\" His voice, which had grown serious, turned light again. \"And he's clearly still in excellent health.\" I twisted around so that I could read his face. \"What are you talking about?\" I demanded. \"What do you mean, this something you had to think about once?\" \"Last spring, when you were\u2026 nearly killed\u2026\" He paused to take a deep breath, snuggling to return to his teasing tone. \"Of course I was trying to focus on finding you alive, but part of my mind was making contingency plans. Like I said, it's not as easy for me as it is for a human.\" For one second, the memory of my last trip to Phoenix washed through my head and made me feel dizzy. I could see it all so clearly\u2014the blinding sun, the heat waves coming off the concrete as I ran with desperate haste to find the sadistic vampire who wanted to torture me to death. James, waiting in the mirrored room with my mother as his hostage\u2014or so I'd thought. I hadn't known it was all a ruse. Just as James hadn't known that Edward was racing to save me; Edward made it in time, but it had been a close one. Unthinkingly, my fingers traced the crescent-shaped scar on my hand that was always just a few degrees cooler than the rest of my skin. I shook my head\u2014as if I could shake away the bad memories\u2014and tried to grasp what Edward meant. My stomach plunged uncomfortably. \"Contingency plans?\" I repeated. \"Well, I wasn't going to live without you.\" He rolled his eyes as if that fact were\u00a0\u00a0 childishly obvious. \"But I wasn't sure how to do it\u2014I knew Emmett and Jasper would never help\u2026 so I was thinking maybe I would go to Italy and do something to provoke the Volturi.\" I didn't want to believe he was serious, but his golden eyes were brooding, focused on something far away in the distance as he contemplated ways to end his own life. Abruptly, I was furious. \"What is a Volturi?\" I demanded. \u00a0\"The Volturi are a family,\" he explained, his eyes still remote. \"A very old, very powerful family of our kind. They are the closest thing our world has to a royal family, I suppose. Carlisle lived with them briefly in his early years, in Italy, before he settled in America\u2014do you remember the story?\" \"Of course I remember.\" I would never forget the first time I'd gone to his home, the huge white mansion buried deep in the forest beside the river, or the room where Carlisle\u2014Edward's father in so many real ways\u2014kept a wall of paintings that illustrated his personal history. The most vivid, most wildly colorful canvas there, the largest, was from Carlisle's time in Italy. Of course I remembered the calm quartet of men, each with the exquisite face of a seraph, painted into the highest balcony overlooking the swirling mayhem of color. Though the painting was centuries old, Carlisle\u2014the blond angel\u2014remained unchanged. And I remembered the three others, Carlisle's early acquaintances. Edward had never used the name Volturi for the beautiful trio, two black-haired, one snow white. He'd called them Aro, Caius, and Marcus, nighttime patrons of the arts\u2026 \"Anyway, you don't irritate the Volturi,\" Edward went on, interrupting ray reverie. \"Not unless you want to die\u2014or whatever it is we do.\" His voice was so calm, it made him sound almost bored by the prospect. My anger turned to horror. I took his marble face between my hands and held it very tightly. \"You must never, never, never think of anything like that again!\" I said. \"No matter what might ever happen to me, you are not allowed to hurt yourself!\" \"I'll never put you in danger again, so it's a moot point.\" \"Put me in danger! I thought we'd established that all the bad luck is my fault?\" I was getting angrier.\u00a0 \"How dare you even think like that?\" The idea of Edward ceasing to exist, even if I were dead, was impossibly painful. \"What would you do, if the situation were reversed?\" he asked. \"That's not the same thing.\" He didn't seem to understand the difference. He chuckled. \"What if something did happen to you?\" I blanched at the thought. \"Would you want me to go off myself?\" A trace of pain touched his perfect features. \"I guess I see your point\u2026 a little,\" he admitted. \"But what would I do without you?\" \"Whatever you were doing before I came along and complicated your existence.\" He sighed. \"You make that sound so easy.\" \"It should be. I'm not really that interesting.\" He was about to argue, but then he let it go. \"Moot point,\" he reminded me. Abruptly, he pulled himself up into a more formal posture, shifting me to the side so that we were no longer touching. \"Charlie?\" I guessed. Edward smiled. After a moment, I heard the sound of the police cruiser pulling into the driveway. I reached out and took his hand firmly. My dad could deal with that much. Charlie came in with a pizza box in his hands. \"Hey, kids.\" He grinned at me. \"I thought you'd like a break from cooking and washing dishes for your birthday. Hungry?\" \"Sure. Thanks, Dad.\" Charlie didn't comment on Edward's apparent lack of appetite. He was used to Edward passing on dinner. \"Do you mind if I borrow Bella for the evening?\" Edward asked when Charlie and I were done. I looked at Charlie hopefully. Maybe he had some concept of birthdays as stay-at-home, family affairs\u2014this was my first birthday with him, the first birthday since my mom, Renee, had remarried and gone to live in Florida, so I didn't know what he would expect. \"That's fine\u2014the Mariners are playing the Sox tonight,\" Charlie explained, and my hope disappeared. \"So I won't be any kind of company\u2026 Here.\" He scooped up the camera he'd gotten me on Renee's suggestion (because I would need pictures to fill up my scrap-book), and threw it to me. He ought to know better than that\u2014I'd always been coordination ally challenged. The camera glanced off the tip of my finger, and tumbled toward the floor. Edward snagged it before it could crash onto the linoleum. \"Nice save,\" Charlie noted. \"If they're doing something fun at the Cullens' tonight, Bella, you should take some pictures. You know how your mother gets\u2014she'll be wanting to see the pictures faster than you can take them.\" \"Good idea, Charlie,\" Edward said, handing me the camera. I turned the camera on Edward, and snapped the first picture. \"It works.\" \"That's good. Hey, say hi to Alice for me. She hasn't been over in a while.\" Charlie's mouth pulled down at one corner. \"It's been three days, Dad,\" I reminded him. Charlie was crazy about Alice. He'd become attached last spring when she'd helped me through my awkward convalescence; Charlie would be forever grateful to her for saving him from the horror of an almost-adult daughter who needed help showering. \"I'll tell her.\" \"Okay. You kids have fun tonight.\" It was clearly a dismissal. Charlie was already edging toward the living room and the TV. Edward smiled, triumphant, and took my hand to pull me from the kitchen. When we got to the truck, he opened the passenger door for me again, and this time I didn't argue. I still had a hard time finding the obscure turnoff to his house in the dark. Edward drove north through Forks, visibly chafing at the speed limit enforced by my prehistoric Chevy. The engine groaned even louder than usual as he pushed it over fifty. \"Take it easy,\" I warned him. \"You know what you would love? A nice little Audi coupe. Very quiet, lots of power\u2026\" \"There's nothing wrong with my truck. And speaking of expensive nonessentials, if you know what's good for you, you didn't spend any money on birthday presents.\" \"Not a dime,\" he said virtuously. \"Good.\" \"Can you do me a favor?\" \"That depends on what it is.\" He sighed, his lovely face serious. \"Bella, the last real birthday any of us had was Emmett in 1935. Cut us a little slack, and don't be too difficult tonight. They're all very excited.\" It always startled me a little when he brought up things like that. \"Fine, I'll behave.\" \"I probably should warn you\u2026\" \"Please do.\" \"When I say they're all excited\u2026 I do mean all of them.\" \"Everyone?\" I choked. \"I thought Emmett and Rosalie were in Africa.\" The rest of Forks was under the impression that the older Cullens had gone off to college this year, to Dartmouth, but I knew better. \"Emmett wanted to be here.\" \"But\u2026 Rosalie?\" \"I know, Bella. Don't worry, she'll be on her best behavior.\" I didn't answer. Like I could just not worry, that easy. Unlike Alice, Edward's other \"adopted\" sister, the golden blond and exquisite Rosalie, didn't like me much. Actually, the feeling was a little bit stronger than just dislike. As far as Rosalie was concerned, I was an unwelcome intruder into her family's secret life. I felt horribly guilty about the present situation, guessing that Rosalie and Emmett's prolonged absence was my fault, even as I furtively enjoyed not having to see her Emmett, Edward's playful bear of a brother, I did miss. He was in many ways just like the big brother I'd always wanted\u2026 only much, much more terrifying. Edward decided to change the subject. \"So, if you won't let me get you the Audi, isn't there anything that you'd like for your birthday?\" The words came out in a whisper. \"You know what I want.\" A deep frown carved creases into his marble forehead. He obviously wished he'd stuck to the subject of Rosalie. It felt like we'd had this argument a lot today. \"Not tonight, Bella. Please.\" \"Well, maybe Alice will give me what I want.\" Edward growled\u2014a deep, menacing sound. \"This isn't going to be your last birthday, Bella,\" he vowed. \"That's not fair!\" I thought I heard his teeth clench together. We were pulling up to the house now. Bright light shined from every window on the first two floors. A long line of glowing Japanese lanterns hung from the porch eaves, reflecting a soft radiance on the huge cedars that surrounded the house. Big bowls of flowers\u2014pink roses\u2014lined the wide stairs up to the front doors. I moaned. Edward took a few deep breaths to calm himself. \"This is a party,\" he reminded me. \"Try to be a good sport.\" \"Sure,\" I muttered. He came around to get my door, and offered me his hand. \"I have a question.\" He waited warily. \"If I develop this film,\" I said, toying with the camera in my hands, \"will you show up in the picture?\" Edward started laughing. He helped me out of the car, pulled me up the stairs, and was still laughing as he opened the door for me. They were all waiting in the huge white living room; when I walked through the door, they greeted me with a loud chorus of \"Happy birthday, Bella!\" while I blushed and looked down. Alice, I assumed, had covered every flat surface with pink candles and dozens of crystal bowls filled with hundreds of roses. There was a table with a white cloth draped over it next to Edward's grand piano, holding a pink birthday cake, more roses, a stack of glass plates, and a small pile of silver-wrapped presents. It was a hundred times worse than I'd imagined. Edward, sensing my distress, wrapped an encouraging arm around my waist and kissed the top of my head. Edward's parents, Carlisle and Esme\u2014impossibly youthful and lovely as ever\u2014were the closest to the door. Esme hugged me carefully, her soft, caramel-colored hair brushing against my cheek as she kissed my forehead, and then Carlisle put his arm around my shoulders. \"Sorry about this, Bella,\" he stage-whispered. \"We couldn't rein Alice in.\" Rosalie and Emmett stood behind them. Rosalie didn't smile, but at least she didn't glare. Emmett's face was stretched into a huge grin. It had been months since I'd seen them; I'd forgotten how gloriously beautiful Rosalie was\u2014it almost hurt to look at her. And had Emmett always been so\u2026 big? \"You haven't changed at all,\" Emmett said with mock disappointment. \"I expected a perceptible difference, but here you are, red-faced just like always.\" \"Thanks a lot, Emmett,\" I said, blushing deeper. He laughed, \"I have to step out for a second\"\u2014he paused to wink conspicuously at Alice\u2014\"Don't do anything funny while I'm gone.\" \"I'll try.\" Alice let go of Jasper's hand and skipped forward, all her teeth sparkling in the bright light. Jasper smiled, too, but kept his distance. He leaned, long and blond, against the post at the foot of the stairs. During the days we'd had to spend cooped up together in Phoenix, I'd thought he'd gotten over his aversion to me. But he'd gone back to exactly how he'd acted before\u2014avoiding me as much as possible\u2014the moment he was free from that temporary obligation to protect me. I knew it wasn't personal, just a precaution, and I tried not to be overly sensitive about it. Jasper had more trouble sticking to the Cullens' diet than the rest of them; the scent of human blood was much harder for him to resist than the others\u2014he hadn't been trying as long. \"Time to open presents,\" Alice declared. She put her cool hand under my elbow and towed me to the table with the cake and the shiny packages. I put on my best martyr face. \"Alice, I know I told you I didn't want anything\u2014\" \"But I didn't listen,\" she interrupted, smug. \"Open it.\" She took the camera from my hands and replaced it with a big, square silver box. The box was so light that it felt empty. The tag on top said that it was from Emmett, Rosalie, and Jasper. Self-consciously, I tore the paper off and then stared at the box it concealed. It was something electrical, with lots of numbers in the name. I opened the box, hoping for further illumination. But the box was empty. \"Um\u2026 thanks.\" Rosalie actually cracked a smile. Jasper laughed. \"It's a stereo for your truck,\" he explained. \"Emmett's installing it right now so that you can't return it.\" Alice was always one step ahead of me. \"Thanks, Jasper, Rosalie,\" I told them, grinning as I remembered Edward's complaints about my radio this afternoon\u2014all a setup, apparently. \"Thanks, Emmett!\" I called more loudly. I heard his booming laugh from my truck, and I couldn't help laughing, too. \"Open mine and Edward's next,\" Alice said, so excited her voice was a high-pitched trill. She held a small, flat square in her hand. I turned to give Edward a basilisk glare. \"You promised.\" Before he could answer, Emmett bounded through the door. \"Just in time!\" he crowed. He pushed in behind Jasper, who had also drifted closer than usual to get a good look. \"I didn't spend a dime,\" Edward assured me. He brushed a strand of hair from my face, leaving my skin tingling from his touch. I inhaled deeply and turned to Alice. \"Give it to me,\" I sighed. Emmett chuckled with delight. I took the little package, rolling my eyes at Edward while I stuck my finger under the edge of the paper and jerked it under the tape. \"Shoot,\" I muttered when the paper sliced my finger; I pulled it out to examine the damage. A single drop of blood oozed from the tiny cut. It all happened very quickly then. \"No!\" Edward roared. He threw himself at me, flinging me back across the table. It fell, as I did, scattering the cake and the presents, the flowers and the plates. I landed in the mess of shattered crystal. Jasper slammed into Edward, and the sound was like the crash of boulders in a rock slide. There was another noise, a grisly snarling that seemed to be coming from deep in Jasper's chest. Jasper tried to shove past Edward, snapping his teeth just inches from Edward's face. Emmett grabbed Jasper from behind in the next second, locking him into his massive steel grip, but Jasper struggled on, his wild, empty eyes focused only on me. Beyond the shock, there was also pain. I'd tumbled down to the floor by the piano, with my arms thrown out instinctively to catch my fall, into the jagged shards of glass. Only now did I feel the searing, stinging pain that ran from my wrist to the crease inside my elbow. Dazed and disoriented, I looked up from the bright red blood pulsing out of my arm\u2014into the fevered eyes of the six suddenly ravenous vampires.",

            "en": "2-2songngu        2. STITCHES CARLISLE WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO STAYED calm. Centuries of\u00a0 experience in the emergency room were evident in his quiet, authoritative voice. \"Emmett, Rose, get Jasper outside.\" Unsmiling for once, Emmett nodded. \"Come on, Jasper.\" Jasper struggled against Emmett's unbreakable grasp, twisting around, reaching toward his brother with his bared teeth, his eyes still past reason. Edward's face was whiter than bone as he wheeled to crouch over me, taking a clearly defensive position. A low warning growl slid from between his clenched teeth. I could tell that he wasn't breathing. Rosalie, her divine face strangely smug, stepped in front of Jasper\u2014keeping a careful distance from his teeth\u2014and helped Emmett wrestle him through the glass door that Esme held open, one hand pressed over her mouth and nose. Esme's heart-shaped face was ashamed. \"I'm so sorry, Bella,\" she cried as she followed the others into the yard. \"Let me by, Edward,\" Carlisle murmured. A second passed, and then Edward nodded slowly and relaxed his stance. Carlisle knelt beside me, leaning close to examine my arm. I could feel the shock frozen on my face, and I tried to compose it. \"Here, Carlisle,\" Alice said, handing him a towel. He shook his head. \"Too much glass in the wound.\" He reached over and ripped a long, thin scrap from the bottom of the white tablecloth. He twisted it around my arm above the elbow to form a tourniquet. The smell of the blood was making me dizzy. My ears rang. \"Bella,\" Carlisle said softly. \"Do you want me to drive you to the hospital, or would you like me to take care of it here?\" \"Here, please,\" I whispered. If he took me to the hospital, there would be no way to keep this from Charlie. \"I'll get your bag,\" Alice said. \"Let's take her to the kitchen table,\" Carlisle said to Edward. Edward lifted me effortlessly, while Carlisle kept the pressure steady on my arm. \"How are you doing, Bella?\" Carlisle asked. \"I'm fine.\" My voice was reasonably steady, which pleased me. Edward's face was like stone. Alice was there. Carlisle's black bag was already on the table, a small but brilliant desk light plugged into the wall. Edward sat me gently into a chair, and Carlisle pulled up another. He went to work at once. Edward stood over me, still protective, still not breathing. \"Just go, Edward,\" I sighed. \"I can handle it,\" he insisted. But his jaw was rigid; his eyes burned with the intensity of the thirst he fought, so much worse for him than it was for the others. \"You don't need to be a hero,\" I said. \"Carlisle can fix me up without your help. Get some fresh air.\" I winced as Carlisle did something to my arm that stung. \"I'll stay,\" he said. \"Why are you so masochistic?\" I mumbled. Carlisle decided to intercede. \"Edward, you may as well go find Jasper before he gets too far. I'm sure he's upset with himself, and I doubt he'll listen to anyone but you right now.\" \"Yes,\" I eagerly agreed. \"Go find Jasper.\" \"You might as well do something useful,\" Alice added. Edward's eyes narrowed as we ganged up on him, but, finally, he nodded once and sprinted smoothly through the kitchen's back door. I was sure he hadn't taken a breath since I'd sliced my finger. A numb, dead feeling was spreading through my arm. Though it erased the sting, it reminded me of the gash, and I watched Carlisle's face carefully to distract me from what his hands were doing. His hair gleamed gold in the bright light as he bent over my arm. I could feel the faint stirrings of unease in the pit of my stomach, but I was determined not to let my usual squeamishness get the best of me. There was no pain now, just a gentle tugging sensation that I tried to ignore. No reason to get sick like a baby. If she hadn't been in my line of sight, I wouldn't have noticed Alice give up and steal out of the room. With a tiny, apologetic smile on her lips, she disappeared through the kitchen doorway. \"Well, that's everyone,\" I sighed. \"I can clear a room, at least.\" \"It's not your fault,\" Carlisle comforted me with a chuckle. \"It could happen to anyone.\" \"Could\" I repeated. \"But it usually just happens to me.\" He laughed again. His relaxed calm was only more amazing set in direct contrast with everyone else's reaction. I couldn't find any trace of anxiety in his face. He worked with quick, sure movements. The only sound besides our quiet breathing was the soft plink, plink as the tiny fragments of glass dropped one by one to the table. \"How can you do this?\" I demanded. \"Even Alice and Esme\u2026\" I trailed off, shaking my head in wonder. Though the rest of them had given up the traditional diet of vampires just as absolutely as Carlisle had, he was the only one who could bear the smell of my blood without suffering from the intense temptation. Clearly, this was much more difficult than he made it seem. \"Years and years of practice,\" he told me. \"I barely notice the scent anymore.\" \"Do you think it would be harder if you took a vacation from the hospital for a long time. And weren't around any blood?\" \"Maybe.\" He shrugged his shoulders, but his hands remained steady. \"I've never felt the need for an extended holiday.\" He flashed a brilliant smile in my direction. \"I enjoy my work too much.\" Plink, plink, plink. I was surprised at how much glass there seemed to be in my arm. I was tempted to glance at the growing pile, just to check the size, but I knew that idea would not be helpful to my no-vomiting strategy. \"What is it that you enjoy?\" I wondered. It didn't make sense to me\u2014the years of struggle and self-denial he must have spent to get to the point where he could endure this so easily. Besides, I wanted to keep him talking; the conversation kept my mind off the queasy feeling in my stomach. His dark eyes were calm and thoughtful as he answered. \"Hmm. What I enjoy the very most is when my\u2026 enhanced abilities let me save someone who would otherwise have been lost. It's pleasant knowing that, thanks to what I can do, some people's lives are better because I exist. Even the sense of smell is a useful diagnostic tool at times.\" One side of his mouth pulled up in half a smile. I mulled that over while he poked around, making sure all the glass splinters were gone. Then he rummaged in his bag for new tools, and I tried not to picture a needle and thread. \"You try very hard to make up for something that was never your fault,\" I suggested while a new kind of tugging started at the edges of my skin. \"What I mean is, it's not like you asked for this. You didn't choose this kind of life, and yet you have to work so hard to be good.\" \"I don't know that I'm making up for anything,\" he disagreed lightly. \"Like everything in life, I just had to decide what to do with what I was given.\" \"That makes it sound too easy.\" He examined my arm again. \"There,\" he said, snipping a thread. \"All done.\" He wiped an oversized Q-tip, dripping with some syrup-colored liquid, thoroughly across the operation site. The smell was strange; it made my head spin. The syrup stained my skin. \"In the beginning, though,\" I pressed while he taped another long piece of gauze securely in place, sealing it to my skin. \"Why did you even think to try a different way than the obvious one?\" His lips turned up in a private smile. \"Hasn't Edward told you this story?\" \"Yes. But I'm trying to understand what you were thinking\u2026\" His face was suddenly serious again, and I wondered if his thoughts had gone to the same place that mine had. Wondering what I would be thinking when\u2014I refused to think if\u2014it was me. n\u1ebfu \"You know my father was a clergyman,\" he mused as he cleaned the table carefully, rubbing everything down with wet gauze, and then doing it again. The smell of alcohol burned in my nose. \"He had a rather harsh view of the world, which I was already beginning to question before the time that I changed.\" Carlisle put all the dirty gauze and the glass slivers into an empty crystal bowl. I didn't understand what he was doing, even when he lit the match. Then he threw it onto the alcohol-soaked fibers, and the sudden blaze made me jump. \"Sorry,\" he apologized. \"That ought to do it\u2026 So I didn't agree with my father's particular brand of faith. But never, in the nearly four hundred years now since I was born, have I ever seen anything to make me doubt whether God exists in some form or the other. Not even the reflection in the mirror.\" I pretended to examine the dressing on my arm to hide my surprise at the direction our conversation had taken. Religion was the last thing I expected, all things considered. My own life was fairly devoid of belief. Charlie considered himself a Lutheran, because that's what his parents had been, but Sundays he worshipped by the river with a fishing pole in his hand. Renee tried out a church now and then, but, much like her brief affairs with tennis, pottery, yoga, and French classes, she moved on by the time I was aware of her newest fad.  \"I'm sure all this sounds a little bizarre, coming from a vampire.\" He grinned, knowing how their casual use of that word never failed to shock me. \"But I'm hoping that there is still a point to this life, even for us.\u00a0 It's a long shot, I'll admit,\" he continued in an offhand voice. \"By all accounts, we're damned regardless. But I hope, maybe foolishly, that we'll get some measure of credit for trying.\" \"I don't think that's foolish,\" I mumbled. I couldn't imagine anyone, deity included, who wouldn't be impressed by Carlisle. Besides, the only kind of heaven I could appreciate would have to include Edward. \"And I don't think anyone else would, either.\" \"Actually, you're the very first one to agree with me.\" \"The rest of them don't feel the same?\" I asked, surprised, thinking of only one person in particular. Carlisle guessed the direction of my thoughts again. \"Edward's with me up to a point. God and heaven exist\u2026 and so does hell. But he doesn't believe there is an afterlife for our kind.\" Carlisle's voice was very soft; he stared out the big window over the sink, into the darkness. \"You see, he thinks we've lost our souls.\" I immediately thought of Edward's words this afternoon: unless you want to die\u2014or whatever it is that we do. The light bulb flicked on over my head. \"That's the real problem, isn't it?\" I guessed. \"That's why he's being so difficult about me.\" \u00a0Carlisle spoke slowly. \"I look at my\u2026 son. His strength, his goodness, the brightness that shines out of him\u2014and it only fuels that hope, that faith, more than ever. How could there not be more for one such as Edward?\" I nodded in fervent agreement. \"But if I believed as he does\u2026\" He looked down at me with <em>unfathomable</em> eyes. \"If you believed as he did. Could you take away his soul?\" The way he phrased the question thwarted my answer. If he'd asked me whether I would risk my soul for Edward, the reply would be obvious. But would I risk Edward's soul? I pursed my lips unhappily. That wasn't a fair exchange. \"You see the problem.\" I shook my head, aware of the stubborn set of my chin. Carlisle sighed. \"It's my choice,\" I insisted. \"It's his, too.\" He held up his hand when he could see that I was about to argue. \"Whether he is responsible for doing that to you.\" \"He's not the only one able to do it.\" I eyed Carlisle speculatively. He laughed, abruptly lightening the mood. \"Oh, no! You're going to have to work this out with him.\" But then he sighed. \"That's the one part I can never be sure of. I think, in most other ways, that I've done the best I could with what I had to work with. But was it right to doom the others to this life? I can't decide.\" I didn't answer. I imagined what my life would be like if Carlisle had resisted the temptation to change his lonely existence\u2026 and shuddered. \"It was Edward's mother who made up my mind.\" Carlisle's voice was almost a whisper. He stared unseeingly out the black windows. \"His mother?\" Whenever I'd asked Edward about his parents, he would merely say that they had died long ago, and his memories were vague. I realized Carlisle's memory of them, despite the brevity of their contact, would be perfectly clear. \"Yes. Her name was Elizabeth. Elizabeth Masen. His father, Edward Senior, never regained consciousness in the hospital. He died in the first wave of the influenza. But Elizabeth was alert until almost the very end. Edward looks a great deal like her\u2014she had that same strange bronze shade to her hair, and her eyes were exactly the same color green.\" \"His eyes were green?\" I murmured, trying to picture it. \"Yes\u2026\" Carlisle's ocher eyes were a hundred years away now. \"Elizabeth worried obsessively over her son. She hurt her own chances of survival trying to nurse him from her sickbed. I expected that he would go first, he was so much worse off than she was. When the end came for her, it was very quick. It was just after sunset, and I'd arrived to relieve the doctors who'd been working all day. That was a hard time to pretend\u2014there was so much work to be done, and I had no need of rest. How I hated to go back to my house, to hide in the dark and pretend to sleep while so many were dying. \"I went to check Elizabeth and her son first. I'd grown attached\u2014always a dangerous thing to do considering the fragile nature of humans. I could see at once that she'd taken a bad turn. The fever was raging out of control, and her body was too weak to fight anymore. She didn't look weak, though, when she glared up at me from her cot. \"Save him!' she commanded me in the hoarse voice that was all her throat could manage. \"I'll do everything in my power,' I promised her, taking her hand. The fever was so high, she probably couldn't even tell how unnaturally cold mine felt. Everything felt cold to her skin. \"You must,\" she insisted, clutching at my hand with enough strength that I wondered if she wouldn't pull through the crisis after all. Her eyes were hard, like stones, like emeralds. 'You must do everything in your power. What others cannot do, that is what you must do for my Edward.\" \"It frightened me. She looked it me with those piercing eyes, and, for one instant, I felt certain that she knew my secret. Then the fever overwhelmed her, and she never regained consciousness. She died within an hour of making her demand. \"I'd spent decades considering the idea of creating a companion for myself. Just one other creature who could really know me, rather than what I pretended to be. But I could never justify it to myself\u2014doing what had been done to me. \"There Edward lay, dying. It was clear that he had only hours left. Beside him, his mother, her face somehow not yet peaceful, not even in death.\" Carlisle saw it all again, his memory unburned by the intervening century. I could see it clearly, too, as he spoke\u2014the despair of the hospital, the overwhelming atmosphere of death. Edward burning with fever, his life slipping away with each tick of the clock\u2026 I shuddered again, and forced the picture from my mind. \"Elizabeth's words echoed in my head. How could she guess what I could do? Could anyone really want that for her son? \"I looked at Edward. Sick as he was, he was still beautiful. There was something pure and good about his face. The kind of face I would have wanted my son to have. \"After all those years of indecision, I simply acted on a whim. I wheeled his mother to the morgue first, and then I came back for him. No one noticed that he was still breathing. There weren't enough hands, enough eyes, to keep track of half of what the patients needed. The morgue was empty\u2014of the living, at least. I stole him out the back door, and carried him across the rooftops back to my home. \"I wasn't sure what had to be done. I settled for recreating the wounds I'd received myself, so many centuries earlier in London. I felt bad about that later. It was more painful and lingering than necessary. \"I wasn't sorry, though. I've never been sorry that I saved Edward.\" He shook his head, coming back to the present. He smiled at me. \"I suppose I should take you home now.\" \"I'll do that,\" Edward said. He came through the shadowy dining room, walking slowly for him. His face was smooth, unreadable, but there was something wrong with his eyes\u2014something he was trying very hard to hide. I felt a spasm of unease in my stomach. \"Carlisle can take me,\" I said. I looked down at my shirt; the light blue cotton was soaked and spotted with my blood. My right shoulder was covered in thick pink frosting. \"I'm fine.\" Edward's voice was unemotional. \"You'll need to change anyway. You'd give Charlie a heart attack the way you look. I'll have Alice get you something.\" He strode out the kitchen door again. I looked at Carlisle anxiously. \"He's very upset.\" \"Yes,\" Carlisle agreed. \"Tonight is exactly the kind of thing that he fears the most. You being put in danger, because of what we are.\" \"It's not his fault.\" \"It's not yours, either.\" I looked away from his wise, beautiful eyes. I couldn't agree with that. Carlisle offered me his hand and helped me up from the table. I followed him out into the main room. Esme had come back; she was mopping the floor where I'd fallen\u2014with straight bleach from the smell of it. \"Esme, let me do that.\" I could feel that my face was bright red again. \"I'm already done.\" She smiled up at me. \"How do you feel?\" \"I'm fine,\" I assured her. \"Carlisle sews faster than any other doctor I've had.\" They both chuckled. Alice and Edward came in the back doors. Alice hurried to my side, but Edward hung back, his face indecipherable. \"C'mon,\" Alice said. \"I'll get you something less macabre to wear.\" She found me a shirt of Esme's that was close to the same color mine had been. Charlie wouldn't notice, I was sure. The long white bandage on my arm didn't look nearly as serious when I was no longer spattered in gore. Charlie was never surprised to see me bandaged. \"Alice,\" I whispered as she headed back to the door. \"Yes?\" She kept her voice low, too, and looked at me curiously, her head cocked to the side. \"How bad is it?\" I couldn't be sure if my whispering was a wasted effort. Even though we were upstairs, with the door closed, perhaps he could hear me. Her face tensed. \"I'm not sure yet.\" \"How's Jasper?\" She sighed. \"He's very unhappy with himself. It's all so much more of challenge for him, and he hates feeling weak.\" \"It's not his fault. You'll tell him that I'm not mad at him, not at all, won't you?\" \"Of course.\" Edward was waiting for me by the front door. As I got to the bottom of the staircase, he held it open without a word. \"Take your things!\" Alice cried as I walked warily toward Edward. She scooped up the two packages, one half-opened, and my camera from under the piano, and pressed them into my good arm. \"You can thank me later, when you've opened them.\" Esme and Carlisle both said a quiet goodnight. I could see them stealing quick glances at their impassive son, much like I was. It was a relief to be outside; I hurried past the lanterns and the roses, now unwelcome reminders.  Edward kept pace with me silently. He opened the passenger side for me, and I climbed in without complaint. On the dashboard was a big red ribbon, stuck to the new stereo. I pulled it off, throwing it to the floor. As Edward slid into the other side, I kicked the ribbon under my seat. He didn't look at me or the stereo. Neither of us switched it on, and the silence was somehow intensified by the sudden thunder of the engine. He drove too fast down the dark, serpentine lane. The silence was making me insane. \"Say something,\" I finally begged as he turned onto the freeway. \"What do you want me to say?\" he asked in a detached voice. I cringed at his remoteness. 'Tell me you forgive me.\" That brought a flicker of life to his face\u2014a flicker of anger. \"Forgive you? For what?\" \"If I'd been more careful, nothing would have happened.\" \"Bella, you gave yourself a paper cut\u2014that hardly deserves the death penalty.\" \"It's still my fault.\" My words opened up the floodgate. \"Your fault? If you'd cut yourself at Mike Newton's house, with Jessica there and Angela and your other normal friends, the worst that could possibly have happened would be what? Maybe they couldn't find you a bandage? If you'd tripped and knocked over a pile of glass plates on your own\u2014without someone throwing you into them\u2014even then, what's the worst? You'd get blood on the seats when they drove you to the emergency room? Mike Newton could have held your hand while they stitched you up\u2014and he wouldn't be righting the urge to kill you the whole time he was there. Don't try to take any of this on yourself, Bella. It will only make me more disgusted with myself.\" \"How the hell did Mike Newton end up in this conversation?\" I demanded. \"Mike Newton ended up in this conversation because Mike Newton would be a hell of a lot healthier for you to be with,\" he growled. \"I'd rather die than be with Mike Newton,\" I protested. \"I'd rather die than be with anyone but you.\" \"Don't be melodramatic, please.\" \"Well then, don't you be ridiculous.\" He didn't answer. He glared through the windshield, his expression black. I racked my brain for some way to salvage the evening. When we pulled up in front of my house, I still hadn't come up with anything. He killed the engine, but his hands stayed clenched around the steering wheel. \"Will you stay tonight?\" I asked. \"I should go home.\" The last thing I wanted was for him to go wallow in remorse. \"For my birthday,\" I pressed. \"You can't have it both ways\u2014either you want people to ignore your birthday or you don't. One or the other.\" His voice was stern, but not as serious as before. I breathed a silent sigh of relief. \"Okay. I've decided that I don't want you to ignore my birthday. I'll see you upstairs.\" I hopped out, reaching back in for my packages. He frowned. \"You don't have to take those.\" \"I want them,\" I responded automatically, and then wondered if he was using reverse psychology. \"No, you don't. Carlisle and Esme spent money on you.\" \"I'll live.\" I tucked the presents awkwardly under my good arm and slammed the door behind me. He was out of the truck and by my side in less than a second. \"Let me carry them, at least.\" he said as he took them away. \"I'll be in your room.\" I smiled. \"Thanks.\" \"Happy birthday,\" he sighed, and leaned down to touch his lips to mine. I reached up on my toes to make the kiss last longer when he pulled away. He smiled my favorite crooked smile, and then he disappeared into the darkness. The game was still on; as soon as I walked through the front door I could hear the announcer rambling over the babble of the crowd. \"Bell?\" Charlie called. \"Hey, Dad,\" I said as I came around the corner. I held my arm close to my side. The slight pressure burned, and I wrinkled my nose. The anesthetic was apparently losing its effectiveness. \"How was it?\" Charlie lounged across the sofa with his bare feet propped up on the arm.  What was left of his curly brown hair was crushed flat on one side. \"Alice went overboard. Flowers, cake, candles, presents\u2014the whole bit.\" \"What did they get you?\" \"A stereo for my truck.\" And various unknowns. \"Wow.\" \"Yeah,\" I agreed. \"Well, I'm calling it a night.\" \"I'll see you in the morning.\" I waved. \"See ya.\" \"What happened to your arm?\" I flushed and cursed silently. \"I tripped. It's nothing.\" \"Bella,\" he sighed, shaking his head. \"Goodnight, Dad.\" I hurried up to the bathroom, where I kept my pajamas for just such nights as these. I shrugged into the matching tank top and cotton pants that I'd gotten to replace the holey sweats I used to wear to bed, wincing as the movement pulled at the stitches. I washed my face one-handed, brushed my teeth, and then skipped to my room. He was sitting in the center of my bed, toying idly with one of the silver boxes. \"Hi,\" he said. His voice was sad. He was wallowing. I went to the bed, pushed the presents out of his hands, and climbed into his lap. \"Hi.\" I snuggled into his stone chest. \"Can I open my presents now?\" \"Where did the enthusiasm come from?\" he wondered. \"You made me curious.\" I picked up the long flat rectangle that must have been from Carlisle and Esme. \"Allow me,\" he suggested. He took the gift from my hand and tore the silver paper off with one fluid movement. He handed the rectangular white box back to me. \"Are you sure I can handle lifting the lid?\" I muttered, but he ignored me. Inside the box was a long thick piece of paper with an overwhelming amount of fine print. It took me a minute to get the gist of the information. \"We're going to Jacksonville?\" And I was excited, in spite of myself. It was a voucher for plane tickets, for both me and Edward. \"That's the idea.\" \"I can't believe it. Renee is going to flip! You don't mind, though, do you? It's sunny, you'll have to stay inside all day.\" \"I think I can handle it,\" he said, and then frowned. \"If I'd had any idea that you could respond to a gift this appropriately, I would have made you open it in front of Carlisle and Esme. I thought you'd complain.\" \"Well, of course it's too much. But I get to take you with me!\" He chuckled. \"Now I wish I'd spent money on your present. I didn't realize that you were capable of being reasonable.\" I set the tickets aside and reached for his present, my curiosity rekindled. He took it from me and unwrapped it like the first one. He handed back a clear CD jewel case, with a blank silver CD inside. \"What is it?\" I asked, perplexed. He didn't say anything; he took the CD and reached around me to put it in the CD player on the bedside table. He hit play, and we waited in silence. Then the music began. I listened, speechless and wide-eyed. I knew he was waiting for my reaction, but I couldn't talk. Tears welled up, and I reached up to wipe them away before they could spill over. \"Does your arm hurt?\" he asked anxiously. \"No, it's not my arm. It's beautiful, Edward. You couldn't have given me anything I would love more. I can't believe it.\" I shut up, so I could listen. It was his music, his compositions. The first piece on the CD was my lullaby. \"I didn't think you would let me get a piano so I could play for you here,\" he explained. \"You're right.\" \"How does your arm feel?\" \"Just fine.\" Actually, it was starting to blaze under the bandage. I wanted ice. I would have settled for his hand, but that would have given me away. \"I'll get you some Tylenol.\" \"I don't need anything,\" I protested, but he slid me off his lap and headed for the door. \"Charlie,\" I hissed. Charlie wasn't exactly aware that Edward frequently stayed over. In fact, he would have a stroke if that fact were brought to his attention. But I didn't feel too guilty for deceiving him.\u00a0\u00a0  It wasn't as if we were up to anything he wouldn't want me to be up to. Edward and his rules\u2026 \"He won't catch me,\" Edward promised as he disappeared silently out the door . . and returned, catching the door before it had swung back to touch the frame. He had the glass from the bathroom and the bottle of pills in one hand. I took the pills he handed me without arguing\u2014I knew I would lose the argument And my arm really was starting to bother me. My lullaby continued, soft and lovely, in the background. \"It's late,\" Edward noted. He scooped me up off the bed with one arm, and pulled the cover back with the other. He put me down with my head on my pillow and tucked the quilt around me. He lay down next to me\u2014on top of the blanket so I wouldn't get chilled\u2014and put his arm over me. I leaned my head against his shoulder and sighed happily. \"Thanks again,\" I whispered. \"You're welcome.\" It was quiet for a long moment as I listened to my lullaby drift to a close. Another song began. I recognized Esme's favorite. \"What are you thinking about?'\" I wondered in a whisper. He hesitated for a second before he told me. \"I was thinking about right and wrong, actually.\" I felt a chill tingle along my spine. \"Remember how I decided that I wanted you to not ignore my birthday?\" I asked quickly, hoping it wasn't too clear that I was trying to distract him. \"Yes,\" he agreed, wary. \"Well, I was thinking, since it's still my birthday, that I'd like you to kiss me again.\" \"You're greedy tonight.\" \"Yes, I am\u2014but please, don't do anything you don't want to do,\" I added, piqued. He laughed, and then sighed. \"Heaven forbid that I should do anything I don't want to do,\" he said in a strangely desperate tone as he put his hand under my chin and pulled my face up to his. The kiss began much the same as usual\u2014Edward was as careful as ever, and my heart began to overreact like it always did. And then something seemed to change. Suddenly his lips became much more urgent, his free hand twisted into my hair and held my face securely to his. And, though my hands tangled in his hair, too, and though I was clearly beginning to cross his cautious lines, for once he didn't stop me. His body was cold through the thin quilt, but I crushed myself against him eagerly. When he stopped it was abrupt; he pushed me away with gentle, firm hands. I collapsed back onto my pillow, gasping, my head spinning. Something tugged at my memory, elusive, on the edges. \"Sorry,\" he said, and he was breathless, too. \"That was out of line.\" \"I don't mind,\" I panted. He frowned at me in the darkness. \"Try to sleep. Bella.\" \"No, I want you to kiss me again.\" \"You're overestimating my self-control.\" \"Which is tempting you more, my blood or my body?\" I challenged. \"It's a tie.\" He grinned briefly in spite of himself, and then was serious again. \"Now. why don't you stop pushing your luck and go to sleep?\" \"Fine,\" I agreed, snuggling closer to him. I really did feel exhausted. It had been a long day in so many ways, yet I felt no sense of relief at its end. Almost as if something worse was coming tomorrow. It was a silly premonition\u2014what could be worse than today?' Just the shock catching up with me, no doubt. Trying to be sneaky about it, I pressed my injured arm against his shoulder, so his cool skin would sooth the burning. It felt better at once. I was halfway asleep, maybe more, when I realized what his kiss had reminded me of: last spring, when he'd had to leave me to throw James off my trail, Edward had kissed me goodbye, not knowing when\u2014or if\u2014we would see each other again. This kiss had the same almost painful edge for some reason I couldn't imagine. I shuddered into unconsciousness, as if I were already having a nightmare.",

            "en": "5          5. BLOOD TYPE I made my way to English in a daze. I didn't even realize when I first walked in that class had already started. \"Thank you for joining us, Miss Swan,\" Mr. Mason said in a disparaging tone. I flushed and hurried to my seat. It wasn't till class ended that I realized Mike wasn't sitting in his usual seat next to me. I felt a twinge of guilt. But he and Eric both met me at the door as usual, so I figured I wasn't totally unforgiven. Mike seemed to become more himself as we walked, gaining enthusiasm as he talked about the weather report for this weekend. The rain was supposed to take a minor break, and so maybe his beach trip would be possible. I tried to sound eager, to make up for disappointing him yesterday. It was hard; rain or no rain, it would still only be in the high forties, if we were lucky. The rest of the morning passed in a blur. It was difficult to believe that I hadn't just imagined what Edward had said, and the way his eyes had looked. Maybe it was just a very convincing dream that I'd confused with reality. That seemed more probable than that I really appealed to him on any level. So I was impatient and frightened as Jessica and I entered the cafeteria. I wanted to see his face, to see if he'd gone back to the cold, indifferent person I'd known for the last several weeks. Or if, by some miracle, I'd really heard what I thought I'd heard this morning. Jessica babbled on and on about her dance plans \u2014 Lauren and Angela had asked the other boys and they were all going together \u2014 completely unaware of my inattention. Disappointment flooded through me as my eyes unerringly focused on his table. The other four were there, but he was absent. Had he gone home? I followed the still-babbling Jessica through the line, crushed. I'd lost my appetite \u2014 I bought nothing but a bottle of lemonade. I just wanted to go sit down and sulk. \"Edward Cullen is staring at you again,\" Jessica said, finally breaking through my abstraction with his name. \"I wonder why he's sitting alone today.\" My head snapped up. I followed her gaze to see Edward, smiling crookedly, staring at me from an empty table across the cafeteria from where he usually sat. Once he'd caught my eye, he raised one hand and motioned with his index finger for me to join him. As I stared in disbelief, he winked. \"Does he mean you?\" Jessica asked with insulting astonishment in her voice. \"Maybe he needs help with his Biology homework,\" I muttered for her benefit. \"Um, I'd better go see what he wants.\" I could feel her staring after me as I walked away. When I reached his table, I stood behind the chair across from him, unsure. \"Why don't you sit with me today?\" he asked, smiling. I sat down automatically, watching him with caution. He was still smiling. It was hard to believe that someone so beautiful could be real. I was afraid that he might disappear in a sudden puff of smoke, and I would wake up. He seemed to be waiting for me to say something. \"This is different,\" I finally managed. \"Well\u2026\" He paused, and then the rest of the words followed in a rush. \"I decided as long as I was going to hell, I might as well do it thoroughly.\" I waited for him to say something that made sense. The seconds ticked by. \"You know I don't have any idea what you mean,\" I eventually pointed out. \"I know.\" He smiled again, and then he changed the subject. \"I think your friends are angry with me for stealing you.\" \"They'll survive.\" I could feel their stares boring into my back. \"I may not give you back, though,\" he said with a wicked glint in his eyes. I gulped. He laughed. \"You look worried.\" \"No,\" I said, but, ridiculously, my voice broke. \"Surprised, actually\u2026 what brought all this on?\" \"I told you \u2014 I got tired of trying to stay away from you. So I'm giving up.\" He was still smiling, but his ocher eyes were serious. \"Giving up?\" I repeated in confusion. \"Yes \u2014 giving up trying to be good. I'm just going to do what I want now, and let the chips fall where they may.\" His smile faded as he explained, and a hard edge crept into his voice. \"You lost me again.\" The breathtaking crooked smile reappeared. \"I always say too much when I'm talking to you \u2014 that's one of the problems.\" \"Don't worry \u2014 I don't understand any of it,\" I said wryly. \"I'm counting on that.\" \"So, in plain English, are we friends now?\" \"Friends\u2026\" he mused, dubious. \"Or not,\" I muttered. He grinned. \"Well, we can try, I suppose. But I'm warning you now that I'm not a good friend for you.\" Behind his smile, the warning was real.  \"You say that a lot,\" I noted, trying to ignore the sudden trembling in my stomach and keep my voice even. \"Yes, because you're not listening to me. I'm still waiting for you to believe it. If you're smart, you'll avoid me.\" \"I think you've made your opinion on the subject of my intellect clear, too.\" My eyes narrowed. He smiled apologetically. \"So, as long as I'm being\u2026 not smart, we'll try to be friends?\" I struggled to sum up the confusing exchange. \"That sounds about right.\" I looked down at my hands wrapped around the lemonade bottle, not sure what to do now. \"What are you thinking?\" he asked curiously. I looked up into his deep gold eyes, became befuddled, and, as usual, blurted out the truth. \"I'm trying to figure out what you are.\" His jaw tightened, but he kept his smile in place with some effort. \"Are you having any luck with that?\" he asked in an offhand tone. \"Not too much,\" I admitted. He chuckled. \"What are your theories?\" I blushed. I had been vacillating during the last month between Bruce Wayne and Peter Parker. There was no way I was going to own up to that. \"Won't you tell me?\" he asked, tilting his head to one side with a shockingly tempting smile. I shook my head. \"Too embarrassing.\" \"That's really frustrating, you know,\" he complained. \"No,\" I disagreed quickly, my eyes narrowing, \"I can't imagine why that would be frustrating at all \u2014 just because someone refuses to tell you what they're thinking, even if all the while they're making cryptic little remarks specifically designed to keep you up at night wondering what they could possibly mean\u2026 now, why would that be frustrating?\" He grimaced. \"Or better,\" I continued, the pent-up annoyance flowing freely now, \"say that person also did a wide range of bizarre things \u2014 from saving your life under impossible circumstances one day to treating you like a pariah the next, and he never explained any of that, either, even after he promised. That, also, would be very non-frustrating.\" \"You've got a bit of a temper, don't you?\" \"I don't like double standards.\" We stared at each other, unsmiling. He glanced over my shoulder, and then, unexpectedly, he snickered. \"What?\" \"Your boyfriend seems to think I'm being unpleasant to you \u2014 he's debating whether or not to come break up our fight.\" He snickered again. \"I don't know who you're talking about,\" I said frostily. \"But I'm sure you're wrong, anyway.\" \"I'm not. I told you, most people are easy to read.\" \"Except me, of course.\" \"Yes. Except for you.\" His mood shifted suddenly; his eyes turned brooding. \"I wonder why that is.\" I had to look away from the intensity of his stare. I concentrated on unscrewing the lid of my lemonade. I took a swig, staring at the table without seeing it. \"Aren't you hungry?\" he asked, distracted. \"No.\" I didn't feel like mentioning that my stomach was already full \u2014 of butterflies. \"You?\" I looked at the empty table in front of him. \"No, I'm not hungry.\" I didn't understand his expression \u2014 it looked like he was enjoying some private joke. \"Can you do me a favor?\" I asked after a second of hesitation. He was suddenly wary. \"That depends on what you want.\" \"It's not much,\" I assured him. He waited, guarded but curious. \"I just wondered\u2026 if you could warn me beforehand the next time you decide to ignore me for my own good. Just so I'm prepared.\" I looked at the lemonade bottle as I spoke, tracing the circle of the opening with my pinkie finger. \"That sounds fair.\" He was pressing his lips together to keep from laughing when I looked up. \"Thanks.\" \"Then can I have one answer in return?\" he demanded. \"One.\" \"Tell me one theory.\" Whoops. \"Not that one.\" \"You didn't qualify, you just promised one answer,\" he reminded me. \"And you've broken promises yourself,\" I reminded him back. \"Just one theory \u2014 I won't laugh.\" \"Yes, you will.\" I was positive about that. He looked down, and then glanced up at me through his long black lashes, his ocher eyes scorching. \"Please?\" he breathed, leaning toward me. I blinked, my mind going blank. Holy crow, how did he do that? \"Er, what?\" I asked, dazed. \"Please tell me just one little theory.\" His eyes still smoldered at me. \"Um, well, bitten by a radioactive spider?\" Was he a hypnotist, too? Or was I just a hopeless pushover? \"That's not very creative,\" he scoffed. \"I'm sorry, that's all I've got,\" I said, miffed. \"You're not even close,\" he teased. \"No spiders?\" \"Nope.\" \"And no radioactivity?\" \"None.\" \"Dang,\" I sighed. \"Kryptonite doesn't bother me, either,\" he chuckled. \"You're not supposed to laugh, remember?\" He struggled to compose his face. \"I'll figure it out eventually,\" I warned him. \"I wish you wouldn't try.\" He was serious again. \"Because\u2026 ?\" \"What if I'm not a superhero? What if I'm the bad guy?\" He smiled playfully, but his eyes were impenetrable. \"Oh,\" I said, as several things he'd hinted fell suddenly into place. \"I see.\" \"Do you?\" His face was abruptly severe, as if he were afraid that he'd accidentally said too much. \"You're dangerous?\" I guessed, my pulse quickening as I intuitively realized the truth of my own words. He was dangerous. He'd been trying to tell me that all along. He just looked at me, eyes full of some emotion I couldn't comprehend. \"But not bad,\" I whispered, shaking my head. \"No, I don't believe that you're bad.\" \"You're wrong.\" His voice was almost inaudible. He looked down, stealing my bottle lid and then spinning it on its side between his fingers. I stared at him, wondering why I didn't feel afraid. He meant what he was saying \u2014 that was obvious. But I just felt anxious, on edge\u2026 and, more than anything else, fascinated. The same way I always felt when I was near him. The silence lasted until I noticed that the cafeteria was almost empty. I jumped to my feet. \"We're going to be late.\" \"I'm not going to class today,\" he said, twirling the lid so fast it was just a blur. \"Why not?\" \"It's healthy to ditch class now and then.\" He smiled up at me, but his eyes were still troubled. \"Well, I'm going,\" I told him. I was far too big a coward to risk getting caught. He turned his attention back to his makeshift top. \"I'll see you later, then.\" I hesitated, torn, but then the first bell sent me hurrying out the door \u2014 with a last glance confirming that he hadn't moved a centimeter. As I half-ran to class, my head was spinning faster than the bottle cap. So few questions had been answered in comparison to how many new questions had been raised. At least the rain had stopped. I was lucky; Mr. Banner wasn't in the room yet when I arrived. I settled quickly into my seat, aware that both Mike and Angela were staring at me. Mike looked resentful; Angela looked surprised, and slightly awed. Mr. Banner came in the room then, calling the class to order. He was juggling a few small cardboard boxes in his arms. He put them down on Mike's table, telling him to start passing them around the class. \"Okay, guys, I want you all to take one piece from each box,\" he said as he produced a pair of rubber gloves from the pocket of his lab jacket and pulled them on. The sharp sound as the gloves snapped into place against his wrists seemed ominous to me. \"The first should be an indicator card,\" he went on, grabbing a white card with four squares marked on it and displaying it. \"The second is a four-pronged applicator \u2014\" he held up something that looked like a nearly toothless hair pick \"\u2014 and the third is a sterile micro-lancet.\" He held up a small piece of blue plastic and split it open. The barb was invisible from this distance, but my stomach flipped. \"I'll be coming around with a dropper of water to prepare your cards, so please don't start until I get to you.\" He began at Mike's table again, carefully putting one drop of water in each of the four squares. \"Then I want you to carefully prick your finger with the lancet\u2026\" He grabbed Mike's hand and jabbed the spike into the tip of Mike's middle finger. Oh no. Clammy moisture broke out across my forehead. \"Put a small drop of blood on each of the prongs.\" He demonstrated, squeezing Mike's finger till the blood flowed. I swallowed convulsively, my stomach heaving. \"And then apply it to the card,\" he finished, holding up the dripping red card for us to see. I closed my eyes, trying to hear through the ringing\u00a0 in my ears. \"The Red Cross is having a blood drive in Port Angeles next weekend, so I thought you should all know your blood type.\" He sounded proud of himself. \"Those of you who aren't eighteen yet will need a parent's permission \u2014 I have slips at my desk.\" He continued through the room with his water drops. I put my cheek against the cool black tabletop and tried to hold on to my consciousness. All around me I could hear squeals, complaints, and giggles as my classmates skewered their fingers. I breathed slowly in and out through my mouth. \"Bella, are you all right?\" Mr. Banner asked. His voice was close to my head, and it sounded alarmed. \"I already know my blood type, Mr. Banner,\" I said in a weak voice. I was afraid to raise my head. \"Are you feeling faint?\" \"Yes, sir,\" I muttered, internally kicking myself for not ditching when I had the chance. \"Can someone take Bella to the nurse, please?\" he called. I didn't have to look up to know that it would be Mike who volunteered.  \"Can you walk?\" Mr. Banner asked. \"Yes,\" I whispered. Just let me get out of here, I thought. I'll crawl. Mike seemed eager as he put his arm around my waist and pulled my arm over his shoulder. I leaned against him heavily on the way out of the classroom. Mike towed me slowly across campus. When we were around the edge of the cafeteria, out of sight of building four in case Mr. Banner was watching, I stopped. \"Just let me sit for a minute, please?\" I begged. He helped me sit on the edge of the walk. \"And whatever you do, keep your hand in your pocket,\" I warned. I was still so dizzy. I slumped over on my side, putting my cheek against the freezing, damp cement of the sidewalk, closing my eyes. That seemed to help a little. \"Wow, you're green, Bella,\" Mike said nervously. \"Bella?\" a different voice called from the distance. No! Please let me be imagining that horribly familiar voice. \"What's wrong \u2014 is she hurt?\" His voice was closer now, and he sounded upset. I wasn't imagining it. I squeezed my eyes shut, hoping to die. Or, at the very least, not to throw up. Mike seemed stressed. \"I think she's fainted. I don't know what happened, she didn't even stick her finger.\" \"Bella.\" Edward's voice was right beside me, relieved now. \"Can you hear me?\" \"No,\" I groaned. \"Go away.\" He chuckled. \"I was taking her to the nurse,\" Mike explained in a defensive tone, \"but she wouldn't go any farther.\" \"I'll take her,\" Edward said. I could hear the smile still in his voice. \"You can go back to class.\" \"No,\" Mike protested. \"I'm supposed to do it.\" Suddenly the sidewalk disappeared from beneath me. My eyes flew open in shock. Edward had scooped me up in his arms, as easily as if I weighed ten pounds instead of a hundred and ten. \"Put me down!\" Please, please let me not vomit on him. He was walking before I was finished talking. \"Hey!\" Mike called, already ten paces behind us. Edward ignored him. \"You look awful,\" he told me, grinning. \"Put me back on the sidewalk,\" I moaned. The rocking movement of his walk was not helping. He held me away from his body, gingerly, supporting all my weight with just his arms \u2014 it didn't seem to bother him.  \"So you faint at the sight of blood?\" he asked. This seemed to entertain him. I didn't answer. I closed my eyes again and fought the nausea with all my strength, clamping my lips together. \"And not even your own blood,\" he continued, enjoying himself.  I don't know how he opened the door while carrying me, but it was suddenly warm, so I knew we were inside. \"Oh my,\" I heard a female voice gasp. \"She fainted in Biology,\" Edward explained. I opened my eyes. I was in the office, and Edward was striding past the front counter toward the nurse's door. Ms. Cope, the redheaded front office receptionist, ran ahead of him to hold it open. The grandmotherly nurse looked up from a novel, astonished, as Edward swung me into the room and placed me gently on the crackly paper that covered the brown vinyl mattress on the one cot. Then he moved to stand against the wall as far across the narrow room as possible. His eyes were bright, excited. \"She's just a little faint,\" he reassured the startled nurse. \"They're blood typing in Biology.\" The nurse nodded sagely. \"There's always one.\" He muffled a snicker. \"Just lie down for a minute, honey; it'll pass.\" \"I know,\" I sighed. The nausea was already fading. \"Does this happen a lot?\" she asked. \"Sometimes,\" I admitted. Edward coughed to hide another laugh. \"You can go back to class now,\" she told him. \"I'm supposed to stay with her.\" He said this with such assured authority that \u2014 even though she pursed her lips \u2014 the nurse didn't argue it further. \"I'll go get you some ice for your forehead, dear,\" she said to me, and then bustled out of the room. \"You were right,\" I moaned, letting my eyes close. \"I usually am \u2014 but about what in particular this time?\" \"Ditching is healthy.\" I practiced breathing evenly. \"You scared me for a minute there,\" he admitted after a pause. His tone made it sound like he was confessing a humiliating weakness. \"I thought Newton was dragging your dead body off to bury it in the woods.\" \"Ha ha.\" I still had my eyes closed, but I was feeling more normal every minute. \"Honestly \u2014 I've seen corpses with better color. I was concerned that I might have to avenge your murder.\" \"Poor Mike. I'll bet he's mad.\" \"He absolutely loathes me,\" Edward said cheerfully. \"You can't know that,\" I argued, but then I wondered suddenly if he could. \"I saw his face \u2014 I could tell.\" \"How did you see me? I thought you were ditching.\" I was almost fine now, though the queasiness would probably pass faster if I'd eaten something for lunch. On the other hand, maybe it was lucky my stomach was empty. \"I was in my car, listening to a CD.\" Such a normal response \u2014 it surprised me. I heard the door and opened my eyes to see the nurse with a cold compress in her hand. \"Here you go, dear.\" She laid it across my forehead. \"You're looking better,\" she added. \"I think I'm fine,\" I said, sitting up. Just a little ringing in my ears, no spinning. The mint green walls stayed where they should. I could see she was about to make me lie back down, but the door opened just then, and Ms. Cope stuck her head in. \"We've got another one,\" she warned. I hopped down to free up the cot for the next invalid. I handed the compress back to the nurse. \"Here, I don't need this.\" And then Mike staggered through the door, now supporting a sallow-looking Lee Stephens, another boy in our Biology class. Edward and I drew back against the wall to give them room. \"Oh no,\" Edward muttered. \"Go out to the office, Bella.\" I looked up at him, bewildered. \"Trust me \u2014 go.\" I spun and caught the door before it closed, darting out of the infirmary. I could feel Edward right behind me. \"You actually listened to me.\" He was stunned. \"I smelled the blood,\" I said, wrinkling my nose. Lee wasn't sick from watching other people, like me. \"People can't smell blood,\" he contradicted. \"Well, I can \u2014 that's what makes me sick. It smells like rust\u2026 and salt.\" He was staring at me with an <em>unfathomable</em> expression. \"What?\" I asked. \"It's nothing.\" Mike came through the door then, glancing from me to Edward. The look he gave Edward confirmed what Edward had said about loathing. He looked back at me, his eyes glum. \"You look better,\" he accused. \"Just keep your hand in your pocket,\" I warned him again. \"It's not bleeding anymore,\" he muttered. \"Are you going back to class?\" \"Are you kidding? I'd just have to turn around and come back.\" \"Yeah, I guess\u2026 So are you going this weekend? To the beach?\" While he spoke, he flashed another glare toward Edward, who was standing against the cluttered counter, motionless as a sculpture, staring off into space. I tried to sound as friendly as possible. \"Sure, I said I was in.\" \"We're meeting at my dad's store, at ten.\" His eyes flickered to Edward again, wondering if he was giving out too much information. His body language made it clear that it wasn't an open invitation. \"I'll be there,\" I promised. \"I'll see you in Gym, then,\" he said, moving uncertainly toward the door.  \"See you,\" I replied. He looked at me once more, his round face slightly pouting, and then as he walked slowly through the door, his shoulders slumped. A swell of sympathy washed over me. I pondered seeing his disappointed face again\u2026 in Gym.  \"Gym,\" I groaned. \"I can take care of that.\" I hadn't noticed Edward moving to my side, but he spoke now in my ear. \"Go sit down and look pale,\" he muttered. That wasn't a challenge; I was always pale, and my recent swoon had left a light sheen of sweat on my face. I sat in one of the creaky folding chairs and rested my head against the wall with my eyes closed. Fainting spells always exhausted me. I heard Edward speaking softly at the counter. \"Ms. Cope?\" \"Yes?\" I hadn't heard her return to her desk. \"Bella has Gym next hour, and I don't think she feels well enough. Actually, I was thinking I should take her home now. Do you think you could excuse her from class?\" His voice was like melting honey. I could imagine how much more overwhelming his eyes would be. \"Do you need to be excused, too, Edward?\" Ms. Cope fluttered. Why couldn't I do that? \"No, I have Mrs. Goff, she won't mind.\" \"Okay, it's all taken care of. You feel better, Bella,\" she called to me. I nodded weakly, hamming it up just a bit. \"Can you walk, or do you want me to carry you again?\" With his back to the receptionist, his expression became sarcastic. \"I'll walk.\" I stood carefully, and I was still fine. He held the door for me, his smile polite but his eyes mocking. I walked out into the cold, fine mist that had just begun to fall. It felt nice \u2014 the first time I'd enjoyed the constant moisture falling out of the sky \u2014 as it washed my face clean of the sticky perspiration. \"Thanks,\" I said as he followed me out. \"It's almost worth getting sick to miss Gym.\" \"Anytime.\" He was staring straight forward, squinting into the rain. \"So are you going? This Saturday, I mean?\" I was hoping he would, though it seemed unlikely. I couldn't picture him loading up to carpool with the rest of the kids from school; he didn't belong in the same world. But just hoping that he might gave me the first twinge of enthusiasm I'd felt for the outing. \"Where are you all going, exactly?\" He was still looking ahead, expressionless. \"Down to La Push, to First Beach.\" I studied his face, trying to read it. His eyes seemed to narrow infinitesimally. He glanced down at me from the corner of his eye, smiling wryly. \"I really don't think I was invited.\" I sighed. \"I just invited you.\" \"Let's you and I not push poor Mike any further this week. We don't want him to snap.\" His eyes danced; he was enjoying the idea more than he should. \"Mike-schmike.\" I muttered, preoccupied by the way he'd said \"you and I.\" I liked it more than I should.  We were near the parking lot now. I veered left, toward my truck. Something caught my jacket, yanking me back. \"Where do you think you're going?\" he asked, outraged. He was gripping a fistful of my jacket in one hand. I was confused. \"I'm going home.\" \"Didn't you hear me promise to take you safely home? Do you think I'm going to let you drive in your condition?\" His voice was still indignant. \"What condition? And what about my truck?\" I complained.  \"I'll have Alice drop it off after school.\" He was towing me toward his car now, pulling me by my jacket. It was all I could do to keep from falling backward. He'd probably just drag me along anyway if I did. \"Let go!\" I insisted. He ignored me. I staggered along sideways across the wet sidewalk until we reached the Volvo. Then he finally freed me \u2014 I stumbled against the passenger door. \"You are so pushy!\" I grumbled. \"It's open,\" was all he responded. He got in the driver's side. \"I am perfectly capable of driving myself home!\" I stood by the car, fuming. It was raining harder now, and I'd never put my hood up, so my hair was dripping down my back. He lowered the automatic window and leaned toward me across the seat. \"Get in, Bella.\" I didn't answer. I was mentally calculating my chances of reaching the truck before he could catch me. I had to admit, they weren't good. \"I'll just drag you back,\" he threatened, guessing my plan. I tried to maintain what dignity I could as I got into his car. I wasn't very successful \u2014 I looked like a half-drowned cat and my boots squeaked. \"This is completely unnecessary,\" I said stiffly. He didn't answer. He fiddled with the controls, turning the heater up and the music down. As he pulled out of the parking lot, I was preparing to give him the silent treatment \u2014 my face in full pout mode \u2014 but then I recognized the music playing, and my curiosity got the better of my intentions. \"Clair de Lune?\" I asked, surprised. \"You know Debussy?\" He sounded surprised, too. \"Not well,\" I admitted. \"My mother plays a lot of classical music around the house \u2014 I only know my favorites.\" \"It's one of my favorites, too.\" He stared out through the rain, lost in thought. I listened to the music, relaxing against the light gray leather seat. It was impossible not to respond to the familiar, soothing melody. The rain blurred everything outside the window into gray and green smudges. I began to realize we were driving very fast; the car moved so steadily, so evenly, though, I didn't feel the speed. Only the town flashing by gave it away. \"What is your mother like?\" he asked me suddenly. I glanced over to see him studying me with curious eyes. \"She looks a lot like me, but she's prettier,\" I said. He raised his eyebrows. \"I have too much Charlie in me. She's more outgoing than I am, and braver. She's irresponsible and slightly eccentric, and she's a very unpredictable cook. She's my best friend.\" I stopped. Talking about her was making me depressed. \"How old are you, Bella?\" His voice sounded frustrated for some reason I couldn't imagine. He'd stopped the car, and I realized we were at Charlie's house already. The rain was so heavy that I could barely see the house at all. It was like the car was submerged under a river. \"I'm seventeen,\" I responded, a little confused. \"You don't seem seventeen.\" His tone was reproachful; it made me laugh. \"What?\" he asked, curious again. \"My mom always says I was born thirty-five years old and that I get more middle-aged every year.\" I laughed, and then sighed. \"Well, someone has to be the adult.\" I paused for a second. \"You don't seem much like a junior in high school yourself,\" I noted. He made a face and changed the subject. \"So why did your mother marry Phil?\" I was surprised he would remember the name; I'd mentioned it just once, almost two months ago. It took me a moment to answer. \"My mother\u2026 she's very young for her age. I think Phil makes her feel even younger. At any rate, she's crazy about him.\" I shook my head. The attraction was a mystery to me. \"Do you approve?\" he asked. \"Does it matter?\" I countered. \"I want her to be happy\u2026 and he is who she wants.\" \"That's very generous\u2026 I wonder,\" he mused. \"What?\" \"Would she extend the same courtesy to you, do you think? No matter who your choice was?\" He was suddenly intent, his eyes searching mine. \"I-I think so,\" I stuttered. \"But she's the parent, after all. It's a little bit different.\" \"No one too scary then,\" he teased. I grinned in response. \"What do you mean by scary? Multiple facial piercings and extensive tattoos?\" \"That's one definition, I suppose.\" \"What's your definition?\" But he ignored my question and asked me another. \"Do you think that I could be scary?\" He raised one eyebrow, and the faint trace of a smile lightened his face. I thought for a moment, wondering whether the truth or a lie would go over better. I decided to go with the truth. \"Hmmm\u2026 I think you could be, if you wanted to.\" \"Are you frightened of me now?\" The smile vanished, and his heavenly face was suddenly serious. \"No.\" But I answered too quickly. The smile returned. \"So, now are you going to tell me about your family?\" I asked to distract him. \"It's got to be a much more interesting story than mine.\" He was instantly cautious. \"What do you want to know?\" \"The Cullens adopted you?\" I verified. \"Yes.\" I hesitated for a moment. \"What happened to your parents?\" \"They died many years ago.\" His tone was matter-of-fact. \"I'm sorry,\" I mumbled. \"I don't really remember them that clearly. Carlisle and Esme have been my parents for a long time now.\" \"And you love them.\" It wasn't a question. It was obvious in the way he spoke of them. \"Yes.\" He smiled. \"I couldn't imagine two better people.\" \"You're very lucky.\" \"I know I am.\" \"And your brother and sister?\" He glanced at the clock on the dashboard. \"My brother and sister, and Jasper and Rosalie for that matter, are going to be quite upset if they have to stand in the rain waiting for me.\" \"Oh, sorry, I guess you have to go.\" I didn't want to get out of the car. \"And you probably want your truck back before Chief Swan gets home, so you don't have to tell him about the Biology incident.\" He grinned at me. \"I'm sure he's already heard. There are no secrets in Forks.\" I sighed. He laughed, and there was an edge to his laughter. \"Have fun at the beach\u2026 good weather for sunbathing.\" He glanced out at the sheeting rain. \"Won't I see you tomorrow?\" \"No. Emmett and I are starting the weekend early.\" \"What are you going to do?\" A friend could ask that, right? I hoped the disappointment wasn't too apparent in my voice. \"We're going to be hiking in the Goat Rocks Wilderness, just south of Rainier.\" I remembered Charlie had said the Cullens went camping frequently. \"Oh, well, have fun.\" I tried to sound enthusiastic. I don't think I fooled him, though. A smile was playing around the edges of his lips. \"Will you do something for me this weekend?\" He turned to look me straight in the face, utilizing the full power of his burning gold eyes. I nodded helplessly. \"Don't be offended, but you seem to be one of those people who just attract accidents like a magnet. So\u2026 try not to fall into the ocean or get run over or anything, all right?\" He smiled crookedly. The helplessness had faded as he spoke.

            "en": "13        13. CONFESSIONS Edward in the sunlight was shocking. I couldn't get used to it, though I'd been staring at him all afternoon. His skin, white despite the faint flush from yesterday's hunting trip, literally sparkled, like thousands of tiny diamonds were embedded in the surface. He lay perfectly still in the grass, his shirt open over his sculpted, incandescent chest, his scintillating arms bare. His glistening, pale lavender lids were shut, though of course he didn't sleep. A perfect statue, carved in some unknown stone, smooth like marble, glittering like crystal. Now and then, his lips would move, so fast it looked like they were trembling. But, when I asked, he told me he was singing to himself; it was too low for me to hear. I enjoyed the sun, too, though the air wasn't quite dry enough for my taste. I would have liked to lie back, as he did, and let the sun warm my face. But I stayed curled up, my chin resting on my knees, unwilling to take my eyes off him. The wind was gentle; it tangled my hair and ruffled the grass that swayed around his motionless form. The meadow, so spectacular to me at first, paled next to his magnificence. Hesitantly, always afraid, even now, that he would disappear like a mirage, too beautiful to be real\u2026 hesitantly, I reached out one finger and stroked the back of his shimmering hand, where it lay within my reach. I marveled again at the perfect texture, satin smooth, cool as stone. When I looked up again, his eyes were open, watching me. Butterscotch today, lighter, warmer after hunting. His quick smile turned up the corners of his flawless lips. \"I don't scare you?\" he asked playfully, but I could hear the real curiosity in his soft voice. \"No more than usual.\" He smiled wider; his teeth flashed in the sun. I inched closer, stretched out my whole hand now to trace the contours of his forearm with my fingertips. I saw that my fingers trembled, and knew it wouldn't escape his notice. \"Do you mind?\" I asked, for he had closed his eyes again. \"No,\" he said without opening his eyes. \"You can't imagine how that feels.\" He sighed. I lightly trailed my hand over the perfect muscles of his arm, followed\u00a0 the faint pattern of bluish veins inside the crease at his elbow. With my other hand, I reached to turn his hand over. Realizing what I wished, he flipped his palm up in one of those blindingly fast, disconcerting movements of his. It startled me; my fingers froze on his arm for a brief second. \"Sorry,\" he murmured. I looked up in time to see his golden eyes close again. \"It's too easy to be myself with you.\" I lifted his hand, turning it this way and that as I watched the sun glitter on his palm. I held it closer to my face, trying to see the hidden facets in his skin. \"Tell me what you're thinking,\" he whispered. I looked to see his eyes watching me, suddenly intent. \"It's still so strange for me, not knowing.\" \"You know, the rest of us feel that way all the time.\" \"It's a hard life.\" Did I imagine the hint of regret in his tone? \"But you didn't tell me.\" \"I was wishing I could know what you were thinking\u2026\" I hesitated. \"And?\" \"I was wishing that I could believe that you were real. And I was wishing that I wasn't afraid.\" \"I don't want you to be afraid.\" His voice was just a soft murmur. I heard what he couldn't truthfully say, that I didn't need to be afraid, that there was nothing to fear. \"Well, that's not exactly the fear I meant, though that's certainly something to think about.\" So quickly that I missed his movement, he was half sitting, propped up on his right arm, his left palm still in my hands. His angel's face was only a few inches from mine. I might have \u2014 should have \u2014 flinched away from his unexpected closeness, but I was unable to move.  His golden eyes mesmerized me. \"What are you afraid of, then?\" he whispered intently. But I couldn't answer. As I had just that once before, I smelled his cool breath in my face. Sweet, delicious, the scent made my mouth water. It was unlike anything else. Instinctively, unthinkingly, I leaned closer, inhaling. And he was gone, his hand ripped from mine. In the time it took my eyes to focus, he was twenty feet away, standing at the edge of the small meadow, in the deep shade of a huge fir tree. He stared at me, his eyes dark in the shadows, his expression unreadable. I could feel the hurt and shock on my face. My empty hands stung. \"I'm\u2026 sorry\u2026 Edward,\" I whispered. I knew he could hear. \"Give me a moment,\" he called, just loud enough for my less sensitive ears. I sat very still. After ten incredibly long seconds, he walked back, slowly for him. He stopped, still several feet away, and sank gracefully to the ground, crossing his legs. His eyes never left mine.  He took two deep breaths, and then smiled in apology. \"I am so very sorry.\" He hesitated. \"Would you understand what I meant if I said I was only human?\" I nodded once, not quite able to smile at his joke. Adrenaline pulsed through my veins as the realization of danger slowly sank in. He could smell that from where he sat. His smile turned mocking. \"I'm the world's best predator, aren't I? Everything about me invites you in \u2014 my voice, my face, even my smell. As if I need any of that!\" Unexpectedly, he was on his feet, bounding away, instantly out of sight, only to appear beneath the same tree as before, having circled the meadow in half a second. \"As if you could outrun me,\" he laughed bitterly. He reached up with one hand and, with a deafening crack, effortlessly ripped a two-foot-thick branch from the trunk of the spruce. He balanced it in that hand for a moment, and then threw it with blinding speed, shattering it against another huge tree, which shook and trembled at the blow. And he was in front of me again, standing two feet away, still as a stone. \"As if you could fight me off,\" he said gently. I sat without moving, more frightened of him than I had ever been. I'd never seen him so completely freed of that carefully cultivated facade. He'd never been less human\u2026 or more beautiful. Face ashen, eyes wide, I sat like a bird locked in the eyes of a snake. His lovely eyes seem to glow with rash excitement. Then, as the seconds passed, they dimmed. His expression slowly folded into a mask of ancient sadness. \"Don't be afraid,\" he murmured, his velvet voice unintentionally seductive. \"I promise\u2026\" He hesitated. \"I swear not to hurt you.\" He seemed more concerned with convincing himself than me. \"Don't be afraid,\" he whispered again as he stepped closer, with exaggerated slowness. He sat sinuously, with deliberately unhurried movements, till our faces were on the same level, just a foot apart. \"Please forgive me,\" he said formally. \"I can control myself. You caught me off guard. But I'm on my best behavior now.\" He waited, but I still couldn't speak. \"I'm not thirsty today, honestly.\" He winked. At that I had to laugh, though the sound was shaky and breathless. \"Are you all right?\" he asked tenderly, reaching out slowly, carefully, to place his marble hand back in mine. I looked at his smooth, cold hand, and then at his eyes. They were soft, repentant. I looked back at his hand, and then deliberately returned to tracing the lines in his hand with my fingertip. I looked up and smiled timidly. His answering smile was dazzling. \"So where were we, before I behaved so rudely?\" he asked in the gentle cadences of an earlier century. \"I honestly can't remember.\" He smiled, but his face was ashamed. \"I think we were talking about why you were afraid, besides the obvious reason.\" \"Oh, right.\" \"Well?\" I looked down at his hand and doodled aimlessly across his smooth, iridescent palm. The seconds ticked by. \"How easily frustrated I am,\" he sighed. I looked into his eyes, abruptly grasping that this was every bit as new to him as it was to me. As many years of <em>unfathomable</em> experience as he had, this was hard for him, too. I took courage from that thought. \"I was afraid\u2026 because, for, well, obvious reasons, I can't stay with you. And I'm afraid that I'd like to stay with you, much more than I should.\" I looked down at his hands as I spoke. It was difficult for me to say this aloud. \"Yes,\" he agreed slowly. \"That is something to be afraid of, indeed. Wanting to be with me. That's really not in your best interest.\" I frowned. \"I should have left long ago,\" he sighed. \"I should leave now. But I don't know if I can.\" \"I don't want you to leave,\" I mumbled pathetically, staring down again. \"Which is exactly why I should. But don't worry. I'm essentially a selfish creature. I crave your company too much to do what I should.\" \"I'm glad.\" \"Don't be!\" He withdrew his hand, more gently this time; his voice was harsher than usual. Harsh for him, still more beautiful than any human voice. It was hard to keep up \u2014 his sudden mood changes left me always a step behind, dazed. \"It's not only your company I crave! Never forget that. Never forget I am more dangerous to you than I am to anyone else.\" He stopped, and I looked to see him gazing unseeingly into the forest. I thought for a moment. \"I don't think I understand exactly what you mean \u2014 by that last part anyway,\" I said. He looked back at me and smiled, his mood shifting yet again. \"How do I explain?\" he mused. \"And without frightening you again\u2026 hmmmm.\" Without seeming to think about it, he placed his hand back in mine; I held it tightly in both of mine. He looked at our hands. \"That's amazingly pleasant, the warmth.\" He sighed. A moment passed as he assembled his thoughts. \"You know how everyone enjoys different flavors?\" he began. \"Some people love chocolate ice cream, others prefer strawberry?\" I nodded. \"Sorry about the food analogy \u2014 I couldn't think of another way to explain.\" I smiled. He smiled ruefully back. \"You see, every person smells different, has a different essence. If you locked an alcoholic in a room full of stale beer, he'd gladly drink it. But he could resist, if he wished to, if he were a recovering alcoholic. Now let's say you placed in that room a glass of hundred-year-old brandy, the rarest, finest cognac \u2014 and filled the room with its warm aroma \u2014 how do you think he would fare then?\" We sat silently, looking into each other's eyes \u2014 trying to read each other's thoughts. He broke the silence first. \"Maybe that's not the right comparison. Maybe it would be too easy to turn down the brandy. Perhaps I should have made our alcoholic a heroin addict instead.\" \"So what you're saying is, I'm your brand of heroin?\" I teased, trying to lighten the mood. He smiled swiftly, seeming to appreciate my effort. \"Yes, you are exactly my brand of heroin.\" \"Does that happen often?\" I asked. He looked across the treetops, thinking through his response. \"I spoke to my brothers about it.\" He still stared into the distance. \"To Jasper, every one of you is much the same. He's the most recent to join our family. It's a struggle for him to abstain at all. He hasn't had time to grow sensitive to the differences in smell, in flavor.\" He glanced swiftly at me, his expression apologetic. \"Sorry,\" he said. \"I don't mind. Please don't worry about offending me, or frightening me, or whichever. That's the way you think. I can understand, or I can try to at least. Just explain however you can.\" He took a deep breath and gazed at the sky again. \"So Jasper wasn't sure if he'd ever come across someone who was as\" \u2014 he hesitated, looking for the right word \u2014 \"appealing as you are to me.\u00a0 Which makes me think not. Emmett has been on the wagon longer, so to speak, and he understood what I meant. He says twice, for him, once stronger than the other.\" \"And for you?\" \"Never.\" The word hung there for a moment in the warm breeze. \"What did Emmett do?\" I asked to break the silence. It was the wrong question to ask. His face grew dark, his hand clenched into a fist inside mine. He looked away. I waited, but he wasn't going to answer. \"I guess I know,\" I finally said. He lifted his eyes; his expression was wistful, pleading. \"Even the strongest of us fall off the wagon, don't we?\" \"What are you asking? My permission?\" My voice was sharper than I'd intended. I tried to make my tone kinder \u2014 I could guess what his honesty must cost him. \"I mean, is there no hope, then?\" How calmly I could discuss my own death! \"No, no!\" He was instantly contrite. \"Of course there's hope! I mean, of course I won't\u2026\" He left the sentence hanging. His eyes burned into mine. \"It's different for us. Emmett\u2026 these were strangers he happened across. It was a long time ago, and he wasn't as\u2026 practiced, as careful, as he is now.\" He fell silent and watched me intently as I thought it through. \"So if we'd met\u2026 oh, in a dark alley or something\u2026\" I trailed off. \"It took everything I had not to jump up in the middle of that class full of children and \u2014\" He stopped abruptly, looking away. \"When you walked past me, I could have ruined everything Carlisle has built for us, right then and there. If I hadn't been denying my thirst for the last, well, too many years, I wouldn't have been able to stop myself.\" He paused, scowling at the trees. He glanced at me grimly, both of us remembering. \"You must have thought I was possessed.\" \"I couldn't understand why. How you could hate me so quickly\u2026\" \"To me, it was like you were some kind of demon, summoned straight from my own personal hell to ruin me. The fragrance coming off your skin\u2026 I thought it would make me deranged that first day. In that one hour, I thought of a hundred different ways to lure you from the room with me, to get you alone. And I fought them each back, thinking of my family, what I could do to them. I had to run out, to get away before I could speak the words that would make you follow\u2026\" He looked up then at my staggered expression as I tried to absorb his bitter memories. His golden eyes scorched from under his lashes, hypnotic and deadly. \"You would have come,\" he promised. I tried to speak calmly. \"Without a doubt.\" He frowned down at my hands, releasing me from the force of his stare. \"And then, as I tried to rearrange my schedule in a pointless attempt to avoid you, you were there \u2014 in that close, warm little room, the scent was maddening. I so very nearly took you then. There was only one other frail human there \u2014 so easily dealt with.\" I shivered in the warm sun, seeing my memories anew through his eyes, only now grasping the danger. Poor Ms. Cope; I shivered again at how close I'd come to being inadvertently responsible for her death. \"But I resisted. I don't know how. I forced myself not to wait for you, not to follow you from the school. It was easier outside, when I couldn't smell you anymore, to think clearly, to make the right decision. I left the others near home \u2014 I was too ashamed to tell them how weak I was, they only knew something was very wrong \u2014 and then I went straight to Carlisle, at the hospital, to tell him I was leaving.\" I stared in surprise.  \"I traded cars with him \u2014 he had a full tank of gas and I didn't want to stop. I didn't dare to go home, to face Esme. She wouldn't have let me go without a scene. She would have tried to convince me that it wasn't necessary\u2026 \"By the next morning I was in Alaska.\" He sounded ashamed, as if admitting a great cowardice. \"I spent two days there, with some old acquaintances\u2026 but I was homesick. I hated knowing I'd upset Esme, and the rest of them, my adopted family. In the pure air of the mountains it was hard to believe you were so irresistible. I convinced myself it was weak to run away. I'd dealt with temptation before, not of this magnitude, not even close, but I was strong. Who were you, an insignificant little girl\" \u2014 he grinned suddenly \u2014 \"to chase me from the place I wanted to be? So I came back\u2026\" He stared off into space. I couldn't speak. \"I took precautions, hunting, feeding more than usual before seeing you again. I was sure that I was strong enough to treat you like any other human. I was arrogant about it. \"It was unquestionably a complication that I couldn't simply read your thoughts to know what your reaction was to me. I wasn't used to having to go to such circuitous measures, listening to your words in Jessica's mind\u2026 her mind isn't very original, and it was annoying to have to stoop to that. And then I couldn't know if you really meant what you said. It was all extremely irritating.\" He frowned at the memory. \"I wanted you to forget my behavior that first day, if possible, so I tried to talk with you like I would with any person. I was eager actually, hoping to decipher some of your thoughts. But you were too interesting, I found myself caught up in your expressions\u2026 and every now and then you would stir the air with your hand or your hair, and the scent would stun me again\u2026 \"Of course, then you were nearly crushed to death in front of my eyes. Later I thought of a perfectly good excuse for why I acted at that moment \u2014 because if I hadn't saved you, if your blood had been spilled there in front of me, I don't think I could have stopped myself from exposing us for what we are. But I only thought of that excuse later. At the time, all I could think was, 'Not her.'\" He closed his eyes, lost in his agonized confession. I listened, more eager than rational. Common sense told me I should be terrified. Instead, I was relieved to finally understand. And I was filled with compassion for his suffering, even now, as he confessed his craving to take my life. I finally was able to speak, though my voice was faint. \"In the hospital?\" His eyes flashed up to mine. \"I was appalled. I couldn't believe I had put us in danger after all, put myself in your power \u2014 you of all people. As if I needed another motive to kill you.\"  We both flinched as that word slipped out. \"But it had the opposite effect,\" he continued quickly. \"I fought with Rosalie, Emmett, and Jasper when they suggested that now was the time\u2026 the worst fight we've ever had. Carlisle sided with me, and Alice.\" He grimaced when he said her name. I couldn't imagine why. \"Esme told me to do whatever I had to in order to stay.\" He shook his head indulgently. \"All that next day I eavesdropped on the minds of everyone you spoke to, shocked that you kept your word. I didn't understand you at all. But I knew that I couldn't become more involved with you. I did my very best to stay as far from you as possible. And every day the perfume of your skin, your breath, your hair\u2026 it hit me as hard as the very first day.\" He met my eyes again, and they were surprisingly tender. \"And for all that,\" he continued, \"I'd have fared better if I had exposed us all at that first moment, than if now, here \u2014 with no witnesses and nothing to stop me \u2014 I were to hurt you.\" I was human enough to have to ask. \"Why?\" \"Isabella.\" He pronounced my full name carefully, then playfully ruffled my hair with his free hand. A shock ran through my body at his casual touch. \"Bella, I couldn't live with myself if I ever hurt you. You don't know how it's tortured me.\" He looked down, ashamed again. \"The thought of you, still, white, cold\u2026 to never see you blush scarlet again, to never see that flash of intuition in your eyes when you see through my pretenses\u2026 it would be unendurable.\" He lifted his glorious, agonized eyes to mine. \"You are the most important thing to me now. The most important thing to me ever.\" My head was spinning at the rapid change in direction our conversation had taken. From the cheerful topic of my impending demise, we were suddenly declaring ourselves. He waited, and even though I looked down to study our hands between us, I knew his golden eyes were on me.  \"You already know how I feel, of course,\" I finally said. \"I'm here\u2026 which, roughly translated, means I would rather die than stay away from you.\" I frowned. \"I'm an idiot.\" \"You are an idiot,\" he agreed with a laugh. Our eyes met, and I laughed, too. We laughed together at the idiocy and sheer impossibility of such a moment. \"And so the lion fell in love with the lamb\u2026\" he murmured. I looked away, hiding my eyes as I thrilled to the word. \"What a stupid lamb,\" I sighed. \"What a sick, masochistic lion.\" He stared into the shadowy forest for a long moment, and I wondered where his thoughts had taken him. \"Why\u2026 ?\" I began, and then paused, not sure how to continue. He looked at me and smiled; sunlight glinted off his face, his teeth.  \"Yes?\" \"Tell me why you ran from me before.\" His smile faded. \"You know why.\" \"No, I mean, exactly what did I do wrong? I'll have to be on my guard, you see, so I better start learning what I shouldn't do. This, for example\" \u2014 I stroked the back of his hand \u2014 \"seems to be all right.\" He smiled again. \"You didn't do anything wrong, Bella. It was my fault.\" \"But I want to help, if I can, to not make this harder for you.\" \"Well\u2026\" He contemplated for a moment. \"It was just how close you were. Most humans instinctively shy away from us, are repelled by our alienness\u2026 I wasn't expecting you to come so close. And the smell of your throat.\" He stopped short, looking to see if he'd upset me. \"Okay, then,\" I said flippantly, trying to alleviate the suddenly tense atmosphere. I tucked my chin. \"No throat exposure.\" It worked; he laughed. \"No, really, it was more the surprise than anything else.\" He raised his free hand and placed it gently on the side of my neck. I sat very still, the chill of his touch a natural warning \u2014 a warning telling me to be terrified. But there was no feeling of fear in me. There were, however, other feelings\u2026 \"You see,\" he said. \"Perfectly fine.\" My blood was racing, and I wished I could slow it, sensing that this must make everything so much more difficult \u2014 the thudding of my pulse in my veins. Surely he could hear it. \"The blush on your cheeks is lovely,\" he murmured. He gently freed his other hand. My hands fell limply into my lap. Softly he brushed my cheek, then held my face between his marble hands. \"Be very still,\" he whispered, as if I wasn't already frozen. Slowly, never moving his eyes from mine, he leaned toward me. Then abruptly, but very gently, he rested his cold cheek against the hollow at the base of my throat. I was quite unable to move, even if I'd wanted to. I listened to the sound of his even breathing, watching the sun and wind play in his bronze hair, more human than any other part of him. With deliberate slowness, his hands slid down the sides of my neck. I shivered, and I heard him catch his breath. But his hands didn't pause as they softly moved to my shoulders, and then stopped. His face drifted to the side, his nose skimming across my collarbone. He came to rest with the side of his face pressed tenderly against my chest. Listening to my heart. \"Ah,\" he sighed. I don't know how long we sat without moving. It could have been hours.  Eventually the throb of my pulse quieted, but he didn't move or speak again as he held me. I knew at any moment it could be too much, and my life could end \u2014 so quickly that I might not even notice. And I couldn't make myself be afraid. I couldn't think of anything, except that he was touching me. And then, too soon, he released me.  His eyes were peaceful. \"It won't be so hard again,\" he said with satisfaction. \"Was that very hard for you?\" \"Not nearly as bad as I imagined it would be. And you?\" \"No, it wasn't bad\u2026 for me.\" He smiled at my inflection. \"You know what I mean.\" I smiled. \"Here.\" He took my hand and placed it against his cheek. \"Do you feel how warm it is?\" And it was almost warm, his usually icy skin. But I barely noticed, for I was touching his face, something I'd dreamed of constantly since the first day I'd seen him. \"Don't move,\" I whispered. No one could be still like Edward. He closed his eyes and became as immobile as stone, a carving under my hand. I moved even more slowly than he had, careful not to make one unexpected move. I caressed his cheek, delicately stroked his eyelid, the purple shadow in the hollow under his eye. I traced the shape of his perfect nose, and then, so carefully, his flawless lips. His lips parted under my hand, and I could feel his cool breath on my fingertips. I wanted to lean in, to inhale the scent of him. So I dropped my hand and leaned away, not wanting to push him too far. He opened his eyes, and they were hungry. Not in a way to make me fear, but rather to tighten the muscles in the pit of my stomach and send my pulse hammering through my veins again. \"I wish,\" he whispered, \"I wish you could feel the\u2026 complexity\u2026 the confusion\u2026 I feel. That you could understand.\" He raised his hand to my hair, then carefully brushed it across my face. \"Tell me,\" I breathed. \"I don't think I can. I've told you, on the one hand, the hunger \u2014 the thirst \u2014 that, deplorable creature that I am, I feel for you. And I think you can understand that, to an extent. Though\" \u2014 he half-smiled \u2014 \"as you are not addicted to any illegal substances, you probably can't empathize completely. \"But\u2026\" His fingers touched my lips lightly, making me shiver again. \"There are other hungers. Hungers I don't even understand, that are foreign to me.\" \"I may understand that better than you think.\" \"I'm not used to feeling so human. Is it always like this?\" \"For me?\" I paused. \"No, never. Never before this.\" He held my hands between his. They felt so feeble in his iron strength. \"I don't know how to be close to you,\" he admitted. \"I don't know if I can.\" I leaned forward very slowly, cautioning him with my eyes. I placed my cheek against his stone chest. I could hear his breath, and nothing else. \"This is enough,\" I sighed, closing my eyes. In a very human gesture, he put his arms around me and pressed his face against my hair. \"You're better at this than you give yourself credit for,\" I noted. \"I have human instincts \u2014 they may be buried deep, but they're there.\" We sat like that for another immeasurable moment; I wondered if he could be as unwilling to move as I was. But I could see the light was fading, the shadows of the forest beginning to touch us, and I sighed. \"You have to go.\" \"I thought you couldn't read my mind.\" \"It's getting clearer.\" I could hear a smile in his voice. He took my shoulders and I looked into his face. \"Can I show you something?\" he asked, sudden excitement flaring in his eyes. \"Show me what?\" \"I'll show you how I travel in the forest.\" He saw my expression. \"Don't worry, you'll be very safe, and we'll get to your truck much faster.\" His mouth twitched up into that crooked smile so beautiful my heart nearly stopped. \"Will you turn into a bat?\" I asked warily. He laughed, louder than I'd ever heard. \"Like I haven't heard that one before!\" \"Right, I'm sure you get that all the time.\" \"Come on, little coward, climb on my back.\" I waited to see if he was kidding, but, apparently, he meant it. He smiled as he read my hesitation, and reached for me. My heart reacted; even though he couldn't hear my thoughts, my pulse always gave me away. He then proceeded to sling me onto his back, with very little effort on my part, besides, when in place, clamping my legs and arms so tightly around him that it would choke a normal person. It was like clinging to a stone. \"I'm a bit heavier than your average backpack,\" I warned.  \"Hah!\" he snorted. I could almost hear his eyes rolling. I'd never seen him in such high spirits before. He startled me, suddenly grabbing my hand, pressing my palm to his face, and inhaling deeply. \"Easier all the time,\" he muttered. And then he was running. If I'd ever feared death before in his presence, it was nothing compared to how I felt now. He streaked through the dark, thick underbrush of the forest like a bullet, like a ghost. There was no sound, no evidence that his feet touched the earth. His breathing never changed, never indicated any effort. But the trees flew by at deadly speeds, always missing us by inches. I was too terrified to close my eyes, though the cool forest air whipped against my face and burned them. I felt as if I were stupidly sticking my head out the window of an airplane in flight. And, for the first time in my life, I felt the dizzy faintness of motion sickness. Then it was over. We'd hiked hours this morning to reach Edward's meadow, and now, in a matter of minutes, we were back to the truck. \"Exhilarating, isn't it?\" His voice was high, excited. He stood motionless, waiting for me to climb down. I tried, but my muscles wouldn't respond. My arms and legs stayed locked around him while my head spun uncomfortably. \"Bella?\" he asked, anxious now. \"I think I need to lie down,\" I gasped. \"Oh, sorry.\" He waited for me, but I still couldn't move. \"I think I need help,\" I admitted. He laughed quietly, and gently unloosened my stranglehold on his neck. There was no resisting the iron strength of his hands. Then he pulled me around to face him, cradling me in his arms like a small child. He held me for a moment, then carefully placed me on the springy ferns. \"How do you feel?\" he asked. I couldn't be sure how I felt when my head was spinning so crazily. \"Dizzy, I think.\" \"Put your head between your knees.\" I tried that, and it helped a little. I breathed in and out slowly, keeping my head very still. I felt him sitting beside me. The moments passed, and eventually I found that I could raise my head. There was a hollow ringing sound in my ears. \"I guess that wasn't the best idea,\" he mused. I tried to be positive, but my voice was weak. \"No, it was very interesting.\" \"Hah! You're as white as a ghost \u2014 no, you're as white as me!\" \"I think I should have closed my eyes.\" \"Remember that next time.\" \"Next time!\" I groaned. He laughed, his mood still radiant. \"Show-off,\" I muttered. \"Open your eyes, Bella,\" he said quietly. And he was right there, his face so close to mine. His beauty stunned my mind \u2014 it was too much, an excess I couldn't grow accustomed to. \"I was thinking, while I was running\u2026\" He paused. \"About not hitting the trees, I hope.\" \"Silly Bella,\" he chuckled. \"Running is second nature to me, it's not something I have to think about.\" \"Show-off,\" I muttered again. He smiled. \"No,\" he continued, \"I was thinking there was something I wanted to try.\" And he took my face in his hands again. I couldn't breathe. He hesitated \u2014 not in the normal way, the human way. Not the way a man might hesitate before he kissed a woman, to gauge her reaction, to see how he would be received. Perhaps he would hesitate to prolong the moment, that ideal moment of anticipation, sometimes better than the kiss itself. Edward hesitated to test himself, to see if this was safe, to make sure he was still in control of his need. And then his cold, marble lips pressed very softly against mine. What neither of us was prepared for was my response. Blood boiled under my skin, burned in my lips. My breath came in a wild gasp. My fingers knotted in his hair, clutching him to me. My lips parted as I breathed in his heady scent. Immediately I felt him turn to unresponsive stone beneath my lips. His hands gently, but with irresistible force, pushed my face back. I opened my eyes and saw his guarded expression. \"Oops,\" I breathed. \"That's an understatement.\" His eyes were wild, his jaw clenched in acute restraint, yet he didn't lapse from his perfect articulation. He held my face just inches from his. He dazzled my eyes. \"Should I\u2026 ?\" I tried to disengage myself, to give him some room. His hands refused to let me move so much as an inch. \"No, it's tolerable. Wait for a moment, please.\" His voice was polite, controlled. I kept my eyes on his, watched as the excitement in them faded and gentled. Then he smiled a surprisingly impish grin. \"There,\" he said, obviously pleased with himself. \"Tolerable?\" I asked. He laughed aloud. \"I'm stronger than I thought. It's nice to know.\" \"I wish I could say the same. I'm sorry.\" \"You are only human, after all.\" \"Thanks so much,\" I said, my voice acerbic. He was on his feet in one of his lithe, almost invisibly quick movements. He held out his hand to me, an unexpected gesture. I was so used to our standard of careful non-contact. I took his icy hand, needing the support more than I thought. My balance had not yet returned. \"Are you still faint from the run? Or was it my kissing expertise?\" How lighthearted, how human he seemed as he laughed now, his seraphic face untroubled. He was a different Edward than the one I had known. And I felt all the more besotted by him. It would cause me physical pain to be separated from him now. \"I can't be sure, I'm still woozy,\" I managed to respond. \"I think it's some of both, though.\" \"Maybe you should let me drive.\" \"Are you insane?\" I protested. \"I can drive better than you on your best day,\" he teased. \"You have much slower reflexes.\" \"I'm sure that's true, but I don't think my nerves, or my truck, could take it.\" \"Some trust, please, Bella.\" My hand was in my pocket, curled tightly around the key. I pursed my lips, deliberated, then shook my head with a tight grin. \"Nope. Not a chance.\" He raised his eyebrows in disbelief. I started to step around him, heading for the driver's side. He might have let me pass if I hadn't wobbled slightly. Then again, he might not have. His arm created an inescapable snare around my waist. \"Bella, I've already expended a great deal of personal effort at this point to keep you alive. I'm not about to let you behind the wheel of a vehicle when you can't even walk straight. Besides, friends don't let friends drive drunk,\" he quoted with a chuckle. I could smell the unbearably sweet fragrance coming off his chest. \"Drunk?\" I objected. \"You're intoxicated by my very presence.\" He was grinning that playful smirk again. \"I can't argue with that,\" I sighed.; I couldn't resist him in anything. I held the key high and dropped it, watching his hand flash like lightning to catch it soundlessly. \"Take it easy \u2014 my truck is a senior citizen.\" \"Very sensible,\" he approved. \"And are you not affected at all?\" I asked, irked. \"By my presence?\" Again his mobile features transformed, his expression became soft, warm. He didn't answer at first; he simply bent his face to mine, and brushed his lips slowly along my jaw, from my ear to my chin, back and forth. I trembled. \"Regardless,\" he finally murmured, \"I have better reflexes.\"",
