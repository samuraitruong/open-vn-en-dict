            "en": "6            6. SWITZERLAND AS I DROVE HOME , I WASN\u2019T PAYING MUCH ATTENTION TO the road that shimmered wetly in the sun. I was thinking about the flood of information Jacob had shared with me, trying to sort it out, to force it all to make sense. Despite the overload, I felt lighter. Seeing Jacob smile, having all the secrets thrashed out . . . it didn\u2019t make things perfect, but it made them better. I was right to have gone. Jacob needed me. And obviously, I thought as I squinted into the glare, there was no danger. It came out of nowhere. One minute there was nothing but bright highway in my rearview mirror. The next minute, the sun was glinting off a silver Volvo right on my tail. \u201cAw, crap,\u201d I whimpered. I considered pulling over. But I was too much of a coward to face him right away. I\u2019d been counting on some prep time . . . and having Charlie nearby as a buffer. At least that would force him to keep his voice down. The Volvo followed inches behind me. I kept my eyes on the road ahead. Chicken through and through, I drove straight to Angela\u2019s without once meeting the gaze I could feel burning a hole in my mirror. He followed me until I pulled to the curb in front of the Webers\u2019 house. He didn\u2019t stop, and I didn\u2019t look up as he passed. I didn\u2019t want to see the expression on his face. I ran up the short concrete walk to Angela\u2019s door as soon as he was out of sight. Ben answered the door before I could finish knocking, like he\u2019d been standing right behind it. \u201cHey, Bella!\u201d he said, surprised. \u201cHi, Ben. Er, is Angela here?\u201d I wondered if Angela had forgotten our plans, and cringed at the thought of going home early. \u201cSure,\u201d Ben said just as Angela called, \u201cBella!\u201d and appeared at the top of the stairs. Ben peered around me as we both heard the sound of a car on the road; the sound didn\u2019t scare me \u2014 this engine stuttered to a stop, followed by the loud pop of a backfire. Nothing like the purr of the Volvo. This must be the visitor Ben had been waiting for. \u201cAustin\u2019s here,\u201d Ben said as Angela reached his side. A horn honked on the street. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll see you later,\u201d Ben promised. \u201cMiss you already.\u201d He threw his arm around Angela\u2019s neck and pulled her face down to his height so that he could kiss her enthusiastically. After a second of this, Austin honked again. \u201c\u2019Bye, Ang! Love you!\u201d Ben shouted as he dashed past me. Angela swayed, her face slightly pink, then recovered herself and waved until Ben and Austin were out of sight. Then she turned to me and grinned ruefully. \u201cThank you for doing this, Bella,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom the bottom of my heart. Not only are you saving my hands from permanent injury, you also just spared me two long hours of a plot-less, badly dubbed martial arts film.\u201d She sighed in relief. \u201cHappy to be of service.\u201d I was feeling a bit less panicked, able to breathe a little more evenly. It felt so ordinary here. Angela\u2019s easy human dramas were oddly reassuring. It was nice to know that life was normal somewhere . I followed Angela up the stairs to her room. She kicked toys out of the way as she went. The house was unusually quiet. \u201cWhere\u2019s your family?\u201d \u201cMy parents took the twins to a birthday party in Port Angeles. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re really going to help me with this. Ben\u2019s pretending he has tendonitis.\u201d She made a face. \u201cI don\u2019t mind at all,\u201d I said, and then I walked into Angela\u2019s room and saw the stacks of waiting envelopes. \u00a0\u201cOh!\u201d I gasped. Angela turned to look at me, apologies in her eyes. I could see why she\u2019d been putting this off, and why Ben had weaseled out. \u201cI thought you were exaggerating,\u201d I admitted. \u201cI wish. Are you sure you want to do this?\u201d \u201cPut me to work. I\u2019ve got all day.\u201d Angela divided a pile in half and put her mother\u2019s address book between us on her desk. For a while we concentrated, and there was just the sound of our pens scratching quietly across the paper. \u201cWhat\u2019s Edward doing tonight?\u201d she asked after a few minutes. My pen dug into the envelope I was working on. \u201cEmmet\u2019s home for the weekend. They\u2019re supposed to be hiking.\u201d \u201cYou say that like you\u2019re not sure.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky Edward has his brothers for all the hiking and camping. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do if Ben didn\u2019t have Austin for the guy stuff.\u201d \u201cYeah, the outdoors thing is not really for me. And there\u2019s no way I\u2019d ever be able to keep up.\u201d Angela laughed. \u201cI prefer the indoors myself.\u201d She focused on her pile for a minute. I wrote out four more addresses. There was never any pressure to fill a pause with meaningless chatter around Angela. Like Charlie, she was comfortable with silence. But, like Charlie, she was also too observant sometimes. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d she asked in a low voice now. \u201cYou seem . . . anxious.\u201d I smiled sheepishly. \u201cIs it that obvious?\u201d \u201cNot really.\u201d She was probably lying to make me feel better. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to talk about it unless you want to,\u201d she assured me. \u201cI\u2019ll listen if you think it will help.\u201d I was about to say thanks, but no thanks . After all, there were just too many secrets I was bound to keep. I really couldn\u2019t discuss my problems with someone human. That was against the rules. And yet, with a strange, sudden intensity, that\u2019s exactly what I wanted. I wanted to talk to a normal human girlfriend. I wanted to moan a little bit, like any other teenage girl. I wanted my problems to be that simple. It would also be nice to have someone outside the whole vampire-werewolf mess to put things in perspective. Someone unbiased. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll mind my own business,\u201d Angela promised, smiling down at the address she was working on. \u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I am anxious. It\u2019s . . . it\u2019s Edward.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d It was so easy to talk to Angela. When she asked a question like that, I could tell that she wasn\u2019t just morbidly curious or looking for gossip, like Jessica would have been. She cared that I was upset. \u201cOh, he\u2019s mad at me.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s hard to imagine,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s he mad about?\u201d I sighed. \u201cDo you remember Jacob Black?\u201d \u201cAh,\u201d she said. \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s jealous.\u201d \u201cNo, not jealous . . .\u201d I should have kept my mouth shut. There was no way to explain this right. But I wanted to keep talking anyway. I hadn\u2019t realized I was so starved for human conversation. \u201cEdward thinks Jacob is . . . a bad influence, I guess. Sort of . . . dangerous. You know how much trouble I got in a few months back. . . . It\u2019s all ridiculous, though.\u201d I was surprised to see Angela shaking her head. \u201cWhat?\u201d I asked. \u201cBella, I\u2019ve seen how Jacob Black looks at you. I\u2019d bet the real problem is jealousy.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not like that with Jacob.\u201d \u201cFor you, maybe. But for Jacob . . .\u201d I frowned. \u201cJacob knows how I feel. I\u2019ve told him everything.\u201d \u201cEdward\u2019s only human, Bella. He\u2019s going to react like any other boy.\u201d I grimaced. I didn\u2019t have a response to that. She patted my hand. \u201cHe\u2019ll get over it.\u201d \u201cI hope so. Jake\u2019s going through kind of a tough time. He needs me.\u201d \u201cYou and Jacob are pretty close, aren\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cLike family,\u201d I agreed. \u201cAnd Edward doesn\u2019t like him. . . . That must be hard. I wonder how Ben would handle that?\u201d she mused. I half-smiled. \u201cProbably just like any other boy.\u201d She grinned. \u201cProbably.\u201d Then she changed the subject. Angela wasn\u2019t one to pry, and she seemed to sense I wouldn\u2019t \u2014 couldn\u2019t \u2014 say any more. \u201cI got my dorm assignment yesterday. The farthest building from campus, naturally.\u201d \u00a0\u201cDoes Ben know where he\u2019s staying yet?\u201d \u201cThe closest dorm to campus. He\u2019s got all the luck. How about you? Did you decide where you\u2019re going?\u201d I stared down, concentrating on the clumsy <em>scrawl</em> of my handwriting. For a second I was distracted by the thought of Angela and Ben at the University of Washington. They would be off to Seattle in just a few months. Would it be safe then? Would the wild young vampire menace have moved elsewhere? Would there be a new place by then, some other city flinching from horror-movie headlines? Would those new headlines be my fault? I tried to shake it off and answered her question a beat late. \u201cAlaska, I think. The university there in Juneau.\u201d I could hear the surprise in her voice. \u201cAlaska? Oh. Really? I mean, that\u2019s great. I just figured you\u2019d go somewhere . . . warmer.\u201d I laughed a little, still staring at the envelope. \u201cYeah. Forks has really changed my perspective on life.\u201d \u00a0\u201cAnd Edward?\u201d Though his name set butterflies fluttering in my stomach, I looked up and grinned at her. \u201cAlaska\u2019s not too cold for Edward, either.\u201d She grinned back. \u201cOf course not.\u201d And then she sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s so far. You won\u2019t be able to come home very often. I\u2019ll miss you. Will you e-mail me?\u201d A swell of quiet sadness crashed over me; maybe it was a mistake to get closer to Angela now. But wouldn\u2019t it be sadder still to miss out on these last chances? I shook off the unhappy thoughts, so that I could answer her teasingly. \u201cIf I can type again after this.\u201d I nodded toward the stack of envelopes I\u2019d done. We laughed, and it was easy then to chat cheerfully about classes and majors while we finished the rest \u2014 all I had to do was not think about it. Anyway, there were more urgent things to worry about today. I helped her put the stamps on, too. I was afraid to leave. \u201cHow\u2019s your hand?\u201d she asked. I flexed my fingers. \u201cI think I\u2019ll recover the full use of it . . . someday.\u201d The door banged downstairs, and we both looked up. \u201cAng?\u201d Ben called. I tried to smile, but my lips trembled. \u201cI guess that\u2019s my cue to leave.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go. Though he\u2019s probably going to describe the movie for me . . . in detail.\u201d \u201cCharlie will be wondering where I am anyway.\u201d \u201cThanks for helping me.\u201d \u201cI had a good time, actually. We should do something like this again. It was nice to have some girl time.\u201d \u201cDefinitely.\u201d There was a light knock on the bedroom door. \u201cCome in, Ben,\u201d Angela said. I got up and stretched. \u201cHey, Bella! You survived,\u201d Ben greeted me quickly before going to take my place by Angela. He eyed\u00a0 our work. \u201cNice job. Too bad there\u2019s nothing left to do, I would have . . .\u201d He let the thought trail off, and then restarted excitedly. \u201cAng, I can\u2019t believe you missed this one! It was awesome. There was this final fight sequence \u2014 the choreography was unbelievable! This one guy \u2014 well, you\u2019re going to have to see it to know what I\u2019m talking about \u2014\u201d Angela rolled her eyes at me. \u201cSee you at school,\u201d I said with a nervous laugh. She sighed. \u201cSee you.\u201d I was jumpy on the way out to my truck, but the street was empty. I spent the whole drive glancing anxiously in all my mirrors, but there was never any sign of the silver car. His car was not in front of the house, either, though that meant little. \u201cBella?\u201d Charlie called when I opened the front door. \u201cHey, Dad.\u201d I found him in the living room, in front of the TV. \u00a0\u201cSo, how was your day?\u201d \u201cGood,\u201d I said. Might as well tell him everything \u2014 he\u2019d hear it from Billy soon enough. Besides, it would make him happy. \u201cThey didn\u2019t need me at work, so I went down to La Push.\u201d There wasn\u2019t enough surprise in his face. Billy had already talked to him. \u201cHow\u2019s Jacob?\u201d Charlie asked, attempting to sound indifferent. \u201cGood,\u201d I said, just as casual. \u201cYou get over to the Webers\u2019?\u201d \u201cYep. We got all her announcements addressed.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s nice.\u201d Charlie smiled a wide smile. He was strangely focused, considering that there was a game on. \u201cI\u2019m glad you spent some time with your friends today.\u201d \u201cMe, too.\u201d I ambled toward the kitchen, looking for busy work. Unfortunately, Charlie had already cleaned up his lunch. I stood there for a few minutes, staring at the bright patch of light the sun made on the floor. But I knew I couldn\u2019t delay this forever. .  \u201cI\u2019m going to go study,\u201d I announced glumly as I headed up the stairs. \u201cSee you later,\u201d Charlie called after me. If I survive, I thought to myself. I shut my bedroom door carefully before I turned to face my room. Of course he was there. He stood against the wall across from me, in the shadow beside the open window. His face was hard and his posture tense. He glared at me wordlessly.  I cringed, waiting for the torrent, but it didn\u2019t come. He just continued to glare, possibly too angry to speak. \u201cHi,\u201d I finally said. His face could have been carved from stone. I counted to a hundred in my head, but there was no change. \u201cEr . . . so, I\u2019m still alive,\u201d I began. A growl rumbled low in his chest, but his expression didn\u2019t change. \u00a0\u201cNo harm done,\u201d I insisted with a shrug. He moved. His eyes closed, and he pinched the bridge of his nose between the fingers of his right hand. \u201cBella,\u201d he whispered. \u201cDo you have any idea how close I came to crossing the line today? To breaking the treaty and coming after you? Do you know what that would have meant?\u201d I gasped and his eyes opened. They were as cold and hard as night. \u00a0\u201cYou can\u2019t!\u201d I said too loudly. I worked to modulate the volume of my voice so Charlie wouldn\u2019t hear, but I wanted to shout the words. \u201cEdward, they\u2019d use any excuse for a fight. They\u2019d love that. You can\u2019t ever break the rules!\u201d \u201cMaybe they aren\u2019t the only ones who would enjoy a fight.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you start,\u201d I snapped. \u201cYou made the treaty \u2014 you stick to it.\u201d \u201cIf he\u2019d hurt you \u2014\u201d \u201cEnough!\u201d I cut him off. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to worry about. Jacob isn\u2019t dangerous.\u201d \u00a0\u201cBella.\u201d He rolled his eyes. \u201cYou aren\u2019t exactly the best judge of what is or isn\u2019t dangerous.\u201d \u201cI know I don\u2019t have to worry about Jake. And neither do you.\u201d He ground his teeth together. His hands were balled up in fists at his sides. He was still standing against the wall, and I hated the space between us. I took a deep breath, and crossed the room. He didn\u2019t move when I wrapped my arms around him. Next to the warmth of the last of the afternoon sun streaming through the window, his skin felt especially icy. He seemed like ice, too, frozen the way he was. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry I made you anxious,\u201d I muttered. He sighed, and relaxed a little. His arms wound around my waist. \u201cAnxious is a bit of an understatement,\u201d he murmured. \u201cIt was a very long day.\u201d \u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to know about it,\u201d I reminded him. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be hunting longer.\u201d I looked up at his face, at his defensive eyes; I hadn\u2019t noticed in the stress of the moment, but they were too dark. The rings under them were deep purple. I frowned in disapproval. \u00a0\u201cWhen Alice saw you disappear, I came back,\u201d he explained. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have done that. Now you\u2019ll have to go away again.\u201d My frown intensified. \u201cI can wait.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. I mean, I know she couldn\u2019t see me with Jacob, but you should have known \u2014\u201d \u201cBut I didn\u2019t,\u201d he broke in. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t expect me to let you \u2014\u201d \u201cOh, yes, I can,\u201d I interrupted him. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I expect \u2014\u201d \u201cThis won\u2019t happen again.\u201d \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s right! Because you\u2019re not going to overreact next time.\u201d \u201cBecause there isn\u2019t going to be a next time.\u201d \u201cI understand when you have to leave, even if I don\u2019t like it \u2014\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not the same. I\u2019m not risking my life.\u201d \u201cNeither am I.\u201d \u201cWerewolves constitute a risk.\u201d \u00a0\u201cI disagree.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not negotiating this, Bella.\u201d \u201cNeither am I.\u201d His hands were in fists again. I could feel them against my back. The words popped out thoughtlessly. \u201cIs this really just about my safety?\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he demanded. \u00a0\u201cYou aren\u2019t . . .\u201d Angela\u2019s theory seemed sillier now than before. It was hard to finish the thought. \u201cI mean, you know better than to be jealous, right?\u201d He raised one eyebrow. \u201cDo I?\u201d \u201cBe serious.\u201d \u201cEasily \u2014 there\u2019s nothing remotely humorous about this.\u201d I frowned suspiciously. \u201cOr . . . is this something else altogether? Some vampires-and-werewolves-are-always-enemies nonsense? Is this just a testosterone-fueled \u2014\u201d His eyes blazed. \u201cThis is only about you. All I care is that you\u2019re safe.\u201d The black fire in his eyes was impossible to doubt. \u201cOkay,\u201d I sighed. \u201cI believe that. But I want you to know something \u2014 when it comes to all this enemies nonsense, I\u2019m out. I am a neutral country. I am Switzerland. I refuse to be affected by territorial disputes between mythical creatures. Jacob is family. You are . . . well, not exactly the love of my life, because I expect to love you for much longer than that. The love of my existence. I don\u2019t care who\u2019s a werewolf and who\u2019s a vampire. \u00a0If Angela turns out to be a witch, she can join the party, too.\u201d He stared at me silently through narrowed eyes. \u201cSwitzerland,\u201d I repeated again for emphasis. He frowned at me, and then sighed. \u201cBella . . . ,\u201d he began, but he paused, and his nose wrinkled in disgust. \u201cWhat now?\u201d \u201cWell . . . don\u2019t be offended, but you smell like a dog,\u201d he told me. And then he smiled crookedly, so I knew the fight was over. For now. Edward had to make up for the missed hunting trip, and so he was leaving Friday night with Jasper, Emmett, and Carlisle to hit some reserve in Northern California with a mountain lion problem. We\u2019d come to no agreement on the werewolf issue, but I didn\u2019t feel guilty calling Jake \u2014 during my brief window of opportunity when Edward took the Volvo home before climbing back in through my window \u2014 to let him know I\u2019d be coming over on Saturday again. It wasn\u2019t sneaking around. Edward knew how I felt. And if he broke my truck again, then I\u2019d have Jacob pick me up. Forks was neutral, just like Switzerland \u2014 just like me. So when I got off work Thursday and it was Alice rather than Edward waiting for me in the Volvo, I was not suspicious at first. The passenger door was open, and music I didn\u2019t recognize was shaking the frame when the bass played. \u201cHey, Alice,\u201d I shouted over the wailing as I climbed in. \u201cWhere\u2019s your brother?\u201d She was singing along to the song, her voice an octave higher than the melody, weaving through it with a complicated harmony. She nodded at me, ignoring my question as she concentrated on the music. I shut my door and put my hands over my ears. She grinned, and turned the volume down until it was just background. Then she hit the locks and the gas in the same second. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I asked, starting to feel uneasy. \u201cWhere is Edward?\u201d She shrugged. \u201cThey left early.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d I tried to control the absurd disappointment. If he left early, that meant he\u2019d be back sooner, I reminded myself. \u00a0\u201cAll the boys went, and we\u2019re having a slumber party!\u201d she announced in a trilling, singsong voice. \u201cA slumber party?\u201d I repeated, the suspicion finally settling in. \u201cAren\u2019t you excited?\u201d she crowed. I met her animated gaze for a long second. \u201cYou\u2019re kidnapping me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d She laughed and nodded. \u201cTill Saturday. Esme cleared it with Charlie; you\u2019re staying with me two nights, and I will drive you to and from school tomorrow.\u201d I turned my face to the window, my teeth grinding together. \u201cSorry,\u201d Alice said, not sounding in the least bit penitent. \u201cHe paid me off.\u201d \u201cHow?\u201d I hissed through my teeth. \u201cThe Porsche. It\u2019s exactly like the one I stole in Italy.\u201d She sighed happily. \u201cI\u2019m not supposed to drive it around Forks, but if you want, we could see how long it takes to get from here to L.A. \u2014 I bet I could have you back by midnight.\u201d I took a deep breath. \u201cI think I\u2019ll pass,\u201d I sighed, repressing a shudder. We wound, always too fast, down the long drive. Alice pulled around to the garage, and I quickly looked over the cars. Emmett\u2019s big jeep was there, with a shiny canary yellow Porsche between it and Rosalie\u2019s red convertible. Alice hopped out gracefully and went to stroke her hand along the length of her bribe. \u201cPretty, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cPretty over-the-top,\u201d I grumbled, incredulous. \u201cHe gave you that just for two days of holding me hostage?\u201d Alice made a face. A second later, comprehension came and I gasped in horror. \u201cIt\u2019s for every time he\u2019s gone, isn\u2019t it?\u201d She nodded. I slammed my door and stomped toward the house. She danced along next to me, still unrepentant. \u201cAlice, don\u2019t you think this is just a little bit controlling? Just a tiny bit psychotic, maybe?\u201d \u201cNot really.\u201d She sniffed. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem to grasp how dangerous a young werewolf can be.\u00a0 Especially when I can\u2019t see them. Edward has no way to know if you\u2019re safe. You shouldn\u2019t be so reckless.\u201d My voice turned acidic. \u201cYes, because a vampire slumber party is the pinnacle of safety conscious behavior.\u201d Alice laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a pedicure and everything,\u201d she promised. It wasn\u2019t so bad, except for the fact that I was being held against my will. Esme brought Italian food \u2014 the good stuff, all the way from Port Angeles \u2014 and Alice was prepared with my favorite movies. Even Rosalie was there, quietly in the background. Alice did insist on the pedicure, and I wondered if she was working from a list \u2014 maybe something she\u2019d compiled from watching bad sitcoms. \u00a0\u201cHow late do you want to stay up?\u201d she asked when my toenails were glistening a bloody red. Her enthusiasm remained untouched by my mood. \u201cI don\u2019t want to stay up. We have school in the morning.\u201d She pouted. \u201cWhere am I supposed to sleep, anyway?\u201d I measured the couch with my eyes. It was a little short. \u201cCan\u2019t you just keep me under surveillance at my house?\u201d \u201cWhat kind of a slumber party would that be?\u201d Alice shook her head in exasperation. \u201cYou\u2019re sleeping in Edward\u2019s room.\u201d I sighed. His black leather sofa was longer than this one. Actually, the gold carpet in his room was probably thick enough that the floor wouldn\u2019t be half bad either. \u00a0\u201cCan I go back to my place to get my things, at least?\u201d She grinned. \u201cAlready taken care of.\u201d \u201cAm I allowed to use your phone?\u201d \u201cCharlie knows where you are.\u201d \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to call Charlie.\u201d I frowned. \u201cApparently, I have some plans to cancel.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d She deliberated. \u201cI\u2019m not sure about that.\u201d \u201cAlice!\u201d I whined loudly. \u201cC\u2019mon!\u201d \u00a0\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d she said, flitting from the room. She was back in half a second, cell phone in hand. \u201cHe didn\u2019t specifically prohibit this . . . ,\u201d she murmured to herself as she handed it to me. I dialed Jacob\u2019s number, hoping he wasn\u2019t out running with his friends tonight. Luck was with me \u2014 Jacob was the one to answer. \u201cHello?\u201d \u00a0\u201cHey, Jake, it\u2019s me.\u201d Alice watched me with expressionless eyes for a second, before she turned and went to sit between Rosalie and Esme on the sofa. \u201cHi, Bella,\u201d Jacob said, suddenly cautious. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d \u201cNothing good. I can\u2019t come over Saturday after all.\u201d It was silent for a minute. \u201cStupid bloodsucker,\u201d he finally muttered. \u201cI thought he was leaving. Can\u2019t you have a life when he\u2019s gone? Or does he lock you in a coffin?\u201d I laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s funny.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m only laughing because you\u2019re close,\u201d I told him. \u201cBut he\u2019s going to be here Saturday, so it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d \u201cWill he be feeding there in Forks, then?\u201d Jacob asked cuttingly. \u201cNo.\u201d I didn\u2019t let myself get irritated with him. I wasn\u2019t that far from being as angry as he was. \u201cHe left early.\u201d \u00a0\u201cOh. Well, hey, come over now, then,\u201d he said with sudden enthusiasm. \u201cIt\u2019s not that late. Or I\u2019ll come up to Charlie\u2019s.\u201d \u201cI wish. I\u2019m not at Charlie\u2019s,\u201d I said sourly. \u201cI\u2019m kind of being held prisoner.\u201d He was silent as that sunk in, and then he growled. \u201cWe\u2019ll come and get you,\u201d he promised in a flat voice, slipping automatically into a plural. A chill slid down my spine, but I answered in a light and teasing voice. \u201cTempting. I have been tortured \u2014 Alice painted my toenails.\u201d \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be. They\u2019re just trying to keep me safe.\u201d He growled again. \u201cI know it\u2019s silly, but their hearts are in the right place.\u201d \u201cTheir hearts !\u201d he scoffed. \u201cSorry about Saturday,\u201d I apologized. \u201cI\u2019ve got to hit the sack\u201d \u2014 the couch, I corrected mentally \u2014 \u201cbut I\u2019ll call you again soon.\u201d \u00a0\u201cAre you sure they\u2019ll let you?\u201d he asked in a scathing tone. \u201cNot completely.\u201d I sighed. \u201c\u2019Night, Jake.\u201d \u201cSee you around.\u201d Alice was abruptly at my side, her hand held out for the phone, but I was already dialing. She saw the number. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019ll have his phone on him,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll leave a message.\u201d The phone rang four times, followed by a beep. There was no greeting. \u201cYou are in trouble,\u201d I said slowly, emphasizing each word. \u201cEnormous trouble. Angry grizzly bears are going to look tame next to what is waiting for you at home.\u201d I snapped the phone shut and placed it in her waiting hand. \u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d She grinned. \u201cThis hostage stuff is fun.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to sleep now,\u201d I announced, heading for the stairs. Alice tagged along. \u201cAlice,\u201d I sighed. \u201cI\u2019m not going to sneak out. You would know if I was planning to, and you\u2019d catch me if I tried.\u201d \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m just going to show you where your things are,\u201d she said innocently. Edward\u2019s room was at the farthest end of the third floor hallway, hard to mistake even when the huge house had been less familiar. But when I switched the light on, I paused in confusion. Had I picked the wrong door? Alice giggled. It was the same room, I realized quickly; the furniture had just been rearranged. The couch was pushed to the north wall and the stereo shoved up against the vast shelves of CDs \u2014 to make room for the colossal bed that now dominated the central space. The southern wall of glass reflected the scene back like a mirror, making it look twice as bad. It matched. The coverlet was a dull gold, just lighter than the walls; the frame was black, made of intricately patterned wrought iron. Sculpted metal roses wound in vines up the tall posts and formed a bowery lattice overhead. My pajamas were folded neatly on the foot of the bed, my bag of toiletries to one side. \u201cWhat the hell is all this?\u201d I spluttered. \u00a0\u201cYou didn\u2019t really think he would make you sleep on the couch, did you?\u201d I mumbled unintelligibly as I stalked forward to snatch my things off the bed. \u201cI\u2019ll give you some privacy,\u201d Alice laughed. \u201cSee you in the morning.\u201d After my teeth were brushed and I was dressed, I grabbed a puffy feather pillow off the huge bed and dragged the gold cover to the couch. I knew I was being silly, but I didn\u2019t care. Porsches as bribes and king-sized beds in houses where nobody slept \u2014 it was beyond irritating. I flipped off the lights and curled up on the sofa, wondering if I was too annoyed to sleep. In the dark, the glass wall was no longer a black mirror, doubling the room. The light of the moon brightened the clouds outside the window. As my eyes adjusted, I could see the diffused glow highlighting the tops of the trees, and glinting off a small slice of the river. I watched the silver light, waiting for my eyes to get heavy. There was a light knock on the door. \u00a0\u201cWhat, Alice?\u201d I hissed. I was on the defensive, imagining her amusement when she saw my makeshift bed. \u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d Rosalie said softly, opening the door enough that I could see the silver glow touch her perfect face. \u201cCan I come in?",

            "en": "7 REPETITION        11. CULT EACH TIME THAT I OPENED MY EYES TO THE MORNING light and realized I'd lived through another night was a surprise to me. After the surprise wore off, my heart would start to race and my palms would sweat; I couldn't really breathe again until I'd gotten up and ascertained that Charlie had survived as well. I could tell he was worried\u2014watching me jump at any loud sound, or my face suddenly go white for no reason that he could see. From the questions he asked now and then, he seemed to blame the change on Jacob's continued absence. The terror that was always foremost in my thoughts usually distracted me from the fact that another week had passed, and Jacob still hadn't called me. But when I was able to concentrate on my normal life\u2014if my life was really ever normal\u2014this upset me. I missed him horribly. It had been bad enough to be alone before I was scared silly. Now, more than ever, I yearned for his carefree laugh and his infectious grin. I needed the safe sanity of his homemade garage and his warm hand around my cold fingers. I'd half expected him to call on Monday. If there had been some progress with Embry, wouldn't he want to report it? I wanted to believe that it was worry for his friend that was occupying all his time, not that he was just giving up on me. I called him Tuesday, but no one answered. Were the phone lines still having problems? Or had Billy invested in caller I.D.?  On Wednesday I called every half hour until after eleven at night, desperate to hear the warmth of Jacob's voice. Thursday I sat in my truck in front of my house\u2014with the locks pushed down\u2014keys in hand, for a solid hour. I was arguing with myself, trying to justify a quick trip to La Push, but I couldn't do it. I knew that Laurent had gone back to Victoria by now. If I went to La Push, I took the chance of leading one of them there. What if they caught up to me when Jake was nearby? As much as it hurt me, I knew it was better for Jacob that he was avoiding me. Safer for him. It was bad enough that I couldn't figure out a way to keep Charlie safe. Nighttime was the most likely time that they would come looking for me, and what could I say to get Charlie out of the house? If I told him the truth, he'd have me locked up in a rubber room somewhere. I would have endured that\u2014welcomed it, even\u2014if it could have kept him safe. But Victoria would still come to his house first, looking for me. Maybe, if she found me here, that would be enough for her. Maybe she would just leave when she was done with me. So I couldn't run away. Even if I could, where would I go? To Renee? I shuddered at the thought of dragging my lethal shadows into my mother's safe, sunny world. I would never endanger her that way. The worry was eating a hole in my stomach. Soon I would have matching punctures. That night, Charlie did me another favor and called Harry again to see if the Blacks were out of town. Harry reported that Billy had attended the council meeting Wednesday night, and never mentioned anything about leaving. Charlie warned me not to make a nuisance of myself\u2014Jacob would call when he got around to it. Friday afternoon, as I drove home from school, it hit me out of the blue. I wasn't paying attention to the familiar road, letting the sound of the engine deaden my brain and silence the worries, when my subconscious delivered a verdict it must have been working on for some time without my knowledge. As soon as I thought of it, I felt really stupid for not seeing it sooner. Sure. I'd had a lot on my mind\u2014revenge-obsessed vampires, giant mutant wolves, a ragged hole in the center of my chest\u2014but when I laid the evidence out, it was embarrassingly obvious. Jacob avoiding me. Charlie saying he looked strange, upset. . . . Billy's vague, unhelpful answers. Holy crow, I knew exactly what was going on with Jacob. It was Sam Uley. Even my nightmares had been trying to tell me that. Sam had gotten to Jacob. Whatever was happening to the other boys on the reservation had reached out and stolen my friend. He'd been sucked into Sam's cult. He hadn't given up on me at all, I realized with a rush of feeling. I let my truck idle in front of my house. What should I do? I weighed the dangers against each other. If I went looking for Jacob, I risked the chance of Victoria or Laurent finding me with him. If I didn't go after him, Sam would pull him deeper into his frightening, compulsory gang. Maybe it would be too late if I didn't act soon. It had been a week, and no vampires had come for me yet. A week was more than enough time for them to have returned, so I must not be a priority. Most likely, as I'd decided before, they would come for me at night. The chances of them following me to La Push were much lower than the chance of losing Jacob to Sam. It was worth the danger of the secluded forest road. This was no idle visit to see what was going on. I knew what was going on. This was a rescue mission. I was going to talk to Jacob\u2014kidnap him if I had to. I'd once seen a PBS show on deprogramming the brainwashed. There had to be some kind of cure. I decided I'd better call Charlie first. Maybe whatever was going on down in La Push was something the police should be involved in. I dashed inside, in a hurry to be on my way. Charlie answered the phone at the station himself. \"Chief Swan.\" \"Dad, it's Bella.\" \"What's wrong? '\" I couldn't argue with his doomsday assumption this time. My voice was shaking. \"I'm worried about Jacob.\" \"Why? \" he asked, surprised by the unexpected topic. \"I think\u2026 I think something weird is going on down at the reservation. Jacob told me about some strange stuff happening with the other boys his age. Now he's acting the same way and I'm scared.\" \"What kind of stuff? \" He used his professional, police business voice. That was good; he was taking me seriously. \"First he was scared, and then he was avoiding me, and now\u2026 I'm afraid he's part of that bizarre gang down there, Sam's gang. Sam Uley's gang.\" \"Sam Uley? \" Charlie repeated, surprised again. \"Yes.\" Charlie's voice was more relaxed when he answered. \"I think you've got it wrong, Bells. Sam Uley is a great kid. Well, he's a man now. A good son. You should hear Billy talk about him. He's really doing wonders with the youth on the reservation. He's the one who\u2014\" Charlie broke off mid-sentence, and I guessed that he had been about to make a reference to the night I'd gotten lost in the woods. I moved on quickly. \"Dad, it's not like that. Jacob was scared of him.\" \"Did you talk to Billy about this? \" He was trying to soothe me now. I'd lost him as soon as I'd mentioned Sam. \"Billy's not concerned.\" \"Well, Bella, then I'm sure it's okay. Jacob's a kid; he was probably just messing around. I'm sure he's fine. He can't spend every waking minute with you, after all.\" \"This isn't about me,\" I insisted, but the battle was lost. \"I don't think you need to worry about this. Let Billy take care of Jacob.\" \"Charlie\u2026\" My voice was starting to sound whiney. \"Bells, I got a lot on my plate right now. Two tourists have gone missing off a trail outside crescent lake.\" There was an anxious edge to his voice. \"This wolf problem is getting out of hand.\" I was momentarily distracted\u2014stunned, really\u2014by his news. There was no way the wolves could have survived a match-up with Laurent\u2026 \"Are you sure that's what happened to them? \" I asked. \"Afraid so, honey. There was\u2014\" He hesitated. \"There were tracks again, and\u2026 some blood this time.\" \"Oh!\" It must not have come to a confrontation, then. Laurent must have simply outrun the wolves, but why? What I'd seen in the meadow just got stranger and stranger\u2014more impossible to understand. \"Look, I really have to go. Don't worry about Jake, Bella. I'm sure it's nothing.\" \"Fine,\" I said curtly, frustrated as his words reminded me of the more urgent crisis at hand. \"Bye.\" I hang up. I stared at the phone for a long minute. What the hell, I decided. Billy answered after two rings. \"Hello? \" \"Hey, Billy,\" I almost growled. I tried to sound more friendly as I continued. \"Can I talk to Jacob, please? \" \"Jake's not here.\" What a shock. \"Do you know where he is? \" \"He's out with his friends.\" Billy's voice was careful. \"Oh yeah? Anyone I know? Quil? \" I could tell the words didn't come across as casually as I'd meant them to. \"No,\" Billy said slowly. \"I don't think he's with Quil today.\" I knew better than to mention Sam's name. \"Embry? \" I asked. Billy seemed happier to answer this one. \"Yeah, he's with Embry.\" That was enough for me. Embry was one of them. \"Well, have him call me when he gets in, all right? \" \"Sure, sure. No problem.\" Click. \"See you soon, Billy,\" I muttered into the dead phone. I drove to La Push determined to wait. I'd sit out front of his house all night if I had to. I'd miss school. The boy was going to have to come home sometime, and when he did, he was going to have to talk to me. My mind was so preoccupied that the trip I'd been terrified of making seemed to take only a few seconds. Before I was expecting it, the forest began to thin, and I knew I would soon be able to see the first little houses of the reservation. Walking away, along the left side of the road, was a tall boy with a baseball cap. My breath caught for just a moment in my throat, hopeful that luck was with me for once, and I'd stumbled across Jacob without hardly trying. But this boy was too wide, and the hair was short under the hat. Even from behind, I was sure it was Quil, though he looked bigger than the last time I'd seen him. What was with these Quileute boys? Were they feeding them experimental growth hormones?  I crossed over to the wrong side of the road to stop next to him. He looked up when the roar of my truck approached. Quil's expression frightened me more than it surprised me. His face was bleak, brooding, his forehead creased with worry. \"Oh, hey, Bella,\" he greeted me dully. \"Hi, Quil\u2026 Are you okay? \" He stared at me morosely. \"Fine.\" \"Can I give you a ride somewhere? \" I offered. \"Sure, I guess,\" he mumbled. He shuffled around the front of the truck and opened the passenger door to climb in. \"Where to? \" \"My house is on the north side, back behind the store,\" he told me. \"Have you seen Jacob today.\" The question burst from me almost before he'd finished speaking. I looked at Quil eagerly, waiting for his answer. He stared out the windshield for a second before he spoke. \"From a distance,\" he finally said. \"A distance? \" I echoed. \"I tried to follow them\u2014he was with Embry.\" His voice was low, hard to hear over the engine. I leaned closer. \"I know they saw me. But they turned and just disappeared into the trees. I don't think they were alone\u2014I think Sam and his crew might have been with them.\u00a0 \u00a0\"I've been stumbling around in the forest for an hour, yelling for them. I just barely found the road again when you drove up.\" \"So Sam did get to him.\" The words were a little distorted\u2014my teeth were gritted together. Quil stared at me. \"You know about that.? \" I nodded. \"Jake told me\u2026 before.\" \"Before,\" Quil repeated, and sighed. \"Jacob's just as bad as the others now? \" \"Never leaves Sam's side.\" Quil turned his head and spit out the open window. \"And before that\u2014did he avoid everyone? Was he acting upset? \" His voice was low and rough. \"Not for as long as the others. Maybe one day. Then Sam caught up with him.\" \"What do you think it is? Drugs or something? \" \"I can't see Jacob or Embry getting into anything like that\u2026 but what do I know? What else could it be?  And why aren't the old people worried? \" He shook his head, and the fear showed in his eyes now. \"Jacob didn't want to be a part of this\u2026 cult. I don't understand what could change him.\" He stared at me, his face frightened. \"I don't want to be next.\" My eyes mirrored his fear. That was the second time I'd heard it described as a cult. I shivered. \"Are your parents any help? \" He grimaced. \"Right. My grandfather's on the council with Jacob's dad. Sam Uley is the best thing that ever happened to this place, as far as he's concerned.\" We stared at each other for a prolonged moment. We were in La Push now, and my truck was barely crawling along the empty road. I could see the village's only store not too far ahead. \"I'll get out now,\" Quil said. \"My house is right over there.\" He gestured toward the small wooden rectangle behind the store. I pulled over to the shoulder, and he jumped out. \"I'm going to go wait for Jacob,\" I told him in a hard voice. \"Good luck.\" He slammed the door and shuffled forward along the road, his head bent forward, his shoulders slumped. Quil's face haunted me as I made a wide U-turn and headed back toward the Blacks'. He was terrified of being next. What was happening here?  I stopped in front of Jacob's house, killing the motor and rolling down the windows. It was stuffy today, no breeze. I put my feet up on the dashboard and settled in to wait. A movement flashed in my peripheral vision\u2014I turned and spotted Billy looking at me through the front window with a confused expression. I waved once and smiled a tight smile, but stayed where I was.  His eyes narrowed; he let the curtain fall across the glass. I was prepared to stay as long as it took, but I wished I had something to do. I dug up a pen out of the bottom of my backpack, and an old test. I started to doodle on the back of the scrap. I'd only had time to <em>scrawl</em> one row of diamonds when there was a sharp tap against my door. I jumped, looking up, expecting Billy. \"What are you doing here, Bella.'\" Jacob growled. I stared at him in blank astonishment. Jacob had changed radically in the last weeks since I'd seen him. The first thing I noticed was his hair\u2014his beautiful hair was all gone, cropped quite short, covering his head with an inky gloss like black satin. The planes of his face seemed to have hardened subtly, tightened\u2026 aged. His neck and his shoulders were different, too, thicker somehow. His hands, where they gripped the window frame, looked enormous, with the tendons and veins more prominent under the russet skin. But the physical changes were insignificant. It was his expression that made him almost completely unrecognizable. The open,\u00a0 friendly smile was gone like the hair, the warmth in his dark eyes altered to a brooding resentment that was instantly disturbing. There was a darkness in Jacob now. Like my sun had imploded. \"Jacob? \" I whispered. He just stared at me, his eyes tense and angry. I realized we weren't alone. Behind him stood four others; all tall and russet-skinned, black hair chopped short just like Jacob's. They could have been brothers\u2014I couldn't even pick Embry out of the group. The resemblance was only intensified by the strikingly similar hostility in every pair of eyes. Every pair but one. The oldest by several years, Sam stood in the very back, his face serene and sure. I had to swallow back the bile that rose in my throat. I wanted to take a swing at him. No, I wanted to do more than that. More than anything, I wanted to be fierce and deadly, someone no one would dare mess with. Someone who would scare Sam Uley silly. I wanted to be a vampire. The violent desire caught me off guard and knocked the wind out of me. It was the most forbidden of all wishes\u2014even when I only wished it for a malicious reason like this, to gain an advantage over an enemy\u2014because it was the most painful. That future was lost to me forever, had never really been within my grasp. I scrambled to gain control of myself while the hole in my chest ached hollowly. \"What do you want? \" Jacob demanded, his expression growing more resentful as he watched the play of emotion across my face. \"I want to talk to you,\" I said in a weak voice. I tried to focus, but I was still reeling against the escape of my taboo dream. \"Go ahead,\" he hissed through his teeth. His glare was vicious. I'd never seen him look at anyone like that, least of all me. It hurt with a surprising intensity\u2014a physical pain, a stabbing in my head. \"Alone!\" I hissed, and my voice was stronger. He looked behind him, and I knew where his eyes would go. Every one of them was turned for Sam's reaction. Sam nodded once, his face unperturbed. He made a brief comment in an unfamiliar, liquid language\u2014I could only be positive that it wasn't French or Spanish, but I guessed that it was Quileute. He turned and walked into Jacob's house. The others, Paul, Jared, and Embry, I assumed, followed him in. \"Okay.\" Jacob seemed a bit less furious when the others were gone. His face was a little calmer, but also more hopeless. His mouth seemed permanently pulled down at the corners. I took a deep breath. \"You know what I want to know.\" He didn't answer. He just stared at me bitterly. I stared back and the silence stretched on. The pain in his face unnerved me. I felt a lump beginning to build in my throat. \"Can we walk? \" I asked while I could still speak. He didn't respond in any way; his face didn't change. I got out of the car, feeling unseen eyes behind the windows on me, and started walking toward the trees to the north. My feet squished in the damp grass and mud beside the road, and, as that was the only sound, at first I thought he wasn't following me. But when I glanced around, he was right beside me, his feet having somehow found a less noisy path than mine. I felt better in the fringe of trees, where Sam couldn't possibly be watching. As we walked, I struggled for the right thing to say, but nothing came. I just got more and more angry that Jacob had gotten sucked in\u2026 that Billy had allowed this\u2026 that Sam was able to stand there so assured and calm\u2026  Jacob suddenly picked up the pace, striding ahead of me easily with his long legs, and then swinging around to face me, planting himself in my path so I would have to stop too. I was distracted by the overt grace of his movement. Jacob had been nearly as klutzy as me with his never-ending growth spurt. When did that changed?  But Jacob didn't give me time to think about it. \"Let's get this over with,\" he said in a hard, husky voice. I waited. He knew what I wanted. \"It's not what you think.\" His voice was abruptly weary. \"It's not what I thought\u2014I was way off.\" \"So what is it, then? \" He studied my face for a long moment, speculating. The anger never completely left his eyes. \"I can't tell you,\" he finally said. My jaw tightened, and I spoke through my teeth. \"I thought we were friends.\" \"We were.\" There was a slight emphasis on the past tense. \"But you don't need friends anymore,\" I said sourly. \"You have Sam. Isn't that nice\u2014you've always looked up to him so much.\" \"I didn't understand him before.\" \"And now you've seen the light. Hallelujah.\" \"It wasn't like I thought it was. This isn't Sam's fault. He's helping me as much as he can.\" His voice turned brittle and he looked over my head, past me, rage burning out from his eyes. \"He's helping you,\" I repeated dubiously. \"Naturally.\" But Jacob didn't seem to be listening. He was taking deep, deliberate breaths, trying to calm himself. He was so mad that his hands were shaking. \"Jacob, please,\" I whispered \"Won't you tell me what happened? Maybe I can help.\" \"No one can help me now.\" The words were a low moan; his voice broke. \"What did he do to you? \" I demanded, tears collecting in my eyes. I reached out to him, as I had once before, stepping forward with my arms wide. This time he cringed away, holding his hands up defensively. \"Don't touch me,\" he whispered. \"Is Sam catching? \" I mumbled. The stupid tears had escaped the corners of my eyes. I wiped them away with the back of my hand, and folded my arms across my chest. \"Stop blaming Sam.\" The words came out fast, like a reflex. His hands reached up to twist around the hair that was no longer there, and then fell limply at his sides. \"Then who should I blame? \" I retorted. He halfway smiled; it was a bleak, twisted thing. \"You don't want to hear that.\" \"The hell I don't!\" I snapped. \"I want to know, and I want to know now.\" \"You're wrong,\" he snapped back. \"Don't you dare tell me I'm wrong\u2014I'm not the one who got brainwashed! Tell me now whose fault this all is, if it's not your precious Sam!\" \"You asked for it,\" he growled at me, eyes glinting hard. \"If you want to blame someone, why don't you point your finger at those filthy, reeking bloodsuckers that you love so much? \" My mouth fell open and my breath came out with a whooshing sound. I was frozen in place, stabbed through with his double-edged words. The pain twisted in familiar patterns through my body, the jagged hole ripping me open from the inside out, but it was second place, background music to the chaos of my thoughts. I couldn't believe that I'd heard him correctly. There was no trace of indecision in his face. Only fury. My mouth still hung wide. \"I told you that you didn't want to hear it,\" he said. \"I don't understand who you mean,\" I whispered. He raised one eyebrow in disbelief. \"I think you understand exactly who I mean. You're not going to make me say it, are you? I don't like hurting you.\" \"I don't understand who you mean,\" I repeated mechanically. \"The Cullens,\" he said slowly, drawing out the word, scrutinizing my face as he spoke it. \"I saw that\u2014I can see in your eyes what it does to you when I say their name.\" I shook my head back and forth in denial, trying to clear it at the same time. How did he know this? And how did it have anything to do with Sam's cult? Was it a gang of vampire-haters? What was the point of forming such a society when no vampires lived in Forks anymore? Why would Jacob start believing the stories about the Cullens now, when the evidence of them was long gone, never to return?  It took me too long to come up with the correct response. \"Don't tell me you're listening to Billy's superstitious nonsense now,\" I said with a feeble attempt at mockery. \"He knows more than I gave him credit for.\" \"Be serious, Jacob.\" He glared at me, his eyes critical. \"Superstitions aside,\" I said quickly. \"I still don't see what you're accusing the... Cullens\"\u2014wince\u2014\"of. \u00a0They left more than half a year ago. How can you blame them for what Sam is doing now? \" \"Sam isn't doing anything, Bella. And I know they're gone. But sometimes\u2026 things are set in motion, and then it's too late.\" \"What's set in motion? What's too late? What are you blaming them for? \" He was suddenly right in my face, his fury glowing in his eyes. \"For existing,\" he hissed. I was surprised and distracted as the warning words came in Edward's voice again, when I wasn't even scared. \"Quiet now, Bella. Don't push him,\" Edward cautioned in my ear. Ever since Edward's name had broken through the careful walls I'd buried it behind, I'd been unable to lock it up again. It didn't hurt now\u2014not during the precious seconds when I could hear his voice. Jacob was fuming in front of me, quivering with anger. I didn't understand why the Edward delusion was unexpectedly in my mind. Jacob was livid, but he was Jacob. There was no adrenaline, no danger. \"Give him a chance to calm down,\" Edward's voice insisted. I shook my head in confusion. \"You're being ridiculous,\" I told them both. \"Fine,\" Jacob answered, breathing deeply again. \"I won't argue it with you. It doesn't matter anyway, the damage is done.\" \"What damage? \" He didn't flinch as I shouted the words in his face. \"Let's head back. There's nothing more to say.\" I gaped. \"There's everything more to say! You haven't said anything yet!\" He walked past me, striding back toward the house. \"I ran into Quil today,\" I yelled after him. He paused midstep, but didn't turn. \"You remember your friend, Quil? Yeah, he's terrified.\" Jacob whirled to face me. His expression was pained. \"Quil\" was all he said. \"He's worried about you, too. He's freaked out.\" Jacob stared past me with desperate eyes. I goaded him further. \"He's frightened that he's next.\" Jacob clutched at a tree for support, his face turning a strange shade of green under the red-brown surface. \"He won't be next,\" Jacob muttered to himself. \"He can't be. It's over now. This shouldn't still be happening. Why? Why? \" His fist slammed against the tree. It wasn't a big tree, slender and only a few feet taller than Jacob. But it still surprised me when the trunk gave way and snapped off loudly under his blows. Jacob stared at the sharp, broken point with shock that quickly turned to horror. \"I have to get back.\" He whirled and stalked away so swiftly that I had to jog to keep up. \"Back to Sam!\" \"That's one way of looking at it,\" it sounded like he said. He was mumbling and facing away. I chased him back to the truck. \"Wait!\" I called as he turned toward the house. He spun around to face me, and I saw that his hands were shaking again. \"Go home, Bella. I can't hang out with you anymore.\" The silly, inconsequential hurt was incredibly potent. The tears welled up again. \"Are you\u2026 breaking up with me? \" The words were all wrong, but they were the best way I could think to phrase what I was asking. After all, what Jake and I had was more than any schoolyard romance. Stronger. He barked out a bitter laugh. \"Hardly. If that were the case, I'd say 'Let's stay friends.' I can't even say that.\" \"Jacob\u2026 why? Sam won't let you have other friends? Please, Jake. You promised. I need you!\" The blank emptiness of my life before\u2014before Jacob brought some semblance of reason back into it\u2014reared up and confronted me. Loneliness choked in my throat. \"I'm sorry, Bella,\" Jacob said each word distinctly in a cold voice that didn't seem to belong to him. I didn't believe that this was really what Jacob wanted to say. It seemed like there was something else trying to be said through his angry eyes, but I couldn't understand the message. Maybe this wasn't about Sam at all. Maybe this had nothing to do with the Cullens. Maybe he was just trying to pull himself out of a hopeless situation. Maybe I should let him do that, if that's what was best for him. I should do that. It would be right. But I heard my voice escaping in a whisper. \"I'm sorry that I couldn't\u2026 before\u2026 I wish I could change how I feel about you, Jacob.\" I was desperate, reaching, stretching the truth so far that it curved nearly into the shape of a lie. \"Maybe\u2026 maybe I would change,\" I whispered. \"Maybe, if you gave me some time\u2026 just don't quit on me now, Jake. I can't take it.\" His face went from anger to agony in a second. One shaking hand reached out toward me. \"No. Don't think like that, Bella, please. Don't blame yourself, don't think this is your fault. This one is all me. I swear, it's not about you.\" \"It's not you, it's me,\" I whispered. \"There's a new one.\" \"I mean it, Bella. I'm not\u2026\" he struggled, his voice going even huskier as he fought to control his emotion. His eyes were tortured. \"I'm not good enough to be your friend anymore, or anything else. I'm not what I was before. I'm not good.\" \"What? \" I stared at him, confused and appalled. \"What are you saying? You're much better than I am, Jake. You are good! Who told you that you aren't? Sam? It's a vicious lie, Jacob! Don't let him tell you that!\" I was suddenly yelling again. Jacob's face went hard and flat. \"No one had to tell me anything. I know what I am.\" \"You're my friend, that's what you are! Jake\u2014don't!\" He was backing away from me. \"I'm sorry, Bella,\" he said again; this time it was a broken mumble. He turned and almost ran into the house. I was unable to move from where I stood. I stared at the little house; it looked too small to hold four large boys and two larger men. There was no reaction inside. No flutter at the edge of the curtain, no sound of voices or movement. It faced me vacantly. The rain started to drizzle, stinging here and there against my skin. I couldn't take my eyes off the house. Jacob would come back. He had to. The rain picked up, and so did the wind. The drops were no longer falling from above; they slanted at an angle from the west. I could smell the brine from the ocean. My hair whipped in my face, sticking to the wet places and tangling in my lashes. I waited. Finally the door opened, and I took a step forward in relief. Billy rolled his chair into the door frame. I could see no one behind him. \"Charlie just called, Bella. I told him you were on your way home.\" His eyes were full of pity. The pity made it final somehow. I didn't comment. I just turned robotically and climbed in my truck. I'd left the windows open and the seats were slick and wet. It didn't matter. I was already soaked. Not as bad! Not as bad! my mind tried to comfort me. It was true. This wasn't as bad. This wasn't the end of the world, not again. This was just the end of what little peace there was left behind. That was all. Not as bad, I agreed, then added, but bad enough. I'd thought Jake had been healing the hole in me\u2014or at least plugging it up, keeping it from hurting me so much. I'd been wrong. He'd just been carving out his own hole, so that I was now riddled through like Swiss cheese. I wondered why I didn't crumble into pieces. Charlie was waiting on the porch. As I rolled to a stop, he walked out to meet me. \"Billy called. He said you got in fight with Jake\u2014said you were pretty upset,\" he explained as he opened my door for me. Then he looked at my face. A kind of horrified recognition registered in his expression. I tried to feel my face from the inside out, to know what he was seeing. My face felt empty and cold, and I realized what it would remind him of. \"That's not exactly how it happened,\" I muttered. Charlie put his arm around me and helped me out of the car. He didn't comment on my sodden clothes. \"Then what did happen'\" he asked when we were inside. He pulled the afghan off the back of the sofa as he spoke and wrapped it around my shoulders. I realized I was shivering still. My voice was lifeless. \"Sam Uley says Jacob can't be my friend anymore.\" Charlie shot me a strange look. \"Who told you that? \" \"Jacob,\" I stated, though that wasn't exactly what he'd said. It was still true. Charlie's eyebrows pulled together. \"You really think there's something wrong with the Uley kid? \" \"I know there is. Jacob wouldn't tell me what, though.\" I could hear the water from my clothes dripping to the floor and splashing on the linoleum. \"I'm going to go change.\" Charlie was lost in thought. \"Okay,\" he said absently. I decided to take a shower because I was so cold, but the hot water didn't seem to affect the temperature of my skin. I was still freezing when I gave up and shut the water off. In the sudden quiet, I could hear Charlie talking to someone downstairs. I wrapped a towel around me, and cracked the bathroom door. Charlie's voice was angry. \"I'm not buying that. It doesn't make any sense.\" It was quiet then, and I realized he was on the phone. A minute passed. \"Don't you put this on Bella!\" Charlie suddenly shouted. I jumped. When he spoke again, his voice was careful and lower. \"Bella's made it very clear all along that she and Jacob were just friends\u2026 Well, if that was it, then why didn't you say so at first? No, Billy, I think she's right about this\u2026 Because I know my daughter, and if she says Jacob was scared before\u2014\" He was cut off mid-sentence, and when he answered he was almost shouting again. \"What do you mean I don't know my daughter as well as I think I do!\" He listened for a brief second, and his response was almost too low for me to hear. \"If you think I'm going to remind her about that, then you had better think again. She's only just starting to get over it, and mostly because of Jacob, I think. If whatever Jacob has going on with this Sam character sends her back into that depression, then Jacob is going to have to answer to me. You're my friend, Billy, but this is hurting my family.\" There was another break for Billy to respond. \"You got that right\u2014those boys set one toe out of line and I'm going to know about it. We'll be keeping an eye on the situation, you can be sure of that.\" He was no longer Charlie; he was Chief Swan now. \"Fine. Yeah. Goodbye.\" The phone slammed into the cradle. I tiptoed quickly across the hall into my room. Charlie was muttering angrily in the kitchen.  So Billy was going to blame me. I was leading Jacob on and he'd finally had enough. It was strange, for I'd feared that myself, but after the last thing Jacob had said this afternoon, I didn't believe it anymore. There was much more to this than an unrequited crush, and it surprised me that Billy would stoop to claiming that. It made me think that whatever secret they were keeping was bigger than I'd been imagining. At least Charlie was on my side now. I put my pajamas on and crawled into bed. Life seemed dark enough at the moment that I let myself cheat. The hole\u2014holes now\u2014were already aching, so why not? I pulled out the memory\u2014nor a real memory that would hurt too much, but the false memory of Edward's voice in my mind this afternoon\u2014and played it over and over in my head until I fell asleep with the tears still streaming calmly down my empty face. It was a new dream tonight. Rain was falling and Jacob was walking soundlessly beside me, though beneath my feet the ground crunched like dry gravel. But he wasn't my Jacob; he was the new, bitter, graceful Jacob. The smooth suppleness of his walk reminded me of someone else, and, as I watched, his features started to change. The russet color of his skin leached away, leaving his face pale white like bone. His eyes turned gold, and then crimson, and then back to gold again. His short hair twisted in the breeze, turning bronze where the wind touched it. And his face became so beautiful that it shattered my heart. I reached for him, but he took a step away, raising his hands like a shield. And then Edward vanished. I wasn't sure, when I woke in the dark, if I'd just begun crying, or if my tears had run while I slept and simply continued now. I stared at my dark ceiling. I could feel that it was the middle of the night\u2014I was still half-asleep, maybe more than half. I closed my eyes wearily and prayed for a dreamless sleep. That's when I heard the noise that must have wakened me in the first place. Something sharp scraped along the length of my window with a high-pitched squeal, like fingernails against the glass.",

            "en": "Ch\u1ea1ng V\u1ea1ng - Twilight            2. OPEN BOOK The next day was better\u2026 and worse. It was better because it wasn't raining yet, though the clouds were dense and opaque. It was easier because I knew what to expect of my day. Mike came to sit by me in English, and walked me to my next class, with Chess Club Eric glaring at him all the while; that was nattering. People didn't look at me quite as much as they had yesterday. I sat with a big group at lunch that included Mike, Eric, Jessica, and several other people whose names and faces I now remembered. I began to feel like I was treading water, instead of drowning in it.  It was worse because I was tired; I still couldn't sleep with the wind echoing around the\u00a0 house. It was worse because Mr. Varner called on me in Trig when my hand wasn't raised and I had the wrong answer. It was miserable because I had to play volleyball, and the one time I didn't cringe out of the way of the ball, I hit my teammate in the head with it. And it was worse because Edward Cullen wasn't in school at all. \u00a0All morning I was dreading lunch, fearing his bizarre glares. Part of me wanted to confront him and demand to know what his problem was. While I was lying sleepless in my bed, I even imagined what I would say. But I knew myself too well to think I would really have the guts to do it. I made the Cowardly Lion look like the terminator. But when I walked into the cafeteria with Jessica \u2014 trying to keep my eyes from sweeping the place for him, and failing entirely \u2014 I saw that his four siblings of sorts were sitting together at the same table, and he was not with them. Mike intercepted us and steered us to his table. Jessica seemed elated by the attention, and her friends quickly joined us. But as I tried to listen to their easy chatter, I was terribly uncomfortable, waiting nervously for the moment he would arrive. I hoped that he would simply ignore me when he came, and prove my suspicions false. He didn't come, and as time passed I grew more and more tense. I walked to Biology with more confidence when, by the end of lunch, he still hadn't showed. Mike, who was taking on the qualities of a golden retriever, walked faithfully by my side to class. I held my breath at the door, but Edward Cullen wasn't there, either. I exhaled and went to my seat. Mike followed, talking about an upcoming trip to the beach. He lingered by my desk till the bell rang. Then he smiled at me wistfully and went to sit by a girl with braces and a bad perm. It looked like I was going to have to do something about Mike, and it wouldn't be easy. In a town like this, where everyone lived on top of everyone else, diplomacy was essential. I had never been enormously tactful; I had no practice dealing with overly friendly boys. I was relieved that I had the desk to myself, that Edward was absent. I told myself that repeatedly. But I couldn't get rid of the nagging suspicion that I was the reason he wasn't there. It was ridiculous, and egotistical, to think that I could affect anyone that strongly. It was impossible. And yet I couldn't stop worrying that it was true. When the school day was finally done, and the blush was fading out of my cheeks from the volleyball incident, I changed quickly back into my jeans and navy blue sweater. I hurried from the girls' locker room, pleased to find that I had successfully evaded my retriever friend for the moment. I walked swiftly out to the parking lot. It was crowded now with fleeing students. I got in my truck and dug through my bag to make sure I had what I needed. Last night I'd discovered that Charlie couldn't cook much besides fried eggs and bacon. So I requested that I be assigned kitchen detail for the duration of my stay. He was willing enough to hand over the keys to the banquet hall. I also found out that he had no food in the house. So I had my shopping list and the cash from the jar in the cupboard labeled FOOD MONEY, and I was on my way to the Thriftway. I gunned my deafening engine to life, ignoring the heads that turned in my direction, and backed carefully into a place in the line of cars that were waiting to exit the parking lot. As I waited, trying to pretend that the earsplitting rumble was coming from someone else's car, I saw the two Cullens and the Hale twins getting into their car. It was the shiny new Volvo. Of course. I hadn't noticed their clothes before \u2014 I'd been too mesmerized by their faces. Now that I looked, it was obvious that they were all dressed exceptionally well; simply, but in clothes that subtly hinted at designer origins. With their remarkable good looks, the style with which they carried themselves, they could have worn dishrags and pulled it off. It seemed excessive for them to have both looks and money.  But as far as I could tell, life worked that way most of the time. It didn't look as if it bought them any acceptance here.  No, I didn't fully believe that. The isolation must be their desire; I couldn't imagine any door that wouldn't be opened by that degree of beauty. They looked at my noisy truck as I passed them, just like everyone else.  I kept my eyes straight forward and was relieved when I finally was free of the school grounds.  The Thriftway was not far from the school, just a few streets south, off the highway. It was nice to be inside the supermarket; it felt normal. I did the shopping at home, and I fell into the pattern of the familiar task gladly. The store was big enough inside that I couldn't hear the tapping of the rain on the roof to remind me where I was. When I got home, I unloaded all the groceries, stuffing them in wherever I could find an open space. I hoped Charlie wouldn't mind. I wrapped potatoes in foil and stuck them in the oven to bake, covered a steak in marinade and balanced it on top of a carton of eggs in the fridge.  When I was finished with that, I took my book bag upstairs. Before starting my homework, I changed into a pair of dry sweats, pulled my damp hair up into a pony-tail, and checked my e-mail for the first time. I had three messages. \"Bella,\" my mom wrote\u2026  Write me as soon as you get in. Tell me how your flight was. Is it raining? I miss you\u00a0 already. I'm almost finished packing for Florida, but I can't find my pink blouse. Do you know where I put it? Phil says hi.  Mom. I sighed and went to the next. It was sent eight hours after the first. \"Bella,\" she wrote\u2026 Why haven't you e-mailed me yet? What are you waiting for? Mom. The last was from this morning. Isabella, If I haven't heard from you by 5:30 p.m. today I'm calling Charlie. I checked the clock. I still had an hour, but my mom was well known for jumping the gun. Mom, Calm down. I'm writing right now. Don't do anything rash. Bella. I sent that, and began again. Mom, Everything is great. Of course it's raining. I was waiting for something to write about. School isn't bad, just a little repetitive. I met some nice kids who sit by me at lunch. Your blouse is at the dry cleaners - you were supposed to pick it up Friday. Charlie bought me a truck, can you believe it? I love it. It's old, but really sturdy, which is good, you know, for me. I miss you, too. I'll write again soon, but I'm not going to check my e-mail every five minutes. Relax, breathe. I love you. Bella. I had decided to read Wuthering Heights \u2014 the novel we were currently studying in English \u2014 yet again for the fun of it, and that's what I was doing when Charlie came home. I'd lost track of the time, and I hurried downstairs to take the potatoes out and put the steak in to broil. \"Bella?\" my father called out when he heard me on the stairs. Who else? I thought to myself. \"Hey, Dad, welcome home.\" \"Thanks.\" He hung up his gun belt and stepped out of his boots as I bustled about the kitchen. As far as I was aware, he'd never shot the gun on the job. But he kept it ready. When I came here as a child, he would always remove the bullets as soon as he walked in the door. I guess he considered me old enough now not to shoot myself by accident, and not depressed enough to shoot myself on purpose.  \"What's for dinner?\" he asked warily. My mother was an imaginative cook, and her experiments weren't always edible. I was surprised, and sad, that he seemed to remember that far back. \"Steak and potatoes,\" I answered, and he looked relieved. He seemed to feel awkward standing in the kitchen doing nothing; he lumbered into the living room to watch TV while I worked. We were both more comfortable that way. I made a salad while the steaks cooked, and set the table. I called him in when dinner was ready, and he sniffed appreciatively as he walked into the room. \"Smells good, Bell.\" \"Thanks.\" We ate in silence for a few minutes. It wasn't uncomfortable. Neither of us was bothered by the quiet. In some ways, we were well suited for living together. \"So, how did you like school? Have you made any friends?\" he asked as he was taking seconds. \"Well, I have a few classes with a girl named Jessica. I sit with her friends at lunch. And there's this boy, Mike, who's very friendly. Everybody seems pretty nice.\" With one outstanding exception. \"That must be Mike Newton. Nice kid \u2014 nice family. His dad owns the sporting goods store just outside of town. He makes a good living off all the backpackers who come through here.\" \" Do you know the Cullen family?\" I asked hesitantly.  \"Dr. Cullen's family? Sure. Dr. Cullen's a great man.\" \"They\u2026 the kids\u2026 are a little different. They don't seem to fit in very well at school.\" Charlie surprised me by looking angry. \"People in this town,\" he muttered.\u201dDr. Cullen is a brilliant surgeon who could probably work in any hospital in the world, make ten times the salary he gets here,\" he continued, getting louder.\u201dWe're lucky to have him \u2014 lucky that his wife wanted to live in a small town. He's an asset to the community, and all of those kids are well behaved and polite. I had my doubts, when they first moved in, with all those adopted teenagers. I thought we might have some problems with them. But they're all very mature \u2014 I haven't had one speck of trouble from any of them. That's more than I can say for the children of some folks who have lived in this town for generations. And they stick together the way a family should \u2014 camping trips every other weekend\u2026  Just because they're newcomers, people have to talk.\" It was the longest speech I'd ever heard Charlie make. He must feel strongly about whatever people were saying. I backpedaled.\u201dThey seemed nice enough to me. I just noticed they kept to themselves. They're all very attractive,\" I added, trying to be more complimentary. \"You should see the doctor,\" Charlie said, laughing.\u201dIt's a good thing he's happily married. A lot of the nurses at the hospital have a hard time concentrating on their work with him around.\" We lapsed back into silence as we finished eating. He cleared the table while I started on the dishes. He went back to the TV, and after I finished washing the dishes by hand \u2014 no\u00a0 dishwasher \u2014 I went upstairs unwillingly to work on my math homework. I could feel a tradition in the making. That night it was finally quiet. I fell asleep quickly, exhausted. The rest of the week was uneventful. I got used to the routine of my classes. By Friday I was able to recognize, if not name, almost all the students at school. In Gym, the kids on my team learned not to pass me the ball and to step quickly in front of me if the other team tried to take advantage of my weakness. I happily stayed out of their way. Edward Cullen didn't come back to school. Every day, I watched anxiously until the rest of the Cullens entered the cafeteria without him. Then I could relax and join in the lunchtime conversation. Mostly it centered around a trip to the La Push Ocean Park in two weeks that Mike was putting together. I was invited, and I had agreed to go, more out of politeness than desire. Beaches should be hot and dry. By Friday I was perfectly comfortable entering my Biology class, no longer worried that Edward would be there. For all I knew, he had dropped out of school. I tried not to think about him, but I couldn't totally suppress the worry that I was responsible for his continued absence, ridiculous as it seemed. My first weekend in Forks passed without incident. Charlie, unused to spending time in the usually empty house, worked most of the weekend. I cleaned the house, got ahead on my homework, and wrote my mom more bogusly cheerful e-mail. I did drive to the library Saturday, but it was so poorly stocked that I didn't bother to get a card; I would have to make a date to visit Olympia or Seattle soon and find a good bookstore. I wondered idly what kind of gas mileage the truck got\u2026 and shuddered at the thought. The rain stayed soft over the weekend, quiet, so I was able to sleep well. People greeted me in the parking lot Monday morning. I didn't know all their names, but I waved back and smiled at everyone. It was colder this morning, but happily not raining. In English, Mike took his accustomed seat by my side. We had a pop quiz on Wuthering Heights. It was straightforward, very easy. All in all, I was feeling a lot more comfortable than I had thought I would feel by this point. More comfortable than I had ever expected to feel here. When we walked out of class, the air was full of swirling bits of white. I could hear people shouting excitedly to each other. The wind bit at my cheeks, my nose. \"Wow,\" Mike said.\u201dIt's snowing.\" I looked at the little cotton fluffs that were building up along the sidewalk and swirling erratically past my face.  \"Ew.\" Snow. There went my good day. He looked surprised.\u201dDon't you like snow?\" \"No. That means it's too cold for rain.\" Obviously.\u201dBesides, I thought it was supposed to come down in flakes \u2014 you know, each one unique and all that. These just look like the ends of Q-tips.\" \"Haven't you ever seen snow fall before?\" he asked incredulously. \"Sure I have.\" I paused.\u201dOn TV.\" Mike laughed. And then a big, squishy ball of dripping snow smacked into the back of his head. We both turned to see where it came from. I had my suspicions about Eric, who was walking away, his back toward us \u2014 in the wrong direction for his next class. Mike appatently had the same notion.  He bent over and began scraping together a pile of the white mush. \"I'll see you at lunch, okay?\" I kept walking as I spoke.\u201dOnce people start throwing wet stuff, I go inside.\" He just nodded, his eyes on Eric's retreating figure. Throughout the morning, everyone chattered excitedly about the snow; apparently it was the first snowfall of the new year. I kept my mouth shut. Sure, it was drier than rain \u2014 until it melted in your socks. I walked alertly to the cafeteria with Jessica after Spanish. Mush balls were flying everywhere. I kept a binder in my hands, ready to use it as a shield if necessary. Jessica thought I was hilarious, but something in my expression kept her from lobbing a snowball at me herself. Mike caught up to us as we walked in the doors, laughing, with ice melting the spikes in his hair. He and Jessica were talking animatedly about the snow fight as we got in line to buy food. I glanced toward that table in the corner out of habit. And then I froze where I stood. There were five people at the table. Jessica pulled on my arm. \"Hello? Bella? What do you want?\" I looked down; my ears were hot. I had no reason to feel self-conscious, I reminded myself. I hadn't done anything wrong. \"What's with Bella?\" Mike asked Jessica. \"Nothing,\" I answered.\u201dI'll just get a soda today.\" I caught up to the end of the line. \"Aren't you hungry?\" Jessica asked. \"Actually, I feel a little sick,\" I said, my eyes still on the floor. I waited for them to get their food, and then followed them to a table, my eyes on my feet. I sipped my soda slowly, my stomach churning. Twice Mike asked, with unnecessary concern, how I was feeling. I told him it was nothing, but I was wondering if I should play it up and escape to the nurse's office for the next hour. Ridiculous. I shouldn't have to run away.  I decided to permit myself one glance at the Cullen family's table. If he was glaring at me, I would skip Biology, like the coward I was. I kept my head down and glanced up under my lashes. None of them were looking this way. I lifted my head a little. They were laughing. Edward, Jasper, and Emmett all had their hair entirely saturated with melting snow. Alice and Rosalie were leaning away as Emmett shook his dripping hair toward them. They were enjoying the snowy day, just like everyone else \u2014 only they looked more like a scene from a movie than the rest of us. But, aside from the laughter and playfulness, there was something different, and I couldn't quite pinpoint what that difference was. I examined Edward the most carefully. His skin was less pale, I decided \u2014 flushed from the snow fight maybe \u2014 the circles under his eyes much less noticeable. But there was something more. I pondered, staring, trying to isolate the change. \"Bella, what are you staring at?\" Jessica intruded, her eyes following my stare. At that precise moment, his eyes flashed over to meet mine. I dropped my head, letting my hair fall to conceal my face. I was sure, though, in the instant our eyes met, that he didn't look harsh or unfriendly as he had the last time I'd seen him. He looked merely curious again, unsatisfied in some way. \"Edward Cullen is staring at you,\" Jessica giggled in my ear. \"He doesn't look angry, does he?\" I couldn't help asking. \"No,\" she said, sounding confused by my question.\u201dShould he be?\" \"I don't think he likes me,\" I confided. I still felt queasy. I put my head down on my arm. \"The Cullens don't like anybody\u2026 well, they don't notice anybody enough to like them. But he's still staring at you.\" \"Stop looking at him,\" I hissed. She snickered, but she looked away. I raised my head enough to make sure that she did, contemplating violence if she resisted. Mike interrupted us then \u2014 he was planning an epic battle of the blizzard in the parking lot after school and wanted us to join. Jessica agreed enthusiastically. The way she looked at Mike left little doubt that she would be up for anything he suggested. I kept silent. I would have to hide in the gym until the parking lot cleared. For the rest of the lunch hour I very carefully kept my eyes at my own table. I decided to honor the bargain I'd made with myself. Since he didn't look angry, I would go to Biology. My stomach did frightened little flips at the thought of sitting next to him again. I didn't really want to walk to class with Mike as usual \u2014 he seemed to be a popular target for the snowball snipers \u2014 but when we went to the door, everyone besides me groaned in unison. It was raining, washing all traces of the snow away in clear, icy ribbons down the side of the walkway. I pulled my hood up, secretly pleased. I would be free to go straight home after Gym. Mike kept up a string of complaints on the way to building four. Once inside the classroom, I saw with relief that my table was still empty. Mr. Banner was walking around the room, distributing one microscope and box of slides to each table. Class didn't start for a few minutes, and the room buzzed with conversation. I kept my eyes away from the door, doodling idly on the cover of my notebook. I heard very clearly when the chair next to me moved, but my eyes stayed carefully focused on the pattern I was drawing. \"Hello,\" said a quiet, musical voice. I looked up, stunned that he was speaking to me. He was sitting as far away from me as the desk allowed, but his chair was angled toward me. His hair was dripping wet, disheveled \u2014 even so, he looked like he'd just finished shooting a commercial for hair gel. His dazzling face was friendly, open, a slight smile on his flawless lips. But his eyes were careful. \"My name is Edward Cullen,\" he continued.\u201dI didn't have a chance to introduce myself last week. You must be Bella Swan.\" My mind was spinning with confusion. Had I made up the whole thing? He was perfectly polite now. I had to speak; he was waiting. But I couldn't think of anything conventional to say. \"H-how do you know my name?\" I stammered.  He laughed a soft, enchanting laugh. \"Oh, I think everyone knows your name. The whole town's been waiting for you to arrive.\" I grimaced. I knew it was something like that. \"No,\" I persisted stupidly.\u201dI meant, why did you call me Bella?\" He seemed confused.\u201dDo you prefer Isabella?\" \"No, I like Bella,\" I said.\u201dBut I think Charlie \u2014 I mean my dad \u2014 must call me Isabella behind my back \u2014 that's what everyone here seems to know me as,\" I tried to explain, feeling like an utter moron. \"Oh.\" He let it drop. I looked away awkwardly.  Thankfully, Mr. Banner started class at that moment. I tried to concentrate as he explained the lab we would be doing today. The slides in the box were out of order. Working as lab partners, we had to separate the slides of onion root tip cells into the phases of mitosis they represented and label them accordingly. We weren't supposed to use our books. In twenty minutes, he would be coming around to see who had it right. \"Get started,\" he commanded. \"Ladies first, partner?\" Edward asked. I looked up to see him smiling a crooked smile so beautiful that I could only stare at him like an idiot. \"Or I could start, if you wish.\" The smile faded; he was obviously wondering if I was mentally competent. \"No,\" I said, flushing.\u201dI'll go ahead.\" I was showing off, just a little. I'd already done this lab, and I knew what I was looking for. It should be easy. I snapped the first slide into place under the microscope and adjusted it quickly to the 40X objective. I studied the slide briefly. My assessment was confident.\u201dProphase.\" \"Do you mind if I look?\" he asked as I began to remove the slide. His hand caught mine, to stop me, as he asked. His fingers were ice-cold, like he'd been holding them in a snowdrift before class. But that wasn't why I jerked my hand away so quickly. When he touched me, it stung my hand as if an electric current had passed through us. \"I'm sorry,\" he muttered, pulling his hand back immediately. However, he continued to reach for the microscope. I watched him, still staggered, as he examined the slide for an even shorter time than I had. \"Prophase,\" he agreed, writing it neatly in the first space on our worksheet. He swiftly switched out the first slide for the second, and then glanced at it cursorily. \"Anaphase,\" he murmured, writing it down as he spoke.  I kept my voice indifferent.\u201dMay I?\" He smirked and pushed the microscope to me. I looked through the eyepiece eagerly, only to be disappointed. Dang it, he was right. \"Slide three?\" I held out my hand without looking at him. He handed it to me; it seemed like he was being careful not to touch my skin again. I took the most fleeting look I could manage. \"Interphase.\" I passed him the microscope before he could ask for it. He took a swift peek, and then wrote it down. I would have written it while he looked, but his clear, elegant script intimidated me. I didn't want to spoil the page with my clumsy <em>scrawl</em>. We were finished before anyone else was close. I could see Mike and his partner comparing two slides again and again, and another group had their book open under the table. Which left me with nothing to do but try to not look at him\u2026 unsuccessfully. I glanced up, and he was staring at me, that same inexplicable look of frustration in his eyes. Suddenly I identified that subtle difference in his face. \"Did you get contacts?\" I blurted out unthinkingly. He seemed puzzled by my unexpected question.\u201dNo.\" \"Oh,\" I mumbled.\u201dI thought there was something different about your eyes.\" He shrugged, and looked away. In fact, I was sure there was something different. I vividly remembered the flat black color of his eyes the last time he'd glared at me \u2014 the color was striking against the background of his pale skin and his auburn hair. Today, his eyes were a completely different color: a strange ocher, darker than butterscotch, but with the same golden tone. I didn't understand how that could be, unless he was lying for some reason about the contacts. Or maybe Forks was making me crazy in the literal sense of the word. I looked down. His hands were clenched into hard fists again. Mr. Banner came to our table then, to see why we weren't working. He looked over our shoulders to glance at the completed lab, and then stared more intently to check the answers. \"So, Edward, didn't you think Isabella should get a chance with the microscope?\" Mr. Banner asked. \"Bella,\" Edward corrected automatically.\u201dActually, she identified three of the five.\" Mr. Banner looked at me now; his expression was skeptical. \"Have you done this lab before?\" he asked. I smiled sheepishly.\u201dNot with onion root.\" \"Whitefish blastula?\" \"Yeah.\" Mr. Banner nodded.\u201dWere you in an advanced placement program in Phoenix?\" \"Yes.\" \"Well,\" he said after a moment,\u201dI guess it's good you two are lab partners.\" He mumbled something else as he walked away. After he left, I began doodling on my notebook again. \"It's too bad about the snow, isn't it?\" Edward asked. I had the feeling that he was forcing himself to make small talk with me. Paranoia swept over me again. It was like he had heard my conversation with Jessica at lunch and was trying to prove me wrong. \"Not really,\" I answered honestly, instead of pretending to be normal like everyone else. I was still trying to dislodge the stupid feeling of suspicion, and I couldn't concentrate. \"You don't like the cold.\" It wasn't a question. \"Or the wet.\" \"Forks must be a difficult place for you to live,\" he mused. \"You have no idea,\" I muttered darkly. He looked fascinated by what I said, for some reason I couldn't imagine. His face was such a distraction that I tried not to look at it any more than courtesy absolutely demanded. \"Why did you come here, then?\" No one had asked me that \u2014 not straight out like he did, demanding. \"It's\u2026 complicated.\" \"I think I can keep up,\" he pressed. I paused for a long moment, and then made the mistake of meeting his gaze. His dark gold eyes confused me, and I answered without thinking. \"My mother got remarried,\" I said. \"That doesn't sound so complex,\" he disagreed, but he was suddenly sympathetic.\u201dWhen did that happen?\" \"Last September.\" My voice sounded sad, even to me. \"And you don't like him,\" Edward surmised, his tone still kind. \"No, Phil is fine. Too young, maybe, but nice enough.\" \"Why didn't you stay with them?\" I couldn't fathom his interest, but he continued to stare at me with penetrating eyes, as if my dull life's story was somehow vitally important. \"Phil travels a lot. He plays ball for a living.\" I half-smiled. \"Have I heard of him?\" he asked, smiling in response. \"Probably not. He doesn't play well. Strictly minor league. He moves around a lot.\" \"And your mother sent you here so that she could travel with him.\" He said it as an assumption again, not a question. My chin raised a fraction.\u201dNo, she did not send me here. I sent myself.\" His eyebrows knit together.\u201dI don't understand,\" he admitted, and he seemed unnecessarily frustrated by that fact. I sighed. Why was I explaining this to him? He continued to stare at me with obvious curiosity. \"She stayed with me at first, but she missed him. It made her unhappy\u2026 so I decided it was time to spend some quality time with Charlie.\" My voice was glum by the time I finished. \"But now you're unhappy,\" he pointed out.  \"And?\" I challenged. \"That doesn't seem fair.\" He shrugged, but his eyes were still intense. I laughed without humor.\u201dHasn't anyone ever told you? Life isn't fair.\" \"I believe I have heard that somewhere before,\" he agreed dryly. \"So that's all,\" I insisted, wondering why he was still staring at me that way. His gaze became appraising.\u201dYou put on a good show,\" he said slowly. \"But I'd be willing to bet that you're suffering more than you let anyone see.\" I grimaced at him, resisting the impulse to stick out my tongue like a five-year-old, and looked away. \"Am I wrong?\" I tried to ignore him. \"I didn't think so,\" he murmured smugly. \"Why does it matter to you?\" I asked, irritated. I kept my eyes away, watching the teacher make his rounds. \"That's a very good question,\" he muttered, so quietly that I wondered if he was talking to himself. However, after a few seconds of silence, I decided that was the only answer I was going to get. I sighed, scowling at the blackboard. \"Am I annoying you?\" he asked. He sounded amused. I glanced at him without thinking\u2026 and told the truth again.\u201dNot exactly. I'm more annoyed at myself. My face is so easy to read \u2014 my mother always calls me her open book.\" I frowned. \"On the contrary, I find you very difficult to read.\" Despite everything that I'd said and he'd guessed, he sounded like he meant it. \"You must be a good reader then,\" I replied. \"Usually.\" He smiled widely, flashing a set of perfect, ultrawhite teeth. Mr. Banner called the class to order then, and I turned with relief to listen. I was in disbelief that I'd just explained my dreary life to this bizarre, beautiful boy who may or may not despise me. He'd seemed engrossed in our conversation, but now I could see, from the corner of my eye, that he was leaning away from me again, his hands gripping the edge of the table with unmistakable tension. I tried to appear attentive as Mr. Banner illustrated, with transparencies on the overhead projector, what I had seen without difficulty through the microscope. But my thoughts were unmanageable. When the bell finally rang, Edward rushed as swiftly and as gracefully from the room as he had last Monday. And, like last Monday, I stared after him in amazement. Mike skipped quickly to my side and picked up my books for me. I imagined him with a wagging tail. \"That was awful,\" he groaned.\u201dThey all looked exactly the same. You're lucky you had Cullen for a partner.\" \"I didn't have any trouble with it,\" I said, stung by his assumption. I regretted the snub instantly.\u201dI've done the lab before, though,\" I added before he could get his feelings hurt. \"Cullen seemed friendly enough today,\" he commented as we shrugged into our raincoats. He didn't seem pleased about it. I tried to sound indifferent.\u201dI wonder what was with him last Monday.\" I couldn't concentrate on Mike's chatter as we walked to Gym, and RE. didn't do much to hold my attention, either. Mike was on my team today. He chivalrously covered my position as well as his own, so my woolgathering was only interrupted when it was my turn to serve; my team ducked warily out of the way every time I was up. The rain was just a mist as I walked to the parking lot, but I was happier when I was in the dry cab. I got the heater running, for once not caring about the mind-numbing roar of the engine. I unzipped my jacket, put the hood down, and fluffed my damp hair out so the heater could dry it on the way home. I looked around me to make sure it was clear. That's when I noticed the still, white figure. Edward Cullen was leaning against the front door of the Volvo, three cars down from me, and staring intently in my direction. I swiftly looked away and threw the truck into reverse, almost hitting a rusty Toyota Corolla in my haste. Lucky for the Toyota, I stomped on the brake in time. It was just the sort of car that my truck would make scrap metal of. I took a deep breath, still looking out the other side of my car, and cautiously pulled out again, with greater success. I stared straight ahead as I passed the Volvo, but from a peripheral peek, I would swear I saw him laughing.",
