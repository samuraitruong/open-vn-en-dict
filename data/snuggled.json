You've made it through the excitement of labor and delivery, and now you're ready to head home and begin life with your baby. Once home, though, you frantically realize you have no idea what you're doing! Brushing up on these tips can help first-time parents feel confident about caring for a newborn in no time. getting help after the birth  Consider recruiting help from friends and family to get through this time. While in the hospital, use the expertise around you. Many hospitals have feeding specialists or lactation consultants who can help you get started nursing or bottle-feeding. In addition, nurses are a great resource to show you how to hold, burp, change, and care for your baby. For in-home help, you might want to hire a baby nurse or a responsible neighborhood teenager to help you for a short time after the birth. In addition, relatives and friends can be a great resource. They may be more than eager to help, and although you may disagree on certain things, don't dismiss their experience. But if you don't feel up to having guests or you have other concerns, don't feel guilty about placing restrictions on visitors. Handling a newborn  If you haven't spent a lot of time around newborns, their fragility may be intimidating. Here are a few basics to remember: Be careful to support your baby's head and neck. Cradle the head when carrying your baby and support the head when carrying the baby upright or when you lay him or her down.  Be careful not to shake your newborn, whether in play or in frustration. Shaking that is vigorous can cause bleeding in the brain and even death. If you need to wake your infant, don't do it by shaking \u2014 instead, tickle your baby's feet or blow gently on a cheek.  Make sure your baby is securely fastened into the carrier, stroller, or car seat. Limit any activity that would be too rough or bouncy.  Remember that your newborn is not ready for rough play, such as being jiggled on the knee or thrown in the air. Bonding and soothing techniques  Bonding, probably one of the most pleasurable aspects of infant care, occurs during the sensitive time in the first hours and days after birth when parents make a deep connection with their infant. Physical closeness can promote an emotional connection. For infants, the attachment contributes to their emotional growth, which also affects their development in other areas, such as physical growth. Another way to think of bonding is \"falling in love\" with your baby. Children thrive from having a parent or other adult in their life who loves them unconditionally. Begin bonding by cradling your baby and gently stroking him or her in different patterns. Both you and your partner can also take the opportunity to be \"skin-to-skin,\" holding your newborn against your own skin while feeding or cradling. Babies, especially premature babies and those with medical problems, may respond to infant massage. Massage may enhance bonding and help with infant growth and development. Many books and videos cover infant massage \u2014 ask your doctor for recommendations. Be careful, however \u2014 babies are not as strong as adults, so massage your baby gently. Babies usually love vocal sounds, such as talking, babbling, singing, and cooing. Your baby will probably also love listening to music. Baby rattles and musical mobiles are other good ways to stimulate your infant's hearing. If your little one is being fussy, try singing, reciting poetry and nursery rhymes, or reading aloud as you sway or rock your baby gently in a chair. Some babies can be unusually sensitive to touch, light, or sound, and might startle and cry easily, sleep less than you might expect, or turn their faces away when you speak or sing to them. Keep noise and light levels moderate. Swaddling is another soothing technique first-time parents should learn. Swaddling keeps a baby's arms close to the body and legs <em>snuggled</em> together. Not only does this keep a baby warm, but the surrounding pressure seems to give most newborns a sense of security and comfort. Swaddling works well for some babies during their first few weeks. Here's how to swaddle a baby: Spread out the receiving blanket, with one corner folded over slightly. Lay the baby face-up on the blanket with his or her head above the folded corner.  Wrap the left corner over the body and tuck it beneath the back of the baby, going under the right arm. Bring the bottom corner up over the baby's feet and pull it toward the head, folding the fabric down if it gets close to the face.  Wrap the right corner around the baby, and tuck it under the baby's back on the left side, leaving only the neck and head exposed. Diapering Dos and Don'ts  You'll probably decide before you bring your baby home whether you'll use cloth or disposable diapers. Whichever you use, the baby will dirty diapers about 10 times a day, or about 70 times a week. Before diapering a baby, make sure you have all supplies within reach so you won't have to leave your baby unattended on the changing table. You'll need: a clean diaper  a fastener (if cloth is used)  diaper ointment if the baby has a rash  a container of warm water  clean washcloth, diaper wipes, or cotton balls After each bowel movement or if the diaper is wet, lay your baby on his or her back and remove the dirty diaper. Use the water, cotton balls, and washcloth or the wipes to gently wipe your baby's genital area clean. When removing a boy's diaper, do so carefully because exposure to the air may make him urinate. When wiping a girl, wipe her bottom from front to back to avoid a urinary tract infection. To prevent or heal a rash, apply ointment. Always remember to wash your hands thoroughly after changing a diaper. Diaper rash is a common concern. Typically the rash is red and bumpy and will go away in a few days with warm baths, some diaper cream, and a little time out of the diaper. Most rashes occur because the baby's skin is sensitive and becomes irritated by the wet or poopy diaper. To prevent or heal diaper rash, try these tips: Change your baby's diaper frequently, and as soon as possible after bowel movements.  After cleaning the area with mild soap and water or a wipe, apply a diaper rash or \"barrier\" cream. Creams with zinc oxide are preferable because they form a barrier against moisture.  If you use cloth diapers, wash them in dye- and fragrance-free detergents. Let the baby go undiapered for part of the day. This gives the skin a chance to air out. If the diaper rash continues for more than 3 days or seems to be getting worse, call your doctor \u2014 it may be caused by a fungal infection that requires a prescription. Bathing basics  You should give your baby a sponge bath until: the umbilical cord falls off (1\u20134 weeks)  the circumcision heals (1\u20132 weeks)  the navel heals completely (1\u20134 weeks) A bath two or three times a week in the first year is sufficient. More frequent bathing may be drying to the skin. You'll need the following items before bathing your baby: a soft, clean washcloth  mild, unscented baby soap and shampoo  a soft brush to stimulate the baby's scalp  towels or blankets  an infant tub with 2 to 3 inches of warm \u2014 not hot! \u2014 water (to test the water temperature, feel the water with the inside of your elbow or wrist). An infant tub is a plastic tub that can fit in the bathtub and is better fitted for the infant and makes bath time easier to manage.  a clean diaper  clean clothes Sponge baths.  For a sponge bath, pick a warm room and a flat surface, such as a changing table or floor. Undress your baby. Wipe your infant's eyes with a washcloth dampened with water only, starting with one eye and wiping from the inner corner to the outer corner. Use a clean corner of the washcloth to wash the other eye. Clean your baby's nose and ears with the washcloth. Then wet the cloth again, and using a little soap, wash his or her face gently and pat it dry. Next, using baby shampoo, create a lather and gently wash your baby's head. Using a wet cloth and soap, gently wash the rest of the baby, paying special attention to creases under the arms, behind the ears, around the neck, and the genital area. Once you have washed those areas, make sure they are dry and then diaper and dress your baby. Tub baths.  When your baby is ready for tub baths, the first baths should be gentle and brief. If he or she becomes upset, go back to sponge baths for a week or two, then try the bath again. Undress your baby and then place him or her in the water immediately, in a warm room, to prevent chills. Make sure the water in the tub is no more than 2 to 3 inches deep. Use one of your hands to support the head and the other hand to guide the baby in feet-first. Speaking gently, slowly lower your baby up to the chest into the tub. Use a washcloth to wash his or her face and hair. Gently massage your baby's scalp with the pads of your fingers or a soft baby hairbrush, including the area over the fontanelles (soft spots) on the top of the head. When you rinse the soap or shampoo from your baby's head, cup your hand across the forehead so the suds run toward the sides and soap doesn't get into the eyes. Gently wash the rest of your baby's body with water and a small amount of soap. Throughout the bath, regularly pour water gently over your baby's body so he or she doesn't get cold. After the bath, wrap your baby in a towel immediately, making sure to cover his or her head. Baby towels with hoods are great for keeping a freshly washed baby warm. While bathing your infant, never leave the baby alone. If you need to leave the bathroom, wrap the baby in a towel and take him or her with you. Circumcision and umbilical cord care  Immediately after circumcision, the tip of the penis is usually covered with gauze coated with petroleum jelly to keep the wound from sticking to the diaper. Gently wipe the tip clean with warm water after a diaper change, then apply petroleum jelly to the tip so it doesn't stick to the diaper. Redness or irritation of the penis should heal within a few days, but if the redness or swelling increases or if pus-filled blisters form, infection may be present and you should call your baby's doctor immediately. Umbilical cord care in newborns is also important. Some doctors suggest swabbing the area with rubbing alcohol until the cord stump dries up and falls off, usually in 10 days to 3 weeks, but others recommend leaving the area alone. Talk to your child's doctor to see what he or she prefers. The infant's navel area shouldn't be submerged in water until the cord stump falls off and the area is healed. Until it falls off, the cord stump will change color from yellow to brown or black \u2014 this is normal. Consult your doctor if the navel area becomes reddened or if a foul odor or discharge develops. Feeding and burping your baby  Whether feeding your newborn by breast or a bottle, you may be stumped as to how often to do so. Generally, it's recommended that babies be fed on demand \u2014 whenever they seem hungry. Your baby may cue you by crying, putting fingers in his or her mouth, or making sucking noises. A newborn baby needs to be fed every 2 to 3 hours. If you're breastfeeding, give your baby the chance to nurse about 10\u201315 minutes at each breast. If you're formula-feeding, your baby will most likely take about 2\u20133 ounces (60\u201390 milliliters) at each feeding. Some newborns may need to be awakened every few hours to make sure they get enough to eat. Call your baby's doctor if you need to awaken your newborn frequently or if your baby doesn't seem interested in eating or sucking. If you're formula-feeding, you can easily monitor if your baby is getting enough to eat, but if you're breastfeeding, it can be a little trickier. If your baby seems satisfied, produces about six wet diapers and several stools a day, sleeps well, and is gaining weight regularly, then he or she is probably eating enough. Talk to your doctor if you have concerns about your child's growth or feeding schedule. Babies often swallow air during feedings, which can make them fussy. You can prevent this by burping your baby frequently. Try burping your baby every 2 to 3 ounces (60\u201390 milliliters) if you bottle-feed, and each time you switch breasts if you breastfeed. If your baby tends to be gassy, has gastroesophageal reflux, or seems fussy during feeding, try burping your baby every ounce during bottle-feeding or every 5 minutes during breastfeeding. The following are burping strategies: Hold your baby upright with his or her head on your shoulder. Support your baby's head and back while gently patting the back with your other hand.  Sit your baby on your lap. Support your baby's chest and head with one hand by cradling your baby's chin in the palm of your hand and resting the heel of your hand on your baby's chest (be careful to grip your baby's chin - not throat). Use the other hand to gently pat your baby's back.  Lay your baby face-down on your lap. Support your baby's head, making sure it's higher than his or her chest, and gently pat or rub his or her back. If your baby doesn't burp after a few minutes, change the baby's position and try burping for another few minutes before feeding again. Always burp your baby when feeding time is over, then keep him or her in an upright position for at least 10\u201315 minutes to avoid spitting up. Sleeping basics  As a new parent, you may be surprised to learn that your newborn, who seems to need you every minute of the day, actually sleeps about 16 hours or more! Newborns typically sleep for periods of 3\u20134 hours. Don't expect yours to sleep through the night \u2014 the digestive system of babies is so small that they need nourishment every few hours and should be awakened if they haven't been fed for 5 hours (or more frequently). When can you expect your baby to sleep through the night? Many babies sleep through the night (between 6\u20138 hours) at 3 months of age, but if yours doesn't, it's not a cause for concern. Like adults, babies must develop their own sleep patterns and cycles, so if your newborn is gaining weight and appears healthy, don't despair if he or she hasn't slept through the night at 3 months. It's important to place babies on their backs to sleep to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). In addition, remove all fluffy bedding, quilts, sheepskins, stuffed animals, and pillows from the crib to ensure that your baby doesn't get tangled in them or suffocate. Also be sure to alternate the position of your baby's head from night to night (first right, then left, and so on) to prevent being flat on one side of the head.  Even though you may feel anxious about handling a newborn, in a few short weeks you'll develop a routine and be parenting like a pro! If you have any questions or concerns, ask your doctor to recommend resources that can help you and your baby grow together.",

Centuries of\u00a0 experience in the emergency room were evident in his quiet, authoritative voice. \"Emmett, Rose, get Jasper outside.\" Unsmiling for once, Emmett nodded. \"Come on, Jasper.\" Jasper struggled against Emmett's unbreakable grasp, twisting around, reaching toward his brother with his bared teeth, his eyes still past reason. Edward's face was whiter than bone as he wheeled to crouch over me, taking a clearly defensive position. A low warning growl slid from between his clenched teeth. I could tell that he wasn't breathing. Rosalie, her divine face strangely smug, stepped in front of Jasper\u2014keeping a careful distance from his teeth\u2014and helped Emmett wrestle him through the glass door that Esme held open, one hand pressed over her mouth and nose. Esme's heart-shaped face was ashamed. \"I'm so sorry, Bella,\" she cried as she followed the others into the yard. \"Let me by, Edward,\" Carlisle murmured. A second passed, and then Edward nodded slowly and relaxed his stance. Carlisle knelt beside me, leaning close to examine my arm. I could feel the shock frozen on my face, and I tried to compose it. \"Here, Carlisle,\" Alice said, handing him a towel. He shook his head. \"Too much glass in the wound.\" He reached over and ripped a long, thin scrap from the bottom of the white tablecloth. He twisted it around my arm above the elbow to form a tourniquet. The smell of the blood was making me dizzy. My ears rang. \"Bella,\" Carlisle said softly. \"Do you want me to drive you to the hospital, or would you like me to take care of it here?\" \"Here, please,\" I whispered. If he took me to the hospital, there would be no way to keep this from Charlie. \"I'll get your bag,\" Alice said. \"Let's take her to the kitchen table,\" Carlisle said to Edward. Edward lifted me effortlessly, while Carlisle kept the pressure steady on my arm. \"How are you doing, Bella?\" Carlisle asked. \"I'm fine.\" My voice was reasonably steady, which pleased me. Edward's face was like stone. Alice was there. Carlisle's black bag was already on the table, a small but brilliant desk light plugged into the wall. Edward sat me gently into a chair, and Carlisle pulled up another. He went to work at once. Edward stood over me, still protective, still not breathing. \"Just go, Edward,\" I sighed. \"I can handle it,\" he insisted. But his jaw was rigid; his eyes burned with the intensity of the thirst he fought, so much worse for him than it was for the others. \"You don't need to be a hero,\" I said. \"Carlisle can fix me up without your help. Get some fresh air.\" I winced as Carlisle did something to my arm that stung. \"I'll stay,\" he said. \"Why are you so masochistic?\" I mumbled. Carlisle decided to intercede. \"Edward, you may as well go find Jasper before he gets too far. I'm sure he's upset with himself, and I doubt he'll listen to anyone but you right now.\" \"Yes,\" I eagerly agreed. \"Go find Jasper.\" \"You might as well do something useful,\" Alice added. Edward's eyes narrowed as we ganged up on him, but, finally, he nodded once and sprinted smoothly through the kitchen's back door. I was sure he hadn't taken a breath since I'd sliced my finger. A numb, dead feeling was spreading through my arm. Though it erased the sting, it reminded me of the gash, and I watched Carlisle's face carefully to distract me from what his hands were doing. His hair gleamed gold in the bright light as he bent over my arm. I could feel the faint stirrings of unease in the pit of my stomach, but I was determined not to let my usual squeamishness get the best of me. There was no pain now, just a gentle tugging sensation that I tried to ignore. No reason to get sick like a baby. If she hadn't been in my line of sight, I wouldn't have noticed Alice give up and steal out of the room. With a tiny, apologetic smile on her lips, she disappeared through the kitchen doorway. \"Well, that's everyone,\" I sighed. \"I can clear a room, at least.\" \"It's not your fault,\" Carlisle comforted me with a chuckle. \"It could happen to anyone.\" \"Could\" I repeated. \"But it usually just happens to me.\" He laughed again. His relaxed calm was only more amazing set in direct contrast with everyone else's reaction. I couldn't find any trace of anxiety in his face. He worked with quick, sure movements. The only sound besides our quiet breathing was the soft plink, plink as the tiny fragments of glass dropped one by one to the table. \"How can you do this?\" I demanded. \"Even Alice and Esme\u2026\" I trailed off, shaking my head in wonder. Though the rest of them had given up the traditional diet of vampires just as absolutely as Carlisle had, he was the only one who could bear the smell of my blood without suffering from the intense temptation. Clearly, this was much more difficult than he made it seem. \"Years and years of practice,\" he told me. \"I barely notice the scent anymore.\" \"Do you think it would be harder if you took a vacation from the hospital for a long time. And weren't around any blood?\" \"Maybe.\" He shrugged his shoulders, but his hands remained steady. \"I've never felt the need for an extended holiday.\" He flashed a brilliant smile in my direction. \"I enjoy my work too much.\" Plink, plink, plink. I was surprised at how much glass there seemed to be in my arm. I was tempted to glance at the growing pile, just to check the size, but I knew that idea would not be helpful to my no-vomiting strategy. \"What is it that you enjoy?\" I wondered. It didn't make sense to me\u2014the years of struggle and self-denial he must have spent to get to the point where he could endure this so easily. Besides, I wanted to keep him talking; the conversation kept my mind off the queasy feeling in my stomach. His dark eyes were calm and thoughtful as he answered. \"Hmm. What I enjoy the very most is when my\u2026 enhanced abilities let me save someone who would otherwise have been lost. It's pleasant knowing that, thanks to what I can do, some people's lives are better because I exist. Even the sense of smell is a useful diagnostic tool at times.\" One side of his mouth pulled up in half a smile. I mulled that over while he poked around, making sure all the glass splinters were gone. Then he rummaged in his bag for new tools, and I tried not to picture a needle and thread. \"You try very hard to make up for something that was never your fault,\" I suggested while a new kind of tugging started at the edges of my skin. \"What I mean is, it's not like you asked for this. You didn't choose this kind of life, and yet you have to work so hard to be good.\" \"I don't know that I'm making up for anything,\" he disagreed lightly. \"Like everything in life, I just had to decide what to do with what I was given.\" \"That makes it sound too easy.\" He examined my arm again. \"There,\" he said, snipping a thread. \"All done.\" He wiped an oversized Q-tip, dripping with some syrup-colored liquid, thoroughly across the operation site. The smell was strange; it made my head spin. The syrup stained my skin. \"In the beginning, though,\" I pressed while he taped another long piece of gauze securely in place, sealing it to my skin. \"Why did you even think to try a different way than the obvious one?\" His lips turned up in a private smile. \"Hasn't Edward told you this story?\" \"Yes. But I'm trying to understand what you were thinking\u2026\" His face was suddenly serious again, and I wondered if his thoughts had gone to the same place that mine had. Wondering what I would be thinking when\u2014I refused to think if\u2014it was me. n\u1ebfu \"You know my father was a clergyman,\" he mused as he cleaned the table carefully, rubbing everything down with wet gauze, and then doing it again. The smell of alcohol burned in my nose. \"He had a rather harsh view of the world, which I was already beginning to question before the time that I changed.\" Carlisle put all the dirty gauze and the glass slivers into an empty crystal bowl. I didn't understand what he was doing, even when he lit the match. Then he threw it onto the alcohol-soaked fibers, and the sudden blaze made me jump. \"Sorry,\" he apologized. \"That ought to do it\u2026 So I didn't agree with my father's particular brand of faith. But never, in the nearly four hundred years now since I was born, have I ever seen anything to make me doubt whether God exists in some form or the other. Not even the reflection in the mirror.\" I pretended to examine the dressing on my arm to hide my surprise at the direction our conversation had taken. Religion was the last thing I expected, all things considered. My own life was fairly devoid of belief. Charlie considered himself a Lutheran, because that's what his parents had been, but Sundays he worshipped by the river with a fishing pole in his hand. Renee tried out a church now and then, but, much like her brief affairs with tennis, pottery, yoga, and French classes, she moved on by the time I was aware of her newest fad.  \"I'm sure all this sounds a little bizarre, coming from a vampire.\" He grinned, knowing how their casual use of that word never failed to shock me. \"But I'm hoping that there is still a point to this life, even for us.\u00a0 It's a long shot, I'll admit,\" he continued in an offhand voice. \"By all accounts, we're damned regardless. But I hope, maybe foolishly, that we'll get some measure of credit for trying.\" \"I don't think that's foolish,\" I mumbled. I couldn't imagine anyone, deity included, who wouldn't be impressed by Carlisle. Besides, the only kind of heaven I could appreciate would have to include Edward. \"And I don't think anyone else would, either.\" \"Actually, you're the very first one to agree with me.\" \"The rest of them don't feel the same?\" I asked, surprised, thinking of only one person in particular. Carlisle guessed the direction of my thoughts again. \"Edward's with me up to a point. God and heaven exist\u2026 and so does hell. But he doesn't believe there is an afterlife for our kind.\" Carlisle's voice was very soft; he stared out the big window over the sink, into the darkness. \"You see, he thinks we've lost our souls.\" I immediately thought of Edward's words this afternoon: unless you want to die\u2014or whatever it is that we do. The light bulb flicked on over my head. \"That's the real problem, isn't it?\" I guessed. \"That's why he's being so difficult about me.\" \u00a0Carlisle spoke slowly. \"I look at my\u2026 son. His strength, his goodness, the brightness that shines out of him\u2014and it only fuels that hope, that faith, more than ever. How could there not be more for one such as Edward?\" I nodded in fervent agreement. \"But if I believed as he does\u2026\" He looked down at me with unfathomable eyes. \"If you believed as he did. Could you take away his soul?\" The way he phrased the question thwarted my answer. If he'd asked me whether I would risk my soul for Edward, the reply would be obvious. But would I risk Edward's soul? I pursed my lips unhappily. That wasn't a fair exchange. \"You see the problem.\" I shook my head, aware of the stubborn set of my chin. Carlisle sighed. \"It's my choice,\" I insisted. \"It's his, too.\" He held up his hand when he could see that I was about to argue. \"Whether he is responsible for doing that to you.\" \"He's not the only one able to do it.\" I eyed Carlisle speculatively. He laughed, abruptly lightening the mood. \"Oh, no! You're going to have to work this out with him.\" But then he sighed. \"That's the one part I can never be sure of. I think, in most other ways, that I've done the best I could with what I had to work with. But was it right to doom the others to this life? I can't decide.\" I didn't answer. I imagined what my life would be like if Carlisle had resisted the temptation to change his lonely existence\u2026 and shuddered. \"It was Edward's mother who made up my mind.\" Carlisle's voice was almost a whisper. He stared unseeingly out the black windows. \"His mother?\" Whenever I'd asked Edward about his parents, he would merely say that they had died long ago, and his memories were vague. I realized Carlisle's memory of them, despite the brevity of their contact, would be perfectly clear. \"Yes. Her name was Elizabeth. Elizabeth Masen. His father, Edward Senior, never regained consciousness in the hospital. He died in the first wave of the influenza. But Elizabeth was alert until almost the very end. Edward looks a great deal like her\u2014she had that same strange bronze shade to her hair, and her eyes were exactly the same color green.\" \"His eyes were green?\" I murmured, trying to picture it. \"Yes\u2026\" Carlisle's ocher eyes were a hundred years away now. \"Elizabeth worried obsessively over her son. She hurt her own chances of survival trying to nurse him from her sickbed. I expected that he would go first, he was so much worse off than she was. When the end came for her, it was very quick. It was just after sunset, and I'd arrived to relieve the doctors who'd been working all day. That was a hard time to pretend\u2014there was so much work to be done, and I had no need of rest. How I hated to go back to my house, to hide in the dark and pretend to sleep while so many were dying. \"I went to check Elizabeth and her son first. I'd grown attached\u2014always a dangerous thing to do considering the fragile nature of humans. I could see at once that she'd taken a bad turn. The fever was raging out of control, and her body was too weak to fight anymore. She didn't look weak, though, when she glared up at me from her cot. \"Save him!' she commanded me in the hoarse voice that was all her throat could manage. \"I'll do everything in my power,' I promised her, taking her hand. The fever was so high, she probably couldn't even tell how unnaturally cold mine felt. Everything felt cold to her skin. \"You must,\" she insisted, clutching at my hand with enough strength that I wondered if she wouldn't pull through the crisis after all. Her eyes were hard, like stones, like emeralds. 'You must do everything in your power. What others cannot do, that is what you must do for my Edward.\" \"It frightened me. She looked it me with those piercing eyes, and, for one instant, I felt certain that she knew my secret. Then the fever overwhelmed her, and she never regained consciousness. She died within an hour of making her demand. \"I'd spent decades considering the idea of creating a companion for myself. Just one other creature who could really know me, rather than what I pretended to be. But I could never justify it to myself\u2014doing what had been done to me. \"There Edward lay, dying. It was clear that he had only hours left. Beside him, his mother, her face somehow not yet peaceful, not even in death.\" Carlisle saw it all again, his memory unburned by the intervening century. I could see it clearly, too, as he spoke\u2014the despair of the hospital, the overwhelming atmosphere of death. Edward burning with fever, his life slipping away with each tick of the clock\u2026 I shuddered again, and forced the picture from my mind. \"Elizabeth's words echoed in my head. How could she guess what I could do? Could anyone really want that for her son? \"I looked at Edward. Sick as he was, he was still beautiful. There was something pure and good about his face. The kind of face I would have wanted my son to have. \"After all those years of indecision, I simply acted on a whim. I wheeled his mother to the morgue first, and then I came back for him. No one noticed that he was still breathing. There weren't enough hands, enough eyes, to keep track of half of what the patients needed. The morgue was empty\u2014of the living, at least. I stole him out the back door, and carried him across the rooftops back to my home. \"I wasn't sure what had to be done. I settled for recreating the wounds I'd received myself, so many centuries earlier in London. I felt bad about that later. It was more painful and lingering than necessary. \"I wasn't sorry, though. I've never been sorry that I saved Edward.\" He shook his head, coming back to the present. He smiled at me. \"I suppose I should take you home now.\" \"I'll do that,\" Edward said. He came through the shadowy dining room, walking slowly for him. His face was smooth, unreadable, but there was something wrong with his eyes\u2014something he was trying very hard to hide. I felt a spasm of unease in my stomach. \"Carlisle can take me,\" I said. I looked down at my shirt; the light blue cotton was soaked and spotted with my blood. My right shoulder was covered in thick pink frosting. \"I'm fine.\" Edward's voice was unemotional. \"You'll need to change anyway. You'd give Charlie a heart attack the way you look. I'll have Alice get you something.\" He strode out the kitchen door again. I looked at Carlisle anxiously. \"He's very upset.\" \"Yes,\" Carlisle agreed. \"Tonight is exactly the kind of thing that he fears the most. You being put in danger, because of what we are.\" \"It's not his fault.\" \"It's not yours, either.\" I looked away from his wise, beautiful eyes. I couldn't agree with that. Carlisle offered me his hand and helped me up from the table. I followed him out into the main room. Esme had come back; she was mopping the floor where I'd fallen\u2014with straight bleach from the smell of it. \"Esme, let me do that.\" I could feel that my face was bright red again. \"I'm already done.\" She smiled up at me. \"How do you feel?\" \"I'm fine,\" I assured her. \"Carlisle sews faster than any other doctor I've had.\" They both chuckled. Alice and Edward came in the back doors. Alice hurried to my side, but Edward hung back, his face indecipherable. \"C'mon,\" Alice said. \"I'll get you something less macabre to wear.\" She found me a shirt of Esme's that was close to the same color mine had been. Charlie wouldn't notice, I was sure. The long white bandage on my arm didn't look nearly as serious when I was no longer spattered in gore. Charlie was never surprised to see me bandaged. \"Alice,\" I whispered as she headed back to the door. \"Yes?\" She kept her voice low, too, and looked at me curiously, her head cocked to the side. \"How bad is it?\" I couldn't be sure if my whispering was a wasted effort. Even though we were upstairs, with the door closed, perhaps he could hear me. Her face tensed. \"I'm not sure yet.\" \"How's Jasper?\" She sighed. \"He's very unhappy with himself. It's all so much more of challenge for him, and he hates feeling weak.\" \"It's not his fault. You'll tell him that I'm not mad at him, not at all, won't you?\" \"Of course.\" Edward was waiting for me by the front door. As I got to the bottom of the staircase, he held it open without a word. \"Take your things!\" Alice cried as I walked warily toward Edward. She scooped up the two packages, one half-opened, and my camera from under the piano, and pressed them into my good arm. \"You can thank me later, when you've opened them.\" Esme and Carlisle both said a quiet goodnight. I could see them stealing quick glances at their impassive son, much like I was. It was a relief to be outside; I hurried past the lanterns and the roses, now unwelcome reminders.  Edward kept pace with me silently. He opened the passenger side for me, and I climbed in without complaint. On the dashboard was a big red ribbon, stuck to the new stereo. I pulled it off, throwing it to the floor. As Edward slid into the other side, I kicked the ribbon under my seat. He didn't look at me or the stereo. Neither of us switched it on, and the silence was somehow intensified by the sudden thunder of the engine. He drove too fast down the dark, serpentine lane. The silence was making me insane. \"Say something,\" I finally begged as he turned onto the freeway. \"What do you want me to say?\" he asked in a detached voice. I cringed at his remoteness. 'Tell me you forgive me.\" That brought a flicker of life to his face\u2014a flicker of anger. \"Forgive you? For what?\" \"If I'd been more careful, nothing would have happened.\" \"Bella, you gave yourself a paper cut\u2014that hardly deserves the death penalty.\" \"It's still my fault.\" My words opened up the floodgate. \"Your fault? If you'd cut yourself at Mike Newton's house, with Jessica there and Angela and your other normal friends, the worst that could possibly have happened would be what? Maybe they couldn't find you a bandage? If you'd tripped and knocked over a pile of glass plates on your own\u2014without someone throwing you into them\u2014even then, what's the worst? You'd get blood on the seats when they drove you to the emergency room? Mike Newton could have held your hand while they stitched you up\u2014and he wouldn't be righting the urge to kill you the whole time he was there. Don't try to take any of this on yourself, Bella. It will only make me more disgusted with myself.\" \"How the hell did Mike Newton end up in this conversation?\" I demanded. \"Mike Newton ended up in this conversation because Mike Newton would be a hell of a lot healthier for you to be with,\" he growled. \"I'd rather die than be with Mike Newton,\" I protested. \"I'd rather die than be with anyone but you.\" \"Don't be melodramatic, please.\" \"Well then, don't you be ridiculous.\" He didn't answer. He glared through the windshield, his expression black. I racked my brain for some way to salvage the evening. When we pulled up in front of my house, I still hadn't come up with anything. He killed the engine, but his hands stayed clenched around the steering wheel. \"Will you stay tonight?\" I asked. \"I should go home.\" The last thing I wanted was for him to go wallow in remorse. \"For my birthday,\" I pressed. \"You can't have it both ways\u2014either you want people to ignore your birthday or you don't. One or the other.\" His voice was stern, but not as serious as before. I breathed a silent sigh of relief. \"Okay. I've decided that I don't want you to ignore my birthday. I'll see you upstairs.\" I hopped out, reaching back in for my packages. He frowned. \"You don't have to take those.\" \"I want them,\" I responded automatically, and then wondered if he was using reverse psychology. \"No, you don't. Carlisle and Esme spent money on you.\" \"I'll live.\" I tucked the presents awkwardly under my good arm and slammed the door behind me. He was out of the truck and by my side in less than a second. \"Let me carry them, at least.\" he said as he took them away. \"I'll be in your room.\" I smiled. \"Thanks.\" \"Happy birthday,\" he sighed, and leaned down to touch his lips to mine. I reached up on my toes to make the kiss last longer when he pulled away. He smiled my favorite crooked smile, and then he disappeared into the darkness. The game was still on; as soon as I walked through the front door I could hear the announcer rambling over the babble of the crowd. \"Bell?\" Charlie called. \"Hey, Dad,\" I said as I came around the corner. I held my arm close to my side. The slight pressure burned, and I wrinkled my nose. The anesthetic was apparently losing its effectiveness. \"How was it?\" Charlie lounged across the sofa with his bare feet propped up on the arm.  What was left of his curly brown hair was crushed flat on one side. \"Alice went overboard. Flowers, cake, candles, presents\u2014the whole bit.\" \"What did they get you?\" \"A stereo for my truck.\" And various unknowns. \"Wow.\" \"Yeah,\" I agreed. \"Well, I'm calling it a night.\" \"I'll see you in the morning.\" I waved. \"See ya.\" \"What happened to your arm?\" I flushed and cursed silently. \"I tripped. It's nothing.\" \"Bella,\" he sighed, shaking his head. \"Goodnight, Dad.\" I hurried up to the bathroom, where I kept my pajamas for just such nights as these. I shrugged into the matching tank top and cotton pants that I'd gotten to replace the holey sweats I used to wear to bed, wincing as the movement pulled at the stitches. I washed my face one-handed, brushed my teeth, and then skipped to my room. He was sitting in the center of my bed, toying idly with one of the silver boxes. \"Hi,\" he said. His voice was sad. He was wallowing. I went to the bed, pushed the presents out of his hands, and climbed into his lap. \"Hi.\" I <em>snuggled</em> into his stone chest. \"Can I open my presents now?\" \"Where did the enthusiasm come from?\" he wondered. \"You made me curious.\" I picked up the long flat rectangle that must have been from Carlisle and Esme. \"Allow me,\" he suggested. He took the gift from my hand and tore the silver paper off with one fluid movement. He handed the rectangular white box back to me. \"Are you sure I can handle lifting the lid?\" I muttered, but he ignored me. Inside the box was a long thick piece of paper with an overwhelming amount of fine print. It took me a minute to get the gist of the information. \"We're going to Jacksonville?\" And I was excited, in spite of myself. It was a voucher for plane tickets, for both me and Edward. \"That's the idea.\" \"I can't believe it. Renee is going to flip! You don't mind, though, do you? It's sunny, you'll have to stay inside all day.\" \"I think I can handle it,\" he said, and then frowned. \"If I'd had any idea that you could respond to a gift this appropriately, I would have made you open it in front of Carlisle and Esme. I thought you'd complain.\" \"Well, of course it's too much. But I get to take you with me!\" He chuckled. \"Now I wish I'd spent money on your present. I didn't realize that you were capable of being reasonable.\" I set the tickets aside and reached for his present, my curiosity rekindled. He took it from me and unwrapped it like the first one. He handed back a clear CD jewel case, with a blank silver CD inside. \"What is it?\" I asked, perplexed. He didn't say anything; he took the CD and reached around me to put it in the CD player on the bedside table. He hit play, and we waited in silence. Then the music began. I listened, speechless and wide-eyed. I knew he was waiting for my reaction, but I couldn't talk. Tears welled up, and I reached up to wipe them away before they could spill over. \"Does your arm hurt?\" he asked anxiously. \"No, it's not my arm. It's beautiful, Edward. You couldn't have given me anything I would love more. I can't believe it.\" I shut up, so I could listen. It was his music, his compositions. The first piece on the CD was my lullaby. \"I didn't think you would let me get a piano so I could play for you here,\" he explained. \"You're right.\" \"How does your arm feel?\" \"Just fine.\" Actually, it was starting to blaze under the bandage. I wanted ice. I would have settled for his hand, but that would have given me away. \"I'll get you some Tylenol.\" \"I don't need anything,\" I protested, but he slid me off his lap and headed for the door. \"Charlie,\" I hissed. Charlie wasn't exactly aware that Edward frequently stayed over. In fact, he would have a stroke if that fact were brought to his attention. But I didn't feel too guilty for deceiving him.\u00a0\u00a0  It wasn't as if we were up to anything he wouldn't want me to be up to. Edward and his rules\u2026 \"He won't catch me,\" Edward promised as he disappeared silently out the door . . and returned, catching the door before it had swung back to touch the frame. He had the glass from the bathroom and the bottle of pills in one hand. I took the pills he handed me without arguing\u2014I knew I would lose the argument And my arm really was starting to bother me. My lullaby continued, soft and lovely, in the background. \"It's late,\" Edward noted. He scooped me up off the bed with one arm, and pulled the cover back with the other. He put me down with my head on my pillow and tucked the quilt around me. He lay down next to me\u2014on top of the blanket so I wouldn't get chilled\u2014and put his arm over me. I leaned my head against his shoulder and sighed happily. \"Thanks again,\" I whispered. \"You're welcome.\" It was quiet for a long moment as I listened to my lullaby drift to a close. Another song began. I recognized Esme's favorite. \"What are you thinking about?'\" I wondered in a whisper. He hesitated for a second before he told me. \"I was thinking about right and wrong, actually.\" I felt a chill tingle along my spine. \"Remember how I decided that I wanted you to not ignore my birthday?\" I asked quickly, hoping it wasn't too clear that I was trying to distract him. \"Yes,\" he agreed, wary. \"Well, I was thinking, since it's still my birthday, that I'd like you to kiss me again.\" \"You're greedy tonight.\" \"Yes, I am\u2014but please, don't do anything you don't want to do,\" I added, piqued. He laughed, and then sighed. \"Heaven forbid that I should do anything I don't want to do,\" he said in a strangely desperate tone as he put his hand under my chin and pulled my face up to his. The kiss began much the same as usual\u2014Edward was as careful as ever, and my heart began to overreact like it always did. And then something seemed to change. Suddenly his lips became much more urgent, his free hand twisted into my hair and held my face securely to his. And, though my hands tangled in his hair, too, and though I was clearly beginning to cross his cautious lines, for once he didn't stop me. His body was cold through the thin quilt, but I crushed myself against him eagerly. When he stopped it was abrupt; he pushed me away with gentle, firm hands. I collapsed back onto my pillow, gasping, my head spinning. Something tugged at my memory, elusive, on the edges. \"Sorry,\" he said, and he was breathless, too. \"That was out of line.\" \"I don't mind,\" I panted. He frowned at me in the darkness. \"Try to sleep. Bella.\" \"No, I want you to kiss me again.\" \"You're overestimating my self-control.\" \"Which is tempting you more, my blood or my body?\" I challenged. \"It's a tie.\" He grinned briefly in spite of himself, and then was serious again. \"Now. why don't you stop pushing your luck and go to sleep?\" \"Fine,\" I agreed, snuggling closer to him. I really did feel exhausted. It had been a long day in so many ways, yet I felt no sense of relief at its end. Almost as if something worse was coming tomorrow. It was a silly premonition\u2014what could be worse than today?' Just the shock catching up with me, no doubt. Trying to be sneaky about it, I pressed my injured arm against his shoulder, so his cool skin would sooth the burning. It felt better at once. I was halfway asleep, maybe more, when I realized what his kiss had reminded me of: last spring, when he'd had to leave me to throw James off my trail, Edward had kissed me goodbye, not knowing when\u2014or if\u2014we would see each other again.

Jacob was still full of himself for engineering my escape. \u201cDo you think they\u2019ll come looking for you?\u201d he asked, sounding hopeful. \u201cNo.\u201d I was certain about that. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be furious with me tonight, though.\u201d He picked up a rock and chucked it into the waves. \u201cDon\u2019t go back, then,\u201d he suggested again. \u00a0\u201cCharlie would love that,\u201d I said sarcastically. \u201cI bet he wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d I didn\u2019t answer. Jacob was probably right, and that made me grind my teeth together. Charlie\u2019s blatant preference for my Quileute friends was so unfair. I wondered if he would feel the same if he knew the choice was really between vampires and werewolves. \u201cSo what\u2019s the latest pack scandal?\u201d I asked lightly. Jacob skidded to a halt, and he stared down at me with shocked eyes. \u201cWhat? That was a joke.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d He looked away. I waited for him to start walking again, but he seemed lost in thought.  \u201cIs there a scandal?\u201d I wondered. Jacob chuckled once. \u201cI forget what it\u2019s like, not having everyone know everything all the time. Having a quiet, private place inside my head.\u201d We walked along the stony beach quietly for a few minutes. \u00a0\u201cSo what is it?\u201d I finally asked. \u201cThat everyone in your head already knows?\u201d He hesitated for a moment, as if he weren\u2019t sure how much he was going to tell me. Then he sighed and said, \u201cQuil imprinted. That\u2019s three now. The rest of us are starting to get worried. Maybe it\u2019s more common than the stories say. . . .\u201d He frowned, and then turned to stare at me. He gazed into my eyes without speaking, his eyebrows furrowed in concentration. \u201cWhat are you staring at?\u201d I asked, feeling self-conscious. He sighed. \u201cNothing.\u201d Jacob started walking again. Without seeming to think about it, he reached out and took my hand. We paced silently across the rocks. I thought of how we must look walking hand and hand down the beach \u2014 like a couple, certainly \u2014 and wondered if I should object. But this was the way it had always been with Jacob. . . . No reason to get worked up about it now. \u201cWhy is Quil\u2019s imprinting such a scandal?\u201d I asked when it didn\u2019t look like he was going to go on. \u201cIs it because he\u2019s the newest one?\u201d  \u201cThat doesn\u2019t have anything to do with it.\u201d \u201cThen what\u2019s the problem?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s another one of those legend things. I wonder when we\u2019re going to stop being surprised that they\u2019re all true?\u201d he muttered to himself. \u00a0\u201cAre you going to tell me? Or do I have to guess?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d never get it right. See, Quil hasn\u2019t been hanging out with us, you know, until just recently. So he hadn\u2019t been around Emily\u2019s place much.\u201d \u201cQuil imprinted on Emily, too?\u201d I gasped. \u201cNo! I told you not to guess. Emily had her two nieces down for a visit . . . and Quil met Claire.\u201d He didn\u2019t continue. I thought about that for a moment. \u201cEmily doesn\u2019t want her niece with a werewolf? That\u2019s a little hypocritical,\u201d I said. But I could understand why she of all people might feel that way. I thought again of the long scars that marred her face and extended all the way down her right arm. Sam had lost control just once when he was standing too close to her. Once was all it took. . . . I\u2019d seen the pain in Sam\u2019s eyes when he looked at what he\u2019d done to Emily. I could understand why Emily might want to protect her niece from that. \u00a0\u201cWould you please stop guessing? You\u2019re way off. Emily doesn\u2019t mind that part, it\u2019s just, well, a little early.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean early?\u201d Jacob appraised me with narrowed eyes. \u201cTry not to be judgmental, okay?\u201d I nodded cautiously. \u201cClaire is two,\u201d Jacob told me. Rain started to fall. I blinked furiously as the drops pelted my face. Jacob waited in silence. He wore no jacket, as usual; the rain left a spatter of dark spots on his black T-shirt, and dripped through his shaggy hair. His face was expressionless as he watched mine. \u201cQuil . . . imprinted . . . with a two-year-old?\u201d I was finally able to ask. \u201cIt happens.\u201d Jacob shrugged. He bent to grab another rock and sent it flying out into the bay. \u201cOr so the stories say.\u201d \u201cBut she\u2019s a baby,\u201d I protested. He looked at me with dark amusement. \u201cQuil\u2019s not getting any older,\u201d he reminded me, a bit of acid in his tone. \u201cHe\u2019ll just have to be patient for a few decades.\u201d \u201cI . . . don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d I was trying my hardest not to be critical, but, in truth, I was horrified. Until now, nothing about the werewolves had bothered me since the day I\u2019d found out they weren\u2019t committing the murders I\u2019d suspected them of. \u201cYou\u2019re making judgments,\u201d he accused. \u201cI can see it on your face.\u201d \u201cSorry,\u201d I muttered. \u201cBut it sounds really creepy.\u201d \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not like that; you\u2019ve got it all wrong,\u201d Jacob defended his friend, suddenly vehement. \u201cI\u2019ve seen what it\u2019s like, through his eyes. There\u2019s nothing romantic about it at all, not for Quil, not now.\u201d He took a deep breath, frustrated. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard to describe. It\u2019s not like love at first sight, really. It\u2019s more like . . .gravity moves. When you see her, suddenly it\u2019s not the earth holding you here anymore. She does. And nothing matters more than her. And you would do anything for her, be anything for her. . . . You become whatever she needs you to be, whether that\u2019s a protector, or a lover, or a friend, or a brother.   \u201cQuil will be the best, kindest big brother any kid ever had. There isn\u2019t a toddler on the planet that will be more carefully looked after than that little girl will be. And then, when she\u2019s older and needs a friend, he\u2019ll be more understanding, trustworthy, and reliable than anyone else she knows. And then, when she\u2019s grown up, they\u2019ll be as happy as Emily and Sam.\u201d A strange, bitter edge sharpened his tone at the very end, when he spoke of Sam. \u00a0\u201cDoesn\u2019t Claire get a choice here?\u201d \u201cOf course. But why wouldn\u2019t she choose him, in the end? He\u2019ll be her perfect match. Like he was designed for her alone.\u201d We walked in silence for a moment, till I paused to toss a rock toward the ocean. It fell to the beach several meters short. Jacob laughed at me. \u201cWe can\u2019t all be freakishly strong,\u201d I muttered. He sighed. \u201cWhen do you think it will happen for you?\u201d I asked quietly. His answer was flat and immediate. \u201cNever.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not something you can control, is it?\u201d He was silent for a few minutes. Unconsciously, we both walked slower, barely moving at all. \u201cIt\u2019s not supposed to be,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut you have to see her \u2014 the one that\u2019s supposedly meant for you.\u201d \u201cAnd you think that if you haven\u2019t seen her yet, then she\u2019s not out there?\u201d I asked skeptically. \u201cJacob, you haven\u2019t really seen much of the world \u2014 less than me, even.\u201d \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t,\u201d he said in a low voice. He looked at my face with suddenly piercing eyes. \u201cBut I\u2019ll never see anyone else, Bella. I only see you. Even when I close my eyes and try to see something else. Ask Quil or Embry. It drives them all crazy.\u201d I dropped my eyes to the rocks. We weren\u2019t walking anymore. The only sound was of the waves beating against the shore. I couldn\u2019t hear the rain over their roar. \u201cMaybe I\u2019d better go home,\u201d I whispered. \u201cNo!\u201d he protested, surprised by this conclusion. I looked up at him again, and his eyes were anxious now. \u201cYou have the whole day off, right? The bloodsucker won\u2019t be home yet.\u201d I glared at him. \u201cNo offense intended,\u201d he said quickly. \u201cYes, I have the whole day. But, Jake . . .\u201d He held up his hands. \u201cSorry,\u201d he apologized. \u201cI won\u2019t be like that anymore. I\u2019ll just be Jacob.\u201d I sighed. \u201cBut if that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking . . .\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me,\u201d he insisted, smiling with deliberate cheer, too brightly. \u201cI know what I\u2019m doing. Just tell me if I\u2019m upsetting you.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. . . .\u201d \u201cC\u2019mon, Bella. Let\u2019s go back to the house and get our bikes. You\u2019ve got to ride a motorcycle regularly to keep it in tune.\u201d  \u201cI really don\u2019t think I\u2019m allowed.\u201d \u201cBy who? Charlie or the blood \u2014 or him?\u201d \u201cBoth.\u201d Jacob grinned my grin, and he was suddenly the Jacob I missed the most, sunny and warm. I couldn\u2019t help grinning back. The rain softened, turned to mist. \u201cI won\u2019t tell anyone,\u201d he promised. \u201cExcept every one of your friends.\u201d He shook his head soberly and raised his right hand. \u201cI promise not to think about it.\u201d I laughed. \u201cIf I get hurt, it was because I tripped.\u201d \u201cWhatever you say.\u201d We rode our motorcycles on the back roads around La Push until the rain made them too muddy and Jacob insisted that he was going to pass out if he didn\u2019t eat soon. Billy greeted me easily when we got to the house, as if my sudden reappearance meant nothing more complicated than that I\u2019d wanted to spend the day with my friend. After we ate the sandwiches Jacob made, we went out to the garage and I helped him clean up the bikes. I hadn\u2019t been here in months \u2014 since Edward had returned \u2014 but there was no sense of import to it. It was just another afternoon in the garage.  \u201cThis is nice,\u201d I commented when he pulled the warm sodas from the grocery bag. \u201cI\u2019ve missed this place.\u201d He smiled, looking around at the plastic sheds bolted together over our heads. \u201cYeah, I can understand that. All the splendor of the Taj Mahal, without the inconvenience and expense of traveling to India.\u201d \u201cTo Washington\u2019s little Taj Mahal,\u201d I toasted, holding up my can. He touched his can to mine.  \u201cDo you remember last Valentine\u2019s Day? I think that was the last time you were here \u2014 the last time when things were still . . . normal, I mean.\u201d I laughed. \u201cOf course I remember. I traded a lifetime of servitude for a box of conversation hearts. That\u2019s not something I\u2019m likely to forget.\u201d He laughed with me. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Hmm, servitude. I\u2019ll have to think of something good.\u201d Then he sighed. \u201cIt feels like it was years ago. Another era. A happier one.\u201d I couldn\u2019t agree with him. This was my happy era now. But I was surprised to realize how many things I missed from my own personal dark ages. I stared through the opening at the murky forest. The rain had picked up again, but it was warm in the little garage, sitting next to Jacob. He was as good as a furnace. His fingers brushed my hand. \u201cThings have really changed.\u201d \u00a0\u201cYeah,\u201d I said, and then I reached out and patted the back tire of my bike. \u201cCharlie used to like me. I hope Billy doesn\u2019t say anything about today. . . .\u201d I bit my lip. \u201cHe won\u2019t. He doesn\u2019t get worked up about things the way Charlie does. Hey, I never did apologize officially for that stupid move with the bike. I\u2019m real sorry about ratting you out to Charlie. I wish I hadn\u2019t.\u201d I rolled my eyes. \u201cMe, too.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m really, really sorry.\u201d He looked at me hopefully, his wet, tangled black hair sticking up in every direction around his pleading face. \u201cOh, fine! You\u2019re forgiven.\u201d \u201cThanks, Bells!\u201d We grinned at each other for a second, and then his face clouded over. \u201cYou know that day, when I brought the bike over . . . I\u2019ve been wanting to ask you something,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cBut also . . . not wanting to.\u201d I held very still \u2014 a reaction to stress. It was a habit I\u2019d picked up from Edward. \u201cWere you just being stubborn because you were mad at me, or were you really serious?\u201d he whispered. \u00a0\u201cAbout what?\u201d I whispered back, though I was sure I knew what he meant. He glared at me. \u201cYou know. When you said it was none of my business . . . if \u2014 if he bit you.\u201d He cringed visibly at the end. \u201cJake . . .\u201d My throat felt swollen. I couldn\u2019t finish. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. \u201cWere you serious?\u201d He was trembling just slightly. His eyes stayed closed.  \u201cYes,\u201d I whispered. Jacob inhaled, slow and deep. \u201cI guess I knew that.\u201d I stared at his face, waiting for his eyes to open. \u201cYou know what this will mean?\u201d He demanded suddenly. \u201cYou do understand that, don\u2019t you? What will happen if they break the treaty?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll leave first,\u201d I said in a small voice. His eyes flashed open, their black depths full of anger and pain. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a geographic limit to the treaty, Bella. Our great-grandfathers only agreed to keep the peace because the Cullens swore that they were different, that humans weren\u2019t in danger from them. They promised they would never kill or change anyone ever again. If they go back on their word, the treaty is meaningless, and they are no different than any other vampires. Once that\u2019s established, when we find them again \u2014\u201d.  \u00a0\u201cBut, Jake, didn\u2019t you break the treaty already?\u201d I asked, grasping at straws. \u201cWasn\u2019t part of it that you not tell people about the vampires? And you told me. So isn\u2019t the treaty sort of moot, anyhow?\u201d Jacob didn\u2019t like the reminder; the pain in his eyes hardened into animosity. \u201cYeah, I broke the treaty \u2014 back before I believed any of it. And I\u2019m sure they were informed of that.\u201d He glared sourly at my forehead, not meeting my shamed gaze. \u201cBut it\u2019s not like that gives them a freebie or anything. There\u2019s no fault for a fault. They have only one option if they object to what I did. The same option we\u2019ll have when they break the treaty: to attack. To start the war.\u201d He made it sound so inevitable. I shuddered. \u201cJake, it doesn\u2019t have to be that way.\u201d His teeth ground together. \u201cIt is that way.\u201d The silence after his declaration felt very loud. \u201cWill you never forgive me, Jacob?\u201d I whispered. As soon as I said the words, I wished I hadn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t want to hear his answer. \u201cYou won\u2019t be Bella anymore,\u201d he told me. \u201cMy friend won\u2019t exist. There\u2019ll be no one to forgive.\u201d \u201cThat sounds like a no, \u201d I whispered. We faced each other for an endless moment. \u201cIs this goodbye then, Jake?\u201d He blinked rapidly, his fierce expression melting in surprise. \u201cWhy? We still have a few years. Can\u2019t we be friends until we\u2019re out of time?\u201d \u201cYears? No, Jake, not years.\u201d I shook my head, and laughed once without humor. \u201cWeeks is more accurate.\u201d I was not expecting his reaction. He was suddenly on his feet, and there was a loud pop as the soda can exploded in his hand. Soda flew everywhere, soaking me, like it was spraying from a hose. \u201cJake!\u201d I started to complain, but I fell silent when I realized that his whole body was quivering with anger. He glared at me wildly, a growling sound building in his chest. I froze in place, too shocked to remember how to move. The shaking rolled through him, getting faster, until it looked like he was vibrating. His shape blurred. . . . And then Jacob gritted his teeth together, and the growling stopped. He squeezed his eyes tight in concentration; the quivering slowed until only his hands were shaking.  \u201cWeeks,\u201d Jacob said in a flat monotone. I couldn\u2019t respond; I was still frozen. He opened his eyes. They were beyond fury now. \u201cHe\u2019s going to change you into a filthy bloodsucker in just a few weeks!\u201d Jacob hissed through his teeth. Too stunned to take offense at his words, I just nodded mutely. His face turned green under the russet skin.  \u201cOf course, Jake,\u201d I whispered after a long minute of silence. \u201cHe\u2019s seventeen, Jacob. And I get closer to nineteen every day. Besides, what\u2019s the point in waiting? He\u2019s all I want. What else can I do?\u201d I\u2019d meant that as a rhetorical question. His words cracked like snaps of a whip. \u201cAnything. Anything else. You\u2019d be better off dead. I\u2019d rather you were.\u201d I recoiled like he\u2019d slapped me. It hurt worse than if he had. And then, as the pain shot through me, my own temper burst into flame. \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll get lucky,\u201d I said bleakly, lurching to my feet. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll get hit by a truck on my way back.\u201d I grabbed my motorcycle and pushed it out into the rain. He didn\u2019t move as I passed him. As soon as I was on the small, muddy path, I climbed on and kicked the bike to life. The rear tire spit a fountain of mud toward the garage, and I hoped that it hit him. I got absolutely soaked as I sped across the slick highway toward the Cullens\u2019 house. The wind felt like it was freezing the rain against my skin, and my teeth were chattering before I was halfway there. Motorcycles were too impractical for Washington. I would sell the stupid thing first chance I got. I walked the bike into the Cullens\u2019 cavernous garage and was unsurprised to find Alice waiting for me, perched lightly on the hood of her Porsche. Alice stroked the glossy yellow paint. \u00a0\u201cI haven\u2019t even had a chance to drive it.\u201d She sighed. \u201cSorry,\u201d I spit through my rattling teeth. \u201cYou look like you could use a hot shower,\u201d she said, offhand, as she sprang lightly to her feet. \u201cYep.\u201d She pursed her lips, taking in my expression carefully. \u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d \u201cNope.\u201d She nodded in assent, but her eyes were raging with curiosity. \u201cDo you want to go to Olympia tonight?\u201d \u201cNot really. Can\u2019t I go home?\u201d She grimaced. \u201cNever mind, Alice,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll stay if it makes things easier for you.\u201d \u201cThanks,\u201d she sighed in relief. I went to bed early that night, curling up on his sofa again. It was still dark when I woke. I was groggy, but I knew it wasn\u2019t near morning yet. My eyes closed, and I stretched, rolling over. It took me a second before I realized that the movement should have dumped me onto the floor. And that I was much too comfortable. I rolled back over, trying to see. It was darker than last night \u2014 the clouds were too thick for the moon to shine through. \u201cSorry,\u201d he murmured so softly that his voice was part of the darkness. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to wake you.\u201d I tensed, waiting for the fury \u2014 both his and mine \u2014 but it was only quiet and calm in the darkness of his room. I could almost taste the sweetness of reunion in the air, a separate fragrance from the perfume of his breath; the emptiness when we were apart left its own bitter aftertaste, something I didn\u2019t consciously notice until it was removed. There was no friction in the space between us. The stillness was peaceful \u2014 not like the calm before the tempest, but like a clear night untouched by even the dream of a storm. And I didn\u2019t care that I was supposed to be angry with him. I didn\u2019t care that I was supposed to be angry with everyone. I reached out for him, found his hands in the darkness, and pulled myself closer to him. His arms encircled me, cradling me to his chest. My lips searched, hunting along his throat, to his chin, till I finally found his lips. Edward kissed me softly for a moment, and then he chuckled. \u201cI was all braced for the wrath that was going to put grizzlies to shame, and this is what I get? I should infuriate you more often.\u201d \u00a0\u201cGive me a minute to work up to it,\u201d I teased, kissing him again. \u201cI\u2019ll wait as long as you want,\u201d he whispered against my lips. His fingers knotted in my hair. My breath was becoming uneven. \u201cMaybe in the morning.\u201d \u201cWhatever you prefer.\u201d \u201cWelcome home,\u201d I said while his cold lips pressed under my jaw. \u201cI\u2019m glad you came back.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a very good thing.\u201d \u201cMmm,\u201d I agreed, tightening my arms around his neck. His hand curved around my elbow, moving slowly down my arm, across my ribs and over my waist, tracing along my hip and down my leg, around my knee. He paused there, his hand curling around my calf. He pulled my leg up suddenly, hitching it around his hip. I stopped breathing. This wasn\u2019t the kind of thing he usually allowed. Despite his cold hands, I felt suddenly warm. His lips moved in the hollow at the base of my throat. \u201cNot to bring on the ire prematurely,\u201d he whispered, \u201cbut do you mind telling me what it is about this bed that you object to?\u201d Before I could answer, before I could even concentrate enough to make sense of his words, he rolled to the side, pulling me on top of him. He held my face in his hands, angling it up so that his mouth could reach my throat. My breathing was too loud \u2014 it was almost embarrassing, but I couldn\u2019t care quite enough to be ashamed. \u201cThe bed?\u201d he asked again. \u201cI think it\u2019s nice.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s unnecessary,\u201d I managed to gasp. He pulled my face back to his, and my lips shaped themselves around his. Slowly this time, he rolled till he hovered over me. He held himself carefully so that I felt none of his weight, but I could feel the cool marble of his body press against mine. My heart was hammering so loudly that it was hard to hear his quiet laughter. \u201cThat\u2019s debatable,\u201d he disagreed. \u201cThis would be difficult on a couch.\u201d Cold as ice, his tongue lightly traced the shape of my lips. My head was spinning \u2014 the air was coming too fast and shallow.  \u201cDid you change your mind?\u201d I asked breathlessly. Maybe he\u2019d rethought all his careful rules. Maybe there was more significance to this bed than I\u2019d originally guessed. My heart pounded almost painfully as I waited for his answer. Edward sighed, rolling back so that we were on our sides again. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous, Bella,\u201d he said, disapproval strong in his voice \u2014 clearly, he understood what I meant. \u201cI was just trying to illustrate the benefits of the bed you don\u2019t seem to like. Don\u2019t get carried away.\u201d \u201cToo late,\u201d I muttered. \u201cAnd I like the bed,\u201d I added. \u00a0\u201cGood.\u201d I could hear the smile in his voice as he kissed my forehead. \u201cI do, too.\u201d \u201cBut I still think it\u2019s unnecessary,\u201d I continued. \u201cIf we\u2019re not going to get carried away, what\u2019s the point?\u201d He sighed again. \u201cFor the hundredth time, Bella \u2014 it\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d \u201cI like danger,\u201d I insisted. \u201cI know.\u201d There was a sour edge to his voice, and I realized that he would have seen the motorcycle in the garage. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s dangerous,\u201d I said quickly, before he could move to a new topic of discussion. \u201cI\u2019m going to spontaneously combust one of these days \u2014 and you\u2019ll have no one but yourself to blame.\u201d He started to push me away. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I objected, clinging to him. \u201cProtecting you from combustion. If this too much for you. . . .\u201d \u201cI can handle it,\u201d I insisted. He let me worm myself back into the circle of his arms. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I gave you the wrong impression,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to make you unhappy. That wasn\u2019t nice.\u201d \u201cActually, it was very, very nice.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cAren\u2019t you tired? I should let you sleep.\u201d \u201cNo, I\u2019m not. I don\u2019t mind if you want to give me the wrong impression again.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s probably a bad idea. You\u2019re not the only one who gets carried away.\u201d \u201cYes, I am,\u201d I grumbled. He chuckled. \u201cYou have no idea, Bella. It doesn\u2019t help that you are so eager to undermine my self-control, either.\u201d  \u201cI\u2019m not going to apologize for that.\u201d \u201cCan I apologize?\u201d \u201cFor what?\u201d \u201cYou were angry with me, remember?\u201d \u201cOh, that.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was wrong. It\u2019s much easier to have the proper perspective when I have you safely here.\u201d His arms tightened around me. \u201cI go a little berserk when I try to leave you. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll go so far again. It\u2019s not worth it.\u201d I smiled. \u201cDidn\u2019t you find any mountain lions?\u201d \u201cYes, I did, actually. Still not worth the anxiety. I\u2019m sorry I had Alice hold you hostage, though. That was a bad idea.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d I agreed. \u201cI won\u2019t do it again.\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d I said easily. He was already forgiven. \u201cBut slumber parties do have their advantages. . . .\u201d I curled myself closer to him, pressing my lips into the indentation over his collarbone. \u201cYou can hold me hostage any time you want.\u201d \u201cMmm,\u201d he sighed. \u201cI may take you up on that.\u201d \u201cSo is it my turn now?\u201d \u201cYour turn?\u201d his voice was confused. \u201cTo apologize.\u201d \u201cWhat do you have to apologize for?\u201d \u201cAren\u2019t you mad at me?\u201d I asked blankly. \u201cNo.\u201d It sounded like he really meant it. I felt my eyebrows pull together. \u201cDidn\u2019t you see Alice when you got home?\u201d \u201cYes \u2014 why?\u201d \u201cAre you going to take her Porsche back?\u201d \u201cOf course not. It was a gift.\u201d I wished I could see his expression. His voice sounded as if I\u2019d insulted him. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to know what I did?\u201d I asked, starting to be puzzled by his apparent lack of concern. I felt him shrug. \u201cI\u2019m always interested in everything you do \u2014 but you don\u2019t have to tell me unless you want to.\u201d \u201cBut I went to La Push.\u201d \u201cI know.\u201d \u201cAnd I ditched school.\u201d \u201cSo did I.\u201d I stared toward the sound of his voice, tracing his features with my fingers, trying to understand his mood. \u201cWhere did all this tolerance come from?\u201d I demanded. He sighed. \u201cI decided that you were right. My problem before was more about my . . . prejudice against werewolves than anything else. I\u2019m going to try to be more reasonable and trust your judgment. If you say it\u2019s safe, then I\u2019ll believe you.\u201d \u201cWow.\u201d  \u201cAnd . . . most importantly . . . I\u2019m not willing to let this drive a wedge between us.\u201d I rested my head against his chest and closed my eyes, totally content. \u201cSo,\u201d he murmured in a casual tone. \u201cDid you make plans to go back to La Push again soon?\u201d I didn\u2019t answer. His question brought back the memory of Jacob\u2019s words, and my throat was suddenly tight. He misread my silence and the tension in my body. \u201cJust so that I can make my own plans,\u201d he explained quickly. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to feel like you have to hurry back because I\u2019m sitting around waiting for you.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I said in a voice that sounded strange to me. \u201cI don\u2019t have plans go back.\u201d \u201cOh. You don\u2019t have to do that for me.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m welcome anymore,\u201d I whispered.  \u201cDid you run over someone\u2019s cat?\u201d he asked lightly. I knew he didn\u2019t want to force the story out of me, but I could hear the curiosity burning behind his words. \u201cNo.\u201d I took a deep breath, and then mumbled quickly through the explanation. \u201cI thought Jacob would have realized . . . I didn\u2019t think it would surprise him.\u201d Edward waited while I hesitated. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t expecting . . . that it was so soon.\u201d \u201cAh,\u201d Edward said quietly. \u201cHe said he\u2019d rather see me dead.\u201d My voice broke on the last word. Edward was too still for a moment, controlling whatever reaction he didn\u2019t want me to see. Then he crushed me gently to his chest. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d \u201cI thought you\u2019d be glad,\u201d I whispered. \u201cGlad over something that\u2019s hurt you?\u201d he murmured into my hair. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, Bella.\u201d I sighed and relaxed, fitting myself to the stone shape of him. But he was motionless again, tense. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d \u201cYou can tell me.\u201d He paused for a minute. \u201cIt might make you angry.\u201d \u201cI still want to know.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI could quite literally kill him for saying that to you. I want to.\u201d I laughed halfheartedly. \u201cI guess it\u2019s a good thing you\u2019ve got so much self-control.\u201d \u201cI could slip.\u201d His tone was thoughtful. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to have a lapse in control, I can think of a better place for it.\u201d I reached for his face, trying to pull myself up to kiss him. His arms held me tighter, restraining. He sighed. \u201cMust I always be the responsible one?\u201d I grinned in the darkness. \u201cNo. Let me be in charge of responsibility for a few minutes . . . or hours.\u201d \u201cGoodnight, Bella.\u201d \u201cWait \u2014 there was something else I wanted to ask you about.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cI was talking to Rosalie last night. . . .\u201d His body tensed again. \u201cYes. She was thinking about that when I got in. She gave you quite a lot to consider, didn\u2019t she?\u201d His voice was anxious, and I realized that he thought I wanted to talk about the reasons Rosalie\u2019d given me for staying human. But I was interested in something much more pressing. \u201cShe told me a little bit . . . about the time your family lived in Denali.\u201d There was a short pause; this beginning took him by surprise. \u201cYes?\u201d \u201cShe mentioned something about a bunch of female vampires . . . and you.\u201d He didn\u2019t answer, though I waited for a long moment.  \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I said, after the silence had grown uncomfortable. \u201cShe told me you didn\u2019t . . . show any preference. But I was just wondering, you know, if any of them had. Shown a preference for you, I mean.\u201d Again he said nothing. \u201cWhich one?\u201d I asked, trying to keep my voice casual, and not quite managing. \u201cOr was there more than one?\u201d No answer. I wished I could see his face, so I could try to guess what this silence meant. \u201cAlice will tell me,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll go ask her right now.\u201d His arms tightened; I was unable to squirm even an inch away. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s late,\u201d he said. His voice had a little edge to it that was something new. Sort of nervous, maybe a little embarrassed. \u201cBesides, I think Alice stepped out. . . .\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s bad,\u201d I guessed. \u201cIt\u2019s really bad, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I started to panic, my heart accelerating as I imagined the gorgeous immortal rival I\u2019d never realized I had. \u201cCalm down, Bella,\u201d he said, kissing the tip of my nose. \u201cYou\u2019re being absurd.\u201d \u201cAm I? Then why won\u2019t you tell me?\u201d  \u201cBecause there\u2019s nothing to tell. You\u2019re blowing this wildly out of proportion.\u201d \u201cWhich one?\u201d I insisted. He sighed. \u201cTanya expressed a little interest. I let her know, in a very courteous, gentlemanly fashion, that I did not return that interest. End of story.\u201d I kept my voice as even as possible. \u201cTell me something \u2014 what does Tanya look like?\u201d \u201cJust like the rest of us \u2014 white skin, gold eyes,\u201d he answered too quickly. \u201cAnd, of course, extraordinarily beautiful.\u201d I felt him shrug.  \u201cI suppose, to human eyes,\u201d he said, indifferent. \u201cYou know what, though?\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d My voice was petulant. He put his lips right to my ear; his cold breath tickled. \u201cI prefer brunettes.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s a blonde. That figures.\u201d \u201cStrawberry blonde \u2014 not at all my type.\u201d I thought about that for a while, trying to concentrate as his lips moved slowly along my cheek, down my throat, and back up again. He made the circuit three times before I spoke. \u201cI guess that\u2019s okay, then,\u201d I decided. \u201cHmm,\u201d he whispered against my skin. \u201cYou\u2019re quite adorable when you\u2019re jealous. It\u2019s surprisingly enjoyable.\u201d I scowled into the darkness. \u201cIt\u2019s late,\u201d he said again, murmuring, almost crooning now, his voice smoother than silk. \u201cSleep, my Bella. Dream happy dreams. You are the only one who has ever touched my heart. It will always be yours. Sleep, my only love.\u201d He started to hum my lullaby, and I knew it was only a matter of time till I succumbed, so I closed my eyes and <em>snuggled</em> closer into his chest.",
