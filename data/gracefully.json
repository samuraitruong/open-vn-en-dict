            "en": "22         22. HIDE-AND-SEEK It had taken much less time than I'd thought \u2014 all the terror, the despair, the shattering of my heart. The minutes were ticking by more slowly than usual. Jasper still hadn't come back when I returned to Alice. I was afraid to be in the same room with her, afraid that she would guess\u2026 and afraid to hide from her for the same reason. I would have thought I was far beyond the ability to be surprised, my thoughts tortured and unstable, but I was surprised when I saw Alice bent over the desk, gripping the edge with two hands. \"Alice?\" . She didn't react when I called her name, but her head was slowly rocking side to side, and I saw her face. Her eyes were blank, dazed\u2026 My thoughts flew to my mother. Was I already too late? I hurried to her side, reaching out automatically to touch her hand. \"Alice!\" Jasper's voice whipped, and then he was right behind her, his hands curling over hers, loosening them from their grip on the table. Across the room, the door swung shut with a low click. \"What is it?\" he demanded. She turned her face away from me, into his chest. \"Bella,\" she said. \"I'm right here,\" I replied. Her head twisted around, her eyes locking on mine, their expression still strangely blank. I realized at once that she hadn't been speaking to me, she'd been answering Jasper's question. \"What did you see?\" I said \u2014 and there was no question in my flat, uncaring voice. Jasper looked at me sharply. I kept my expression vacant and waited. His eyes were confused as they flickered swiftly between Alice's face and mine, feeling the chaos\u2026 for I could guess what Alice had seen now. I felt a tranquil atmosphere settle around me. I welcomed it, using it to keep my emotions disciplined, under control. Alice, too, recovered herself. \"Nothing, really,\" she answered finally, her voice remarkably calm and convincing. \"Just the same room as before.\" She finally looked at me, her expression smooth and withdrawn. \"Did you want breakfast?\" \"No, I'll eat at the airport.\" I was very calm, too. I went to the bathroom to shower. Almost as if I were borrowing Jasper's strange extra sense, I could feel Alice's wild \u2014 though well-concealed \u2014 desperation to have me out of the room, to be alone with Jasper. So she could tell him that they were doing something wrong, that they were going to fail\u2026 I got ready methodically, concentrating on each little task. I left my hair down, swirling around me, covering my face. The peaceful mood Jasper created worked its way through me and helped me think clearly. Helped me plan. I dug through my bag until I found my sock full of money. I emptied it into my pocket. \u00a0I was anxious to get to the airport, and glad when we left by seven. I sat alone this time in the back of the dark car. Alice leaned against the door, her face toward Jasper but, behind her sunglasses, shooting glances in my direction every few seconds. \"Alice?\" I asked indifferently. She was wary. \"Yes?\" \"How does it work? The things that you see?\" I stared out the side window, and my voice sounded bored. \"Edward said it wasn't definite\u2026 that things change?\" It was harder than I would have thought to say his name. That must have been what alerted Jasper, why a fresh wave of serenity filled the car. \"Yes, things change\u2026\" she murmured \u2014 hopefully, I thought. \"Some things are more certain than others\u2026 like the weather. People are harder. I only see the course they're on while they're on it. Once they change their minds \u2014 make a new decision, no matter how small \u2014 the whole future shifts.\" I nodded thoughtfully. \"So you couldn't see James in Phoenix until he decided to come here.\" \"Yes,\" she agreed, wary again. And she hadn't seen me in the mirror room with James until I'd made the decision to meet him there. I tried not to think about what else she might have seen. I didn't want my panic to make Jasper more suspicious. They would be watching me twice as carefully now, anyway, after Alice's vision. This was going to be impossible. We got to the airport. Luck was with me, or maybe it was just good odds. Edward's plane was landing in terminal four, the largest terminal, where most flights landed \u2014 so it wasn't surprising that his was. But it was the terminal I needed: the biggest, the most confusing. And there was a door on level three that might be the only chance. We parked on the fourth floor of the huge garage. I led the way, for once more knowledgeable about my surroundings than they were. We took the elevator down to level three, where the passengers unloaded. Alice and Jasper spent a long time looking at the departing flights board. I could hear them discussing the pros and cons of New York, Atlanta, Chicago. Places I'd never seen. And would never see. I waited for my opportunity, impatient, unable to stop my toe from tapping. We sat in the long rows of chairs by the metal detectors, Jasper and Alice pretending to people-watch but really watching me. Every inch I shifted in my seat was followed by a quick glance out of the corner of their eyes. It was hopeless. Should I run? Would they dare to stop me physically in this public place? Or would they simply follow? I pulled the unmarked envelope out of my pocket and set it on top of Alice's black leather bag. She looked at me. \"My letter,\" I said. She nodded, tucking it under the top flap. He would find it soon enough. The minutes passed and Edward's arrival grew closer. It was amazing how every cell in my body seemed to know he was coming, to long for his coming. That made it very hard. I found myself trying to think of excuses to stay, to see him first and then make my escape. But I knew that was impossible if I was going to have any chance to get away. Several times Alice offered to go get breakfast with me. Later, I told her, not yet. I stared at the arrival board, watching as flight after flight arrived on time. The flight from Seattle crept closer to the top of the board.  And then, when I had only thirty minutes to make my escape, the numbers changed. His plane was ten minutes early. I had no more time. \"I think I'll eat now,\" I said quickly. Alice stood. \"I'll come with you.\" \"Do you mind if Jasper comes instead?\" I asked. \"I'm feeling a little\u2026\" I didn't finish the sentence. My eyes were wild enough to convey what I didn't say. Jasper stood up. Alice's eyes were confused, but \u2014 I saw to my relief\u2014 not suspicious. She must be attributing the change in her vision to some maneuver of the tracker's rather than a betrayal by me. Jasper walked silently beside me, his hand on the small of my back, as if he were guiding me. I pretended a lack of interest in the first few airport cafes, my head scanning for what I really wanted. And there it was, around the corner, out of Alice's sharp sight: the level-three ladies' room. \"Do you mind?\" I asked Jasper as we passed. \"I'll just be a moment.\" \"I'll be right here,\" he said. As soon as the door shut behind me, I was running. I remembered the time I had gotten lost from this bathroom, because it had two exits. Outside the far door it was only a short sprint to the elevators, and if Jasper stayed where he said he would, I'd never be in his line of sight. I didn't look behind me as I ran. This was my only chance, and even if he saw me, I had to keep going. People stared, but I ignored them. Around the corner the elevators were waiting, and I dashed forward, throwing my hand between the closing doors of a full elevator headed down. I squeezed in beside the irritated passengers, and checked to make sure that the button for level one had been pushed. It was already lit, and the doors closed. As soon as the door opened I was off again, to the sound of annoyed murmurs behind me. I slowed myself as I passed the security guards by the luggage carousels, only to break into a run again as the exit doors came into view. I had no way of knowing if Jasper was looking for me yet. I would have only seconds if he was following my scent. I jumped out the automatic doors, nearly smacking into the glass when they opened too slowly. Along the crowded curb there wasn't a cab in sight. I had no time. Alice and Jasper were either about to realize I was gone, or they already had. They would find me in a heartbeat. A shuttle to the Hyatt was just closing its doors a few feet behind me.  \"Wait!\" I called, running, waving at the driver. \"This is the shuttle to the Hyatt,\" the driver said in confusion as he opened the doors. \"Yes,\" I huffed, \"that's where I'm going.\" I hurried up the steps. He looked askance at my luggage-less state, but then shrugged, not caring enough to ask. Most of the seats were empty. I sat as far from the other travelers as possible, and watched out the window as first the sidewalk, and then the airport, drifted away. I couldn't help imagining Edward, where he would stand at the edge of the road when he found the end of my trail. I couldn't cry yet, I told myself. I still had a long way to go. My luck held. In front of the Hyatt, a tired-looking couple was getting their last suitcase out of the trunk of a cab. I jumped out of the shuttle and ran to the cab, sliding into the seat behind the driver. The tired couple and the shuttle driver stared at me. I told the surprised cabbie my mother's address. \"I need to get there as soon as possible.\" \"That's in Scottsdale,\" he complained. I threw four twenties over the seat. \"Will that be enough?\" \"Sure, kid, no problem.\" I sat back against the seat, folding my arms across my lap. The familiar city began to rush around me, but I didn't look out the windows. I exerted myself to maintain control. I was determined not to lose myself at this point, now that my plan was successfully completed.  There was no point in indulging in more terror, more anxiety. My path was set. I just had to follow it now. So, instead of panicking, I closed my eyes and spent the twenty minutes' drive with Edward. I imagined that I had stayed at the airport to meet Edward. I visualized how I would stand on my toes, the sooner to see his face. How quickly, how <em>gracefully</em> he would move through the crowds of people separating us.  And then I would run to close those last few feet between us \u2014 reckless as always \u2014 and I would be in his marble arms, finally safe. I wondered where we would have gone. North somewhere, so he could be outside in the day. Or maybe somewhere very remote, so we could lay in the sun together again. I imagined him by the shore, his skin sparkling like the sea. It wouldn't matter how long we had to hide. To be trapped in a hotel room with him would be a kind of heaven. So many questions I still had for him. I could talk to him forever, never sleeping, never leaving his side. I could see his face so clearly now\u2026 almost hear his voice. And, despite all the horror and hopelessness, I was fleetingly happy. So involved was I in my escapist daydreams, I lost all track of the seconds racing by. \"Hey, what was the number?\" The cabbie's question punctured my fantasy, letting all the colors run out of my lovely delusions. Fear, bleak and hard, was waiting to fill the empty space they left behind. \"Fifty-eight twenty-one.\" My voice sounded strangled. The cabbie looked at me, nervous that I was having an episode or something. \"Here we are, then.\" He was anxious to get me out of his car, probably hoping I wouldn't ask for my change. \"Thank you,\" I whispered. There was no need to be afraid, I reminded myself. The house was empty. I had to hurry; my mom was waiting for me, frightened, depending on me. I ran to the door, reaching up automatically to grab the key under the eave. I unlocked the door. It was dark inside, empty, normal. I ran to the phone, turning on the kitchen light on my way. There, on the whiteboard, was a ten-digit number written in a small, neat hand. My fingers stumbled over the keypad, making mistakes. I had to hang up and start again. I concentrated only on the buttons this time, carefully pressing each one in turn. I was successful. I held the phone to my ear with a shaking hand. It rang only once. \"Hello, Bella,\" that easy voice answered. \"That was very quick. I'm impressed.\" \"Is my mom all right?\" \"She's perfectly fine. Don't worry, Bella, I have no quarrel with her.\u00a0 Unless you didn't come alone, of course.\" Light, amused. \"I'm alone.\" I'd never been more alone in my entire life. \"Very good. Now, do you know the ballet studio just around the corner from your home?\" \"Yes. I know how to get there.\" \"Well, then, I'll see you very soon.\" I hung up. I ran from the room, through the door, out into the baking heat. There was no time to look back at my house, and I didn't want to see it as it was now \u2014 empty, a symbol of fear instead of sanctuary. The last person to walk through those familiar rooms was my enemy. From the corner of my eye, I could almost see my mother standing in the shade of the big eucalyptus tree where I'd played as a child. Or kneeling by the little plot of dirt around the mailbox, the cemetery of all the flowers she'd tried to grow. The memories were better than any reality I would see today. But I raced away from them, toward the corner, leaving everything behind me. I felt so slow, like I was running through wet sand \u2014 I couldn't seem to get enough purchase from the concrete. I tripped several times, once falling, catching myself with my hands, scraping them on the sidewalk, and then lurching up to plunge forward again. But at last I made it to the corner. Just another street now; I ran, sweat pouring down my face, gasping. The sun was hot on my skin, too bright as it bounced off the white concrete and blinded me. I felt dangerously exposed. More fiercely than I would have dreamed I was capable of, I wished for the green, protective forests of Forks\u2026 of home. \u00a0When I rounded the last corner, onto Cactus, I could see the studio, looking just as I remembered it. The parking lot in front was empty, the vertical blinds in all the windows drawn. I couldn't run anymore \u2014 I couldn't breathe; exertion and fear had gotten the best of me. I thought of my mother to keep my feet moving, one in front of the other. As I got closer, I could see the sign inside the door. It was handwritten on hot pink paper; it said the dance studio was closed for spring break.  I touched the handle, tugged on it cautiously. It was unlocked. I fought to catch my breath, and opened the door. The lobby was dark and empty, cool, the air conditioner thrumming. The plastic molded chairs were stacked along the walls, and the carpet smelled like shampoo. The west dance floor was dark, I could see through the open viewing window. The east dance floor, the bigger room, was lit. But the blinds were closed on the window. Terror seized me so strongly that I was literally trapped by it. I couldn't make my feet move forward.  And then my mother's voice called. \"Bella? Bella?\" That same tone of hysterical panic. I sprinted to the door, to the sound of her voice. \"Bella, you scared me! Don't you ever do that to me again!\" Her voice continued as I ran into the long, high-ceilinged room. I stared around me, trying to find where her voice was coming from. I heard her laugh, and I whirled to the sound. There she was, on the TV screen, tousling my hair in relief. It was Thanksgiving, and I was twelve. We'd gone to see my grandmother in California, the last year before she died. We went to the beach one day, and I'd leaned too far over the edge of the pier. She'd seen my feet flailing, trying to reclaim my balance. \"Bella? Bella?\" she'd called to me in fear. And then the TV screen was blue. I turned slowly. He was standing very still by the back exit, so still I hadn't noticed him at first. In his hand was a remote control. We stared at each other for a long moment, and then he smiled. He walked toward me, quite close, and then passed me to put the remote down next to the VCR. I turned carefully to watch him. \"Sorry about that, Bella, but isn't it better that your mother didn't really have to be involved in all this?\" His voice was courteous, kind. And suddenly it hit me. My mother was safe. She was still in Florida. She'd never gotten my message. She'd never been terrified by the dark red eyes in the abnormally pale face before me. She was safe. \"Yes,\" I answered, my voice saturated with relief. \"You don't sound angry that I tricked you.\" \"I'm not.\" My sudden high made me brave. What did it matter now? It would soon be over. Charlie and Mom would never be harmed, would never have to fear. I felt almost giddy. Some analytical part of my mind warned me that I was dangerously close to snapping from the stress. \"How odd. You really mean it.\" His dark eyes assessed me with interest. The irises were nearly black, just a hint of ruby around the edges. Thirsty. \"I will give your strange coven this much, you humans can be quite interesting. I guess I can see the draw of observing you. It's amazing \u2014 some of you seem to have no sense of your own self-interest at all.\" He was standing a few feet away from me, arms folded, looking at me curiously. There was no menace in his face or stance. He was so very average-looking, nothing remarkable about his face or body at all. Just the white skin, the circled eyes I'd grown so used to. He wore a pale blue, long-sleeved shirt and faded blue jeans. \"I suppose you're going to tell me that your boyfriend will avenge you?\" he asked, hopefully it seemed to me. \"No, I don't think so. At least, I asked him not to.\" \"And what was his reply to that?\" \"I don't know.\" It was strangely easy to converse with this genteel hunter. \"I left him a letter.\" \"How romantic, a last letter. And do you think he will honor it?\" His voice was just a little harder now, a hint of sarcasm marring his polite tone. \"I hope so.\" Hmmm. Well, our hopes differ then. You see, this was all just a little too easy, too quick. To be quite honest, I'm disappointed. I expected a much greater challenge. And, after all, I only needed a little luck.\" I waited in silence. \"When Victoria couldn't get to your father, I had her find out more about you. There was no sense in running all over the planet chasing you down when I could comfortably wait for you in a place of my choosing. So, after I talked to Victoria, I decided to come to Phoenix to pay your mother a visit. I'd heard you say you were going home. At first, I never dreamed you meant it. But then I wondered. Humans can be very predictable; they like to be somewhere familiar, somewhere safe. And wouldn't it be the perfect ploy, to go to the last place you should be when you're hiding \u2014 the place that you said you'd be. \"But of course I wasn't sure, it was just a hunch. I usually get a feeling about the prey that I'm hunting, a sixth sense, if you will. I listened to your message when I got to your mother's house, but of course I couldn't be sure where you'd called from. It was very useful to have your number, but you could have been in Antarctica for all I knew, and the game wouldn't work unless you were close by. \"Then your boyfriend got on a plane to Phoenix. Victoria was monitoring them for me, naturally; in a game with this many players, I couldn't be working alone. And so they told me what I'd hoped, that you were here after all. I was prepared; I'd already been through your charming home movies. And then it was simply a matter of the bluff. \"Very easy, you know, not really up to my standards. So, you see, I'm hoping you're wrong about your boyfriend. Edward, isn't it?\" I didn't answer. The bravado was wearing off. I sensed that he was coming to the end of his gloat. It wasn't meant for me anyway. There was no glory in beating me, a weak human. \"Would you mind, very much, if I left a little letter of my own for your Edward?\" He took a step back and touched a palm-sized digital video camera balanced carefully on top of the stereo. A small red light indicated that it was already running. He adjusted it a few times, widened the frame. I stared at him in horror. \"I'm sorry, but I just don't think he'll be able to resist hunting me after he watches this. And I wouldn't want him to miss anything. It was all for him, of course. You're simply a human, who unfortunately was in the wrong place, at the wrong time, and indisputably running with the wrong crowd, I might add.\" He stepped toward me, smiling. \"Before we begin\u2026\" I felt a curl of nausea in the pit of my stomach as he spoke. This was something I had not anticipated. \"I would just like to rub it in, just a little bit. The answer was there all along, and I was so afraid Edward would see that and ruin my fun. It happened once, oh, ages ago. The one and only time my prey escaped me. \"You see, the vampire who was so stupidly fond of this little victim made the choice that your Edward was too weak to make. When the old one knew I was after his little friend, he stole her from the asylum where he worked \u2014 I never will understand the obsession some vampires seem to form with you humans \u2014 and as soon as he freed her he made her safe.  She didn't even seem to notice the pain, poor little creature. She'd been stuck in that black hole of a cell for so long. A hundred years earlier and she would have been burned at the stake for her visions. In the nineteen-twenties it was the asylum and the shock treatments. When she opened her eyes, strong with her fresh youth, it was like she'd never seen the sun before. The old vampire made her a strong new vampire, and there was no reason for me to touch her then.\" He sighed. \"I destroyed the old one in vengeance.\" \"Alice,\" I breathed, astonished. \"Yes, your little friend. I was surprised to see her in the clearing. So I guess her coven ought to be able to derive some comfort from this experience. I get you, but they get her. The one victim who escaped me, quite an honor, actually. \"And she did smell so delicious. I still regret that I never got to taste\u2026 She smelled even better than you do. Sorry \u2014 I don't mean to be offensive. You have a very nice smell. Floral, somehow\u2026\" He took another step toward me, till he was just inches away. He lifted a lock of my hair and sniffed at it delicately. Then he gently patted the strand back into place, and I felt his cool fingertips against my throat. He reached up to stroke my cheek once quickly with his thumb, his face curious. I wanted so badly to run, but I was frozen. I couldn't even flinch away. \"No,\" he murmured to himself as he dropped his hand, \"I don't understand.\" He sighed. \"Well, I suppose we should get on with it. And then I can call your friends and tell them where to find you, and my little message.\" I was definitely sick now. There was pain coming, I could see it in his eyes. It wouldn't be enough for him to win, to feed and go. There would be no quick end like I'd been counting on. My knees began to shake, and I was afraid I was going to fall. He stepped back, and began to circle, casually, as if he were trying to get a better view of a statue in a museum. His face was still open and friendly as he decided where to start. Then he slumped forward, into a crouch I recognized, and his pleasant smile slowly widened, grew, till it wasn't a smile at all but a contortion of teeth, exposed and glistening. I couldn't help myself\u2014 I tried to run. As useless as I knew it would be, as weak as my knees already were, panic took over and I bolted for the emergency door. He was in front of me in a flash. I didn't see if he used his hand or his foot, it was too fast. A crushing blow struck my chest \u2014 I felt myself flying backward, and then heard the crunch as my head bashed into the mirrors. The glass buckled, some of the pieces shattering and splintering on the floor beside me. I was too stunned to feel the pain. I couldn't breathe yet.  He walked toward me slowly. \"That's a very nice effect,\" he said, examining the mess of glass, his voice friendly again. \"I thought this room would be visually dramatic for my little film. That's why I picked this place to meet you. It's perfect, isn't it?\" I ignored him, scrambling on my hands and knees, crawling toward the other door. He was over me at once, his foot stepping down hard on my leg. I heard the sickening snap before I felt it. But then I did feel it, and I couldn't hold back my scream of agony. I twisted up to reach for my leg, and he was standing over me, smiling. \"Would you like to rethink your last request?\" he asked pleasantly. His toe nudged my broken leg and I heard a piercing scream. With a shock, I realized it was mine. \"Wouldn't you rather have Edward try to find me?\" he prompted. \"No!\" I croaked. \"No, Edward, don't\u2014\" And then something smashed into my face, throwing me back into the broken mirrors. Over the pain of my leg, I felt the sharp rip across my scalp where the glass cut into it. And then the warm wetness began to spread through my hair with alarming speed. I could feel it soaking the shoulder of my shirt, hear it dripping on the wood below. The smell of it twisted my stomach. Through the nausea and dizziness I saw something that gave me a sudden, final shred of hope. His eyes, merely intent before, now burned with an uncontrollable need. The blood \u2014 spreading crimson across my white shirt, pooling rapidly on the floor \u2014 was driving him mad with thirst. No matter his original intentions, he couldn't draw this out much longer. Let it be quick now, was all I could hope as the flow of blood from my head sucked my consciousness away with it. My eyes were closing.  I heard, as if from underwater, the final growl of the hunter. I could see, through the long tunnels my eyes had become, his dark shape coming toward me. With my last effort, my hand instinctively raised to protect my face. My eyes closed, and I drifted.",

            "en": "7 REPETITION        7 REPETITION I wasn't sure what the hell i was doing here. Was I trying to push myself back into the zombie stupor? Had I turned masochistic \u2014 developed a taste for torture? I should have gone straight down to La Push I felt much, much healthier around Jacob. This was not a healthy thing to do. But I continued to drive slowly down the overgrown lane, twisting through the trees that arched over me like a green, living tunnel. My hands were shaking, so I tightened my grip on the steering wheel. I knew that part of the reason I did this was the nightmare, now that I was really awake, the nothingness of the dream gnawed on my nerves, a dog worrying a bone. There was something to search for. Unattainable and impossible, uncaring and\u00a0\u00a0 distracted\u2026 but he was out there, somewhere. I had to believe that. The other part was the strange sense of repetition I'd felt at school today, the coincidence of the date. The feeling that I was starting over\u2014perhaps the way my first day would have gone if I'd really been the most unusual person in the cafeteria that afternoon. The words ran through my head, tonelessly, like I was reading them rather than hearing them spoken: It will be as if I'd never existed. I was lying to myself by splitting my reason for coming here into just two parts. I didn't want to admit the strongest motivation. Because it was mentally unsound. The truth was that I wanted to hear his voice again, like I had in the strange delusion Friday night. For that brief moment, when his voice came from some other part of me than my conscious memory, when his voice was perfect and honey smooth rather than the pale echo my memories usually produced, I was able to remember without pain. It hadn't lasted; the pain had caught up with me, as I was sure it would for this fool's errand. But those precious moments when I could hear him again were an irresistible lure. I had to find some way to repeat the experience\u2026 or maybe the better word was episode. I was hoping that d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu was the key. So I was going to his home, a place I hadn't been since my ill-fated birthday party, so many months ago. The thick, almost jungle-like growth crawled slowly past my windows. The drive wound on and on. I started to go faster, getting edgy. How long had I been driving? Shouldn't I have reached the house yet? The lane was so overgrown that it did not look familiar. What if I couldn't find it? I shivered. What if there was no tangible proof at all? Then there was the break in the trees that I was looking for, only it was not so\u00a0 pronounced as before. The flora here did not wait long to reclaim any land that was left unguarded. The tall ferns had infiltrated the meadow around the house, crowding against the trunks of the cedars, even the wide porch. It was like the lawn had been flooded\u2014waist-high\u2014with green, feathery waves. And the house was there, but it was not the same. Though nothing had changed on the outside, the emptiness screamed from the blank windows. It was creepy. For the first time since I'd seen the beautiful house, it looked like a fitting haunt for vampires. I hit the brakes, looking away. I was afraid to go farther. But nothing happened. No voice in my head. So I left the engine running and jumped out into the fern sea. Maybe, like Friday night, if I walked forward\u2026 I approached the barren, vacant face slowly, my truck rumbling out a comforting roar behind me. I stopped when I got to the porch stairs, because there was nothing here. No lingering sense of their presence\u2026 of his presence. The house was solidly here, but it meant little. Its concrete reality would not counteract the nothingness of the nightmares. I didn't go any closer. I didn't want to look in the windows. I wasn't sure which would be harder to see. If the rooms were bare, echoing empty from floor to ceiling, that would certainly hurt. Like my grandmother's funeral, when my mother had insisted that I stay outside during the viewing. She had said that I didn't need to see Gran that way, to remember her that way, rather than alive. But wouldn't it be worse if there were no change? If the couches sat just as I'd last seen them, the paintings on the walls\u2014worse still, the piano on its low platform? It would be second only to the house disappearing all together, to see that there was no physical possession that tied them in anyway. That everything remained, untouched and forgotten, behind them. Just like me. I turned my back on the gaping emptiness and hurried to my truck. I nearly ran. I was anxious to be gone, to get back to the human world. I felt hideously empty, and I wanted to see Jacob. Maybe I was developing a new kind of sickness, another addiction, like the numbness before. I didn't care. I pushed my truck as fast as it would go as I barreled toward my fix. Jacob was waiting for me. My chest seemed to relax as soon as I saw him, making it easier to breathe. \"Hey, Bella,\" he called. I smiled in relief. \"Hey, Jacob,\" I waved at Billy, who was looking out the window. \"Let's get to work,\" Jacob said in a low but eager voice. I was somehow able to laugh. \"You seriously aren't sick of me yet?\" I wondered. He must be starting to ask himself how desperate I was for company. Jacob led the way around the house to his garage. \"Nope. Not yet.\" \"Please let me know when I start getting on your nerves. I don't want to be a pain.\" \"Okay.\" He laughed, a throaty sound. \"I wouldn't hold your breath for that, though.\" When I walked into the garage, I was shocked to see the red bike standing up, looking like a motorcycle rather than a pile of jagged metal. \"Jake, you're amazing,\" I breathed. He laughed again. \"I get obsessive when I have a project.\" He shrugged. \"If I had any brains I'd drag it out a little bit.\" \"Why?\" He looked down, pausing for so long that I wondered if he hadn't heard my question. Finally, he asked me, \"Bella, if I told you that I couldn't fix these bikes, what would you say?\" I didn't answer right away, either, and he glanced up to check my expression. \"I would say\u2026 that's too bad, but I'll bet we could figure out something else to do. If we got really desperate, we could even do homework.\" Jacob smiled, and his shoulders relaxed. He sat down next to the bike and picked up a wrench. \"So you think you'll still come over when I'm done, then?\" \"Is that what you meant?\" I shook my head. \"I guess I am taking advantage of your very underpriced mechanical skills. But as long as you let me come over, I'll be here.\" \"Hoping to see Quil again?\" he teased. \"You caught me.\" He chuckled. \"You really like spending time with me?\" he asked, marveling. \"Very, very much. And I'll prove it. I have to work tomorrow, but Wednesday we'll do something nonmechanical.\" \"Like what?\" \"I have no idea. We can go to my place so you won't be tempted to be obsessive. You could bring your schoolwork\u2014you have to be getting behind, because I know I am.\" \"Homework might be a good idea.\" He made a face, and I wondered how much he was leaving undone to be with me. \"Yes,\" I agreed. \"We'll have to start being responsible occasionally, or Billy and Charlie aren't going to be so easygoing about this.\" I made a gesture indicating the two of us as a single entity. He liked that\u2014he beamed. \"Homework once a week?\" he proposed. \"Maybe we'd better go with twice,\" I suggested, thinking of the pile I'd just been assigned today. He sighed a heavy sigh. Then he reached over his toolbox to a paper grocery sack. He pulled out two cans of soda, cracking one open and handing it to me. He opened the second, and held it up ceremoniously. \"Here's to responsibility,\" he toasted. \"Twice a week.\" \"And recklessness every day in between,\" I emphasized. He grinned and touched his can to mine. I got home later than I'd planned and found Charlie had ordered a pizza rather than wait for me. He wouldn't let me apologize. \"I don't mind,\" he assured me. \"You deserve a break from all the cooking, anyway.\" I knew he was just relieved that I was still acting like a normal person, and he was not about to rock the boat. I checked my e-mail before I started on my homework, and there was a long one from Renee. She gushed over every detail I'd provided her with, so I sent back another exhaustive description of my day. Everything but the motorcycles. Even happy-go-lucky Renee was likely to be alarmed by that. School Tuesday had its ups and downs. Angela and Mike seemed ready to welcome me back with open arms\u2014to kindly overlook my few months of aberrant behavior. Jess was more resistant. I wondered if she needed a formal written apology for the Port Angeles incident. Mike was animated and chatty at work. It was like he'd stored up the semester's worth of talk, and it was all spilling out now. I found that I was able to smile and laugh with him, though it wasn't as effortless as it was with Jacob. It seemed harmless enough, until quitting time. Mike put the closed sign in the window while I folded my vest and shoved it under the counter. \"This was fun tonight,\" Mike said happily. \"Yeah,\" I agreed, though I'd much rather have spent the afternoon in the garage. \"It's too bad that you had to leave the movie early last week.\" I was a little confused by his train of thought. I shrugged. \"I'm just a wimp, I guess.\" \"What I mean is, you should go to a better movie, something you'd enjoy,\" he explained. \"Oh,\" I muttered, still confused. \"Like maybe this Friday. With me. We could go see something that isn't scary at all.\" I bit my lip. I didn't want to screw things up with Mike, not when he was one of the only people ready to forgive me for being crazy. But this, again, felt far too familiar. Like the last year had never happened. I wished I had Jess as an excuse this time. \"Like a date?\" I asked. Honesty was probably the best policy at this point. Get it over with. He processed the tone of my voice \"If you want. But it doesn't have to be like that.\" \"I don't date,\" I said slowly, realizing how true that was. That whole world seemed impossibly distant. \"Just as friends?\" he suggested. His clear blue eyes were not as eager now. I hoped he really meant that we could be friends anyway. \"That would be fun. But I actually have plans already this Friday, so maybe next week?\" \"What are you doing?\" he asked, less casually than I think he wanted to sound. \"Homework. I have a\u2026 study session planned with a friend.\" \"Oh. Okay. Maybe next week.\" He walked me to my car, less exuberant than before. It reminded me so clearly of my first months in Forks. I'd come full circle, and now everything felt like an echo\u2014an empty echo, devoid of the interest it used to have. The next night, Charlie didn't seem the smallest bit surprised to find Jacob and me sprawled across the living room floor with our books scattered around us, so I guessed that he and Billy were talking behind our backs. \"Hey, kids,\" he said, his eyes straying to the kitchen. The smell of the lasagna I'd spent the afternoon making\u2014while Jacob watched and occasionally sampled\u2014wafted down the hall; I was being good, trying to atone for all the pizza. Jacob stayed for dinner, and took a plate home for Billy. He grudgingly added another year to my negotiable age for being a good cook. Friday was the garage, and Saturday, after my shift at Newton's, was homework again. Charlie felt secure enough in my sanity to spend the day fishing with Harry. When he got back, we were all done\u2014feeling very sensible and mature about it, too\u2014and watching Monster Garage on the Discovery Channel. \"I probably ought to go.\" Jacob sighed. \"It's later than I thought.\" \"Okay, fine,\" I grumbled. \"I'll take you home.\" He laughed at my unwilling expression\u2014it seemed to please him. \"Tomorrow, back to work,\" I said as soon as we were safe in the truck. \"What time do you want me to come up?\" There was an unexplained excitement in his answering smile. \"I'll call you first, okay?\" \"Sure.\" I frowned to myself, wondering what was up. His smile widened. I cleaned the house the next morning\u2014waiting for Jacob to call and trying to shake off the Litest nightmare. The scenery had changed. Last night I'd wandered in a wide sea of ferns interspersed with huge hemlock trees. There was nothing else there, and I was lost, wandering aimless and alone, searching for nothing. I wanted to kick myself for the stupid field trip last week. I shoved the dream out of my conscious mind, hoping it would stay locked up somewhere and not escape again. Charlie was outside washing the cruiser, so when the phone rang, I dropped the toilet brush and ran downstairs to answer it. \"Hello?\" I asked breathlessly. \"Bella,\" Jacob said, a strange, formal tone to his voice. \"Hey, Jake.\" \"I believe that\u2026 we have a date\" he said, his tone thick with implications. It took me a second before I got it. \"They're done? I can't believe it!\" What perfect timing. I needed something to distract me from nightmares and nothingness. \"Yeah, they run and everything.\" \"Jacob, you are absolutely, without a doubt, the most talented and wonderful person I know. You get ten years for this one.\" \"Cool! I'm middle-aged now.\" I laughed. \"I'm on my way up!\" I threw the cleaning supplies under the bathroom counter and grabbed my jacket. \"Headed to see Jake,\" Charlie said when I ran past him. It wasn't really a question. \"Yep,\" I replied as I jumped in my truck. \"I'll be at the station later,\" Charlie called after me. \"Okay,\" I yelled back, turning the key. Charlie said something else, but I couldn't hear him clearly over the roar of the engine. It sounded sort of like, \"Where's the fire?\" I parked my truck off to the side of the Blacks' house, close to the trees, to make it easier for us to sneak the bikes out. When I got out, a splash of color caught my eye\u2014two shiny motorcycles, one red, one black, were hidden under a spruce, invisible from the house. Jacob was prepared. There was a piece of blue ribbon tied in a small bow around each of the handlebars. I was laughing at that when Jacob ran out of the house. \"Ready?\" he asked in a low voice, his eyes sparkling. I glanced over his shoulder, and there was no sign of Billy. \"Yeah,\" I said, but I didn't feel quite as excited as before; I was trying to imagine myself actually on the motorcycle. Jacob loaded the bikes into the bed of the truck with ease, laying them carefully on their sides so they didn't show. \"Let's go,\" he said, his voice higher than usual with excitement. \"I know the perfect spot\u2014no one will catch us there.\" We drove south out of town. The dirt road wove in and out of the forest\u2014sometimes there was nothing but trees, and then there would suddenly be a breathtaking glimpse of the Pacific Ocean, reaching to the horizon, dark gray under the clouds. We were above the shore, on top of the cliffs that bordered the beach here and the view seemed to stretch on forever. I was driving slowly, so that I could safely stare out across the ocean now and then, as the road wound closer to the sea cliffs. Jacob was talking about finishing the bikes, but his descriptions were getting technical, so I wasn't paying close attention. That was when I noticed four figures standing on a rocky ledge, much too close to the precipice. I couldn't tell from the distance how old they were, but I assumed they were men. Despite the chill in the air today, they seemed to be wearing only shorts. As I watched, the tallest person stepped closer to the brink. I slowed automatically, my foot hesitating over the brake pedal. And then he threw himself off the edge. \"No!\" I shouted, stomping down on the brake. \"What's wrong?\" Jacob shouted back, alarmed.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \"That guy\u2014he just jumped off the cliff! Why didn't they stop him? We've got to call an ambulance!\" I threw open my door and started to get out, which made no sense at all. The fastest way to a phone was to drive back to Billy's. But I couldn't believe what I'd just seen. Maybe, subconsciously, I hoped I would see something different without the glass of the windshield in the way. Jacob laughed, and I spun to stare at him wildly. How could he be so calloused, so cold-blooded? \"They're just cliff diving, Bella. Recreation. La Push doesn't have a mall, you know.\" He was teasing, but there was a strange note of irritation in his voice. \"Cliff diving?\" I repeated, dazed. I stared in disbelief as a second figure stepped to the edge, paused, and then very <em>gracefully</em> leaped into space. He fell for what seemed like an eternity to me, finally cutting smoothly into the dark gray waves below. \"Wow. It's so high.\" I slid back into my seat, still staring wide-eyed at the two remaining divers. \"It must be a hundred feet.\" \"Well, yeah, most of us jump from lower down, that rock that juts out from the cliff about halfway.\" He pointed out his window. The place he indicated did seem much more reasonable. \"Those guys are insane. Probably showing off how tough they are. I mean, really, it's freezing today. That water can't feel good.\" He made a disgruntled face, as if the stunt personally offended him. It surprised me a little. I would have thought Jacob was nearly impossible to upset. \"You jump off the cliff?\" I hadn't missed the \"us.\" \"Sure, sure.\" He shrugged and grinned. \"It's fun. A little scary, kind of a rush.\" I looked back at the cliffs, where the third figure was pacing the edge. I'd never witnessed anything so reckless in all my life. My eyes widened, and I smiled. \"Jake, you have to take me cliff diving.\" He frowned back at me, his face disapproving. \"Bella, you just wanted to call an ambulance for Sam,\" he reminded me. I was surprised that he could tell who it was from this distance. \"I want to try,\" I insisted, start ing to get out of the car again. Jacob grabbed my wrist. \"Not today, all right? Can we at least wait for a warmer day?\" \"Okay, fine,\" I agreed. With the door open, the glacial breeze was raising goose bumps on my arm. \"But I want to go soon.\" \"Soon.\" He rolled his eyes. \"Sometimes you're a little strange, Bella. Do you know that?\" I sighed. \"Yes.\" \"And we're not jumping off the top.\" I watched, fascinated, as the third boy made a running start and flung himself farther into the empty air than the other two. He twisted and cart wheeled through space as he fell, like he was skydiving. He looked absolutely free\u2014 unthinking and utterly irresponsible. \"Fine,\" I agreed. \"Not the first time, anyway.\" Now Jacob sighed. \"Are we going to try out the bikes or not?\" he demanded. \"Okay, okay,\" I said, tearing my eyes away from the last person waiting on the cliff. I put my seat belt back on and closed the door. The engine was still running, roaring as it idled. We started down the road again. \"So who were those guys\u2014the crazy ones?\" I wondered. He made a disgusted sound in the back of his throat. \"The La Push gang.\" \"You have a gang?\" I asked. I realized that I sounded impressed. He laughed once at my reaction. \"Not like that. I swear, they're like hall monitors gone bad. They don't start fights, they keep the peace.\" He snorted. \"There was this guy from up somewhere by the Makah rez, big guy too, scary-looking. Well, word got around that he was selling meth to kids, and Sam Uley and his disciples ran him off our land. They're all about our land, and tribe pride\u2026 it's getting ridiculous. The worst part is that the council takes them seriously. Embry said that the council actually meets with Sam.\" He shook his head, face full of resentment. \"Embry also heard from Leah Clearwater that they call themselves 'protectors' or something like that.\" Jacob's hands were clenched into fists, as if he'd like to hit something. I'd never seen this side of him.  I was surprised to hear Sam Uley's name. I didn't want it to bring back the images from my nightmare, so I made a quick observation to distract myself. \"You don't like them very much.\" \"Does it show?\" he asked sarcastically. \"Well\u2026 It doesn't sound like they're doing anything bad.\" I tried to soothe him, to make him cheerful again. \"Just sort of annoyingly goody-two-shoes for a gang.\" \u201cYeah. Annoying is a good word. They're always showing off\u2014like the cliff thing. They act like\u2026 like, I don't know. Like tough guys. I was hanging out at the store with Embry and Quil once, last semester, and Sam came by with his followers, Jared and Paul. Quil said something, you know how he's got a big mouth, and it pissed Paul off. His eyes got all dark, and he sort of smiled\u2014no, he showed his teeth but he didn't smile\u2014and it was like he was so mad he was shaking or something. But Sam put his hand against Paul's chest and shook his head. Paul looked at him for a minute and calmed down. Honestly, it was like Sam was holding him back\u2014like Paul was going to tear us up if Sam didn't stop him.\" He groaned. \"Like a bad western. You know, Sam's a pretty big guy, he's twenty. But Paul's just sixteen, too, shorter than me and not as beefy as Quil. I think any one of us could take him.\" \"Tough guys,\" I agreed. I could see it in my head as he described it, and it reminded me of something\u2026 a trio of tall, dark men standing very still and close together in my father's living room. The picture was sideways, because my head was lying against the couch while Dr. Gerandy and Charlie leaned over me\u2026 Had that been Sam's gang? I spoke quickly again to divert myself from the bleak memories. \"Isn't Sam a little too old for this kind of thing?\" \"Yeah. He was supposed to go to college, but he stayed. And no one gave him any crap about it, either.\u00a0 The whole council pitched a fit when my sister turned down a partial scholarship and got married. But, oh no, Sam Uley can do no wrong.\" His face was set in unfamiliar lines of outrage\u2014outrage and something else I didn't recognize at first. \"It all sounds really annoying and\u2026 strange. But I don't get why you're taking it so personally.\" I peeked over at his face, hoping I hadn't offended him. He was suddenly calm, staring out the side window. \"You just missed the turn,\" he said in an even voice. I executed a very wide U-turn, nearly hitting a tree as my circle ran the truck halfway off the road. \"Thanks for the heads-up,\" I muttered as I started up the side road. \"Sorry, I wasn't paying attention.\" It was quiet for a brief minute. \"You can stop anywhere along here,\" he said softly. I pulled over and cut the engine. My ears rang in the silence that followed. We both got out, and Jacob headed around to the back to get the bikes. I tried to read his expression. Something more was bothering him. I'd hit a nerve. He smiled halfheartedly as he pushed the red bike to my side. \"Happy late birthday. Are you ready for this?\" \"I think so.\" The bike suddenly looked intimidating, frightening, as I realized I would soon be astride it. \"We'll take it slow,\" he promised. I gingerly leaned the motorcycle against the truck's fender while he went to get his. \"Jake\u2026\"I hesitated as he came back around the truck. \"Yeah?\" \"What's really bothering you? About the Sam thing, I mean? Is there something else?\" I watched his face. He grimaced, but he didn't seem angry. He looked at the dirt and kicked his shoe against the front tire of his bike again and again, like he was keeping time. He sighed. \"It's just\u2026 the way they treat me. It creeps me out.\" The words started to rush out now. \"You know, the council is supposed to be made up of equals, but if there was a leader, it would be my dad. I've never been able to figure out why people treat him the way they do. Why his opinion counts the most. It's got something to do with his father and his father's father. My great-grandpa, Ephraim Black, was sort of the last chief we had, and they still listen to Billy, maybe because of that.\u201d  \"But I'm just like everyone else. Nobody treats me special\u2026 until now.\" That caught me off guard. \"Sam treats you special?\" \"Yeah,\" he agreed, looking up at me with troubled eyes. \"He looks at me like he's waiting for something\u2026 like I'm going to join his stupid gang someday. He pays more attention to me than any of the other guys. I hate it.\" \"You don't have to join anything.\" My voice was angry. This was really upsetting Jacob, and that infuriated me. Who did these \"protectors\" think they were? \"Yeah.\" His foot kept up its rhythm against the tire. \"What?\" I could tell there was more.  He frowned, his eyebrows pulling up in a way that looked sad and worried rather than angry. \"It's Embry. He's been avoiding me lately.\" The thoughts didn't seem connected, but I wondered if I was to blame for the problems with his friend. \"You've been hanging out with me a lot,\" I reminded him, feeling selfish. I'd been monopolizing him. \"No, that's not it. It's not just me\u2014it's Quil, too, and everyone. Embry missed a week of school, but he was never home when we tried to see him. And when he came back, he looked\u2026 he looked freaked out. Terrified. Quil and I both tried to get him to tell us what was wrong, but he wouldn't talk to either one of us.\" I stared at Jacob, biting my lip anxiously\u2014he was really frightened. But he didn't look at me. He watched his own foot kicking the rubber as if it belonged to someone else. The tempo increased. \"Then this week, out of nowhere, Embry's hanging out with Sam and the rest of them. He was out on the cliffs today.\" His voice was low and tense. He finally looked at me. \"Bella, they bugged him even more than they bother me. He didn't want anything to do with them. And now Embry's following Sam around like he's joined a cult. \"And that's the way it was with Paul. Just exactly the same. He wasn't friends with Sam at all. Then he stopped coming to school for a few weeks, and, when he came back, suddenly Sam owned him. I don't know what it means. I can't figure it out, and I feel like I have to, because Embry's my friend and\u2026 Sam's looking at me funny.. and\u2026\" He trailed off. \"Have you talked to Billy about this?\" I asked. His horror was spreading to me. I had chills running on the back of my neck. Now there was anger on his face. \"Yes,\" he snorted. \"That was helpful.\" \"What did he say?\" Jacob's expression was sarcastic, and when he spoke, his voice mocked the deep tones of his father's voice. \"It's nothing you need to worry about now, Jacob. In a few years, if you don't\u2026 well, I'll explain later.\" And then his voice was his own. \"What am I supposed to get from that? Is he trying to say it's some stupid puberty, coming-of-age thing? This is something else. Something wrong.\" He was biting his lower lip and clenching his hands. He looked like he was about to cry. I threw my arms around him instinctively, wrapping them around his waist and pressing my face against his chest. He was so big, I felt like I was a child hugging a grown-up. \"Oh, Jake, it'll be okay!\" I promised. \"If it gets worse you can come live with me and Charlie. Don't be scared, we'll think of something!\" He was frozen for a second, and then his long arms wrapped hesitantly around me. \"Thanks, Bella.\" His voice was huskier than usual. We stood like that for a moment, and it didn't upset me; in fact, I felt comforted by the contact. This didn't feel anything like the last time someone had embraced me this way. This was friendship. And Jacob was very warm. It was strange for me, being this close\u2014emotionally rather than physically, though the physical was strange for me, too\u2014to another human being. It wasn't my usual style. I didn't normally relate to people so easily, on such a basic level. Not human beings. \"If this is how you're going to react, I'll freak out more often.\" Jacob's voice was light, normal again, and his laughter rumbled against my ear. His fingers touched my hair, soft and tentative. Well, it was friendship for me. I pulled away quickly, laughing with him, but determined to put things back in perspective at once. \"It's hard to believe I'm two years older than you,\" I said, emphasizing the word older. \"You make me feel like a dwarf.\" Standing this close to him, I really had to crane my neck to see his face. \"You're forgetting I'm in my forties, of course.\" \"Oh, that's right.\" He patted my head. \"You're like a little doll,\" he teased. \"A porcelain doll.\" I rolled my eyes, taking another step away. \"Let's not start with the albino cracks.\" \"Seriously, Bella, are you sure you're not?\" He stretched his russet arm out next to mine. The difference wasn't flattering. \"I've never seen anyone paler than you\u2026 well, except for\u2014\" He broke off, and I looked away, trying to not understand what he had been about to say. \"So are we going to ride or what?\" \"Let's do it,\" I agreed, more enthusiastic than I would have been half a minute ago. His unfinished sentence reminded me of why I was here.",

            "en": "6            6. SWITZERLAND AS I DROVE HOME , I WASN\u2019T PAYING MUCH ATTENTION TO the road that shimmered wetly in the sun. I was thinking about the flood of information Jacob had shared with me, trying to sort it out, to force it all to make sense. Despite the overload, I felt lighter. Seeing Jacob smile, having all the secrets thrashed out . . . it didn\u2019t make things perfect, but it made them better. I was right to have gone. Jacob needed me. And obviously, I thought as I squinted into the glare, there was no danger. It came out of nowhere. One minute there was nothing but bright highway in my rearview mirror. The next minute, the sun was glinting off a silver Volvo right on my tail. \u201cAw, crap,\u201d I whimpered. I considered pulling over. But I was too much of a coward to face him right away. I\u2019d been counting on some prep time . . . and having Charlie nearby as a buffer. At least that would force him to keep his voice down. The Volvo followed inches behind me. I kept my eyes on the road ahead. Chicken through and through, I drove straight to Angela\u2019s without once meeting the gaze I could feel burning a hole in my mirror. He followed me until I pulled to the curb in front of the Webers\u2019 house. He didn\u2019t stop, and I didn\u2019t look up as he passed. I didn\u2019t want to see the expression on his face. I ran up the short concrete walk to Angela\u2019s door as soon as he was out of sight. Ben answered the door before I could finish knocking, like he\u2019d been standing right behind it. \u201cHey, Bella!\u201d he said, surprised. \u201cHi, Ben. Er, is Angela here?\u201d I wondered if Angela had forgotten our plans, and cringed at the thought of going home early. \u201cSure,\u201d Ben said just as Angela called, \u201cBella!\u201d and appeared at the top of the stairs. Ben peered around me as we both heard the sound of a car on the road; the sound didn\u2019t scare me \u2014 this engine stuttered to a stop, followed by the loud pop of a backfire. Nothing like the purr of the Volvo. This must be the visitor Ben had been waiting for. \u201cAustin\u2019s here,\u201d Ben said as Angela reached his side. A horn honked on the street. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll see you later,\u201d Ben promised. \u201cMiss you already.\u201d He threw his arm around Angela\u2019s neck and pulled her face down to his height so that he could kiss her enthusiastically. After a second of this, Austin honked again. \u201c\u2019Bye, Ang! Love you!\u201d Ben shouted as he dashed past me. Angela swayed, her face slightly pink, then recovered herself and waved until Ben and Austin were out of sight. Then she turned to me and grinned ruefully. \u201cThank you for doing this, Bella,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom the bottom of my heart. Not only are you saving my hands from permanent injury, you also just spared me two long hours of a plot-less, badly dubbed martial arts film.\u201d She sighed in relief. \u201cHappy to be of service.\u201d I was feeling a bit less panicked, able to breathe a little more evenly. It felt so ordinary here. Angela\u2019s easy human dramas were oddly reassuring. It was nice to know that life was normal somewhere . I followed Angela up the stairs to her room. She kicked toys out of the way as she went. The house was unusually quiet. \u201cWhere\u2019s your family?\u201d \u201cMy parents took the twins to a birthday party in Port Angeles. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re really going to help me with this. Ben\u2019s pretending he has tendonitis.\u201d She made a face. \u201cI don\u2019t mind at all,\u201d I said, and then I walked into Angela\u2019s room and saw the stacks of waiting envelopes. \u00a0\u201cOh!\u201d I gasped. Angela turned to look at me, apologies in her eyes. I could see why she\u2019d been putting this off, and why Ben had weaseled out. \u201cI thought you were exaggerating,\u201d I admitted. \u201cI wish. Are you sure you want to do this?\u201d \u201cPut me to work. I\u2019ve got all day.\u201d Angela divided a pile in half and put her mother\u2019s address book between us on her desk. For a while we concentrated, and there was just the sound of our pens scratching quietly across the paper. \u201cWhat\u2019s Edward doing tonight?\u201d she asked after a few minutes. My pen dug into the envelope I was working on. \u201cEmmet\u2019s home for the weekend. They\u2019re supposed to be hiking.\u201d \u201cYou say that like you\u2019re not sure.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky Edward has his brothers for all the hiking and camping. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do if Ben didn\u2019t have Austin for the guy stuff.\u201d \u201cYeah, the outdoors thing is not really for me. And there\u2019s no way I\u2019d ever be able to keep up.\u201d Angela laughed. \u201cI prefer the indoors myself.\u201d She focused on her pile for a minute. I wrote out four more addresses. There was never any pressure to fill a pause with meaningless chatter around Angela. Like Charlie, she was comfortable with silence. But, like Charlie, she was also too observant sometimes. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d she asked in a low voice now. \u201cYou seem . . . anxious.\u201d I smiled sheepishly. \u201cIs it that obvious?\u201d \u201cNot really.\u201d She was probably lying to make me feel better. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to talk about it unless you want to,\u201d she assured me. \u201cI\u2019ll listen if you think it will help.\u201d I was about to say thanks, but no thanks . After all, there were just too many secrets I was bound to keep. I really couldn\u2019t discuss my problems with someone human. That was against the rules. And yet, with a strange, sudden intensity, that\u2019s exactly what I wanted. I wanted to talk to a normal human girlfriend. I wanted to moan a little bit, like any other teenage girl. I wanted my problems to be that simple. It would also be nice to have someone outside the whole vampire-werewolf mess to put things in perspective. Someone unbiased. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll mind my own business,\u201d Angela promised, smiling down at the address she was working on. \u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I am anxious. It\u2019s . . . it\u2019s Edward.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d It was so easy to talk to Angela. When she asked a question like that, I could tell that she wasn\u2019t just morbidly curious or looking for gossip, like Jessica would have been. She cared that I was upset. \u201cOh, he\u2019s mad at me.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s hard to imagine,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s he mad about?\u201d I sighed. \u201cDo you remember Jacob Black?\u201d \u201cAh,\u201d she said. \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s jealous.\u201d \u201cNo, not jealous . . .\u201d I should have kept my mouth shut. There was no way to explain this right. But I wanted to keep talking anyway. I hadn\u2019t realized I was so starved for human conversation. \u201cEdward thinks Jacob is . . . a bad influence, I guess. Sort of . . . dangerous. You know how much trouble I got in a few months back. . . . It\u2019s all ridiculous, though.\u201d I was surprised to see Angela shaking her head. \u201cWhat?\u201d I asked. \u201cBella, I\u2019ve seen how Jacob Black looks at you. I\u2019d bet the real problem is jealousy.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not like that with Jacob.\u201d \u201cFor you, maybe. But for Jacob . . .\u201d I frowned. \u201cJacob knows how I feel. I\u2019ve told him everything.\u201d \u201cEdward\u2019s only human, Bella. He\u2019s going to react like any other boy.\u201d I grimaced. I didn\u2019t have a response to that. She patted my hand. \u201cHe\u2019ll get over it.\u201d \u201cI hope so. Jake\u2019s going through kind of a tough time. He needs me.\u201d \u201cYou and Jacob are pretty close, aren\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cLike family,\u201d I agreed. \u201cAnd Edward doesn\u2019t like him. . . . That must be hard. I wonder how Ben would handle that?\u201d she mused. I half-smiled. \u201cProbably just like any other boy.\u201d She grinned. \u201cProbably.\u201d Then she changed the subject. Angela wasn\u2019t one to pry, and she seemed to sense I wouldn\u2019t \u2014 couldn\u2019t \u2014 say any more. \u201cI got my dorm assignment yesterday. The farthest building from campus, naturally.\u201d \u00a0\u201cDoes Ben know where he\u2019s staying yet?\u201d \u201cThe closest dorm to campus. He\u2019s got all the luck. How about you? Did you decide where you\u2019re going?\u201d I stared down, concentrating on the clumsy scrawl of my handwriting. For a second I was distracted by the thought of Angela and Ben at the University of Washington. They would be off to Seattle in just a few months. Would it be safe then? Would the wild young vampire menace have moved elsewhere? Would there be a new place by then, some other city flinching from horror-movie headlines? Would those new headlines be my fault? I tried to shake it off and answered her question a beat late. \u201cAlaska, I think. The university there in Juneau.\u201d I could hear the surprise in her voice. \u201cAlaska? Oh. Really? I mean, that\u2019s great. I just figured you\u2019d go somewhere . . . warmer.\u201d I laughed a little, still staring at the envelope. \u201cYeah. Forks has really changed my perspective on life.\u201d \u00a0\u201cAnd Edward?\u201d Though his name set butterflies fluttering in my stomach, I looked up and grinned at her. \u201cAlaska\u2019s not too cold for Edward, either.\u201d She grinned back. \u201cOf course not.\u201d And then she sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s so far. You won\u2019t be able to come home very often. I\u2019ll miss you. Will you e-mail me?\u201d A swell of quiet sadness crashed over me; maybe it was a mistake to get closer to Angela now. But wouldn\u2019t it be sadder still to miss out on these last chances? I shook off the unhappy thoughts, so that I could answer her teasingly. \u201cIf I can type again after this.\u201d I nodded toward the stack of envelopes I\u2019d done. We laughed, and it was easy then to chat cheerfully about classes and majors while we finished the rest \u2014 all I had to do was not think about it. Anyway, there were more urgent things to worry about today. I helped her put the stamps on, too. I was afraid to leave. \u201cHow\u2019s your hand?\u201d she asked. I flexed my fingers. \u201cI think I\u2019ll recover the full use of it . . . someday.\u201d The door banged downstairs, and we both looked up. \u201cAng?\u201d Ben called. I tried to smile, but my lips trembled. \u201cI guess that\u2019s my cue to leave.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go. Though he\u2019s probably going to describe the movie for me . . . in detail.\u201d \u201cCharlie will be wondering where I am anyway.\u201d \u201cThanks for helping me.\u201d \u201cI had a good time, actually. We should do something like this again. It was nice to have some girl time.\u201d \u201cDefinitely.\u201d There was a light knock on the bedroom door. \u201cCome in, Ben,\u201d Angela said. I got up and stretched. \u201cHey, Bella! You survived,\u201d Ben greeted me quickly before going to take my place by Angela. He eyed\u00a0 our work. \u201cNice job. Too bad there\u2019s nothing left to do, I would have . . .\u201d He let the thought trail off, and then restarted excitedly. \u201cAng, I can\u2019t believe you missed this one! It was awesome. There was this final fight sequence \u2014 the choreography was unbelievable! This one guy \u2014 well, you\u2019re going to have to see it to know what I\u2019m talking about \u2014\u201d Angela rolled her eyes at me. \u201cSee you at school,\u201d I said with a nervous laugh. She sighed. \u201cSee you.\u201d I was jumpy on the way out to my truck, but the street was empty. I spent the whole drive glancing anxiously in all my mirrors, but there was never any sign of the silver car. His car was not in front of the house, either, though that meant little. \u201cBella?\u201d Charlie called when I opened the front door. \u201cHey, Dad.\u201d I found him in the living room, in front of the TV. \u00a0\u201cSo, how was your day?\u201d \u201cGood,\u201d I said. Might as well tell him everything \u2014 he\u2019d hear it from Billy soon enough. Besides, it would make him happy. \u201cThey didn\u2019t need me at work, so I went down to La Push.\u201d There wasn\u2019t enough surprise in his face. Billy had already talked to him. \u201cHow\u2019s Jacob?\u201d Charlie asked, attempting to sound indifferent. \u201cGood,\u201d I said, just as casual. \u201cYou get over to the Webers\u2019?\u201d \u201cYep. We got all her announcements addressed.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s nice.\u201d Charlie smiled a wide smile. He was strangely focused, considering that there was a game on. \u201cI\u2019m glad you spent some time with your friends today.\u201d \u201cMe, too.\u201d I ambled toward the kitchen, looking for busy work. Unfortunately, Charlie had already cleaned up his lunch. I stood there for a few minutes, staring at the bright patch of light the sun made on the floor. But I knew I couldn\u2019t delay this forever. .  \u201cI\u2019m going to go study,\u201d I announced glumly as I headed up the stairs. \u201cSee you later,\u201d Charlie called after me. If I survive, I thought to myself. I shut my bedroom door carefully before I turned to face my room. Of course he was there. He stood against the wall across from me, in the shadow beside the open window. His face was hard and his posture tense. He glared at me wordlessly.  I cringed, waiting for the torrent, but it didn\u2019t come. He just continued to glare, possibly too angry to speak. \u201cHi,\u201d I finally said. His face could have been carved from stone. I counted to a hundred in my head, but there was no change. \u201cEr . . . so, I\u2019m still alive,\u201d I began. A growl rumbled low in his chest, but his expression didn\u2019t change. \u00a0\u201cNo harm done,\u201d I insisted with a shrug. He moved. His eyes closed, and he pinched the bridge of his nose between the fingers of his right hand. \u201cBella,\u201d he whispered. \u201cDo you have any idea how close I came to crossing the line today? To breaking the treaty and coming after you? Do you know what that would have meant?\u201d I gasped and his eyes opened. They were as cold and hard as night. \u00a0\u201cYou can\u2019t!\u201d I said too loudly. I worked to modulate the volume of my voice so Charlie wouldn\u2019t hear, but I wanted to shout the words. \u201cEdward, they\u2019d use any excuse for a fight. They\u2019d love that. You can\u2019t ever break the rules!\u201d \u201cMaybe they aren\u2019t the only ones who would enjoy a fight.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you start,\u201d I snapped. \u201cYou made the treaty \u2014 you stick to it.\u201d \u201cIf he\u2019d hurt you \u2014\u201d \u201cEnough!\u201d I cut him off. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to worry about. Jacob isn\u2019t dangerous.\u201d \u00a0\u201cBella.\u201d He rolled his eyes. \u201cYou aren\u2019t exactly the best judge of what is or isn\u2019t dangerous.\u201d \u201cI know I don\u2019t have to worry about Jake. And neither do you.\u201d He ground his teeth together. His hands were balled up in fists at his sides. He was still standing against the wall, and I hated the space between us. I took a deep breath, and crossed the room. He didn\u2019t move when I wrapped my arms around him. Next to the warmth of the last of the afternoon sun streaming through the window, his skin felt especially icy. He seemed like ice, too, frozen the way he was. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry I made you anxious,\u201d I muttered. He sighed, and relaxed a little. His arms wound around my waist. \u201cAnxious is a bit of an understatement,\u201d he murmured. \u201cIt was a very long day.\u201d \u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to know about it,\u201d I reminded him. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be hunting longer.\u201d I looked up at his face, at his defensive eyes; I hadn\u2019t noticed in the stress of the moment, but they were too dark. The rings under them were deep purple. I frowned in disapproval. \u00a0\u201cWhen Alice saw you disappear, I came back,\u201d he explained. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have done that. Now you\u2019ll have to go away again.\u201d My frown intensified. \u201cI can wait.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. I mean, I know she couldn\u2019t see me with Jacob, but you should have known \u2014\u201d \u201cBut I didn\u2019t,\u201d he broke in. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t expect me to let you \u2014\u201d \u201cOh, yes, I can,\u201d I interrupted him. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I expect \u2014\u201d \u201cThis won\u2019t happen again.\u201d \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s right! Because you\u2019re not going to overreact next time.\u201d \u201cBecause there isn\u2019t going to be a next time.\u201d \u201cI understand when you have to leave, even if I don\u2019t like it \u2014\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not the same. I\u2019m not risking my life.\u201d \u201cNeither am I.\u201d \u201cWerewolves constitute a risk.\u201d \u00a0\u201cI disagree.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not negotiating this, Bella.\u201d \u201cNeither am I.\u201d His hands were in fists again. I could feel them against my back. The words popped out thoughtlessly. \u201cIs this really just about my safety?\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he demanded. \u00a0\u201cYou aren\u2019t . . .\u201d Angela\u2019s theory seemed sillier now than before. It was hard to finish the thought. \u201cI mean, you know better than to be jealous, right?\u201d He raised one eyebrow. \u201cDo I?\u201d \u201cBe serious.\u201d \u201cEasily \u2014 there\u2019s nothing remotely humorous about this.\u201d I frowned suspiciously. \u201cOr . . . is this something else altogether? Some vampires-and-werewolves-are-always-enemies nonsense? Is this just a testosterone-fueled \u2014\u201d His eyes blazed. \u201cThis is only about you. All I care is that you\u2019re safe.\u201d The black fire in his eyes was impossible to doubt. \u201cOkay,\u201d I sighed. \u201cI believe that. But I want you to know something \u2014 when it comes to all this enemies nonsense, I\u2019m out. I am a neutral country. I am Switzerland. I refuse to be affected by territorial disputes between mythical creatures. Jacob is family. You are . . . well, not exactly the love of my life, because I expect to love you for much longer than that. The love of my existence. I don\u2019t care who\u2019s a werewolf and who\u2019s a vampire. \u00a0If Angela turns out to be a witch, she can join the party, too.\u201d He stared at me silently through narrowed eyes. \u201cSwitzerland,\u201d I repeated again for emphasis. He frowned at me, and then sighed. \u201cBella . . . ,\u201d he began, but he paused, and his nose wrinkled in disgust. \u201cWhat now?\u201d \u201cWell . . . don\u2019t be offended, but you smell like a dog,\u201d he told me. And then he smiled crookedly, so I knew the fight was over. For now. Edward had to make up for the missed hunting trip, and so he was leaving Friday night with Jasper, Emmett, and Carlisle to hit some reserve in Northern California with a mountain lion problem. We\u2019d come to no agreement on the werewolf issue, but I didn\u2019t feel guilty calling Jake \u2014 during my brief window of opportunity when Edward took the Volvo home before climbing back in through my window \u2014 to let him know I\u2019d be coming over on Saturday again. It wasn\u2019t sneaking around. Edward knew how I felt. And if he broke my truck again, then I\u2019d have Jacob pick me up. Forks was neutral, just like Switzerland \u2014 just like me. So when I got off work Thursday and it was Alice rather than Edward waiting for me in the Volvo, I was not suspicious at first. The passenger door was open, and music I didn\u2019t recognize was shaking the frame when the bass played. \u201cHey, Alice,\u201d I shouted over the wailing as I climbed in. \u201cWhere\u2019s your brother?\u201d She was singing along to the song, her voice an octave higher than the melody, weaving through it with a complicated harmony. She nodded at me, ignoring my question as she concentrated on the music. I shut my door and put my hands over my ears. She grinned, and turned the volume down until it was just background. Then she hit the locks and the gas in the same second. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I asked, starting to feel uneasy. \u201cWhere is Edward?\u201d She shrugged. \u201cThey left early.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d I tried to control the absurd disappointment. If he left early, that meant he\u2019d be back sooner, I reminded myself. \u00a0\u201cAll the boys went, and we\u2019re having a slumber party!\u201d she announced in a trilling, singsong voice. \u201cA slumber party?\u201d I repeated, the suspicion finally settling in. \u201cAren\u2019t you excited?\u201d she crowed. I met her animated gaze for a long second. \u201cYou\u2019re kidnapping me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d She laughed and nodded. \u201cTill Saturday. Esme cleared it with Charlie; you\u2019re staying with me two nights, and I will drive you to and from school tomorrow.\u201d I turned my face to the window, my teeth grinding together. \u201cSorry,\u201d Alice said, not sounding in the least bit penitent. \u201cHe paid me off.\u201d \u201cHow?\u201d I hissed through my teeth. \u201cThe Porsche. It\u2019s exactly like the one I stole in Italy.\u201d She sighed happily. \u201cI\u2019m not supposed to drive it around Forks, but if you want, we could see how long it takes to get from here to L.A. \u2014 I bet I could have you back by midnight.\u201d I took a deep breath. \u201cI think I\u2019ll pass,\u201d I sighed, repressing a shudder. We wound, always too fast, down the long drive. Alice pulled around to the garage, and I quickly looked over the cars. Emmett\u2019s big jeep was there, with a shiny canary yellow Porsche between it and Rosalie\u2019s red convertible. Alice hopped out <em>gracefully</em> and went to stroke her hand along the length of her bribe. \u201cPretty, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cPretty over-the-top,\u201d I grumbled, incredulous. \u201cHe gave you that just for two days of holding me hostage?\u201d Alice made a face. A second later, comprehension came and I gasped in horror. \u201cIt\u2019s for every time he\u2019s gone, isn\u2019t it?\u201d She nodded. I slammed my door and stomped toward the house. She danced along next to me, still unrepentant. \u201cAlice, don\u2019t you think this is just a little bit controlling? Just a tiny bit psychotic, maybe?\u201d \u201cNot really.\u201d She sniffed. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem to grasp how dangerous a young werewolf can be.\u00a0 Especially when I can\u2019t see them. Edward has no way to know if you\u2019re safe. You shouldn\u2019t be so reckless.\u201d My voice turned acidic. \u201cYes, because a vampire slumber party is the pinnacle of safety conscious behavior.\u201d Alice laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a pedicure and everything,\u201d she promised. It wasn\u2019t so bad, except for the fact that I was being held against my will. Esme brought Italian food \u2014 the good stuff, all the way from Port Angeles \u2014 and Alice was prepared with my favorite movies. Even Rosalie was there, quietly in the background. Alice did insist on the pedicure, and I wondered if she was working from a list \u2014 maybe something she\u2019d compiled from watching bad sitcoms. \u00a0\u201cHow late do you want to stay up?\u201d she asked when my toenails were glistening a bloody red. Her enthusiasm remained untouched by my mood. \u201cI don\u2019t want to stay up. We have school in the morning.\u201d She pouted. \u201cWhere am I supposed to sleep, anyway?\u201d I measured the couch with my eyes. It was a little short. \u201cCan\u2019t you just keep me under surveillance at my house?\u201d \u201cWhat kind of a slumber party would that be?\u201d Alice shook her head in exasperation. \u201cYou\u2019re sleeping in Edward\u2019s room.\u201d I sighed. His black leather sofa was longer than this one. Actually, the gold carpet in his room was probably thick enough that the floor wouldn\u2019t be half bad either. \u00a0\u201cCan I go back to my place to get my things, at least?\u201d She grinned. \u201cAlready taken care of.\u201d \u201cAm I allowed to use your phone?\u201d \u201cCharlie knows where you are.\u201d \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to call Charlie.\u201d I frowned. \u201cApparently, I have some plans to cancel.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d She deliberated. \u201cI\u2019m not sure about that.\u201d \u201cAlice!\u201d I whined loudly. \u201cC\u2019mon!\u201d \u00a0\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d she said, flitting from the room. She was back in half a second, cell phone in hand. \u201cHe didn\u2019t specifically prohibit this . . . ,\u201d she murmured to herself as she handed it to me. I dialed Jacob\u2019s number, hoping he wasn\u2019t out running with his friends tonight. Luck was with me \u2014 Jacob was the one to answer. \u201cHello?\u201d \u00a0\u201cHey, Jake, it\u2019s me.\u201d Alice watched me with expressionless eyes for a second, before she turned and went to sit between Rosalie and Esme on the sofa. \u201cHi, Bella,\u201d Jacob said, suddenly cautious. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d \u201cNothing good. I can\u2019t come over Saturday after all.\u201d It was silent for a minute. \u201cStupid bloodsucker,\u201d he finally muttered. \u201cI thought he was leaving. Can\u2019t you have a life when he\u2019s gone? Or does he lock you in a coffin?\u201d I laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s funny.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m only laughing because you\u2019re close,\u201d I told him. \u201cBut he\u2019s going to be here Saturday, so it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d \u201cWill he be feeding there in Forks, then?\u201d Jacob asked cuttingly. \u201cNo.\u201d I didn\u2019t let myself get irritated with him. I wasn\u2019t that far from being as angry as he was. \u201cHe left early.\u201d \u00a0\u201cOh. Well, hey, come over now, then,\u201d he said with sudden enthusiasm. \u201cIt\u2019s not that late. Or I\u2019ll come up to Charlie\u2019s.\u201d \u201cI wish. I\u2019m not at Charlie\u2019s,\u201d I said sourly. \u201cI\u2019m kind of being held prisoner.\u201d He was silent as that sunk in, and then he growled. \u201cWe\u2019ll come and get you,\u201d he promised in a flat voice, slipping automatically into a plural. A chill slid down my spine, but I answered in a light and teasing voice. \u201cTempting. I have been tortured \u2014 Alice painted my toenails.\u201d \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be. They\u2019re just trying to keep me safe.\u201d He growled again. \u201cI know it\u2019s silly, but their hearts are in the right place.\u201d \u201cTheir hearts !\u201d he scoffed. \u201cSorry about Saturday,\u201d I apologized. \u201cI\u2019ve got to hit the sack\u201d \u2014 the couch, I corrected mentally \u2014 \u201cbut I\u2019ll call you again soon.\u201d \u00a0\u201cAre you sure they\u2019ll let you?\u201d he asked in a scathing tone. \u201cNot completely.\u201d I sighed. \u201c\u2019Night, Jake.\u201d \u201cSee you around.\u201d Alice was abruptly at my side, her hand held out for the phone, but I was already dialing. She saw the number. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019ll have his phone on him,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll leave a message.\u201d The phone rang four times, followed by a beep. There was no greeting. \u201cYou are in trouble,\u201d I said slowly, emphasizing each word. \u201cEnormous trouble. Angry grizzly bears are going to look tame next to what is waiting for you at home.\u201d I snapped the phone shut and placed it in her waiting hand. \u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d She grinned. \u201cThis hostage stuff is fun.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to sleep now,\u201d I announced, heading for the stairs. Alice tagged along. \u201cAlice,\u201d I sighed. \u201cI\u2019m not going to sneak out. You would know if I was planning to, and you\u2019d catch me if I tried.\u201d \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m just going to show you where your things are,\u201d she said innocently. Edward\u2019s room was at the farthest end of the third floor hallway, hard to mistake even when the huge house had been less familiar. But when I switched the light on, I paused in confusion. Had I picked the wrong door? Alice giggled. It was the same room, I realized quickly; the furniture had just been rearranged. The couch was pushed to the north wall and the stereo shoved up against the vast shelves of CDs \u2014 to make room for the colossal bed that now dominated the central space. The southern wall of glass reflected the scene back like a mirror, making it look twice as bad. It matched. The coverlet was a dull gold, just lighter than the walls; the frame was black, made of intricately patterned wrought iron. Sculpted metal roses wound in vines up the tall posts and formed a bowery lattice overhead. My pajamas were folded neatly on the foot of the bed, my bag of toiletries to one side. \u201cWhat the hell is all this?\u201d I spluttered. \u00a0\u201cYou didn\u2019t really think he would make you sleep on the couch, did you?\u201d I mumbled unintelligibly as I stalked forward to snatch my things off the bed. \u201cI\u2019ll give you some privacy,\u201d Alice laughed. \u201cSee you in the morning.\u201d After my teeth were brushed and I was dressed, I grabbed a puffy feather pillow off the huge bed and dragged the gold cover to the couch. I knew I was being silly, but I didn\u2019t care. Porsches as bribes and king-sized beds in houses where nobody slept \u2014 it was beyond irritating. I flipped off the lights and curled up on the sofa, wondering if I was too annoyed to sleep. In the dark, the glass wall was no longer a black mirror, doubling the room.

            "en": "EPILOGUE:AN OCCASION        EPILOGUE:AN OCCASION Edward helped me into his car, being very careful of the wisps of silk and chiffon, the flowers he'd just pinned into my elaborately styled curls, and my bulky walking cast. He ignored the angry set of my mouth. When he had me settled, he got in the driver's seat and headed back out the long, narrow drive. \"At what point exactly are you going to tell me what's going on?\" I asked grumpily. I really hated surprises. And he knew that. I'm shocked that you haven't figured it out yet.\" He threw a mocking smile in my direction, and my breath caught in my throat. Would I ever get used to his perfection? \"I did mention that you looked very nice, didn't I?\" I verified. \"Yes.\" He grinned again. I'd never seen him dress in black before, and, with the contrast against his pale skin, his beauty was absolutely surreal. That much I couldn't deny, even if the fact that he was wearing a tuxedo made me very nervous. Not quite as nervous as the dress. Or the shoe. Only one shoe, as my other foot was still securely encased in plaster. But the stiletto heel, held on only by satin ribbons, certainly wasn't going to help me as I tried to hobble around. \"I'm not coming over anymore if Alice is going to treat me like Guinea Pig Barbie when I do,\" I griped. I'd spent the better part of the day in Alice's staggeringly vast bathroom, a helpless victim as she played hairdresser and cosmetician. Whenever I fidgeted or complained, she reminded me that she didn't have any memories of being human, and asked me not to ruin her vicarious fun. Then she'd dressed me in the most ridiculous dress \u2014 deep blue, frilly and off the shoulders, with French tags I couldn't read \u2014 a dress more suitable for a runway than Forks. Nothing good could come of our formal attire, of that I was sure. Unless\u2026 but I was afraid to put my suspicions into words, even in my own head.  I was distracted then by the sound of a phone ringing. Edward pulled his cell phone from a pocket inside his jacket, looking briefly at the caller ID before answering. \"Hello, Charlie,\" he said warily. \"Charlie?\" I frowned. Charlie had been\u2026 difficult since my return to Forks. He had compartmentalized my bad experience into two defined reactions. Toward Carlisle he was almost worshipfully grateful. On the other hand, he was stubbornly convinced that Edward was at fault \u2014 because, if not for him, I wouldn't have left home in the first place. And Edward was far from disagreeing with him. These days I had rules that hadn't existed before: curfews\u2026 visiting hours. Something Charlie was saying made Edward's eyes widen in disbelief, and then a grin spread across his face. \"You're kidding!\" He laughed. \"What is it?\" I demanded. He ignored me. \"Why don't you let me talk to him?\" Edward suggested with evident pleasure. He waited for a few seconds. \"Hello, Tyler, this is Edward Cullen.\" His voice was very friendly, on the surface. I knew it well enough to catch the soft edge of menace. What was Tyler doing at my house? The awful truth began to dawn on me. I looked again at the inappropriate dress Alice had forced me into. \"I'm sorry if there's been some kind of miscommunication, but Bella is unavailable tonight.\" Edward's tone changed, and the threat in his voice was suddenly much more evident as he continued. \"To be perfectly honest, she'll be unavailable every night, as far as anyone besides myself is concerned. No offense. And I'm sorry about your evening.\" He didn't sound sorry at all. And then he snapped the phone shut, a huge smirk on his face. My face and neck flushed crimson with anger. I could feel the rage-induced tears starting to fill my eyes. He looked at me in surprise. \"Was that last part a bit too much? I didn't mean to offend you.\" I ignored that.  \"You're taking me to the prom!\" I yelled. It was embarrassingly obvious now. If I'd been paying any attention at all, I'm sure I would have noticed the date on the posters that decorated the school buildings. But I'd never dreamed he was thinking of subjecting me to this. Didn't he know me at all? He wasn't expecting the force of my reaction, that was clear. He pressed his lips together and his eyes narrowed. \"Don't be difficult, Bella.\" My eyes flashed to the window; we were halfway to the school already. \"Why are you doing this to me?\" I demanded in horror. He gestured to his tuxedo. \"Honestly, Bella, what did you think we were doing?\" I was mortified. First, because I'd missed the obvious. And also because the vague suspicions \u2014 expectations, really \u2014 that I'd been forming all day, as Alice tried to transform me into a beauty queen, were so far wide of the mark. My half-fearful hopes seemed very silly now. I'd guessed there was some kind of occasion brewing. But prom! That was the furthest thing from my mind. The angry tears rolled over my cheeks. I remembered with dismay that I was very uncharacteristically wearing mascara. I wiped quickly under my eyes to prevent any smudges. My hand was unblackened when I pulled it away; maybe Alice had known I would need waterproof makeup. \"This is completely ridiculous. Why are you crying?\" he demanded in frustration. \"Because I'm mad!\" \"Bella.\" He turned the full force of his scorching golden eyes on me. \"What?\" I muttered, distracted. \"Humor me,\" he insisted. His eyes were melting all my fury. It was impossible to fight with him when he cheated like that. I gave in with poor grace. \"Fine,\" I pouted, unable to glare as effectively as I would have liked. \"I'll go quietly. But you'll see. I'm way overdue for more bad luck. I'll probably break my other leg. Look at this shoe! It's a death trap!\" I held out my good leg as evidence. \"Hmmm.\" He stared at my leg longer than was necessary. \"Remind me to thank Alice for that tonight.\" \"Alice is going to be there?\" That comforted me slightly. \"With Jasper, and Emmett\u2026 and Rosalie,\" he admitted. The feeling of comfort disappeared. There had been no progress with Rosalie, though I was on quite good terms with her sometimes-husband. Emmett enjoyed having me around \u2014 he thought my bizarre human reactions were hilarious\u2026 or maybe it was just the fact that I fell down a lot that he found so funny. Rosalie acted as if I didn't exist. While I shook my head to dispel the direction my thoughts had taken, I thought of something else. \"Is Charlie in on this?\" I asked, suddenly suspicious. \"Of course.\" He grinned, and then chuckled. \"Apparently Tyler wasn't, though.\" I gritted my teeth. How Tyler could be so delusional, I couldn't imagine. At school, where Charlie couldn't interfere, Edward and I were inseparable \u2014 except for those rare sunny days. We were at the school now; Rosalie's red convertible was conspicuous in the parking lot. The clouds were thin today, a few streaks of sunlight escaping through far away in the west. He got out and walked around the car to open my door. He held out his hand. I sat stubbornly in my seat, arms folded, feeling a secret twinge of smugness. The lot was crowded with people in formal dress: witnesses. He couldn't remove me forcibly from the car as he might have if we'd been alone. He sighed. \"When someone wants to kill you, you're brave as a lion \u2014 and then when someone mentions dancing\u2026\" He shook his head. I gulped. Dancing. \"Bella, I won't let anything hurt you \u2014 not even yourself. I won't let go of you once, I promise.\" I thought about that and suddenly felt much better. He could see that in my face. \"There, now,\" he said gently, \"it won't be so bad.\" He leaned down and wrapped one arm around my waist. I took his other hand and let him lift me from the car. He kept his arm tightly around me, supporting me as I limped toward the school. In Phoenix, they held proms in hotel ballrooms. This dance was in the gym, of course. It was probably the only room in town big enough for a dance. When we got inside, I giggled. There were actual balloon arches and twisted garlands of pastel crepe paper festooning the walls. \"This looks like a horror movie waiting to happen,\" I snickered. \"Well,\" he muttered as we slowly approached the ticket table \u2014 he was carrying most of my weight, but I still had to shuffle and wobble my feet forward \u2014 \"there are more than enough vampires present.\" I looked at the dance floor; a wide gap had formed in the center of the floor, where two couples whirled <em>gracefully</em>. The other dancers pressed to the sides of the room to give them space \u2014 no one wanted to stand in contrast with such radiance. Emmett and Jasper were intimidating and flawless in classic tuxedos. Alice was striking in a black satin dress with geometric cutouts that bared large triangles of her snowy white skin. And Rosalie was\u2026 well, Rosalie. She was beyond belief. Her vivid scarlet dress was backless, tight to her calves where it flared into a wide ruffled train, with a neckline that plunged to her waist. I pitied every girl in the room, myself included. \"Do you want me to bolt the doors so you can massacre the unsuspecting townsfolk?\" I whispered conspiratorially. \"And where do you fit into that scheme?\" He glared. \"Oh, I'm with the vampires, of course.\" He smiled reluctantly. \"Anything to get out of dancing.\" \"Anything.\" He bought our tickets, then turned me toward the dance floor. I cringed against his arm and dragged my feet. \"I've got all night,\" he warned. Eventually he towed me out to where his family was twirling elegantly \u2014 if in a style totally unsuitable to the present time and music. I watched in horror. \"Edward.\" My throat was so dry I could only manage a whisper. \"I honestly can't dance!\" I could feel the panic bubbling up inside my chest. \"Don't worry, silly,\" he whispered back. \"I can.\" He put my arms around his neck and lifted me to slide his feet under mine. And then we were whirling, too. \"I feel like I'm five years old,\" I laughed after a few minutes of effortless waltzing. \"You don't look five,\" he murmured, pulling me closer for a second, so that my feet were briefly a foot from the ground. Alice caught my eye on a turn and smiled in encouragement \u2014 I smiled back. I was surprised to realize that I was actually enjoying myself\u2026 a little. \"Okay, this isn't half bad,\" I admitted. But Edward was staring toward the doors, and his face was angry. \"What is it?\" I wondered aloud. I followed his gaze, disoriented by the spinning, but finally I could see what was bothering him. Jacob Black, not in a tux, but in a long-sleeved white shirt and tie, his hair smoothed back into his usual ponytail, was crossing the floor toward us. After the first shock of recognition, I couldn't help but feel bad for Jacob. He was clearly uncomfortable \u2014 excruciatingly so. His face was apologetic as his eyes met mine. Edward snarled very quietly. \"Behave!\" I hissed. Edward's voice was scathing. \"He wants to chat with you.\" Jacob reached us then, the embarrassment and apology even more evident on his face. \"Hey, Bella, I was hoping you would be here.\" Jacob sounded like he'd been hoping the exact opposite. But his smile was just as warm as ever.  \"Hi, Jacob.\" I smiled back. \"What's up?\" \"Can I cut in?\" he asked tentatively, glancing at Edward for the first time. I was shocked to notice that Jacob didn't have to look up. He must have grown half a foot since the first time I'd seen him. Edward's face was composed, his expression blank. His only answer was to set me carefully on my feet, and take a step back. \"Thanks,\" Jacob said amiably. Edward just nodded, looking at me intently before he turned to walk away. Jacob put his hands on my waist, and I reached up to put my hands on his shoulders. \"Wow, Jake, how tall are you now?\" He was smug. \"Six-two.\" We weren't really dancing \u2014 my leg made that impossible. Instead we swayed awkwardly from side to side without moving our feet. It was just as well; the recent growth spurt had left him looking gangly and uncoordinated, he was probably no better a dancer than I was. \"So, how did you end up here tonight?\" I asked without true curiosity. Considering Edward's reaction, I could guess. \"Can you believe my dad paid me twenty bucks to come to your prom?\" he admitted, slightly ashamed. \"Yes, I can,\" I muttered. \"Well, I hope you're enjoying yourself, at least. Seen anything you like?\" I teased, nodding toward a group of girls lined up against the wall like pastel confections. \"Yeah,\" he sighed. \"But she's taken.\" He glanced down to meet my curious gaze for just a second \u2014 then we both looked away, embarrassed. \"You look really pretty, by the way,\" he added shyly. \"Um, thanks. So why did Billy pay you to come here?\" I asked quickly, though I knew the answer. Jacob didn't seem grateful for the subject change; he looked away, uncomfortable again. \"He said it was a 'safe' place to talk to you. I swear the old man is losing his mind.\" I joined in his laughter weakly. \"Anyway, he said that if I told you something, he would get me that master cylinder I need,\" he confessed with a sheepish grin. \"Tell me, then. I want you to get your car finished.\" I grinned back. At least Jacob didn't believe any of this. It made the situation a bit easier. Against the wall, Edward was watching my face, his own face expressionless. I saw a sophomore in a pink dress eyeing him with timid speculation, but he didn't seem to be aware of her. Jacob looked away again, ashamed. \"Don't get mad, okay?\" \"There's no way I'll be mad at you, Jacob,\" I assured him. \"I won't even be mad at Billy. Just say what you have to.\" \"Well \u2014 this is so stupid, I'm sorry, Bella \u2014 he wants you to break up with your boyfriend. He asked me to tell you 'please.'\" He shook his head in disgust. \"He's still superstitious, eh?\" \"Yeah. He was\u2026 kind of over the top when you got hurt down in Phoenix. He didn't believe\u2026\"Jacob trailed off self-consciously. My eyes narrowed. \"I fell.\" \"I know that,\" Jacob said quickly. \"He thinks Edward had something to do with me getting hurt.\" It wasn't a question, and despite my promise, I was angry.  Jacob wouldn't meet my eyes. We weren't even bothering to sway to the music, though his hands were still on my waist, and mine around his neck. \"Look, Jacob, I know Billy probably won't believe this, but just so you know\" \u2014 he looked at me now, responding to the new earnestness in my voice \u2014 \"Edward really did save my life. If it weren't for Edward and his father, I'd be dead.\" \"I know,\" he claimed, but he sounded like my sincere words had affected him some. Maybe he'd be able to convince Billy of this much, at least. \"Hey, I'm sorry you had to come do this, Jacob,\" I apologized. \"At any rate, you get your parts, right?\" \"Yeah,\" he muttered. He was still looking awkward\u2026 upset. \"There's more?\" I asked in disbelief. \"Forget it,\" he mumbled, \"I'll get a job and save the money myself.\" I glared at him until he met my gaze. \"Just spit it out, Jacob.\" \"It's so bad.\" \"I don't care. Tell me,\" I insisted. \"Okay\u2026 but, geez, this sounds bad.\" He shook his head. \"He said to tell you, no, to warn you, that \u2014 and this is his plural, not mine\" \u2014 he lifted one hand from my waist and made little quotations marks in the air \u2014 '\"We'll be watching.'\" He watched warily for my reaction. It sounded like something from a mafia movie. I laughed out loud. \"Sorry you had to do this, Jake,\" I snickered. \"I don't mind that much.\" He grinned in relief. His eyes were appraising as they raked quickly over my dress. \"So, should I tell him you said to butt the hell out?\" he asked hopefully. \"No,\" I sighed. \"Tell him I said thanks. I know he means well.\" The song ended, and I dropped my arms. His hands hesitated at my waist, and he glanced at my bum leg. \"Do you want to dance again? Or can I help you get somewhere?\" Edward answered for me. \"That's all right, Jacob. I'll take it from here.\" Jacob flinched, and stared wide-eyed at Edward, who stood just beside us. \"Hey, I didn't see you there,\" he mumbled. \"I guess I'll see you around, Bella.\" He stepped back, waving halfheartedly. I smiled. \"Yeah, I'll see you later.\" \"Sorry,\" he said again before he turned for the door. Edward's arms wound around me as the next song started. It was a little up-tempo for slow dancing, but that didn't seem to concern him. I leaned my head against his chest, content. \"Feeling better?\" I teased. \"Not really,\" he said tersely. \"Don't be mad at Billy,\" I sighed. \"He just worries about me for Charlie's sake. It's nothing personal.\" \"I'm not mad at Billy,\" he corrected in a clipped voice. \"But his son is irritating me.\" I pulled back to look at him. His face was very serious. \"Why?\" \"First of all, he made me break my promise.\" I stared at him in confusion. He half-smiled. \"I promised I wouldn't let go of you tonight,\" he explained. \"Oh. Well, I forgive you.\" \"Thanks. But there's something else.\" Edward frowned. I waited patiently. \"He called you pretty,\" he finally continued, his frown deepening. \"That's practically an insult, the way you look right now. You're much more than beautiful.\" I laughed. \"You might be a little biased.\" \"I don't think that's it. Besides, I have excellent eyesight.\" We were twirling again, my feet on his as he held me close. \"So are you going to explain the reason for all of this?\" I wondered. He looked down at me, confused, and I glared meaningfully at the crepe paper. He considered for a moment, and then changed direction, spinning me through the crowd to the back door of the gym. I caught a glimpse of Jessica and Mike dancing, staring at me curiously. Jessica waved, and I smiled back quickly. Angela was there, too, looking blissfully happy in the arms of little Ben Cheney; she didn't look up from his eyes, a head lower than hers. Lee and Samantha, Lauren, glaring toward us, with Conner; I could name every face that spiraled past me. And then we were outdoors, in the cool, dim light of a fading sunset. As soon as we were alone, he swung me up into his arms, and carried me across the dark grounds till he reached the bench beneath the shadow of the madrone trees. He sat there, keeping me cradled against his chest. The moon was already up, visible through the gauzy clouds, and his face glowed pale in the white light. His mouth was hard, his eyes troubled. \"The point?\" I prompted softly. He ignored me, staring up at the moon. \"Twilight, again,\" he murmured. \"Another ending. No matter how perfect the day is, it always has to end.\" \"Some things don't have to end,\" I muttered through my teeth, instantly tense. He sighed. \"I brought you to the prom,\" he said slowly, finally answering my question, \"because I don't want you to miss anything. I don't want my presence to take anything away from you, if I can help it. I want you to be human. I want your life to continue as it would have if I'd died in nineteen-eighteen like I should have.\" I shuddered at his words, and then shook my head angrily. \"In what strange parallel dimension would I ever have gone to prom of my own free will? If you weren't a thousand times stronger than me, I would never have let you get away with this.\" He smiled briefly, but it didn't touch his eyes. \"It wasn't so bad, you said so yourself.\" \"That's because I was with you.\" We were quiet for a minute; he stared at the moon and I stared at him. I wished there was some way to explain how very uninterested I was in a normal human life. \"Will you tell me something?\" he asked, glancing down at me with a slight smile. \"Don't I always?\" \"Just promise you'll tell me,\" he insisted, grinning. I knew I was going to regret this almost instantly. \"Fine.\" \"You seemed honestly surprised when you figured out that I was taking you here,\" he began. \"I was,\" I interjected. \"Exactly,\" he agreed. \"But you must have had some other theory\u2026 I'm curious \u2014 what did you think I was dressing you up for?\" Yes, instant regret. I pursed my lips, hesitating. \"I don't want to tell you.\" \"You promised,\" he objected. \"I know.\" \"What's the problem?\" I knew he thought it was mere embarrassment holding me back. \"I think it will make you mad \u2014 or sad.\"  His brows pulled together over his eyes as he thought that through. \"I still want to know. Please?\" I sighed. He waited. \"Well\u2026 I assumed it was some kind of\u2026 occasion. But I didn't think it would be some trite human thing\u2026 prom!\" I scoffed. \"Human?\" he asked flatly. He'd picked up on the key word. I looked down at my dress, fidgeting with a stray piece of chiffon. He waited in silence. \"Okay,\" I confessed in a rush. \"So I was hoping that you might have changed your mind\u2026 that you were going to change me, after all.\" A dozen emotions played across his face. Some I recognized: anger\u2026 pain\u2026 and then he seemed to collect himself and his expression became amused. \"You thought that would be a black tie occasion, did you?\" he teased, touching the lapel of his tuxedo jacket. I scowled to hide my embarrassment. \"I don't know how these things work. To me, at least, it seems more rational than prom does.\" He was still grinning. \"It's not funny,\" I said. \"No, you're right, it's not,\" he agreed, his smile fading. \"I'd rather treat it like a joke, though, than believe you're serious.\" \"But I am serious.\" He sighed deeply. \"I know. And you're really that willing?\" The pain was back in his eyes. I bit my lip and nodded. \"So ready for this to be the end,\" he murmured, almost to himself, \"for this to be the twilight of your life, though your life has barely started. You're ready to give up everything.\" \"It's not the end, it's the beginning,\" I disagreed under my breath. \"I'm not worth it,\" he said sadly. \"Do you remember when you told me that I didn't see myself very clearly?\" I asked, raising my eyebrows. \"You obviously have the same blindness.\" \"I know what I am.\" I sighed. But his mercurial mood shifted on me. He pursed his lips, and his eyes were probing. He examined my face for a long moment.  \"You're ready now, then?\" he asked. \"Um.\" I gulped. \"Yes?\" He smiled, and inclined his head slowly until his cold lips brushed against the skin just under the corner of my jaw. \"Right now?\" he whispered, his breath blowing cool on my neck. I shivered involuntarily. \"Yes,\" I whispered, so my voice wouldn't have a chance to break. If he thought I was bluffing, he was going to be disappointed. I'd already made this decision, and I was sure. It didn't matter that my body was rigid as a plank, my hands balled into fists, my breathing erratic\u2026 He chuckled darkly, and leaned away. His face did look disappointed. \"You can't really believe that I would give in so easily,\" he said with a sour edge to his mocking tone. \"A girl can dream.\" His eyebrows rose. \"Is that what you dream about? Being a monster?\" \"Not exactly,\" I said, frowning at his word choice. Monster, indeed. \"Mostly I dream about being with you forever.\" His expression changed, softened and saddened by the subtle ache in my voice. \"Bella.\" His fingers lightly traced the shape of my lips. \"I will stay with you \u2014 isn't that enough?\" I smiled under his fingertips. \"Enough for now.\" He frowned at my tenacity. No one was going to surrender tonight. He exhaled, and the sound was practically a growl. I touched his face. \"Look,\" I said. \"I love you more than everything else in the world combined. Isn't that enough?\" \"Yes, it is enough,\" he answered, smiling. \"Enough for forever.\" And he leaned down to press his cold lips once more to my throat.",

            "en": "17         17. THE GAME It was just beginning to drizzle when Edward turned onto my street. Up until that moment, I'd had no doubt that he'd be staying with me while I spent a few interim hours in the real world. And then I saw the black car, a weathered Ford, parked in Charlie's driveway \u2014 and heard Edward mutter something unintelligible in a low, harsh voice. Leaning away from the rain under the shallow front porch, Jacob Black stood behind his father's wheelchair. Billy's face was impassive as stone as Edward parked my truck against the curb. Jacob stared down, his expression mortified. Edward's low voice was furious. \"This is crossing the line.\" \"He came to warn Charlie?\" I guessed, more horrified than angry. Edward just nodded, answering Billy's gaze through the rain with narrowed eyes. I felt weak with relief that Charlie wasn't home yet. \"Let me deal with this,\" I suggested. Edward's black glare made me anxious. To my surprise, he agreed. \"That's probably best. Be careful, though. The child has no idea.\" I bridled a little at the word child. \"Jacob is not that much younger than I am,\" I reminded him. He looked at me then, his anger abruptly fading. \"Oh, I know,\" he assured me with a grin. I sighed and put my hand on the door handle. \"Get them inside,\" he instructed, \"so I can leave. I'll be back around dusk.\" \"Do you want my truck?\" I offered, meanwhile wondering how I would explain its absence to Charlie. He rolled his eyes. \"I could walk home faster than this truck moves.\" \"You don't have to leave,\" I said wistfully. He smiled at my glum expression. \"Actually, I do. After you get rid of them\" \u2014 he threw a dark glance in the Blacks' direction \u2014 \"you still have to prepare Charlie to meet your new boyfriend.\" He grinned widely, showing all of his teeth. I groaned. \"Thanks a lot.\" He smiled the crooked smile that I loved. \"I'll be back soon,\" he promised. His eyes flickered back to the porch, and then he leaned in to swiftly kiss me just under the edge of my jaw. My heart lurched frantically, and I, too, glanced toward the porch. Billy's face was no longer impassive, and his hands clutched at the armrests of his chair. \"Soon,\" I stressed as I opened the door and stepped out into the rain. I could feel his eyes on my back as I half-ran through the light sprinkle toward the porch. \"Hey, Billy. Hi, Jacob.\" I greeted them as cheerfully as I could manage. \"Charlie's gone for the day \u2014 I hope you haven't been waiting long.\" \"Not long,\" Billy said in a subdued tone. His black eyes were piercing. \"I just wanted to bring this up.\" He indicated a brown paper sack resting in his lap. \"Thanks,\" I said, though I had no idea what it could be. \"Why don't you come in for a minute and dry off?\" I pretended to be oblivious to his intense scrutiny as I unlocked the door, and waved them in ahead of me. \"Here, let me take that,\" I offered, turning to shut the door. I allowed myself one last glance at Edward. He was waiting, perfectly still, his eyes solemn. \"You'll want to put it in the fridge,\" Billy noted as he handed me the package. \"It's some of Harry Clearwater's homemade fish fry \u2014 Charlie's favorite. The fridge keeps it drier.\" He shrugged. \"Thanks,\" I repeated, but with feeling this time. \"I was running out of new ways to fix fish, and he's bound to bring home more tonight.\" \"Fishing again?\" Billy asked with a subtle gleam in his eye. \"Down at the usual spot? Maybe I'll run by and see him.\" \"No,\" I quickly lied, my face going hard. \"He was headed someplace new\u2026 but I have no idea where.\" He took in my changed expression, and it made him thoughtful. \"Jake,\" he said, still appraising me. \"Why don't you go get that new picture of Rebecca out of the car? I'll leave that for Charlie, too.\" \"Where is it?\" Jacob asked, his voice morose. I glanced at him, but he was staring at the floor, his eyebrows pulling together. \"I think I saw it in the trunk,\" Billy said. \"You may have to dig for it.\" Jacob slouched back out into the rain. Billy and I faced each other in silence. After a few seconds, the quiet started to feel awkward, so I turned and headed to the kitchen. I could hear his wet wheels squeak against the linoleum as he followed. I shoved the bag onto the crowded top shelf of the fridge, and spun around to confront him. His deeply lined face was unreadable. \"Charlie won't be back for a long time.\" My voice was almost rude. He nodded in agreement, but said nothing. \"Thanks again for the fish fry,\" I hinted. He continued nodding. I sighed and folded my arms across my chest. He seemed to sense that I had given up on small talk. \"Bella,\" he said, and then he hesitated. I waited. \"Bella,\" he said again, \"Charlie is one of my best friends.\" \"Yes.\" He spoke each word carefully in his rumbling voice. \"I noticed you've been spending time with one of the Cullens.\" \"Yes,\" I repeated curtly. His eyes narrowed. \"Maybe it's none of my business, but I don't think that is such a good idea.\" \"You're right,\" I agreed. \"It is none of your business.\" He raised his graying eyebrows at my tone. \"You probably don't know this, but the Cullen family has an unpleasant reputation on the reservation.\" \"Actually, I did know that,\" I informed him in a hard voice. This surprised him. \"But that reputation couldn't be deserved, could it?\u00a0 Because the Cullens never set foot on the reservation, do they?\" I could see that my less than subtle reminder of the agreement that both bound and protected his tribe pulled him up short. \"That's true,\" he acceded, his eyes guarded. \"You seem\u2026 well informed about the Cullens. More informed than I expected.\" I stared him down. \"Maybe even better informed than you are.\" He pursed his thick lips as he considered that. \"Maybe.\" he allowed, but his eyes were shrewd. \"Is Charlie as well informed?\" He had found the weak chink in my armor. \"Charlie likes the Cullens a lot,\" I hedged. He clearly understood my evasion. His expression was unhappy, but unsurprised. \"It's not my business,\" he said. \"But it may be Charlie's.\" \"Though it would be my business, again, whether or not I think that it's Charlie's business, right?\" I wondered if he even understood my confused question as I struggled not to say anything compromising. But he seemed to. He thought about it while the rain picked up against the roof, the only sound breaking the silence. \"Yes,\" he finally surrendered. \"I guess that's your business, too.\" I sighed with relief. \"Thanks, Billy.\" \"Just think about what you're doing, Bella,\" he urged. \"Okay,\" I agreed quickly. He frowned. \"What I meant to say was, don't do what you're doing.\" I looked into his eyes, filled with nothing but concern for me, and there was nothing I could say. Just then the front door banged loudly, and I jumped at the sound. \"There's no picture anywhere in that car.\" Jacob's complaining voice reached us before he did. The shoulders of his shirt were stained with the rain, his hair dripping, when he rounded the corner. \"Hmm,\" Billy grunted, suddenly detached, spinning his chair around to face his son. \"I guess I left it at home.\" Jacob rolled his eyes dramatically. \"Great.\" \"Well, Bella, tell Charlie\" \u2014 Billy paused before continuing \u2014 \"that we stopped by, I mean.\" \"I will,\" I muttered. Jacob was surprised. \"Are we leaving already?\" \"Charlie's gonna be out late,\" Billy explained as he rolled himself past Jacob. \"Oh.\" Jacob looked disappointed. \"Well, I guess I'll see you later, then, Bella.\" \"Sure,\" I agreed. \"Take care,\" Billy warned me. I didn't answer. Jacob helped his father out the door. I waved briefly, glancing swiftly toward my now-empty truck, and then shut the door before they were gone. I stood in the hallway for a minute, listening to the sound of their car as it backed out and drove away. I stayed where I was, waiting for the irritation and anxiety to subside. When the tension eventually faded a bit, I headed upstairs to change out of my dressy clothes. I tried on a couple of different tops, not sure what to expect tonight. As I concentrated on what was coming, what had just passed became insignificant. Now that I was removed from Jasper's and Edward's influence, I began to make up for not being terrified before. I gave up quickly on choosing an outfit \u2014 throwing on an old flannel shirt and jeans \u2014 knowing I would be in my raincoat all night anyway. The phone rang and I sprinted downstairs to get it. There was only one voice I wanted to hear; anything else would be a disappointment. But I knew that if he wanted to talk to me, he'd probably just materialize in my room. \"Hello?\" I asked, breathless. \"Bella? It's me,\" Jessica said. \"Oh, hey, Jess.\" I scrambled for a moment to come back down to reality. It felt like months rather than days since I'd spoken to Jess. \"How was the dance?\" \"It was so much fun!\" Jessica gushed. Needing no more invitation than that, she launched into a minute-by-minute account of the previous night. I mmm'd and ahh'd at the right places, but it wasn't easy to concentrate. Jessica, Mike, the dance, the school \u2014 they all seemed strangely irrelevant at the moment. My eyes kept flashing to the window, trying to judge the degree of light behind the heavy clouds. \"Did you hear what I said, Bella?\" Jess asked, irritated. \"I'm sorry, what?\" \"I said, Mike kissed me! Can you believe it?\" \"That's wonderful, Jess,\" I said. \"So what did you do yesterday?\" Jessica challenged, still sounding bothered by my lack of attention. Or maybe she was upset because I hadn't asked for details. \"Nothing, really. I just hung around outside to enjoy the sun.\" I heard Charlie's car in the garage. \"Did you ever hear anything more from Edward Cullen?\" The front door slammed and I could hear Charlie banging around under the stairs, putting his tackle away. \"Um.\" I hesitated, not sure what my story was anymore. \"Hi there, kiddo!\" Charlie called as he walked into the kitchen. I waved at him. Jess heard his voice. \"Oh, your dad's there. Never mind \u2014 we'll talk tomorrow. See you in Trig.\" \"See ya, Jess.\" I hung up the phone. \"Hey, Dad,\" I said. He was scrubbing his hands in the sink. \"Where's the fish?\" \"I put it out in the freezer.\" \"I'll go grab a few pieces before they freeze \u2014 Billy dropped off some of Harry Clearwater's fish fry this afternoon.\" I worked to sound enthusiastic. \"He did?\" Charlie's eyes lit up. \"That's my favorite.\" Charlie cleaned up while I got dinner ready. It didn't take long till we were sitting at the table, eating in silence. Charlie was enjoying his food. I was wondering desperately how to fulfill my assignment, struggling to think of a way to broach the subject. \"What did you do with yourself today?\" he asked, snapping me out of my reverie. \"Well, this afternoon I just hung out around the house\u2026\" Only the very recent part of this afternoon, actually. I tried to keep my voice upbeat, but my stomach was hollow. \"And this morning I was over at the Cullens'.\" Charlie dropped his fork. \"Dr. Cullen's place?\" he asked in astonishment. I pretended not to notice his reaction. \"Yeah.\" \"What were you doing there?\" He hadn't picked his fork back up. \"Well, I sort of have a date with Edward Cullen tonight, and he wanted to introduce me to his parents\u2026 Dad?\" It appeared that Charlie was having an aneurysm. \"Dad, are you all right?\" \"You are going out with Edward Cullen?\" he thundered. Uh-oh. \"I thought you liked the Cullens.\" \"He's too old for you,\" he ranted. \"We're both juniors,\" I corrected, though he was more right than he dreamed. \"Wait\u2026\" He paused. \"Which one is Edwin?\" \"Edward is the youngest, the one with the reddish brown hair.\" The beautiful one, the godlike one\u2026 \"Oh, well, that's\" \u2014 he struggled \u2014 \"better, I guess. I don't like the look of that big one. I'm sure he's a nice boy and all, but he looks too\u2026 mature for you. Is this Edwin your boyfriend?\" \"It's Edward, Dad.\" \"Is he?\" \"Sort of, I guess.\" \"You said last night that you weren't interested in any of the boys in town.\" But he picked up his fork again, so I could see the worst was over. \"Well, Edward doesn't live in town, Dad.\" He gave me a disparaging look as he chewed. \"And, anyways,\" I continued, \"it's kind of at an early stage, you know.\u00a0 Don't embarrass me with all the boyfriend talk, okay?\" \"When is he coming over?\" \"He'll be here in a few minutes.\" \"Where is he taking you?\" I groaned loudly. \"I hope you're getting the Spanish Inquisition out of your system now. We're going to play baseball with his family.\" His face puckered, and then he finally chuckled. \"You're playing baseball?\" \"Well, I'll probably watch most of the time.\" \"You must really like this guy,\" he observed suspiciously. I sighed and rolled my eyes for his benefit. I heard the roar of an engine pull up in front of the house. I jumped up and started cleaning my dishes. \"Leave the dishes, I can do them tonight. You baby me too much.\" The doorbell rang, and Charlie stalked off to answer it. I was half a step behind him. I hadn't realized how hard it was pouring outside. Edward stood in the halo of the porch light, looking like a male model in an advertisement for raincoats. \"Come on in, Edward.\" I breathed a sigh of relief when Charlie got his name right. \"Thanks, Chief Swan,\" Edward said in a respectful voice. \"Go ahead and call me Charlie. Here, I'll take your jacket.\" \"Thanks, sir.\" \"Have a seat there, Edward.\" I grimaced. Edward sat down fluidly in the only chair, forcing me to sit next to Chief Swan on the sofa. I quickly shot him a dirty look. He winked behind Charlie's back. \"So I hear you're getting my girl to watch baseball.\" Only in Washington would the fact that it was raining buckets have no bearing at all on the playing of outdoor sports. \"Yes, sir, that's the plan.\" He didn't look surprised that I'd told my father the truth. He might have been listening, though. \"Well, more power to you, I guess.\" Charlie laughed, and Edward joined in. \"Okay.\" I stood up. \"Enough humor at my expense. Let's go.\" I walked back to the hall and pulled on my jacket. They followed. \"Not too late, Bell.\" \"Don't worry, Charlie, I'll have her home early,\" Edward promised. \"You take care of my girl, all right?\" I groaned, but they ignored me. \"She'll be safe with me, I promise, sir.\" Charlie couldn't doubt Edward's sincerity, it rang in every word. I stalked out. They both laughed, and Edward followed me. I stopped dead on the porch. There, behind my truck, was a monster Jeep. Its tires were higher than my waist. There were metal guards over the headlights and tail-lights, and four large spotlights attached to the crash bar. The hardtop was shiny red. Charlie let out a low whistle. \"Wear your seat belts,\" he choked out. Edward followed me around to my side and opened the door. I gauged the distance to the seat and prepared to jump for it. He sighed, and then lifted me in with one hand. I hoped Charlie didn't notice. As he went around to the driver's side, at a normal, human pace, I tried to put on my seat belt. But there were too many buckles. \"What's all this?\" I asked when he opened the door. \"It's an off-roading harness.\" \"Uh-oh.\" I tried to find the right places for all the buckles to fit, but it wasn't going too quickly. He sighed again and reached over to help me. I was glad that the rain was too heavy to see Charlie clearly on the porch. That meant he couldn't see how Edward's hands lingered at my neck, brushed along my collarbones. I gave up trying to help him and focused on not hyperventilating. Edward turned the key and the engine roared to life. We pulled away from the house. \"This is a\u2026 um\u2026 big Jeep you have.\" \"It's Emmett's. I didn't think you'd want to run the whole way.\" \"Where do you keep this thing?\" \"We remodeled one of the outbuildings into a garage.\" \"Aren't you going to put on your seat belt?\" He threw me a disbelieving look. Then something sunk in. \"Run the whole way? As in, we're still going to run part of the way?\" My voice edged up a few octaves. He grinned tightly. \"You're not going to run.\" \"I'm going to be sick.\" \"Keep your eyes closed, you'll be fine.\" I bit my lip, fighting the panic. He leaned over to kiss the top of my head, and then groaned. I looked at him, puzzled. \"You smell so good in the rain,\" he explained. \"In a good way, or in a bad way?\" I asked cautiously. He sighed. \"Both, always both.\" I don't know how he found his way in the gloom and downpour, but he somehow found a side road that was less of a road and more of a mountain path. For a long while conversation was impossible, because I was bouncing up and down on the seat like a jackhammer. He seemed to enjoy the ride, though, smiling hugely the whole way. And then we came to the end of the road; the trees formed green walls on three sides of the Jeep. The rain was a mere drizzle, slowing every second, the sky brighter through the clouds. \"Sorry, Bella, we have to go on foot from here.\" \"You know what? I'll just wait here.\" \"What happened to all your courage? You were extraordinary this morning.\" \"I haven't forgotten the last time yet.\" Could it have been only yesterday? He was around to my side of the car in a blur. He started unbuckling me. \"I'll get those, you go on ahead,\" I protested. \"Hmmm\u2026\" he mused as he quickly finished. \"It seems I'm going to have to tamper with your memory.\" Before I could react, he pulled me from the Jeep and set my feet on the ground. It was barely misting now; Alice was going to be right. \"Tamper with my memory?\" I asked nervously. \"Something like that.\" He was watching me intently, carefully, but there was humor deep in his eyes. He placed his hands against the Jeep on either side of my head and leaned forward, forcing me to press back against the door. He leaned in even closer, his face inches from mine. I had no room to escape. \"Now,\" he breathed, and just his smell disturbed my thought processes, \"what exactly are you worrying about?\" \"Well, um, hitting a tree \u2014\" I gulped \"\u2014 and dying. And then getting sick.\" He fought back a smile. Then he bent his head down and touched his cold lips softly to the hollow at the base of my throat. \"Are you still worried now?\" he murmured against my skin. \"Yes.\" I struggled to concentrate. \"About hitting trees and getting sick.\" His nose drew a line up the skin of my throat to the point of my chin. His cold breath tickled my skin. \"And now?\" His lips whispered against my jaw. \"Trees,\" I gasped. \"Motion sickness.\" He lifted his face to kiss my eyelids. \"Bella, you don't really think I would hit a tree, do you?\" \"No, but I might.\" There was no confidence in my voice. He smelled an easy victory. He kissed slowly down my cheek, stopping just at the corner of my mouth. \"Would I let a tree hurt you?\" His lips barely brushed against my trembling lower lip. \"No,\" I breathed. I knew there was a second part to my brilliant defense, but I couldn't quite call it back. \"You see,\" he said, his lips moving against mine. \"There's nothing to be afraid of, is there?\" \"No,\" I sighed, giving up. Then he took my face in his hands almost roughly, and kissed me in earnest, his unyielding lips moving against mine. There really was no excuse for my behavior. Obviously I knew better by now. And yet I couldn't seem to stop from reacting exactly as I had the first time. Instead of keeping safely motionless, my arms reached up to twine tightly around his neck, and I was suddenly welded to his stone figure. I sighed, and my lips parted. He staggered back, breaking my grip effortlessly. \"Damn it, Bella!\" he broke off, gasping. \"You'll be the death of me, I swear you will.\" I leaned over, bracing my hands against my knees for support. \"You're indestructible,\" I mumbled, trying to catch my breath. \"I might have believed that before I met you. Now let's get out of here before I do something really stupid,\" he growled. He threw me across his back as he had before, and I could see the extra effort it took for him to be as gentle as he was. I locked my legs around his waist and secured my arms in a choke hold around his neck. \"Don't forget to close your eyes,\" he warned severely. I quickly tucked my face into his shoulder blade, under my own arm, and squeezed my eyes shut. And I could hardly tell we were moving. I could feel him gliding along beneath me, but he could have been strolling down the sidewalk, the movement was so smooth. I was tempted to peek, just to see if he was really flying through the forest like before, but I resisted. It wasn't worth that awful dizziness. I contented myself with listening to his breath come and go evenly. I wasn't quite sure we had stopped until he reached back and touched my hair. \"It's over, Bella.\" I dared to open my eyes, and, sure enough, we were at a standstill. I stiffly unlocked my stranglehold on his body and slipped to the ground, landing on my backside. \"Oh!\" I huffed as I hit the wet ground. He stared at me incredulously, evidently not sure whether he was still too mad to find me funny. But my bewildered expression pushed him over the edge, and he broke into a roar of laughter. I picked myself up, ignoring him as I brushed the mud and bracken off the back of my jacket. That only made him laugh harder. Annoyed, I began to stride off into the forest. I felt his arm around my waist. \"Where are you going, Bella?\" \"To watch a baseball game. You don't seem to be interested in playing anymore, but I'm sure the others will have fun without you.\" \"You're going the wrong way.\" I turned around without looking at him, and stalked off in the opposite direction. He caught me again. \"Don't be mad, I couldn't help myself. You should have seen your face.\" He chuckled before he could stop himself. \"Oh, you're the only one who's allowed to get mad?\" I asked, raising my eyebrows. \"I wasn't mad at you.\" \"'Bella, you'll be the death of me'?\" I quoted sourly. \"That was simply a statement of fact.\" I tried to turn away from him again, but he held me fast. \"You were mad,\" I insisted. \"Yes.\" \"But you just said \u2014\" \"That I wasn't mad at you. Can't you see that, Bella?\" He was suddenly intense, all trace of teasing gone. \"Don't you understand?\" \"See what?\" I demanded, confused by his sudden mood swing as much as his words. \"I'm never angry with you \u2014 how could I be? Brave, trusting\u2026 warm as you are.\" \"Then why?\" I whispered, remembering the black moods that pulled him away from me, that I'd always interpreted as well-justified frustration \u2014 frustration at my weakness, my slowness, my unruly human reactions\u2026 He put his hands carefully on both sides of my face. \"I infuriate myself,\" he said gently. \"The way I can't seem to keep from putting you in danger. My very existence puts you at risk. Sometimes I truly hate myself. I should be stronger, I should be able to \u2014\"  I placed my hand over his mouth. \"Don't.\" He took my hand, moving it from his lips, but holding it to his face. \"I love you,\" he said. \"It's a poor excuse for what I'm doing, but it's still true.\" It was the first time he'd said he loved me \u2014 in so many words. He might not realize it, but I certainly did. \"Now, please try to behave yourself,\" he continued, and he bent to softly brush his lips against mine. I held properly still. Then I sighed. \"You promised Chief Swan that you would have me home early, remember? We'd better get going.\" \"Yes, ma'am.\" He smiled wistfully and released all of me but one hand. He led me a few feet through the tall, wet ferns and draping moss, around a massive hemlock tree, and we were there, on the edge of an enormous open field in the lap of the Olympic peaks. It was twice the size of any baseball stadium. I could see the others all there; Esme, Emmett, and Rosalie, sitting on a bare outcropping of rock, were the closest to us, maybe a hundred yards away. Much farther out I could see Jasper and Alice, at least a quarter of a mile apart, appearing to throw something back and forth, but I never saw any ball. It looked like Carlisle was marking bases, but could they really be that far apart? When we came into view, the three on the rocks rose. Esme started toward us. Emmett followed after a long look at Rosalie's back; Rosalie had risen <em>gracefully</em> and strode off toward the field without a glance in our direction. My stomach quivered uneasily in response. \"Was that you we heard, Edward?\" Esme asked as she approached. \"It sounded like a bear choking,\" Emmett clarified. I smiled hesitantly at Esme. \"That was him.\" \"Bella was being unintentionally funny,\" Edward explained, quickly settling the score. Alice had left her position and was running, or dancing, toward us. She hurtled to a fluid stop at our feet. \"It's time,\" she announced. As soon as she spoke, a deep rumble of thunder shook the forest beyond us, and then crashed westward toward town. \"Eerie, isn't it?\" Emmett said with easy familiarity, winking at me. \"Let's go.\" Alice reached for Emmett's hand and they darted toward the oversized field; she ran like a gazelle. He was nearly as graceful and just as fast \u2014 yet Emmett could never be compared to a gazelle. \"Are you ready for some ball?\" Edward asked, his eyes eager, bright. I tried to sound appropriately enthusiastic. \"Go team!\" He snickered and, after mussing my hair, bounded off after the other two. His run was more aggressive, a cheetah rather than a gazelle, and he quickly overtook them. The grace and power took my breath away. \"Shall we go down?\" Esme asked in her soft, melodic voice, and I realized I was staring openmouthed after him. I quickly reassembled my expression and nodded. Esme kept a few feet between us, and I wondered if she was still being careful not to frighten me. She matched her stride to mine without seeming impatient at the pace.  \"You don't play with them?\" I asked shyly. \"No, I prefer to referee \u2014 I like keeping them honest,\" she explained. \"Do they like to cheat, then?\" \"Oh yes \u2014 you should hear the arguments they get into! Actually, I hope you don't, you would think they were raised by a pack of wolves.\" \"You sound like my mom,\" I laughed, surprised. She laughed, too. \"Well, I do think of them as my children in most ways. I never could get over my mothering instincts \u2014 did Edward tell you I had lost a child?\" \"No,\" I murmured, stunned, scrambling to understand what lifetime she was remembering. \"Yes, my first and only baby. He died just a few days after he was born, the poor tiny thing,\" she sighed. \"It broke my heart \u2014 that's why I jumped off the cliff, you know,\" she added matter-of-factly. \"Edward just said you f-fell,\" I stammered. \"Always the gentleman.\" She smiled. \"Edward was the first of my new sons. I've always thought of him that way, even though he's older than I, in one way at least.\" She smiled at me warmly. \"That's why I'm so happy that he's found you, dear.\" The endearment sounded very natural on her lips. \"He's been the odd man out for far too long; it's hurt me to see him alone.\" \"You don't mind, then?\" I asked, hesitant again. \"That I'm\u2026 all wrong for him?\" \"No.\" She was thoughtful. \"You're what he wants. It will work out, somehow,\" she said, though her forehead creased with worry. Another peal of thunder began. Esme stopped then; apparently, we'd reached the edge of the field. It looked as if they had formed teams. Edward was far out in left field, Carlisle stood between the first and second bases, and Alice held the ball, positioned on the spot that must be the pitcher's mound. Emmett was swinging an aluminum bat; it whistled almost untraceably through the air. I waited for him to approach home plate, but then I realized, as he took his stance, that he was already there \u2014 farther from the pitcher's mound than I would have thought possible. Jasper stood several feet behind him, catching for the other team. Of course, none of them had gloves. \"All right,\" Esme called in a clear voice, which I knew even Edward would hear, as far out as he was. \"Batter up.\" Alice stood straight, deceptively motionless. Her style seemed to be stealth rather than an intimidating windup. She held the ball in both hands at her waist, and then, like the strike of a cobra, her right hand flicked out and the ball smacked into Jasper's hand. \"Was that a strike?\" I whispered to Esme. \"If they don't hit it, it's a strike,\" she told me. Jasper hurled the ball back to Alice's waiting hand. She permitted herself a brief grin. And then her hand spun out again. This time the bat somehow made it around in time to smash into the invisible ball. The crack of impact was shattering, thunderous; it echoed off the mountains \u2014 I immediately understood the necessity of the thunderstorm. The ball shot like a meteor above the field, flying deep into the surrounding forest. \"Home run,\" I murmured. \"Wait,\" Esme cautioned, listening intently, one hand raised. Emmett was a blur around the bases, Carlisle shadowing him. I realized Edward was missing. \"Out!\" Esme cried in a clear voice. I stared in disbelief as Edward sprang from the fringe of the trees, ball in his upraised hand, his wide grin visible even to me. \"Emmett hits the hardest,\" Esme explained, \"but Edward runs the fastest.\" The inning continued before my incredulous eyes. It was impossible to keep up with the speed at which the ball flew, the rate at which their bodies raced around the field. I learned the other reason they waited for a thunderstorm to play when Jasper, trying to avoid Edward's infallible fielding, hit a ground ball toward Carlisle. Carlisle ran into the ball, and then raced Jasper to first base. When they collided, the sound was like the crash of two massive falling boulders. I jumped up in concern, but they were somehow unscathed. \"Safe,\" Esme called in a calm voice. Emmett's team was up by one \u2014 Rosalie managed to flit around the bases after tagging up on one of Emmett's long flies \u2014 when Edward caught the third out. He sprinted to my side, sparkling with excitement. \"What do you think?\" he asked. \"One thing's for sure, I'll never be able to sit through dull old Major League Baseball again.\" \"And it sounds like you did so much of that before,\" he laughed. \"I am a little disappointed,\" I teased. \"Why?\" he asked, puzzled. \"Well, it would be nice if I could find just one thing you didn't do better than everyone else on the planet.\" He flashed his special crooked smile, leaving me breathless. \"I'm up,\" he said, heading for the plate. He played intelligently, keeping the ball low, out of the reach of Rosalie's always-ready hand in the outfield, gaining two bases like lightning before Emmett could get the ball back in play. Carlisle knocked one so far out of the field \u2014 with a boom that hurt my ears \u2014 that he and Edward both made it in. Alice slapped them dainty high fives. The score constantly changed as the game continued, and they razzed each other like any street ballplayers as they took turns with the lead. Occasionally Esme would call them to order. The thunder rumbled on, but we stayed dry, as Alice had predicted. Carlisle was up to bat, Edward catching, when Alice suddenly gasped. My eyes were on Edward, as usual, and I saw his head snap up to look at her. Their eyes met and something flowed between them in an instant. He was at my side before the others could ask Alice what was wrong. \"Alice?\" Esme's voice was tense. \"I didn't see \u2014 I couldn't tell,\" she whispered. All the others were gathered by this time. \"What is it, Alice?\" Carlisle asked with the calm voice of authority. \"They were traveling much quicker than I thought. I can see I had the perspective wrong before,\" she murmured. Jasper leaned over her, his posture protective. \"What changed?\" he asked. \"They heard us playing, and it changed their path,\" she said, contrite, as if she felt responsible for whatever had frightened her. Seven pairs of quick eyes flashed to my face and away. \"How soon?\" Carlisle said, turning toward Edward. A look of intense concentration crossed his face. \"Less than five minutes. They're running \u2014 they want to play.\" He scowled. \"Can you make it?\" Carlisle asked him, his eyes flicking toward me again. \"No, not carrying \u2014\" He cut short. \"Besides, the last thing we need is for them to catch the scent and start hunting.\" \"How many?\" Emmett asked Alice. \"Three,\" she answered tersely. \"Three!\" he scoffed. \"Let them come.\" The steel bands of muscle flexed along his massive arms. For a split second that seemed much longer than it really was, Carlisle deliberated. Only Emmett seemed unperturbed; the rest stared at Carlisle's face with anxious eyes. \"Let's just continue the game,\" Carlisle finally decided. His voice was cool and level. \"Alice said they were simply curious.\" All this was said in a flurry of words that lasted only a few seconds. I had listened carefully and caught most of it, though I couldn't hear what Esme now asked Edward with a silent vibration of her lips. I only saw the slight shake of his head and the look of relief on her face. \"You catch, Esme,\" he said. \"I'll call it now.\" And he planted himself in front of me. The others returned to the field, warily sweeping the dark forest with their sharp eyes. Alice and Esme seemed to orient themselves around where I stood. \"Take your hair down,\" Edward said in a low, even voice. I obediently slid the rubber band out of my hair and shook it out around me. I stated the obvious. \"The others are coming now.\" \"Yes, stay very still, keep quiet, and don't move from my side, please.\" He hid the stress in his voice well, but I could hear it. He pulled my long hair forward, around my face. \"That won't help,\" Alice said softly. \"I could smell her across the field.\" \"I know.\" A hint of frustration colored his tone. Carlisle stood at the plate, and the others joined the game halfheartedly. \"What did Esme ask you?\" I whispered. He hesitated for a second before he answered. \"Whether they were thirsty,\" he muttered unwillingly. The seconds ticked by; the game progressed with apathy now. No one dared to hit harder than a bunt, and Emmett, Rosalie, and Jasper hovered in the infield.  Now and again, despite the fear that numbed my brain, I was aware of Rosalie's eyes on me. They were expressionless, but something about the way she held her mouth made me think she was angry. Edward paid no attention to the game at all, eyes and mind ranging the forest. \"I'm sorry, Bella,\" he muttered fiercely. \"It was stupid, irresponsible, to expose you like this.
