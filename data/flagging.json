            "en": "Vitamins and Minerals    Breakfast cereals advertise that they're packed with vitamins and minerals. Sports drinks claim they can rev up your <em>flagging</em> energy with a jolt of vitamins or minerals (sorry, but even powerful vitamins and minerals can't act that fast!). You know vitamins and minerals are good for you. But which ones does your body really need? And is it possible to get too much of a good thing? What are vitamins and minerals? Vitamins and minerals make people's bodies work properly. Although you get vitamins and minerals from the foods you eat every day, some foods have more vitamins and minerals than others. Vitamins fall into two categories: fat soluble and water soluble. The fat-soluble vitamins \u2014 A, D, E, and K \u2014 dissolve in fat and can be stored in your body. The water-soluble vitamins \u2014 C and the B-complex vitamins (such as vitamins B6, B12, niacin, riboflavin, and folate) \u2014 need to dissolve in water before your body can absorb them. Your body can't store these vitamins. Any vitamin C or B that your body doesn't use may be lost mostly when you pee. So you need a fresh supply of these vitamins every day. Whereas vitamins are organic substances (made by plants or animals), minerals are inorganic elements that come from the soil and water and are absorbed by plants or eaten by animals. Your body needs larger amounts of some minerals, such as calcium, to grow and stay healthy. Other minerals like chromium, copper, iodine, iron, selenium, and zinc are called trace minerals because you only need very small amounts of them each day. what do vitamins and minerals do? Vitamins and minerals boost the immune system, support normal growth and development, and help cells and organs do their jobs. For example, you've probably heard that carrots are good for your eyes. It's true! Carrots are full of substances called carotenoids that your body converts into vitamin A, which helps prevent eye problems. Another vitamin, vitamin K, helps blood to clot (so cuts and scrapes stop bleeding quickly). You'll find vitamin K in green leafy vegetables, broccoli, and soybeans. And to have strong bones, you need to eat foods such as milk, yogurt, and green leafy vegetables, which are rich in the mineral calcium. Fuel for growth People go through a lot of physical changes \u2014 including growth and puberty \u2014 during their teenage years. Eating right during this time is especially important because the body needs a variety of vitamins and minerals to grow, develop, and stay healthy. Eating a variety of foods is the best way to get all the vitamins and minerals you need each day, as well as the right balance of carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and calories. Whole or unprocessed foods \u2014 like fresh fruits and vegetables, grains, low-fat dairy products, lean meats, fish, and poultry \u2014 are the best choices for providing the nutrients your body needs to stay healthy and grow properly. It's OK to eat foods like potato chips and cookies once in a while, but don't overdo high-calorie foods like these because they offer little nutritionally. To choose healthy foods, check food labels and pick items that are high in vitamins and minerals. For example, if you're choosing beverages, you'll find that a glass of milk is a good source of vitamin D and the minerals calcium, phosphorous, and potassium. A glass of soda, on the other hand, offers very few vitamins or minerals \u2014 if any. You can also satisfy your taste without sacrificing nutrition while eating out: Vegetable pizzas or fajitas, sandwiches with lean meat, fresh salads, and baked potatoes are a few delicious, nutritious choices. If you're a vegetarian, you'll need to plan carefully for a diet that offers the vitamins and minerals found primarily in meats. The best sources for the minerals zinc and iron are meats, fish, and poultry. However, you can get zinc and iron in dried beans, seeds, nuts, and leafy green vegetables like kale. Vitamin B12, which is important for manufacturing red blood cells, is not found in plant foods. If you don't eat meat, you can find vitamin B12 in eggs, milk and other dairy foods, and fortified breakfast cereals. Vegans (vegetarians who eat no animal products at all, including dairy products) may need to take vitamin supplements. If you're thinking about becoming a vegetarian, talk to your doctor or a dietitian about how to plan a healthy, balanced diet. Common Concerns Lots of teens wonder if they should take vitamin or mineral supplements. If your diet includes a wide variety of foods, including grain products, fresh fruits and vegetables, dairy products, nuts, seeds, eggs, and meats, then you are probably getting the vitamins and minerals your body needs. But if you're skipping meals, dieting, or if you're concerned that you're not eating enough items from a particular category, such as vegetables or dairy products, then talk to your doctor or to a dietitian. These professionals can help you create an eating plan that includes the nutrients your body needs. consult your doctor before taking vitamin or mineral supplements. Some people think that if something is good for you, then the more you take in, the healthier you'll be. But that's not necessarily true when it comes to vitamins and minerals. For example, fat-soluble vitamins or minerals, which the body stores and excretes more slowly, can build up in your system to levels where they could cause problems. There are hundreds of supplements on the market and of course their manufacturers want you to purchase them. Beware of unproven claims about the benefits of taking more than recommended amounts of any vitamin or mineral. A healthy teen usually doesn't need supplements if he or she is eating a well-rounded diet. Your best bet for getting the vitamins and minerals you need is to eat a wide variety of healthy foods and skip the vitamin pills and then you'll feel better!",

            "en": "Obituary: Robert McNamara          Former American secretaries of defence seldom get such widespread obituaries as Robert S McNamara. Despite a distinguished career which saw him at the centre of power or influence at some of the most troubled times of the 20th Century, it was Errol Morris's 2003 film, The Fog of War, subtitled Eleven Lessons from the Life of Robert McNamara, which singled out this former defence secretary. In the film, McNamara spoke frankly about the Vietnam war, the Cuban missile crisis and World War II, giving a behind-the-scenes account of the context in which important decisions were taken, in so doing raising questions about the nature of war and human behaviour. Cuban Missile Crisis A brilliant statistician, he was drafted to help develop methods of statistical control for managing the strategic bombing campaigns against Germany and Japan. He worked with General Curtis LeMay on the firebombing of 67 Japanese cities that killed almost a million people, 100,000 on one night in wooden Tokyo. In The Fog of War, he agreed with LeMay's assertion that the pair \"were behaving as war criminals\" and would have been tried as such had their side lost. In 1946, McNamara was hired by the Ford Motor company to rejuvenate its <em>flagging</em> sales. He rose to become the first president of the company outside the Ford family. He was one of the first to introduce safety features in order to reduce the death rate in crashes. But in 1960, he was snapped up by President John F Kennedy to become his defence secretary. In this post, he reformed Pentagon practices, oversaw a huge military build-up and was centrally involved in the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, when Soviet nuclear missiles were discovered in Cuba and the world teetered on the brink of a nuclear war for 13 days. Hate figure In the film, he described Gen LeMay, at that time an adviser to Kennedy, and Fidel Castro, as the two most dangerous personalities of that crisis. Gen LeMay wanted to attack Cuba unilaterally, while Mr Castro, he said, told him that he had pressed Soviet leader Nikita Krushchev to attack the United States with nuclear weapons if the US invaded. During the Vietnam War, McNamara supported US efforts to prevent the victory of Communist insurgents over the government of South Vietnam. To anti-war protesters at the time, McNamara became something of a hate figure, an arrogant ultra-hawk responsible for escalating the war. Yet recently-released tapes of conversations between McNamara and President Lyndon Johnson, used in The Fog of War, reveal Johnson chiding his defence secretary for having advised Kennedy to pull American military advisers out of Vietnam. Instead, Johnson put ground troops into Vietnam following the Gulf of Tonkin incident in which, it was claimed, Vietnamese torpedo boats had attacked US warships. McNamara confirmed that these attacks never actually took place. Haunted by Vietnam By 1966, McNamara had begun to question the wisdom of US involvement in Vietnam and, a year later, was privately advising Johnson to end the war by negotiation. He initiated a full investigation of the American commitment to Vietnam. But Johnson escalated the war further by bombing North Vietnam. McNamara left the job in 1968. The war eventually claimed the lives of three million Vietnamese and 58,000 Americans. Almost immediately, he took up the presidency of the World Bank where he remained until 1981, focusing on the developing world. In later years, he became a prolific author and lecturer. His role in the Vietnam War continued to haunt him, though. It was his memoir, In Retrospect: The Tragedy and Lessons of Vietnam (1995), which inspired The Fog of War movie. He described the war as \"terribly wrong\" owing to a combination of the anti-communist climate of the times, mistaken assumptions of foreign policy and military misjudgements. Critics claimed his admission came 30 years too late. In 2004, at the age of 88, he married 70-year-old Diana Byfield. It was his second marriage - his first wife Margaret, to whom he was married for 40 years, died of cancer in 1981. Robert McNamara once said, \"I don't believe we should apply our power unilaterally. If we can't persuade nations with similar values, we'd better re-examine our reasoning.\"",
