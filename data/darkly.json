            "en": "21          21. PHONE CALL I could feel it was too early again when I woke, and I knew I was getting the schedule of my days and nights slowly reversed. I lay in my bed and listened to the quiet voices of Alice and Jasper in the other room. That they were loud enough for me to hear at all was strange. I rolled till my feet touched the floor and then staggered to the living room. The clock on the TV said it was just after two in the morning. Alice and Jasper were sitting together on the sofa, Alice sketching again while Jasper looked over her shoulder. They didn't look up when I entered, too engrossed in Alice's work. I crept to Jasper's side to peek. \"Did she see something more?\" I asked him quietly. \"Yes. Something's brought him back to the room with the VCR, but it's light now.\" I watched as Alice drew a square room with dark beams across its low ceiling. The walls were paneled in wood, a little too dark, out of date.  The floor had a dark carpet with a pattern in it. There was a large window against the south wall, and an opening through the west wall led to the living room. One side of that entrance was stone \u2014 a large tan stone fireplace that was open to both rooms. The focus of the room from this perspective, the TV and VCR, balanced on a too-small wooden stand, were in the southwest corner of the room. An aged sectional sofa curved around in front of the TV, a round coffee table in front of it. \"The phone goes there,\" I whispered, pointing. Two pairs of eternal eyes stared at me. \"That's my mother's house.\" Alice was already off the couch, phone in hand, dialing. I stared at the precise rendering of my mother's family room. Uncharacteristically, Jasper slid closer to me. He lightly touched his hand to my shoulder, and the physical contact seemed to make his calming influence stronger. The panic stayed dull, unfocused. Alice's lips were trembling with the speed of her words, the low buzzing impossible to decipher. I couldn't concentrate. \"Bella,\" Alice said. I looked at her numbly. \"Bella, Edward is coming to get you. He and Emmett and Carlisle are going to take you somewhere, to hide you for a while.\" \"Edward is coming?\" The words were like a life vest, holding my head above the flood. \"Yes, he's catching the first flight out of Seattle. We'll meet him at the airport, and you'll leave with him.\" \"But, my mother\u2026 he came here for my mother, Alice!\" Despite Jasper, the hysteria bubbled up in my voice. \"Jasper and I will stay till she's safe.\" \"I can't win, Alice. You can't guard everyone I know forever. Don't you see what he's doing? He's not tracking me at all. He'll find someone, he'll hurt someone I love\u2026 Alice, I can't \u2014\" \"We'll catch him, Bella,\" she assured me. \"And what if you get hurt, Alice? Do you think that's okay with me? Do you think it's only my human family he can hurt me with?\" Alice looked meaningfully at Jasper. A deep, heavy fog of lethargy washed over me, and my eyes closed without my permission. My mind struggled against the fog, realizing what was happening. I forced my eyes open and stood up, stepping away from Jasper's hand. \"I don't want to go back to sleep,\" I snapped. I walked to my room and shut the door, slammed it really, so I could be free to go to pieces privately. This time Alice didn't follow me. For three and a half hours I stared at the wall, curled in a ball, rocking. My mind went around in circles, trying to come up with some way out of this nightmare. There was no escape, no reprieve. I could see only one possible end looming <em>darkly</em> in my future. The only question was how many other people would be hurt before I reached it. The only solace, the only hope I had left, was knowing that I would see Edward soon. Maybe, if I could just see his face again, I would also be able to see the solution that eluded me now. When the phone rang, I returned to the front room, a little ashamed of my behavior. I hoped I hadn't offended either of them, that they would know how grateful I was for the sacrifices they were making on my account. Alice was talking as rapidly as ever, but what caught my attention was that, for the first time, Jasper was not in the room. I looked at the clock \u2014 it was five-thirty in the morning. \"They're just boarding their plane,\" Alice told me. \"They'll land at nine-forty-five.\" Just a few more hours to keep breathing till he was here. \"Where's Jasper?\" \"He went to check out.\" \"You aren't staying here?\" \"No, we're relocating closer to your mother's house.\" My stomach twisted uneasily at her words. But the phone rang again, distracting me. She looked surprised, but I was already walking forward, reaching hopefully for the phone. \"Hello?\" Alice asked. \"No, she's right here.\" She held the phone out to me. Your mother, she mouthed. \"Hello?\" \"Bella? Bella?\" It was my mother's voice, in a familiar tone I had heard a thousand times in my childhood, anytime I'd gotten too close to the edge of the sidewalk or strayed out of her sight in a crowded place. It was the sound of panic. I sighed. I'd been expecting this, though I'd tried to make my message as unalarming as possible without lessening the urgency of it. \"Calm down, Mom,\" I said in my most soothing voice, walking slowly away from Alice. I wasn't sure if I could lie as convincingly with her eyes on me. \"Everything is fine, okay? Just give me a minute and I'll explain everything, I promise.\" I paused, surprised that she hadn't interrupted me yet. \"Mom?\" \"Be very careful not to say anything until I tell you to.\" The voice I heard now was as unfamiliar as it was unexpected. It was a man's tenor voice, a very pleasant, generic voice \u2014 the kind of voice that you heard in the background of luxury car commercials. He spoke very quickly. \"Now, I don't need to hurt your mother, so please do exactly as I say, and she'll be fine.\" He paused for a minute while I listened in mute horror. \"That's very good,\" he congratulated. \"Now repeat after me, and do try to sound natural. Please say, 'No, Mom, stay where you are.'\" \"No, Mom, stay where you are.\" My voice was barely more than a whisper. \"I can see this is going to be difficult.\" The voice was amused, still light and friendly. \"Why don't you walk into another room now so your face doesn't ruin everything? There's no reason for your mother to suffer. As you're walking, please say, 'Mom, please listen to me.' Say it now.\" \"Mom, please listen to me,\" my voice pleaded. I walked very slowly to the bedroom, feeling Alice's worried stare on my back. I shut the door behind me, trying to think clearly through the terror that gripped my brain. \"There now, are you alone? Just answer yes or no.\"  \"Yes.\" \"But they can still hear you, I'm sure.\" \"Yes.\" \"All right, then,\" the agreeable voice continued, \"say, 'Mom, trust me.'\" \"Mom, trust me.\" \"This worked out rather better than I expected. I was prepared to wait, but your mother arrived ahead of schedule. It's easier this way, isn't it? Less suspense, less anxiety for you.\" I waited. \"Now I want you to listen very carefully. I'm going to need you to get away from your friends; do you think you can do that? Answer yes or no.\" \"No.\" \"I'm sorry to hear that. I was hoping you would be a little more creative than that. Do you think you could get away from them if your mother's life depended on it? Answer yes or no.\" Somehow, there had to be a way. I remembered that we were going to the airport. Sky Harbor International Airport: crowded, confusingly laid out\u2026 \"Yes.\" \"That's better. I'm sure it won't be easy, but if I get the slightest hint that you have any company, well, that would be very bad for your mother,\" the friendly voice promised. \"You must know enough about us by now to realize how quickly I would know if you tried to bring anyone along with you. And how little time I would need to deal with your mother if that was the case. Do you understand? Answer yes or no.\" \"Yes.\" My voice broke. \"Very good, Bella. Now this is what you have to do. I want you to go to your mother's house. Next to the phone there will be a number. Call it, and I'll tell you where to go from there.\" I already knew where I would go, and where this would end. But I would follow his instructions exactly. \"Can you do that? Answer yes or no.\" \"Yes.\" \"Before noon, please, Bella. I haven't got all day,\" he said politely. \"Where's Phil?\" I asked tersely. \"Ah, be careful now, Bella. Wait until I ask you to speak, please.\" I waited. \"It's important, now, that you don't make your friends suspicious when you go back to them.  Tell them that your mother called, and that you talked her out of coming home for the time being. Now repeat after me, 'Thank you, Mom.' Say it now.\" \"Thank you, Mom.\" The tears were coming. I tried to fight them back. \"Say, 'I love you, Mom, I'll see you soon.' Say it now.\" \"I love you, Mom.\" My voice was thick. \"I'll see you soon,\" I promised. \"Goodbye, Bella. I look forward to seeing you again.\" He hung up. I held the phone to my ear. My joints were frozen with terror \u2014 I couldn't unbend my fingers to drop it. I knew I had to think, but my head was filled with the sound of my mother's panic. Seconds ticked by while I fought for control.  Slowly, slowly, my thoughts started to break past that brick wall of pain. To plan. For I had no choices now but one: to go to the mirrored room and die. I had no guarantees, nothing to give to keep my mother alive. I could only hope that James would be satisfied with winning the game, that beating Edward would be enough. Despair gripped me; there was no way to bargain, nothing I could offer or withhold that could influence him. But I still had no choice. I had to try. I pushed the terror back as well as I could. My decision was made. It did no good to waste time agonizing over the outcome. I had to think clearly, because Alice and Jasper were waiting for me, and evading them was absolutely essential, and absolutely impossible. I was suddenly grateful that Jasper was gone. If he had been here to feel my anguish in the last five minutes, how could I have kept them from being suspicious? I choked back the dread, the anxiety, tried to stifle it. I couldn't afford it now. I didn't know when he would return. I concentrated on my escape. I had to hope that my familiarity with the airport would turn the odds in my favor. Somehow, I had to keep Alice away\u2026 I knew Alice was in the other room waiting for me, curious. But I had to deal with one more thing in private, before Jasper was back. I had to accept that I wouldn't see Edward again, not even one last glimpse of his face to carry with me to the mirror room. I was going to hurt him, and I couldn't say goodbye. I let the waves of torture wash over me, have their way for a time. Then I pushed them back, too, and went to face Alice. The only expression I could manage was a dull, dead look. I saw her alarm and I didn't wait for her to ask. I had just one script and I'd never manage improvisation now. \"My mom was worried, she wanted to come home. But it's okay, I convinced her to stay away.\" My voice was lifeless. \"We'll make sure she's fine, Bella, don't worry.\" I turned away; I couldn't let her see my face. My eye fell on a blank page of the hotel stationery on the desk. I went to it slowly, a plan forming. There was an envelope there, too. That was good. \"Alice,\" I asked slowly, without turning, keeping my voice level. \"If I write a letter for my mother, would you give it to her? Leave it at the house, I mean.\" \"Sure, Bella.\" Her voice was careful. She could see me coming apart at the seams. I had to keep my emotions under better control.  I went into the bedroom again, and knelt next to the little bedside table to write. \"Edward,\" I wrote. My hand was shaking, the letters were hardly legible. I love you. I am so sorry. He has my mom, and I have to try. I know it may not work. I am so very, very sorry. Don't be angry with Alice and Jasper. If I get away from them it will be a miracle. Tell them thank you for me. Alice especially, please.  And please, please, don't come after him. That's what he wants. I think.  I can't bear it if anyone has to be hurt because of me, especially you.

            "en": "16           16. CARLISLE He led me back to the room that he'd pointed out as Carlisle's office. He paused outside the door for an instant. \"Come in,\" Carlisle's voice invited. Edward opened the door to a high-ceilinged room with tall, west-facing windows. The walls were paneled again, in a darker wood \u2014 where they were visible. Most of the wall space was taken up by towering bookshelves that reached high above my head and held more books than I'd ever seen outside a library. Carlisle sat behind a huge mahogany desk in a leather chair. He was just placing a bookmark in the pages of the thick volume he held. The room was how I'd always imagined a college dean's would look \u2014 only Carlisle looked too young to fit the part. \"What can I do for you?\" he asked us pleasantly, rising from his seat.  \"I wanted to show Bella some of our history,\" Edward said. \"Well, your history, actually.\" \"We didn't mean to disturb you,\" I apologized. \"Not at all. Where are you going to start?\" \"The Waggoner,\" Edward replied, placing one hand lightly on my shoulder and spinning me around to look back toward the door we'd just come through. Every time he touched me, in even the most casual way, my heart had an audible reaction. It was more embarrassing with Carlisle there. The wall we faced now was different from the others. Instead of bookshelves, this wall was crowded with framed pictures of all sizes, some in vibrant colors, others dull monochromes. I searched for some logic, some binding motif the collection had in common, but I found nothing in my hasty examination. Edward pulled me toward the far left side, standing me in front of a small square oil painting in a plain wooden frame. This one did not stand out among the bigger and brighter pieces; painted in varying tones of sepia, it depicted a miniature city full of steeply slanted roofs, with thin spires atop a few scattered towers. A wide river filled the foreground, crossed by a bridge covered with structures that looked like tiny cathedrals. \"London in the sixteen-fifties,\" Edward said. \"The London of my youth,\" Carlisle added, from a few feet behind us. I flinched; I hadn't heard him approach. Edward squeezed my hand.  \"Will you tell the story?\" Edward asked. I twisted a little to see Carlisle's reaction. He met my glance and smiled. \"I would,\" he replied. \"But I'm actually running a bit late. The hospital called this morning \u2014 Dr. Snow is taking a sick day. Besides, you know the stories as well as I do,\" he added, grinning at Edward now. It was a strange combination to absorb \u2014 the everyday concerns of the town doctor stuck in the middle of a discussion of his early days in seventeenth-century London. It was also unsettling to know that he spoke aloud only for my benefit. After another warm smile for me, Carlisle left the room. I stared at the little picture of Carlisle's hometown for a long moment.  \"What happened then?\" I finally asked, staring up at Edward, who was watching me. \"When he realized what had happened to him?\" He glanced back to the paintings, and I looked to see which image caught his interest now. It was a larger landscape in dull fall colors \u2014 an empty, shadowed meadow in a forest, with a craggy peak in the distance. \"When he knew what he had become,\" Edward said quietly, \"he rebelled against it. He tried to destroy himself. But that's not easily done.\" \"How?\" I didn't mean to say it aloud, but the word broke through my shock. \"He jumped from great heights,\" Edward told me, his voice impassive. \"He tried to drown himself in the ocean\u2026 but he was young to the new life, and very strong. It is amazing that he was able to resist\u2026 feeding\u2026 while he was still so new. The instinct is more powerful then, it takes over everything. But he was so repelled by himself that he had the strength to try to kill himself with starvation.\" \"Is that possible?\u201dMy voice was faint. \"No, there are very few ways we can be killed.\" I opened my mouth to ask, but he spoke before I could. \"So he grew very hungry, and eventually weak. He strayed as far as he could from the human populace, recognizing that his willpower was weakening, too.  For months he wandered by night, seeking the loneliest places, loathing himself. \"One night, a herd of deer passed his hiding place. He was so wild with thirst that he attacked without a thought. His strength returned and he realized there was an alternative to being the vile monster he feared. Had he not eaten venison in his former life? Over the next months his new philosophy was born. He could exist without being a demon. He found himself again. \"He began to make better use of his time. He'd always been intelligent, eager to learn. Now he had unlimited time before him. He studied by night, planned by day. He swam to France and \u2014\" \"He swam to France?\" \"People swim the Channel all the time, Bella,\" he reminded me patiently. \"That's true, I guess. It just sounded funny in that context. Go on.\" \"Swimming is easy for us \u2014\" \"Everything is easy for you,\" I griped. He waited, his expression amused. \"I won't interrupt again, I promise.\" He chuckled <em>darkly</em>, and finished his sentence. \"Because, technically, we don't need to breathe.\" \"You \u2014\" \"No, no, you promised.\" He laughed, putting his cold finger lightly to my lips. \"Do you want to hear the story or not?\" \"You can't spring something like that on me, and then expect me not to say anything,\" I mumbled against his finger. He lifted his hand, moving it to rest against my neck. The speed of my heart reacted to that, but I persisted. \"You don't have to breathe?\" I demanded. \"No, it's not necessary. Just a habit.\" He shrugged. \"How long can you go\u2026 without breathing?\" \"Indefinitely, I suppose; I don't know. It gets a bit uncomfortable \u2014 being without a sense of smell.\" \"A bit uncomfortable,\" I echoed. I wasn't paying attention to my own expression, but something in it made him grow somber. His hand dropped to his side and he stood very still, his eyes intent on my face. The silence lengthened. His features were immobile as stone. \"What is it?\" I whispered, touching his frozen face. His face softened under my hand, and he sighed. \"I keep waiting for it to happen.\" \"For what to happen?\" \"I know that at some point, something I tell you or something you see is going to be too much. And then you'll run away from me, screaming as you go.\" He smiled half a smile, but his eyes were serious. \"I won't stop you. I want this to happen, because I want you to be safe. And yet, I want to be with you. The two desires are impossible to reconcile\u2026\" He trailed off, staring at my face. Waiting. \"I'm not running anywhere,\" I promised. \"We'll see,\" he said, smiling again. I frowned at him. \"So, go on \u2014 Carlisle was swimming to France.\" He paused, getting back into his story. Reflexively, his eyes flickered to another picture \u2014 the most colorful of them all, the most ornately framed, and the largest; it was twice as wide as the door it hung next to. The canvas overflowed with bright figures in swirling robes, writhing around long pillars and off marbled balconies. I couldn't tell if it represented Greek mythology, or if the characters floating in the clouds above were meant to be biblical. \"Carlisle swam to France, and continued on through Europe, to the universities there. By night he studied music, science, medicine \u2014 and found his calling, his penance, in that, in saving human lives.\" His expression became awed, almost reverent. \"I can't adequately describe the struggle; it took Carlisle two centuries of torturous effort to perfect his self-control. Now he is all but immune to the scent of human blood, and he is able to do the work he loves without agony. He finds a great deal of peace there, at the hospital\u2026\" Edward stared off into space for a long moment. Suddenly he seemed to recall his purpose. He tapped his finger against the huge painting in front of us. \"He was studying in Italy when he discovered the others there. They were much more civilized and educated than the wraiths of the London sewers.\" He touched a comparatively sedate quartet of figures painted on the highest balcony, looking down calmly on the mayhem below them. I examined the grouping carefully and realized, with a startled laugh, that I recognized the golden-haired man. \"Solimena was greatly inspired by Carlisle's friends. He often painted them as gods,\" Edward chuckled. \"Aro, Marcus, Caius,\" he said, indicating the other three, two black-haired, one snowy-white. \"Nighttime patrons of the arts.\" \"What happened to them?\" I wondered aloud, my fingertip hovering a centimeter from the figures on the canvas. \"They're still there.\" He shrugged. \"As they have been for who knows how many millennia. Carlisle stayed with them only for a short time, just a few decades. He greatly admired their civility, their refinement, but they persisted in trying to cure his aversion to 'his natural food source,' as they called it. They tried to persuade him, and he tried to persuade them, to no avail. At that point, Carlisle decided to try the New World. He dreamed of finding others like himself. He was very lonely, you see. \"He didn't find anyone for a long time. But, as monsters became the stuff of fairy tales, he found he could interact with unsuspecting humans as if he were one of them. He began practicing medicine. But the companionship he craved evaded him; he couldn't risk familiarity. \"When the influenza epidemic hit, he was working nights in a hospital in Chicago. He'd been turning over an idea in his mind for several years, and he had almost decided to act \u2014 since he couldn't find a companion, he would create one. He wasn't absolutely sure how his own transformation had occurred, so he was hesitant. And he was loath to steal anyone's life the way his had been stolen. It was in that frame of mind that he found me. There was no hope for me; I was left in a ward with the dying. He had nursed my parents, and knew I was alone. He decided to try\u2026\" His voice, nearly a whisper now, trailed off. He stared unseeingly through the west windows. I wondered which images filled his mind now, Carlisle's memories or his own. I waited quietly. When he turned back to me, a gentle angel's smile lit his expression. \"And so we've come full circle,\" he concluded. \"Have you always stayed with Carlisle, then?\" I wondered. \"Almost always.\" He put his hand lightly on my waist and pulled me with him as he walked through the door. I stared back at the wall of pictures, wondering if I would ever get to hear the other stories. Edward didn't say any more as we walked down the hall, so I asked, \"Almost?\" He sighed, seeming reluctant to answer. \"Well, I had a typical bout of rebellious adolescence \u2014 about ten years after I was\u2026 born\u2026 created, whatever you want to call it. I wasn't sold on his life of abstinence, and I resented him for curbing my appetite. So I went off on my own for a time.\" \"Really?\" I was intrigued, rather than frightened, as I perhaps should have been. He could tell. I vaguely realized that we were headed up the next flight of stairs, but I wasn't paying much attention to my surroundings. \"That doesn't repulse you?\" \"No.\" \"Why not?\" \"I guess\u2026 it sounds reasonable.\" He barked a laugh, more loudly than before. We were at the top of the stairs now, in another paneled hallway. \"From the time of my new birth,\" he murmured, \"I had the advantage of knowing what everyone around me was thinking, both human and non-human alike. That's why it took me ten years to defy Carlisle \u2014 I could read his perfect sincerity, understand exactly why he lived the way he did. \"It took me only a few years to return to Carlisle and recommit to his vision. I thought I would be exempt from the\u2026 depression\u2026 that accompanies a conscience. Because I knew the thoughts of my prey, I could pass over the innocent and pursue only the evil. If I followed a murderer down a dark alley where he stalked a young girl \u2014 if I saved her, then surely I wasn't so terrible.\" I shivered, imagining only too clearly what he described \u2014 the alley at night, the frightened girl, the dark man behind her. And Edward, Edward as he hunted, terrible and glorious as a young god, unstoppable. Would she have been grateful, that girl, or more frightened than before? \"But as time went on, I began to see the monster in my eyes. I couldn't escape the debt of so much human life taken, no matter how justified. And I went back to Carlisle and Esme. They welcomed me back like the prodigal. It was more than I deserved.\" We'd come to a stop in front of the last door in the hall. \"My room,\" he informed me, opening it and pulling me through. His room faced south, with a wall-sized window like the great room below. The whole back side of the house must be glass. His view looked down on the winding Sol Duc River, across the untouched forest to the Olympic Mountain range. The mountains were much closer than I would have believed. The western wall was completely covered with shelf after shelf of CDs. His room was better stocked than a music store. In the corner was a sophisticated-looking sound system, the kind I was afraid to touch because I'd be sure to break something. There was no bed, only a wide and inviting black leather sofa. The floor was covered with a thick golden carpet, and the walls were hung with heavy fabric in a slightly darker shade. \"Good acoustics?\" I guessed. He chuckled and nodded. He picked up a remote and turned the stereo on. It was quiet, but the soft jazz number sounded like the band was in the room with us. I went to look at his mind-boggling music collection. \"How do you have these organized?\" I asked, unable to find any rhyme or reason to the titles. He wasn't paying attention. \"Ummm, by year, and then by personal preference within that frame,\" he said absently. I turned, and he was looking at me with a peculiar expression in his eyes. \"What?\" \"I was prepared to feel\u2026 relieved. Having you know about everything, not needing to keep secrets from you. But I didn't expect to feel more than that. I like it. It makes me\u2026 happy.\" He shrugged, smiling slightly. \"I'm glad,\" I said, smiling back. I'd worried that he might regret telling me these things. It was good to know that wasn't the case. But then, as his eyes dissected my expression, his smile faded and his forehead creased. \"You're still waiting for the running and the screaming, aren't you?\" I guessed. A faint smile touched his lips, and he nodded. \"I hate to burst your bubble, but you're really not as scary as you think you are. I don't find you scary at all, actually,\" I lied casually. He stopped, raising his eyebrows in blatant disbelief. Then he flashed a wide, wicked smile. \"You really shouldn't have said that,\" he chuckled. He growled, a low sound in the back of his throat; his lips curled back over his perfect teeth. His body shifted suddenly, half-crouched, tensed like a lion about to pounce. I backed away from him, glaring. \"You wouldn't.\" \u00a0\" I didn't see him leap at me \u2014 it was much too fast. I only found myself suddenly airborne, and then we crashed onto the sofa, knocking it into the wall. All the while, his arms formed an iron cage of protection around me \u2014 I was barely jostled. But I still was gasping as I tried to right myself. He wasn't having that. He curled me into a ball against his chest, holding me more securely than iron chains. I glared at him in alarm, but he seemed well in control, his jaw relaxed as he grinned, his eyes bright only with humor. \"You were saying?\" he growled playfully. \"That you are a very, very terrifying monster,\" I said, my sarcasm marred a bit by my breathless voice. \"Much better,\" he approved. \"Um.\" I struggled. \"Can I get up now?\" He just laughed. \"Can we come in?\" a soft voice sounded from the hall. I struggled to free myself, but Edward merely readjusted me so that I was somewhat more conventionally seated on his lap. I could see it was Alice, then, and Jasper behind her in the doorway. My cheeks burned, but Edward seemed at ease. \"Go ahead.\" Edward was still chuckling quietly. Alice seemed to find nothing unusual in our embrace; she walked \u2014 almost danced, her movements were so graceful \u2014 to the center of the room, where she folded herself sinuously onto the floor. Jasper, however, paused at the door, his expression a trifle shocked. He stared at Edward's face, and I wondered if he was tasting the atmosphere with his unusual sensitivity. \"It sounded like you were having Bella for lunch, and we came to see if you would share,\" Alice announced. I stiffened for an instant, until I realized Edward was grinning \u2014 whether at her comment or my response, I couldn't tell. \"Sorry, I don't believe I have enough to spare,\" he replied, his arms holding me recklessly close. \"Actually,\" Jasper said, smiling despite himself as he walked into the room, \"Alice says there's going to be a real storm tonight, and Emmett wants to play ball. Are you game?\" The words were all common enough, but the context confused me. I gathered that Alice was a bit more reliable than the weatherman, though. Edward's eyes lit up, but he hesitated. \"Of course you should bring Bella,\" Alice chirped. I thought I saw Jasper throw a quick glance at her. \"Do you want to go?\" Edward asked me, excited, his expression vivid. \"Sure.\" I couldn't disappoint such a face. \"Um, where are we going?\" \"We have to wait for thunder to play ball \u2014 you'll see why,\" he promised. \"Will I need an umbrella?\" They all three laughed aloud. \"Will she?\" Jasper asked Alice. \"No.\" She was positive. \"The storm will hit over town. It should be dry enough in the clearing.\" \"Good, then.\" The enthusiasm in Jasper's voice was catching, naturally. I found myself eager, rather than scared stiff. \"Let's go see if Carlisle will come.\" Alice bounded up and to the door in a fashion that would break any ballerina's heart. \"Like you don't know,\" Jasper teased, and they were swiftly on their way. Jasper managed to inconspicuously close the door behind them. \"What will we be playing?\" I demanded. \"You will be watching,\" Edward clarified. \"We will be playing baseball.\" I rolled my eyes. \"Vampires like baseball?\" \"It's the American pastime,\" he said with mock solemnity.",

            "en": "9      9. THEORY \"Can I ask just one more?\" I pleaded as Edward accelerated much too quickly down the quiet street. He didn't seem to be paying any attention to the road. He sighed. \"One,\" he agreed. His lips pressed together into a cautious line. \"Well\u2026 you said you knew I hadn't gone into the bookstore, and that I had gone south. I was just wondering how you knew that.\" He looked away, deliberating. \"I thought we were past all the evasiveness,\" I grumbled. He almost smiled. \"Fine, then. I followed your scent.\" He looked at the road, giving me time to compose my face. I couldn't think of an acceptable response to that, but I filed it carefully away for future study. I tried to refocus. I wasn't ready to let him be finished, now that he was finally explaining things. \"And then you didn't answer one of my first questions\u2026\" I stalled. He looked at me with disapproval. \"Which one?\" \"How does it work \u2014 the mind-reading thing? Can you read anybody's mind, anywhere? How do you do it? Can the rest of your family\u2026 ?\" I felt silly, asking for clarification on make-believe. \"That's more than one,\" he pointed out. I simply intertwined my fingers and gazed at him, waiting. \"No, it's just me. And I can't hear anyone, anywhere. I have to be fairly close. The more familiar someone's\u2026 'voice' is, the farther away I can hear them. But still, no more than a few miles.\" He paused thoughtfully. \"It's a little like being in a huge hall filled with people, everyone talking at once. It's just a hum \u2014 a buzzing of voices in the background. Until I focus on one voice, and then what they're thinking is clear. \u00a0\"Most of the time I tune it all out \u2014 it can be very distracting. And then it's easier to seem normal\" \u2014 he frowned as he said the word \u2014 \"when I'm not accidentally answering someone's thoughts rather than their words.\" \"Why do you think you can't hear me?\" I asked curiously. He looked at me, his eyes enigmatic. \"I don't know,\" he murmured. \"The only guess I have is that maybe your mind doesn't work the same way the rest of theirs do. Like your thoughts are on the AM frequency and I'm only getting FM.\" He grinned at me, suddenly amused. \"My mind doesn't work right? I'm a freak?\" The words bothered me more than they should \u2014 probably because his speculation hit home. I'd always suspected as much, and it embarrassed me to have it confirmed. \"I hear voices in my mind and you're worried that you're the freak,\" he laughed. \"Don't worry, it's just a theory\u2026\" His face tightened. \"Which brings us back to you.\" I sighed. How to begin? \"Aren't we past all the evasions now?\" he reminded me softly. I looked away from his face for the first time, trying to find words. I happened to notice the speedometer. \"Holy crow!\" I shouted. \"Slow down!\" \"What's wrong?\" He was startled. But the car didn't decelerate. \"You're going a hundred miles an hour!\" I was still shouting. I shot a panicky glance out the window, but it was too dark to see much. The road was only visible in the long patch of bluish brightness from the headlights. The forest along both sides of the road was like a black wall \u2014 as hard as a wall of steel if we veered off the road at this speed. \"Relax, Bella.\" He rolled his eyes, still not slowing. \"Are you trying to kill us?\" I demanded. \"We're not going to crash.\" I tried to modulate my voice. \"Why are you in such a hurry?\" \"I always drive like this.\" He turned to smile crookedly at me. \"Keep your eyes on the road!\" \"I've never been in an accident, Bella \u2014 I've never even gotten a ticket.\" He grinned and tapped his forehead. \"Built-in radar detector.\" \"Very funny.\" I fumed. \"Charlie's a cop, remember? I was raised to abide by traffic laws. Besides, if you turn us into a Volvo pretzel around a tree trunk, you can probably just walk away.\" \"Probably,\" he agreed with a short, hard laugh. \"But you can't.\" He sighed, and I watched with relief as the needle gradually drifted toward eighty. \"Happy?\" \"Almost.\" \"I hate driving slow,\" he muttered. \"This is slow?\" \"Enough commentary on my driving,\" he snapped. \"I'm still waiting for your latest theory.\" I bit my lip. He looked down at me, his honey eyes unexpectedly gentle. \"I won't laugh,\" he promised. \"I'm more afraid that you'll be angry with me.\" \"Is it that bad?\" \"Pretty much, yeah.\" He waited. I was looking down at my hands, so I couldn't see his expression. \"Go ahead.\" His voice was calm. \"I don't know how to start,\" I admitted. \"Why don't you start at the beginning\u2026 you said you didn't come up with this on your own.\" \"No.\" \"What got you started \u2014 a book? A movie?\" he probed. \"No \u2014 it was Saturday, at the beach.\" I risked a glance up at his face. He looked puzzled. \"I ran into an old family friend \u2014Jacob Black,\" I continued. \"His dad and Charlie have been friends since I was a baby.\" He still looked confused. \"His dad is one of the Quileute elders.\" I watched him carefully. His confused expression froze in place. \"We went for a walk \u2014\" I edited all my scheming out of the story \"\u2014 and he was telling me some old legends \u2014 trying to scare me, I think. He told me one\u2026\" I hesitated. \"Go on,\" he said. \"About vampires.\" I realized I was whispering. I couldn't look at his face now. But I saw his knuckles tighten convulsively on the wheel. \"And you immediately thought of me?\" Still calm. \"No. He\u2026 mentioned your family.\" He was silent, staring at the road. I was worried suddenly, worried about protecting Jacob. \"He just thought it was a silly superstition,\" I said quickly. \"He didn't expect me to think anything of it.\" It didn't seem like enough; I had to confess. \"It was my fault, I forced him to tell me.\" \"Why?\" \"Lauren said something about you \u2014 she was trying to provoke me. And an older boy from the tribe said your family didn't come to the reservation, only it sounded like he meant something different. So I got Jacob alone and I tricked it out of him,\" I admitted, hanging my head.  He startled me by laughing. I glared up at him. He was laughing, but his eyes were fierce, staring ahead. \"Tricked him how?\" he asked. \"I tried to flirt \u2014 it worked better than I thought it would.\" Disbelief colored my tone as I remembered. \"I'd like to have seen that.\" He chuckled <em>darkly</em>. \"And you accused me of dazzling people \u2014 poor Jacob Black.\" I blushed and looked out my window into the night. \"What did you do then?\" he asked after a minute. \"I did some research on the Internet.\" \"And did that convince you?\" His voice sounded barely interested. But his hands were clamped hard onto the steering wheel. \"No. Nothing fit. Most of it was kind of silly. And then\u2026\" I stopped. \"What?\" \"I decided it didn't matter,\" I whispered. \"It didn't matter?\" His tone made me look up \u2014 I had finally broken through his carefully composed mask. His face was incredulous, with just a hint of the anger I'd feared. \"No,\" I said softly. \"It doesn't matter to me what you are.\" A hard, mocking edge entered his voice. \"You don't care if I'm a monster? If I'm not human!\" \"No.\" He was silent, staring straight ahead again. His face was bleak and cold. \"You're angry,\" I sighed. \"I shouldn't have said anything.\" \"No,\" he said, but his tone was as hard as his face. \"I'd rather know what you're thinking \u2014 even if what you're thinking is insane.\" \"So I'm wrong again?\" I challenged. \"That's not what I was referring to. 'It doesn't matter'!\" he quoted, gritting his teeth together.  \"I'm right?\" I gasped. \"Does it matter?\" I took a deep breath. \"Not really.\" I paused. \"But I am curious.\" My voice, at least, was composed. He was suddenly resigned. \"What are you curious about?\" \"How old are you?\" \"Seventeen,\" he answered promptly. \"And how long have you been seventeen?\" His lips twitched as he stared at the road. \"A while,\" he admitted at last. \"Okay.\" I smiled, pleased that he was still being honest with me. He stared down at me with watchful eyes, much as he had before, when he was worried I would go into shock. I smiled wider in encouragement, and he frowned. \"Don't laugh \u2014 but how can you come out during the daytime?\" He laughed anyway. \"Myth.\" \"Burned by the sun?\" \"Myth.\" \"Sleeping in coffins?\" \"Myth.\" He hesitated for a moment, and a peculiar tone entered his voice. \"I can't sleep.\" It took me a minute to absorb that. \"At all?\" \"Never,\" he said, his voice nearly inaudible. He turned to look at me with a wistful expression. The golden eyes held mine, and I lost my train of thought. I stared at him until he looked away. \"You haven't asked me the most important question yet.\" His voice was hard now, and when he looked at me again his eyes were cold. I blinked, still dazed. \"Which one is that?\" \"You aren't concerned about my diet?\" he asked sarcastically. \"Oh,\" I murmured, \"that.\" \"Yes, that.\" His voice was bleak. \"Don't you want to know if I drink blood?\" I flinched. \"Well, Jacob said something about that.\" \"What did Jacob say?\" he asked flatly. \"He said you didn't\u2026 hunt people. He said your family wasn't supposed to be dangerous because you only hunted animals.\" \"He said we weren't dangerous?\" His voice was deeply skeptical. \"Not exactly. He said you weren't supposed to be dangerous. But the Quileutes still didn't want you on their land, just in case.\" He looked forward, but I couldn't tell if he was watching the road or not. \"So was he right? About not hunting people?\" I tried to keep my voice as even as possible. \"The Quileutes have a long memory,\" he whispered. I took it as a confirmation. \"Don't let that make you complacent, though,\" he warned me. \"They're right to keep their distance from us. We are still dangerous.\" \"I don't understand.\" \"We try,\" he explained slowly. \"We're usually very good at what we do. Sometimes we make mistakes. Me, for example, allowing myself to be alone with you.\" \"This is a mistake?\" I heard the sadness in my voice, but I didn't know if he could as well. \"A very dangerous one,\" he murmured. We were both silent then. I watched the headlights twist with the curves of the road. They moved too fast; it didn't look real, it looked like a video game. I was aware of the time slipping away so quickly, like the black road beneath us, and I was hideously afraid that I would never have another chance to be with him like this again \u2014 openly, the walls between us gone for once. His words hinted at an end, and I recoiled from the idea. I couldn't waste one minute I had with him. \"Tell me more,\" I asked desperately, not caring what he said, just so I could hear his voice again. He looked at me quickly, startled by the change in my tone. \"What more do you want to know?\" \"Tell me why you hunt animals instead of people,\" I suggested, my voice still tinged with desperation. I realized my eyes were wet, and I fought against the grief that was trying to overpower me. \"I don't want to be a monster.\" His voice was very low. \"But animals aren't enough?\" He paused. \"I can't be sure, of course, but I'd compare it to living on tofu and soy milk; we call ourselves vegetarians, our little inside joke. It doesn't completely satiate the hunger \u2014 or rather thirst. But it keens us strong enough to resist. Most of the time.\" His tone turned ominous. \"Sometimes it's more difficult than others.\" \"Is it very difficult for you now?\" I asked. He sighed. \"Yes.\" \"But you're not hungry now,\" I said confidently \u2014 stating, not asking. \"Why do you think that?\" \"Your eyes. I told you I had a theory. I've noticed that people \u2014 men in particular \u2014 are crabbier when they're hungry.\" He chuckled. \"You are observant, aren't you?\" I didn't answer; I just listened to the sound of his laugh, committing it to memory. \"Were you hunting this weekend, with Emmett?\" I asked when it was quiet again. \"Yes.\" He paused for a second, as if deciding whether or not to say something. \"I didn't want to leave, but it was necessary. It's a bit easier to be around you when I'm not thirsty.\" \"Why didn't you want to leave?\" \"It makes me\u2026 anxious\u2026 to be away from you.\" His eyes were gentle but intense, and they seemed to be making my bones turn soft. \"I wasn't joking when I asked you to try not to fall in the ocean or get run over last Thursday. I was distracted all weekend, worrying about you. And after what happened tonight, I'm surprised that you did make it through a whole weekend unscathed.\" He shook his head, and then seemed to remember something. \"Well, not totally unscathed.\" \"What?\" \"Your hands,\" he reminded me. I looked down at my palms, at the almost-healed scrapes across the heels of my hands. His eyes missed nothing. \"I fell,\" I sighed. \"That's what I thought.\" His lips curved up at the corners. \"I suppose, being you, it could have been much worse \u2014 and that possibility tormented me the entire time I was away. It was a very long three days. I really got on Emmett's nerves.\" He smiled ruefully at me. \"Three days? Didn't you just get back today?\" \"No, we got back Sunday.\" \"Then why weren't any of you in school?\" I was frustrated, almost angry as I thought of how much disappointment I had suffered because of his absence. \"Well, you asked if the sun hurt me, and it doesn't. But I can't go out in the sunlight \u2014 at least, not where anyone can see.\" \"Why?\" \"I'll show you sometime,\" he promised.  I thought about it for a moment. \"You might have called me,\" I decided. He was puzzled. \"But I knew you were safe.\" \"But I didn't know where you were. I \u2014\" I hesitated, dropping my eyes. \"What?\" His velvety voice was compelling. \"I didn't like it. Not seeing you. It makes me anxious, too.\" I blushed to be saying this out loud. He was quiet. I glanced up, apprehensive, and saw that his expression was pained. \"Ah,\" he groaned quietly. \"This is wrong.\" I couldn't understand his response. \"What did I say?\" \"Don't you see, Bella? It's one thing for me to make myself miserable, but a wholly other thing for you to be so involved.\" He turned his anguished eyes to the road, his words flowing almost too fast for me to understand. \"I don't want to hear that you feel that way.\" His voice was low but urgent. His words cut me. \"It's wrong. It's not safe. I'm dangerous, Bella \u2014 please, grasp that.\" \" No.\" I tried very hard not to look like a sulky child. \"I'm serious,\" he growled. \"So am I. I told you, it doesn't matter what you are. It's too late.\" His voice whipped out, low and harsh. \"Never say that.\" I bit my lip and was glad he couldn't know how much that hurt. I stared out at the road. We must be close now. He was driving much too fast.  \"What are you thinking?\" he asked, his voice still raw. I just shook my head, not sure if I could speak. I could feel his gaze on my face, but I kept my eyes forward. \"Are you crying?\" He sounded appalled. I hadn't realized the moisture in my eyes had brimmed over. I quickly rubbed my hand across my cheek, and sure enough, traitor tears were there, betraying me.  \"No,\" I said, but my voice cracked. I saw him reach toward me hesitantly with his right hand, but then he stopped and placed it slowly back on the steering wheel. \"I'm sorry.\" His voice burned with regret. I knew he wasn't just apologizing for the words that had upset me. The darkness slipped by us in silence. \"Tell me something,\" he asked after another minute, and I could hear him struggle to use a lighter tone. \"Yes?\" \"What were you thinking tonight, just before I came around the corner? I couldn't understand your expression \u2014 you didn't look that scared, you looked like you were concentrating very hard on something.\" \"I was trying to remember how to incapacitate an attacker \u2014 you know, self-defense. I was going to smash his nose into his brain.\" I thought of the dark-haired man with a surge of hate. \"You were going to fight them?\" This upset him. \"Didn't you think about running?\" \"I fall down a lot when I run,\" I admitted. \"What about screaming for help?\" \"I was getting to that part.\" He shook his head. \"You were right \u2014 I'm definitely fighting fate trying to keep you alive.\" I sighed. We were slowing, passing into the boundaries of Forks. It had taken less than twenty minutes. \"Will I see you tomorrow?\" I demanded. \"Yes \u2014 I have a paper due, too.\" He smiled. \"I'll save you a seat at lunch.\" It was silly, after everything we'd been through tonight, how that little promise sent flutters through my stomach, and made me unable to speak. We were in front of Charlie's house. The lights were on, my truck in its place, everything utterly normal. It was like waking from a dream. He stopped the car, but I didn't move. \"Do you promise to be there tomorrow?\" \"I promise.\" I considered that for a moment, then nodded. I pulled his jacket off, taking one last whiff. \"You can keep it \u2014 you don't have a jacket for tomorrow,\" he reminded me. I handed it back to him. \"I don't want to have to explain to Charlie.\" \"Oh, right.\" He grinned. I hesitated, my hand on the door handle, trying to prolong the moment. \"Bella?\" he asked in a different tone \u2014 serious, but hesitant. \"Yes?\" I turned back to him too eagerly. \"Will you promise me something?\" \"Yes,\" I said, and instantly regretted my unconditional agreement. What if he asked me to stay away from him? I couldn't keep that promise. \"Don't go into the woods alone.\" I stared at him in blank confusion. \"Why?\" He frowned, and his eyes were tight as he stared past me out the window. \"I'm not always the most dangerous thing out there. Let's leave it at that.\" I shuddered slightly at the sudden bleakness in his voice, but I was relieved. This, at least, was an easy promise to honor. \"Whatever you say.\" \"I'll see you tomorrow,\" he sighed, and I knew he wanted me to leave now. \"Tomorrow, then.\" I opened the door unwillingly. \"Bella?\" I turned and he was leaning toward me, his pale, glorious face just inches from mine. My heart stopped beating. \"Sleep well,\" he said. His breath blew in my face, stunning me. It was the same exquisite scent that clung to his jacket, but in a more concentrated form. I blinked, thoroughly dazed. He leaned away. I was unable to move until my brain had somewhat unscrambled itself. Then I stepped out of the car awkwardly, having to use the frame for support. I thought I heard him chuckle, but the sound was too quiet for me to be certain. He waited till I had stumbled to the front door, and then I heard his engine quietly rev. I turned to watch the silver car disappear around the corner. I realized it was very cold. I reached for the key mechanically, unlocked the door, and stepped inside. Charlie called from the living room. \"Bella?\" \"Yeah, Dad, it's me.\" I walked in to see him. He was watching a baseball game. \"You're home early.\" \"Am I?\" I was surprised. \"It's not even eight yet,\" he told me. \"Did you girls have fun?\" \"Yeah \u2014 it was lots of fun.\" My head was spinning as I tried to remember all the way back to the girls' night out I had planned. \"They both found dresses.\" \"Are you all right?\" \"I'm just tired. I did a lot of walking.\" \"Well, maybe you should go lie down.\" He sounded concerned. I wondered what my face looked like. \"I'm just going to call Jessica first.\" \"Weren't you just with her?\" he asked, surprised. \"Yes \u2014 but I left my jacket in her car. I want to make sure she brings it tomorrow.\" \"Well, give her a chance to get home first.\" \"Right,\" I agreed. I went to the kitchen and fell, exhausted, into a chair. I was really feeling dizzy now. I wondered if I was going to go into shock after all. Get a grip, I told myself. The phone rang suddenly, startling me. I yanked it off the hook. \"Hello?\" I asked breathlessly. \"Bella?\" \"Hey, Jess, I was just going to call you.\" \"You made it home?\" Her voice was relieved\u2026 and surprised. \"Yes. I left my jacket in your car \u2014 could you bring it to me tomorrow?\" \"Sure. But tell me what happened!\" she demanded. \"Um, tomorrow \u2014 in Trig, okay?\" She caught on quickly. \"Oh, is your dad there?\" \"Yes, that's right.\" \"Okay, I'll talk to you tomorrow, then. Bye!\" I could hear the impatience in her voice. \"Bye, Jess.\" I walked up the stairs slowly, a heavy stupor clouding my mind. I went through the motions of getting ready for bed without paying any attention to what I was doing. It wasn't until I was in the shower \u2014 the water too hot, burning my skin \u2014 that I realized I was freezing. I shuddered violently for several minutes before the steaming spray could finally relax my rigid muscles. Then I stood in the shower, too tired to move, until the hot water began to run out. I stumbled out, wrapping myself securely in a towel, trying to hold the heat from the water in so the aching shivers wouldn't return. I dressed for bed swiftly and climbed under my quilt, curling into a ball, hugging myself to keep warm. A few small shudders trembled through me. My mind still swirled dizzily, full of images I couldn't understand, and some I fought to repress. Nothing seemed clear at first, but as I fell gradually closer to unconsciousness, a few certainties became evident. About three things I was absolutely positive. First, Edward was a vampire. Second, there was part of him \u2014 and I didn't know how potent that part might be \u2014 that thirsted for my blood. And third, I was unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him.",

            "en": "EPILOGUE:AN OCCASION        EPILOGUE:AN OCCASION Edward helped me into his car, being very careful of the wisps of silk and chiffon, the flowers he'd just pinned into my elaborately styled curls, and my bulky walking cast. He ignored the angry set of my mouth. When he had me settled, he got in the driver's seat and headed back out the long, narrow drive. \"At what point exactly are you going to tell me what's going on?\" I asked grumpily. I really hated surprises. And he knew that. I'm shocked that you haven't figured it out yet.\" He threw a mocking smile in my direction, and my breath caught in my throat. Would I ever get used to his perfection? \"I did mention that you looked very nice, didn't I?\" I verified. \"Yes.\" He grinned again. I'd never seen him dress in black before, and, with the contrast against his pale skin, his beauty was absolutely surreal. That much I couldn't deny, even if the fact that he was wearing a tuxedo made me very nervous. Not quite as nervous as the dress. Or the shoe. Only one shoe, as my other foot was still securely encased in plaster. But the stiletto heel, held on only by satin ribbons, certainly wasn't going to help me as I tried to hobble around. \"I'm not coming over anymore if Alice is going to treat me like Guinea Pig Barbie when I do,\" I griped. I'd spent the better part of the day in Alice's staggeringly vast bathroom, a helpless victim as she played hairdresser and cosmetician. Whenever I fidgeted or complained, she reminded me that she didn't have any memories of being human, and asked me not to ruin her vicarious fun. Then she'd dressed me in the most ridiculous dress \u2014 deep blue, frilly and off the shoulders, with French tags I couldn't read \u2014 a dress more suitable for a runway than Forks. Nothing good could come of our formal attire, of that I was sure. Unless\u2026 but I was afraid to put my suspicions into words, even in my own head.  I was distracted then by the sound of a phone ringing. Edward pulled his cell phone from a pocket inside his jacket, looking briefly at the caller ID before answering. \"Hello, Charlie,\" he said warily. \"Charlie?\" I frowned. Charlie had been\u2026 difficult since my return to Forks. He had compartmentalized my bad experience into two defined reactions. Toward Carlisle he was almost worshipfully grateful. On the other hand, he was stubbornly convinced that Edward was at fault \u2014 because, if not for him, I wouldn't have left home in the first place. And Edward was far from disagreeing with him. These days I had rules that hadn't existed before: curfews\u2026 visiting hours. Something Charlie was saying made Edward's eyes widen in disbelief, and then a grin spread across his face. \"You're kidding!\" He laughed. \"What is it?\" I demanded. He ignored me. \"Why don't you let me talk to him?\" Edward suggested with evident pleasure. He waited for a few seconds. \"Hello, Tyler, this is Edward Cullen.\" His voice was very friendly, on the surface. I knew it well enough to catch the soft edge of menace. What was Tyler doing at my house? The awful truth began to dawn on me. I looked again at the inappropriate dress Alice had forced me into. \"I'm sorry if there's been some kind of miscommunication, but Bella is unavailable tonight.\" Edward's tone changed, and the threat in his voice was suddenly much more evident as he continued. \"To be perfectly honest, she'll be unavailable every night, as far as anyone besides myself is concerned. No offense. And I'm sorry about your evening.\" He didn't sound sorry at all. And then he snapped the phone shut, a huge smirk on his face. My face and neck flushed crimson with anger. I could feel the rage-induced tears starting to fill my eyes. He looked at me in surprise. \"Was that last part a bit too much? I didn't mean to offend you.\" I ignored that.  \"You're taking me to the prom!\" I yelled. It was embarrassingly obvious now. If I'd been paying any attention at all, I'm sure I would have noticed the date on the posters that decorated the school buildings. But I'd never dreamed he was thinking of subjecting me to this. Didn't he know me at all? He wasn't expecting the force of my reaction, that was clear. He pressed his lips together and his eyes narrowed. \"Don't be difficult, Bella.\" My eyes flashed to the window; we were halfway to the school already. \"Why are you doing this to me?\" I demanded in horror. He gestured to his tuxedo. \"Honestly, Bella, what did you think we were doing?\" I was mortified. First, because I'd missed the obvious. And also because the vague suspicions \u2014 expectations, really \u2014 that I'd been forming all day, as Alice tried to transform me into a beauty queen, were so far wide of the mark. My half-fearful hopes seemed very silly now. I'd guessed there was some kind of occasion brewing. But prom! That was the furthest thing from my mind. The angry tears rolled over my cheeks. I remembered with dismay that I was very uncharacteristically wearing mascara. I wiped quickly under my eyes to prevent any smudges. My hand was unblackened when I pulled it away; maybe Alice had known I would need waterproof makeup. \"This is completely ridiculous. Why are you crying?\" he demanded in frustration. \"Because I'm mad!\" \"Bella.\" He turned the full force of his scorching golden eyes on me. \"What?\" I muttered, distracted. \"Humor me,\" he insisted. His eyes were melting all my fury. It was impossible to fight with him when he cheated like that. I gave in with poor grace. \"Fine,\" I pouted, unable to glare as effectively as I would have liked. \"I'll go quietly. But you'll see. I'm way overdue for more bad luck. I'll probably break my other leg. Look at this shoe! It's a death trap!\" I held out my good leg as evidence. \"Hmmm.\" He stared at my leg longer than was necessary. \"Remind me to thank Alice for that tonight.\" \"Alice is going to be there?\" That comforted me slightly. \"With Jasper, and Emmett\u2026 and Rosalie,\" he admitted. The feeling of comfort disappeared. There had been no progress with Rosalie, though I was on quite good terms with her sometimes-husband. Emmett enjoyed having me around \u2014 he thought my bizarre human reactions were hilarious\u2026 or maybe it was just the fact that I fell down a lot that he found so funny. Rosalie acted as if I didn't exist. While I shook my head to dispel the direction my thoughts had taken, I thought of something else. \"Is Charlie in on this?\" I asked, suddenly suspicious. \"Of course.\" He grinned, and then chuckled. \"Apparently Tyler wasn't, though.\" I gritted my teeth. How Tyler could be so delusional, I couldn't imagine. At school, where Charlie couldn't interfere, Edward and I were inseparable \u2014 except for those rare sunny days. We were at the school now; Rosalie's red convertible was conspicuous in the parking lot. The clouds were thin today, a few streaks of sunlight escaping through far away in the west. He got out and walked around the car to open my door. He held out his hand. I sat stubbornly in my seat, arms folded, feeling a secret twinge of smugness. The lot was crowded with people in formal dress: witnesses. He couldn't remove me forcibly from the car as he might have if we'd been alone. He sighed. \"When someone wants to kill you, you're brave as a lion \u2014 and then when someone mentions dancing\u2026\" He shook his head. I gulped. Dancing. \"Bella, I won't let anything hurt you \u2014 not even yourself. I won't let go of you once, I promise.\" I thought about that and suddenly felt much better. He could see that in my face. \"There, now,\" he said gently, \"it won't be so bad.\" He leaned down and wrapped one arm around my waist. I took his other hand and let him lift me from the car. He kept his arm tightly around me, supporting me as I limped toward the school. In Phoenix, they held proms in hotel ballrooms. This dance was in the gym, of course. It was probably the only room in town big enough for a dance. When we got inside, I giggled. There were actual balloon arches and twisted garlands of pastel crepe paper festooning the walls. \"This looks like a horror movie waiting to happen,\" I snickered. \"Well,\" he muttered as we slowly approached the ticket table \u2014 he was carrying most of my weight, but I still had to shuffle and wobble my feet forward \u2014 \"there are more than enough vampires present.\" I looked at the dance floor; a wide gap had formed in the center of the floor, where two couples whirled gracefully. The other dancers pressed to the sides of the room to give them space \u2014 no one wanted to stand in contrast with such radiance. Emmett and Jasper were intimidating and flawless in classic tuxedos. Alice was striking in a black satin dress with geometric cutouts that bared large triangles of her snowy white skin. And Rosalie was\u2026 well, Rosalie. She was beyond belief. Her vivid scarlet dress was backless, tight to her calves where it flared into a wide ruffled train, with a neckline that plunged to her waist. I pitied every girl in the room, myself included. \"Do you want me to bolt the doors so you can massacre the unsuspecting townsfolk?\" I whispered conspiratorially. \"And where do you fit into that scheme?\" He glared. \"Oh, I'm with the vampires, of course.\" He smiled reluctantly. \"Anything to get out of dancing.\" \"Anything.\" He bought our tickets, then turned me toward the dance floor. I cringed against his arm and dragged my feet. \"I've got all night,\" he warned. Eventually he towed me out to where his family was twirling elegantly \u2014 if in a style totally unsuitable to the present time and music. I watched in horror. \"Edward.\" My throat was so dry I could only manage a whisper. \"I honestly can't dance!\" I could feel the panic bubbling up inside my chest. \"Don't worry, silly,\" he whispered back. \"I can.\" He put my arms around his neck and lifted me to slide his feet under mine. And then we were whirling, too. \"I feel like I'm five years old,\" I laughed after a few minutes of effortless waltzing. \"You don't look five,\" he murmured, pulling me closer for a second, so that my feet were briefly a foot from the ground. Alice caught my eye on a turn and smiled in encouragement \u2014 I smiled back. I was surprised to realize that I was actually enjoying myself\u2026 a little. \"Okay, this isn't half bad,\" I admitted. But Edward was staring toward the doors, and his face was angry. \"What is it?\" I wondered aloud. I followed his gaze, disoriented by the spinning, but finally I could see what was bothering him. Jacob Black, not in a tux, but in a long-sleeved white shirt and tie, his hair smoothed back into his usual ponytail, was crossing the floor toward us. After the first shock of recognition, I couldn't help but feel bad for Jacob. He was clearly uncomfortable \u2014 excruciatingly so. His face was apologetic as his eyes met mine. Edward snarled very quietly. \"Behave!\" I hissed. Edward's voice was scathing. \"He wants to chat with you.\" Jacob reached us then, the embarrassment and apology even more evident on his face. \"Hey, Bella, I was hoping you would be here.\" Jacob sounded like he'd been hoping the exact opposite. But his smile was just as warm as ever.  \"Hi, Jacob.\" I smiled back. \"What's up?\" \"Can I cut in?\" he asked tentatively, glancing at Edward for the first time. I was shocked to notice that Jacob didn't have to look up. He must have grown half a foot since the first time I'd seen him. Edward's face was composed, his expression blank. His only answer was to set me carefully on my feet, and take a step back. \"Thanks,\" Jacob said amiably. Edward just nodded, looking at me intently before he turned to walk away. Jacob put his hands on my waist, and I reached up to put my hands on his shoulders. \"Wow, Jake, how tall are you now?\" He was smug. \"Six-two.\" We weren't really dancing \u2014 my leg made that impossible. Instead we swayed awkwardly from side to side without moving our feet. It was just as well; the recent growth spurt had left him looking gangly and uncoordinated, he was probably no better a dancer than I was. \"So, how did you end up here tonight?\" I asked without true curiosity. Considering Edward's reaction, I could guess. \"Can you believe my dad paid me twenty bucks to come to your prom?\" he admitted, slightly ashamed. \"Yes, I can,\" I muttered. \"Well, I hope you're enjoying yourself, at least. Seen anything you like?\" I teased, nodding toward a group of girls lined up against the wall like pastel confections. \"Yeah,\" he sighed. \"But she's taken.\" He glanced down to meet my curious gaze for just a second \u2014 then we both looked away, embarrassed. \"You look really pretty, by the way,\" he added shyly. \"Um, thanks. So why did Billy pay you to come here?\" I asked quickly, though I knew the answer. Jacob didn't seem grateful for the subject change; he looked away, uncomfortable again. \"He said it was a 'safe' place to talk to you. I swear the old man is losing his mind.\" I joined in his laughter weakly. \"Anyway, he said that if I told you something, he would get me that master cylinder I need,\" he confessed with a sheepish grin. \"Tell me, then. I want you to get your car finished.\" I grinned back. At least Jacob didn't believe any of this. It made the situation a bit easier. Against the wall, Edward was watching my face, his own face expressionless. I saw a sophomore in a pink dress eyeing him with timid speculation, but he didn't seem to be aware of her. Jacob looked away again, ashamed. \"Don't get mad, okay?\" \"There's no way I'll be mad at you, Jacob,\" I assured him. \"I won't even be mad at Billy. Just say what you have to.\" \"Well \u2014 this is so stupid, I'm sorry, Bella \u2014 he wants you to break up with your boyfriend. He asked me to tell you 'please.'\" He shook his head in disgust. \"He's still superstitious, eh?\" \"Yeah. He was\u2026 kind of over the top when you got hurt down in Phoenix. He didn't believe\u2026\"Jacob trailed off self-consciously. My eyes narrowed. \"I fell.\" \"I know that,\" Jacob said quickly. \"He thinks Edward had something to do with me getting hurt.\" It wasn't a question, and despite my promise, I was angry.  Jacob wouldn't meet my eyes. We weren't even bothering to sway to the music, though his hands were still on my waist, and mine around his neck. \"Look, Jacob, I know Billy probably won't believe this, but just so you know\" \u2014 he looked at me now, responding to the new earnestness in my voice \u2014 \"Edward really did save my life. If it weren't for Edward and his father, I'd be dead.\" \"I know,\" he claimed, but he sounded like my sincere words had affected him some. Maybe he'd be able to convince Billy of this much, at least. \"Hey, I'm sorry you had to come do this, Jacob,\" I apologized. \"At any rate, you get your parts, right?\" \"Yeah,\" he muttered. He was still looking awkward\u2026 upset. \"There's more?\" I asked in disbelief. \"Forget it,\" he mumbled, \"I'll get a job and save the money myself.\" I glared at him until he met my gaze. \"Just spit it out, Jacob.\" \"It's so bad.\" \"I don't care. Tell me,\" I insisted. \"Okay\u2026 but, geez, this sounds bad.\" He shook his head. \"He said to tell you, no, to warn you, that \u2014 and this is his plural, not mine\" \u2014 he lifted one hand from my waist and made little quotations marks in the air \u2014 '\"We'll be watching.'\" He watched warily for my reaction. It sounded like something from a mafia movie. I laughed out loud. \"Sorry you had to do this, Jake,\" I snickered. \"I don't mind that much.\" He grinned in relief. His eyes were appraising as they raked quickly over my dress. \"So, should I tell him you said to butt the hell out?\" he asked hopefully. \"No,\" I sighed. \"Tell him I said thanks. I know he means well.\" The song ended, and I dropped my arms. His hands hesitated at my waist, and he glanced at my bum leg. \"Do you want to dance again? Or can I help you get somewhere?\" Edward answered for me. \"That's all right, Jacob. I'll take it from here.\" Jacob flinched, and stared wide-eyed at Edward, who stood just beside us. \"Hey, I didn't see you there,\" he mumbled. \"I guess I'll see you around, Bella.\" He stepped back, waving halfheartedly. I smiled. \"Yeah, I'll see you later.\" \"Sorry,\" he said again before he turned for the door. Edward's arms wound around me as the next song started. It was a little up-tempo for slow dancing, but that didn't seem to concern him. I leaned my head against his chest, content. \"Feeling better?\" I teased. \"Not really,\" he said tersely. \"Don't be mad at Billy,\" I sighed. \"He just worries about me for Charlie's sake. It's nothing personal.\" \"I'm not mad at Billy,\" he corrected in a clipped voice. \"But his son is irritating me.\" I pulled back to look at him. His face was very serious. \"Why?\" \"First of all, he made me break my promise.\" I stared at him in confusion. He half-smiled. \"I promised I wouldn't let go of you tonight,\" he explained. \"Oh. Well, I forgive you.\" \"Thanks. But there's something else.\" Edward frowned. I waited patiently. \"He called you pretty,\" he finally continued, his frown deepening. \"That's practically an insult, the way you look right now. You're much more than beautiful.\" I laughed. \"You might be a little biased.\" \"I don't think that's it. Besides, I have excellent eyesight.\" We were twirling again, my feet on his as he held me close. \"So are you going to explain the reason for all of this?\" I wondered. He looked down at me, confused, and I glared meaningfully at the crepe paper. He considered for a moment, and then changed direction, spinning me through the crowd to the back door of the gym. I caught a glimpse of Jessica and Mike dancing, staring at me curiously. Jessica waved, and I smiled back quickly. Angela was there, too, looking blissfully happy in the arms of little Ben Cheney; she didn't look up from his eyes, a head lower than hers. Lee and Samantha, Lauren, glaring toward us, with Conner; I could name every face that spiraled past me. And then we were outdoors, in the cool, dim light of a fading sunset. As soon as we were alone, he swung me up into his arms, and carried me across the dark grounds till he reached the bench beneath the shadow of the madrone trees. He sat there, keeping me cradled against his chest. The moon was already up, visible through the gauzy clouds, and his face glowed pale in the white light. His mouth was hard, his eyes troubled. \"The point?\" I prompted softly. He ignored me, staring up at the moon. \"Twilight, again,\" he murmured. \"Another ending. No matter how perfect the day is, it always has to end.\" \"Some things don't have to end,\" I muttered through my teeth, instantly tense. He sighed. \"I brought you to the prom,\" he said slowly, finally answering my question, \"because I don't want you to miss anything. I don't want my presence to take anything away from you, if I can help it. I want you to be human. I want your life to continue as it would have if I'd died in nineteen-eighteen like I should have.\" I shuddered at his words, and then shook my head angrily. \"In what strange parallel dimension would I ever have gone to prom of my own free will? If you weren't a thousand times stronger than me, I would never have let you get away with this.\" He smiled briefly, but it didn't touch his eyes. \"It wasn't so bad, you said so yourself.\" \"That's because I was with you.\" We were quiet for a minute; he stared at the moon and I stared at him. I wished there was some way to explain how very uninterested I was in a normal human life. \"Will you tell me something?\" he asked, glancing down at me with a slight smile. \"Don't I always?\" \"Just promise you'll tell me,\" he insisted, grinning. I knew I was going to regret this almost instantly. \"Fine.\" \"You seemed honestly surprised when you figured out that I was taking you here,\" he began. \"I was,\" I interjected. \"Exactly,\" he agreed. \"But you must have had some other theory\u2026 I'm curious \u2014 what did you think I was dressing you up for?\" Yes, instant regret. I pursed my lips, hesitating. \"I don't want to tell you.\" \"You promised,\" he objected. \"I know.\" \"What's the problem?\" I knew he thought it was mere embarrassment holding me back. \"I think it will make you mad \u2014 or sad.\"  His brows pulled together over his eyes as he thought that through. \"I still want to know. Please?\" I sighed. He waited. \"Well\u2026 I assumed it was some kind of\u2026 occasion. But I didn't think it would be some trite human thing\u2026 prom!\" I scoffed. \"Human?\" he asked flatly. He'd picked up on the key word. I looked down at my dress, fidgeting with a stray piece of chiffon. He waited in silence. \"Okay,\" I confessed in a rush. \"So I was hoping that you might have changed your mind\u2026 that you were going to change me, after all.\" A dozen emotions played across his face. Some I recognized: anger\u2026 pain\u2026 and then he seemed to collect himself and his expression became amused. \"You thought that would be a black tie occasion, did you?\" he teased, touching the lapel of his tuxedo jacket. I scowled to hide my embarrassment. \"I don't know how these things work. To me, at least, it seems more rational than prom does.\" He was still grinning. \"It's not funny,\" I said. \"No, you're right, it's not,\" he agreed, his smile fading. \"I'd rather treat it like a joke, though, than believe you're serious.\" \"But I am serious.\" He sighed deeply. \"I know. And you're really that willing?\" The pain was back in his eyes. I bit my lip and nodded. \"So ready for this to be the end,\" he murmured, almost to himself, \"for this to be the twilight of your life, though your life has barely started. You're ready to give up everything.\" \"It's not the end, it's the beginning,\" I disagreed under my breath. \"I'm not worth it,\" he said sadly. \"Do you remember when you told me that I didn't see myself very clearly?\" I asked, raising my eyebrows. \"You obviously have the same blindness.\" \"I know what I am.\" I sighed. But his mercurial mood shifted on me. He pursed his lips, and his eyes were probing. He examined my face for a long moment.  \"You're ready now, then?\" he asked. \"Um.\" I gulped. \"Yes?\" He smiled, and inclined his head slowly until his cold lips brushed against the skin just under the corner of my jaw. \"Right now?\" he whispered, his breath blowing cool on my neck. I shivered involuntarily. \"Yes,\" I whispered, so my voice wouldn't have a chance to break. If he thought I was bluffing, he was going to be disappointed. I'd already made this decision, and I was sure. It didn't matter that my body was rigid as a plank, my hands balled into fists, my breathing erratic\u2026 He chuckled <em>darkly</em>, and leaned away. His face did look disappointed. \"You can't really believe that I would give in so easily,\" he said with a sour edge to his mocking tone. \"A girl can dream.\" His eyebrows rose. \"Is that what you dream about? Being a monster?\" \"Not exactly,\" I said, frowning at his word choice. Monster, indeed. \"Mostly I dream about being with you forever.\" His expression changed, softened and saddened by the subtle ache in my voice. \"Bella.\" His fingers lightly traced the shape of my lips. \"I will stay with you \u2014 isn't that enough?\" I smiled under his fingertips. \"Enough for now.\" He frowned at my tenacity. No one was going to surrender tonight. He exhaled, and the sound was practically a growl. I touched his face. \"Look,\" I said. \"I love you more than everything else in the world combined. Isn't that enough?\" \"Yes, it is enough,\" he answered, smiling. \"Enough for forever.\" And he leaned down to press his cold lips once more to my throat.",

            "en": "7 REPETITION        21 VERDICT WE WERE IN A BRIGHTLY LIT, UNREMARKABLE HALLWAY. The walls were off-white, the floor carpeted in industrial gray. Common rectangular fluorescent lights were spaced evenly along the ceiling. It was warmer here, for which I was grateful. This hall seemed very benign after the gloom of the ghoulish stone sewers. Edward didn't seem to agree with my assessment. He glowered <em>darkly</em> down the long hallway, toward the slight, black shrouded figure at the end, standing by an elevator. He pulled me along, and Alice walked on my other side. The heavy door creaked shut behind us, and then there was the thud of a bolt sliding home.\u00a0 Jane waited by the elevator, one hand holding the doors open for us. Her expression was apathetic. Once inside the elevator, the three vampires that belonged to the Volturi relaxed further. They threw back their cloaks, letting the hoods fall back on their shoulders. Felix and Demetri were both of a slightly olive complexion\u2014it looked odd combined with their chalky pallor. Felix's black hair was cropped short, but Demetri's waved to his shoulders. Their irises were deep crimson around the edges, darkening until they were black around the pupil. Under the shrouds, their clothes were modern, pale, and nondescript. I cowered in the corner, cringing against Edward. His hand still rubbed against my arm. He never took his eyes off Jane. The elevator ride was short; we stepped out into what looked like a posh office reception area. The walls were paneled in wood, the floors carpeted in thick, deep green. There were no windows, but large, brightly lit paintings of the Tuscan countryside hung everywhere as replacements. Pale leather couches were arranged in cozy groupings, and the glossy tables held crystal vases full of vibrantly colored bouquets. The flowers' smell reminded me of a funeral home.  In the middle of the room was a high, polished mahogany counter. I gawked in astonishment at the woman behind it. She was tall, with dark skin and green eyes. She would have been very pretty in any other company\u2014but not here. Because she was every bit as human as I was. I couldn't comprehend what this human woman was doing here, totally at ease, surrounded by vampires.  She smiled politely in welcome. \"Good afternoon, Jane,\" she said. There was no surprise in her face as she glanced at Jane's company. Not Edward, his bare chest glinting dimly in the white lights, or even me, disheveled and comparatively hideous. Jane nodded. \"Gianna.\" She continued toward a set of double doors in the back of the room, and we followed. As Felix passed the desk, he winked at Gianna, and she giggled. On the other side of the wooden doors was a different kind of reception. The pale boy in the pearl gray suit could have been Jane's twin. His hair was darker, and his lips were not as full, but he was just as lovely. He came forward to meet us. He smiled, reaching for her. \"Jane.\" \"Alec,\" she responded, embracing the boy. They kissed each other's cheeks on both sides. Then he looked at us. \"They send you out for one and you come back with two\u2026 and a half,\" he noted, looking at me. \"Nice work.\" She laughed\u2014the sound sparkled with delight like a baby's cooing. \"Welcome back, Edward,\" Alec greeted him. \"You seem in a better mood.\" \"Marginally,\" Edward agreed in a flat voice. I glanced at Edward's hard face, and wondered how his mood could have been darker before. Alec chuckled, and examined me as I clung to Edward's side. \"And this is the cause of all the trouble?\" he asked, skeptical. Edward only smiled, his expression contemptuous. Then he froze. \"Dibs,\" Felix called casually from behind. Edward turned, a low snarl building deep in his chest. Felix smiled\u2014his hand was raised, palm up; he curled his fingers twice, inviting Edward forward. Alice touched Edward's arm. \"Patience,\" she cautioned him. They exchanged a long glance, and I wished I could hear what she was telling him. I figured that it was something to do with not attacking Felix, because Edward took a deep breath and turned back to Alec. \"Aro will be so pleased to see you again,\" Alec said, as if nothing had passed. \"Let's not keep him waiting,\" Jane suggested. Edward nodded once. Alec and Jane, holding hands, led the way down yet another wide, ornate hall\u2014would there ever be an end? They ignored the doors at the end of the hall\u2014doors entirely sheathed in gold\u2014stopping halfway down the hall and sliding aside a piece of the paneling to expose a plain wooden door. It wasn't locked. Alec held it open for Jane. I wanted to groan when Edward pulled me through to the other side of the door. It was the same ancient stone as the square, the alley, and the sewers. And it was dark and cold again. The stone antechamber was not large. It opened quickly into a brighter, cavernous room, perfectly round like a huge castle turret\u2026 which was probably exactly what it was. Two stories up, long window slits threw thin rectangles of bright sunlight onto the stone floor below. There were no artificial lights. The only furniture in the room were several massive wooden chairs, like thrones, that were spaced unevenly, flush with the curving stone walls. In the very center of the circle, in a slight depression, was another drain. I wondered if they used it as an exit, like the hole in the street. The room was not empty. A handful of people were convened in seemingly relaxed conversation. The murmur of low, smooth voices was a gentle hum in the air. As I watched, a pair of pale women in summer dresses paused in a patch of light, and, like prisms, their skin threw the light in rainbow sparkles against the sienna walls. The exquisite faces all turned toward our party as we entered the room. Most of the immortals were dressed in inconspicuous pants and shirts\u2014things that wouldn't stick out at all on the streets below. But the man who spoke first wore one of the long robes. It was pitch-black, and brushed against the floor. For a moment, I thought his long, jet-black hair was the hood of his cloak. \"Jane, dear one, you've returned!\" he cried in evident delight. His voice was just a soft sighing. He drifted forward, and the movement flowed with such surreal grace that I gawked, my mouth hanging open. Even Alice, whose every motion looked like dancing, could not compare. I was only more astonished as he floated closer and I could see his face. It was not like the unnaturally attractive faces that surrounded him (for he did not approach us alone; the entire group converged around him, some following, and some walking ahead of him with the alert manner of bodyguards). I couldn't decide if his face was beautiful or not. I suppose the features were perfect.  But he was as different from the vampires beside him as they were from me. His skin was translucently white, like onionskin, and it looked just as delicate\u2014it stood in shocking contrast to the long black hair that framed his face. I felt a strange, horrifying urge to touch his cheek, to see if it was softer than Edward's or Alice's, or if it was powdery, like chalk. His eyes were red, the same as the others around him, but the color was clouded, milky; I wondered if his vision was affected by the haze. He glided to Jane, took her face in his papery hands, kissed her lightly on her full lips, and then floated back a step. \"Yes, Master.\" Jane smiled; the expression made her look like an angelic child. \"I brought him back alive, just as you wished.\" \"Ah, Jane.\" He smiled, too. \"You are such a comfort to me.\" He turned his misty eyes toward us, and the smile brightened\u2014became ecstatic. \"And Alice and Bella, too!\" he rejoiced, clapping his thin hands together. \"This is a happy surprise!  Wonderful!\" I stared in shock as he called our names informally, as if we were old friends dropping in for an unexpected visit. He turned to our hulking escort. \"Felix, be a dear and tell my brothers about our company. I'm sure they wouldn't want to miss this.\" \"Yes, Master.\" Felix nodded and disappeared back the way we had come. \"You see, Edward?\" The strange vampire turned and smiled at Edward like a fond but scolding grandfather. \"What did I tell you? Aren't you glad that I didn't give you what you wanted yesterday?\" \"Yes, Aro, I am,\" he agreed, tightening his arm around my waist. \"I love a happy ending.\" Aro sighed. \"They are so rare. But I want the whole story. How did this happen? Alice?\" He turned to gaze at Alice with curious, misty eyes. \"Your brother seemed to think you infallible, but apparently there was some mistake.\" \"Oh, I'm far from infallible.\" She flashed a dazzling smile. She looked perfectly at ease, except that her hands were balled into tight little fists. \"As you can see today, I cause problems as often as I cure them.\" \"You're too modest,\" Aro chided. \"I've seen some of your more amazing exploits, and I must admit I've never observed anything like your talent. Wonderful!\" Alice flickered a glance at Edward. Aro did not miss it. \"I'm sorry, we haven't been introduced properly at all, have we? It's just that I feel like I know you already, and I tend get ahead of myself. Your brother introduced us yesterday, in a peculiar way. You see, I share some of your brother's talent, only I am limited in a way that he is not.\" Aro shook his head; his tone was envious. \"And also exponentially more powerful,\" Edward added dryly. He looked at Alice as he swiftly explained. \"Aro needs physical contact to hear your thoughts, but he hears much more than I do. You know I can only hear what's passing through your head in the moment. Aro hears every thought your mind has ever had.\" Alice raised her delicate eyebrows, and Edward inclined his head. Aro didn't miss that either. \"But to be able to hear from a distance\u2026\" Aro sighed, gesturing toward the two of them, and the exchange that had just taken place. \"That would be so convenient.\" Aro looked over our shoulders. All the other heads turned in the same direction, including Jane, Alec, and Demetri, who stood silently beside us. I was the slowest to turn. Felix was back, and behind him floated two more black-robed men. Both looked very much like Aro, one even had the same flowing black hair. The other had a shock of snow-white hair\u2014the same shade as his face\u2014that brushed against his shoulders. Their faces had identical, paper-thin skin. The trio from Carlisle's painting was complete, unchanged by the last three hundred years since it was painted. \"Marcus, Caius, look!\" Aro crooned. \"Bella is alive after all, and Alice is here with her! Isn't that wonderful?\" Neither of the other two looked as if wonderful would be their first choice of words. The dark-haired man seemed utterly bored, like he'd seen too many millennia of Aro's enthusiasm. The other's face was sour under the snowy hair. Their lack of interest did not curb Aro's enjoyment. \"Let us have the story,\" Aro almost sang in his feathery voice. The white-haired ancient vampire drifted away, gliding toward one of the wooden thrones. The other paused beside Aro, and he reached his hand out, at first I thought to take Aro's hand. But he just touched Aro's palm briefly and then dropped his hand to his side. Aro raised one black brow. I wondered how his papery skin did not crumple in the effort. Edward snorted very quietly, and Alice looked at him, curious. \"Thank you, Marcus,\" Aro said. \"That's quite interesting.\" I realized, a second late, that Marcus was letting Aro know his thoughts. Marcus didn't look interested. He glided away from Aro to join the one who must be Caius, seated against the wall. Two of the attending vampires followed silently behind him\u2014bodyguards, like I'd thought before. I could see that the two women in the sundresses had gone to stand beside Caius in the same manner. The idea of any vampire needing a guard was faintly ridiculous to me, but maybe the ancient ones were as frail as their skin suggested. Aro was shaking his head. \"Amazing,\"' he said. \"Absolutely amazing.\" Alice's expression was frustrated. Edward turned to her and explained again in a swift, low voice.  \"Marcus sees relationships. He's surprised by the intensity of ours.\" Aro smiled. \"So convenient,\" he repeated to himself. Then he spoke to us. \"It takes quite a bit to surprise Marcus, I can assure you.\" I looked at Marcus's dead face, and I believed that. \"It's just so difficult to understand, even now,\" Aro mused, staring at Edward's arm wrapped around me. It was hard for me to follow Aro's chaotic train of thought. I struggled to keep up. \"How can you stand so close to her like that?\" \"It's not without effort,\" Edward answered calmly. \"But still\u2014la tua cantante! What a waste!\" Edward chuckled once without humor. \"I look at it more as a price.\" Aro was skeptical. \"A very high price.\" \"Opportunity cost.\" Aro laughed. \"If I hadn't smelled her through your memories, I wouldn't have believed the call of anyone's blood could be so strong. I've never felt anything like it myself. Most of us would trade much for such a gift, and yet you\u2026\" \"Waste it,\" Edward finished, his voice sarcastic now. Aro laughed again. \"Ah, how I miss my friend Carlisle! You remind me of him\u2014only he was not so angry.\" \"Carlisle outshines me in many other ways as well.\" \"I certainly never thought to see Carlisle bested for self-control of all things, but you put him to shame.\" \"Hardly.\" Edward sounded impatient. As if he were tired of the preliminaries. It made me more afraid; I couldn't help but try to imagine what he expected would follow. \"I am gratified by his success,\" Aro mused. \"Your memories of him are quite a gift for me, though they astonish me exceedingly. I am surprised by how it\u2026 pleases me, his success in this unorthodox path he's chosen. I expected that he would waste, weaken with time. I'd scoffed at his plan to find others who would share his peculiar vision. Yet, somehow, I'm happy to be wrong.\" Edward didn't reply. \"But your restraint!\" Aro sighed. \"I did not know such strength was possible. To inure yourself against such a siren call, not just once but again and again\u2014if I had not felt it myself, I would not have believed.\" Edward gazed back at Aro's admiration with no expression. I knew his face well enough\u2014time had not changed that\u2014to guess at something seething beneath the surface. I fought to keep my breathing even. \"Just remembering how she appeals to you\u2026\" Aro chuckled. \"It makes me thirsty.\" Edward tensed. \"Don't be disturbed,\" Aro reassured him. \"I mean her no harm. But I am so curious, about one thing in particular.\" He eyed me with bright interest. \"May I?\" he asked eagerly, lifting one hand. \"Ask her,\" Edward suggested in a flat voice. \"Of course, how rude of me!\" Aro exclaimed. \"Bella,\" he addressed me directly now. \"I'm fascinated that you are the one exception to Edward's impressive talent\u2014so very interesting that such a thing should occur! And I was wondering, since our talents are similar in many ways, if you would be so kind as to allow me to try\u2014to see if you are an exception for me, as well?\" My eyes flashed up to Edward's face in terror. Despite Aro's overt politeness, I didn't believe I really had a choice. I was horrified at the thought of allowing him to touch me, and yet also perversely intrigued by the chance to feel his strange skin. Edward nodded in encouragement\u2014whether because he was sure Aro would not hurt me, or because there was no choice, I couldn't tell. I turned back to Aro and raised my hand slowly in front of me. It was trembling. He glided closer, and I believe he meant his expression to be reassuring. But his papery features were too strange, too alien and frightening, to reassure. The look on his face was more confident than his words had been. Aro reached out, as if to shake my hand, and pressed his insubstantial-looking skin against mine. It was hard, but felt brittle\u2014shale rather than granite\u2014and even colder than I expected. His filmy eyes smiled down at mine, and it was impossible to look away. They were mesmerizing in an odd, unpleasant way. Aro's face altered as I watched. The confidence wavered and became first doubt, then incredulity before he calmed it into a friendly mask. \"So very interesting,\" he said as he released my hand and drifted back. My eyes flickered to Edward, and, though his face was composed, I thought he seemed a little smug. Aro continued to drift with a thoughtful expression. He was quiet for a moment, his eyes flickering between the three of us. Then, abruptly, he shook his head. \"A first,\" he said to himself \"I wonder if she is immune to our other talents\u2026 Jane, dear?\" \"No!\" Edward snarled the word. Alice grabbed his arm with a restraining hand. He shook her off. Little Jane smiled up happily at Aro. \"Yes, Master?\" Edward was truly snarling now, the sound ripping and tearing from him, glaring at Aro with baleful eyes. The room had gone still, everyone watching him with amazed disbelief, as if he were committing some embarrassing social faux pas. I saw Felix grin hopefully and move a step forward. Aro glanced at him once, and he froze in place, his grin turning to a sulky expression. Then he spoke to Jane. \"I was wondering, my dear one, if Bella is immune to you.\" I could barely hear Aro over Edward's furious growls. He let go of me, moving to hide me from their view. Caius ghosted in our direction, with his entourage, to watch. Jane turned toward us with a beatific smile. \"Don't!\" Alice cried as Edward launched himself at the little girl. Before I could react, before anyone could jump between them, before Aro's bodyguards could tense, Edward was on the ground. No one had touched him, but he was on the stone floor writhing in obvious agony, while I stared in horror. Jane was smiling only at him now, and it all clicked together. What Alice had said about formidable gifts , why everyone treated Jane with such deference, and why Edward had thrown himself in her path before she could do that to me. \"Stop!\" I shrieked, my voice echoing in the silence, jumping forward to put myself between them. But Alice threw her arms around me in an unbreakable grasp and ignored my struggles. No sound escaped Edward's lips as he cringed against the stones. It felt like my head would explode from the pain of watching this. \"Jane,\" Aro recalled her in a tranquil voice. She looked up quickly, still smiling with pleasure, her eyes questioning. As soon as Jane looked away, Edward was still. Aro inclined his head toward me. Jane turned her smile in my direction. I didn't even meet her gaze. I watched Edward from the prison of Alice's arms, still struggling pointlessly. \"He's fine,\" Alice whispered in a tight voice. As she spoke, he sat up, and then sprang lightly to his feet. His eyes met mine, and they were horror-struck. At first I thought the horror was for what he had just suffered. But then he looked quickly at Jane, and back to me\u2014and his face relaxed into relief. I looked at Jane, too, and she no longer smiled. She glared at me, her jaw clenched with the intensity of her focus. I shrank back, waiting for the pain. Nothing happened. Edward was by my side again. He touched Alice's arm, and she surrendered me to him. Aro started to laugh. \"Ha, ha. ha,\" he chuckled. \"This is wonderful!\" Jane hissed in frustration, leaning forward like she was preparing to spring. \"Don't be put out, dear one,\" Aro said in a comforting tone, placing a powder-light hand on her shoulder. \"She confounds us all.\" Jane's upper lip curled back ever her teeth as she continued to glare at me. \"Ha, ha, ha,\" Aro chortled again. \"You're very brave, Edward, to endure in silence. I asked Jane to do that to me once\u2014just out of curiosity.\" He shook his head in admiration. Edward glared, disgusted. \"So what do we do with you now?\" Aro sighed. Edward and Alice stiffened. This was the part they'd been waiting for. I began to tremble. \"I don't suppose there's any chance that you've changed your mind?\" Aro asked Edward hopefully. \"Your talent would be an excellent addition to our little company.\" Edward hesitated. From the corner of my eye, I saw both Felix and Jane grimace. Edward seemed to weigh each word before he spoke it. \"I'd\u2026 rather\u2026 not.\" \"Alice?\" Aro asked, still hopeful. \"Would you perhaps be interested in joining with us?\" \"No, thank you,\" Alice said. \"And you, Bella?\" Aro raised his eyebrows. Edward hissed, low in my ears. I stared at Aro blankly. Was he joking? Or was he really asking me if I wanted to stay for dinner? It was the white-haired Caius who broke the silence. \"What?\" he demanded of Aro; his voice, though no more than a whisper, was flat. \"Caius, surely you see the potential,\" Aro chided him affectionately. \"I haven't seen a prospective talent so promising since we found Jane and Alec. Can you imagine the possibilities when she is one of us?\" Caius looked away with a caustic expression. Jane's eyes sparked with indignation at the comparison. Edward fumed beside me. I could hear a rumble in his chest, building toward a growl. I couldn't let his temper get him hurt. \"No, thank you,\" I spoke up in barely more than a whisper, my voice breaking in fright. Aro sighed. \"That's unfortunate. Such a waste.\" Edward hissed. \"Join or die, is that it? I suspected as much when we were brought to this room. So much for your laws.\" The tone of his voice surprised me. He sounded irate, but there was something deliberate about his delivery\u2014as if he'd chosen his words with great care. \"Of course not.\" Aro blinked, astonished. \"We were already convened here, Edward, awaiting Heidi's return. Not for you.\" \"Aro,\" Caius hissed. \"The law claims them.\" Edward glared at Caius. \"How so?\" he demanded. He must have known what Caius was thinking, but he seemed determined to make him speak it aloud. Caius pointed a skeletal finger at me. \"She knows too much. You have exposed our secrets.\" His voice was papery thin, just like his skin. \"There are a few humans in on your charade here, as well,\" Edward reminded him, and I thought of the pretty receptionist below. Caius's face twisted into a new expression. Was it supposed to be a smiled. \"Yes,\" he agreed. \"But when they are no longer useful to us, they will serve to sustain us. That is not your plan for this one. If she betrays our secrets, are you prepared to destroy her? I think not,\" he scoffed. \"I wouldn't\u2014,\" I began, still whispering. Caius silenced me with an icy look. \"Nor do you intend to make her one of us,\" Caius continued. \"Therefore, she is a vulnerability. Though it is true, for this, only her life is forfeit. You may leave if you wish.\" Edward bared his teeth. \"That's what I thought,\" Caius said, with something akin to pleasure. Felix leaned forward, eager. \"Unless\u2026\" Aro interrupted. He looked unhappy with the way the conversation had gone. \"Unless you do intend to give her immortality?\" Edward pursed his lips, hesitating for a moment before he answered. \"And if I do?\" Aro smiled, happy again. \"Why, then you would be free to go home and give my regards to my friend Carlisle.\" His expression turned more hesitant. \"But I'm afraid you would have to mean it.\" Aro raised his hand in front of him. Caius, who had begun to scowl furiously, relaxed. Edward's lips tightened into a fierce line. He stared into my eyes, and I stared back. \"Mean it,\" I whispered. \"Please.\" Was it really such a loathsome idea? Would he rather die than change me? I felt like I'd been kicked in the stomach. Edward stared down at me with a tortured expression. And then Alice stepped away from us, forward toward Aro. We turned to watch her. Her hand was raised like his. She didn't say anything, and Aro waved off his anxious guard as they moved to block her approach. Aro met her halfway, and took her hand with an eager, acquisitive glint in his eyes. He bent his head over their touching hands, his eyes closing as he concentrated. Alice was motionless, her face blank. I heard Edward's teeth snap together. No one moved. Aro seemed frozen over Alice's hand. The seconds passed and I grew more and more stressed, wondering how much time would pass before it was too much time. Before it meant something was wrong\u2014more wrong than it already was. Another agonizing moment passed, and then Aro's voice broke the silence. \"Ha, ha, ha,\" he laughed, his head still bent forward. He looked up slowly, his eyes bright with excitement. \"That was fascinating!\" Alice smiled dryly. \"I'm glad you enjoyed it.\" \"To see the things you've seen\u2014especially the ones that haven't happened yet!\" He shook his head in wonder. \"But that will,\" she reminded him, voice calm. \"Yes, yes, it's quite determined. Certainly there's no problem.\" Caius looked bitterly disappointed\u2014a feeling he seemed to share with Felix and Jane. \"Aro,\" Caius complained. \"Dear Caius,\" Aro smiled. \"Do not fret. Think of the possibilities! They do not join us today, but we can always hope for the future. Imagine the joy young Alice alone would bring to our little household\u2026 Besides, I'm so terribly curious to see how Bella turns out!\" Aro seemed convinced. Did he not realize how subjective Alice's visions were.' That she could make up her mind to transform me today, and then change it tomorrow? A million tiny decisions, her decisions and so many others', too\u2014Edward's\u2014could alter her path, and with that, the future. And would it really matter that Alice was willing, would it make any difference if I did become a vampire, when the idea was so repulsive to Edward? If death was, to him, a better alternative than having me around forever, an immortal annoyance? Terrified as I was, I felt myself sinking down into depression, drowning in it\u2026 \"Then we are free to go now?\" Edward asked in an even voice. \"Yes, yes,\" Aro said pleasantly. \"But please visit again. It's been absolutely enthralling!\" \"And we will visit you as well,\" Caius promised, his eyes suddenly half-closed like the heavy-lidded gaze of a lizard. \"To be sure that you follow through on your side. Were I you, I would not delay too long. We do not offer second chances.\" Edward's jaw clenched tight, but he nodded once. Caius smirked and drifted back to where Marcus still sat, unmoving and uninterested. Felix groaned. \"Ah, Felix.\" Aro smiled, amused. \"Heidi will be here at any moment. Patience.\" \"Hmm.\" Edward's voice had a new edge to it. \"In that case, perhaps we'd better leave sooner rather than later.\" \"Yes,\" Aro agreed. \"That's a good idea. Accidents do happen. Please wait below until after dark, though, if you don't mind.\" \"Of course,\" Edward agreed, while I cringed at the thought of waiting out the day before we could escape. \"And here,\" Aro added, motioning to Felix with one finger. Felix came forward at once, and Aro unfastened the gray cloak the huge vampire wore, pulling from his shoulders. He tossed it to Edward. \"Take this. You're a little conspicuous.\" Edward put the long cloak on, leaving the hood down. Aro sighed. \"It suits you.\" Edward chuckled, but broke off suddenly, glancing over his shoulder. \"Thank you, Aro. We'll wait below.\" \"Goodbye, young friends,\" Aro said, his eyes bright as he stared in the same direction. \"Let's go,\" Edward said, urgent now. Demetri gestured that we should follow, and then set off the way we'd come in, the only exit by the look of things. Edward pulled me swiftly along beside him. Alice was close by my other side, her face hard. \"Not fast enough,\" she muttered. I stared up at her, frightened, but she only seemed chagrined. It was then that I first heard the babble of voices\u2014loud, rough voices\u2014coming from the antechamber. \"Well this is unusual,\" a man's coarse voice boomed. \"So medieval,\" an unpleasantly shrill, female voice gushed back. A large crowd was coming through the little door, filling the smaller stone chamber. Demetri motioned for us to make room. We pressed back against the cold wall to let them pass. The couple in front, Americans from the sound of them, glanced around themselves with appraising eyes. \"Welcome, guests! Welcome to Volterra!\" I could hear Aro sing from the big turret room. The rest of them, maybe forty or more, filed in after the couple. Some studied the setting like tourists. A few even snapped pictures. Others looked confused, as if the story that had led them to this room was not making sense anymore. I noticed one small, dark woman in particular. Around her neck was a rosary, and she gripped the cross tightly in one hand. She walked more slowly than the others, touching someone now and then and asking a question in an unfamiliar language. No one seemed to understand her, and her voice grew more panicked. Edward pulled my face against his chest, but it was too late. I already understood. As soon as the smallest break appeared, Edward pushed me quickly toward the door. I could feel the horrified expression on my face, and the tears beginning to pool in my eyes. The ornate golden hallway was quiet, empty except for one gorgeous, statuesque woman. She stared at us curiously, me in particular. \"Welcome home, Heidi,\" Demetri greeted her from behind us. Heidi smiled absently. She reminded me of Rosalie, though they looked nothing alike\u2014it was just that her beauty, too, was exceptional, unforgettable. I couldn't seem to look away. She was dressed to emphasize that beauty. Her amazingly long legs, darkened with tights, were exposed by the shortest of miniskirts. Her top was long-sleeved and high-necked, but extremely close-fitting, and constructed of red vinyl. Her long mahogany hair was lustrous, and her eyes were the strangest shade of violet\u2014a color that might result from blue-tinted contacts over red irises. \"Demetri,\" she responded in a silky voice, her eyes flickering between my face and Edward's gray cloak. \"Nice fishing,\" Demetri complimented her, and I suddenly understood the attention-grabbing outfit she wore\u2026 she was not only the fisherman, but also the bait. \"Thanks.\" She flashed a stunning smile. \"Aren't you coming?\" \"In a minute. Save a few for me.\" Heidi nodded and ducked through the door with one last curious look at me. Edward set a pace that had me running to keep up. But we still couldn't get through the ornate door at the end of the hallway before the screaming started.",
