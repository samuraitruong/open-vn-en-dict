            "en": "Lupus    What is lupus? Lupus is a lifelong disorder of the immune system. Immune cells attack the body\u2019s own healthy tissues, leading to inflammation and tissue damage. Symptoms may be limited to the skin, but more often lupus also causes internal problems such as joint pain. In severe cases, it can damage the heart, kidneys, and other vital organs. Although there\u2019s no cure, there are treatments that can minimize the damage. Lupus symptom: Joint pain Joint and muscle pain is often the first sign of lupus. This pain tends to occur on both sides of the body at the same time, particularly in the joints of the wrists, hands, elbows, knees, or ankles. The joints may look inflamed and feel warm to touch. But unlike rheumatoid arthritis, lupus usually does not cause permanent joint damage. Lupus symptom: Butterfly rash A tell-tale sign of lupus is a butterfly-shaped rash across the cheeks and bridge of the nose. Other common skin problems include sensitivity to the sun with flaky, red spots or a scaly, purple rash on various parts of the body, including the face, neck, and arms. Some people also develop mouth or lip sores. Lupus symptom: Nail changes Lupus can cause the nails to crack or fall off. They may be discolored with blue or reddish spots at the base. These spots are actually in the nail bed, the result of inflamed small blood vessels. Swelling may also make the skin around the base of the nail look red and puffy. Lupus Symptoms: Fever and Fatigue Most people with lupus experience some degrees of fatigue. In many cases, it is severe enough to interfere with exercise and other daily activities. Most patients also run a low-grade fever from time to time. This unexplained fever may be the warning sign in some people. Lupus symptom: Light sensitivity Many people with lupus are unusually sensitive to the sun and other forms of ultraviolet light (such as tanning beds.) A day at the beach may trigger a skin rash in areas exposed to sunlight and may worsen other lupus symptoms. Certain medications can make people with lupus even more sensitive to UV light. Lupus symptom: Hair loss The symptoms of lupus tend to come and go, and this includes hair loss. Patients may go through periods where their hair falls out in patches or becomes thinner all across the scalp. Once the flare-up is over, new hair is likely to grow in evenly. Lupus symptom: Raynaud's Some people with lupus develop a condition called Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon. Their fingers and toes become painful, numb, and <em>tingly</em> in response to cold temperatures or emotional stress. This happens when small blood vessels spasm and restrict blood flow to the area. During an attack, the fingers and toes may turn white or blue. People can also have Raynaud's without having lupus or any serious health complications. Lupus or something else? When lupus begins, it can look a lot like rheumatoid arthritis, which causes joint pain and swelling, or fibromyalgia, which causes fatigue and pain. One aspect that sets lupus apart is the combination of skin rashes with joint pain and fatigue. There are also lab tests that can help distinguish lupus from other diseases. Diagnosing lupus Diagnosing lupus can be tricky. The disease can mimic other conditions, and it often takes a different course in different people. Many people have it for years before developing tell-tale symptoms. Although there is no one test for lupus, certain proteins usually show up in a patient\u2019s blood. A blood test for antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) can provide a critical clue. Other lab tests may check cell counts, kidney function, and clotting time. A tissue biopsy sometimes helps with diagnosis. Who gets lupus? Anyone can get lupus. But more than 90% of people with lupus are women. Aside from being female, your odds of getting the disease are higher if you are: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * African-American, Latino, or Asian \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Aged 15 to 45 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Related to someone with lupus Types of lupus When people say \u201clupus,\u201d they usually mean systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the most common and serious type. But there are other types. Cutaneous lupus erythematosus \u2013 also called discoid lupus -- is limited to the skin and doesn\u2019t cause the organ damage that sometimes occurs with SLE. The most common symptom is a circular rash. Drug-induced systemic lupus causes temporary lupus symptoms in people who take certain medications. Medical treatments for lupus There are ways to control the symptoms of lupus. These include corticosteroid creams for rashes and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for joint pain and fever. Antimalarial medications can help fight joint pain, ulcers, and rashes. Higher dose of corticosteroids may be given as pills or injections. People with severe lupus may benefit from drugs that suppress the immune system. Self-care for lupus Making some changes to your routine can also help reduce lupus flare-ups: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Cover up when you\u2019re in the sun. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Don\u2019t smoke. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Exercise regularly. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Improve your stress management skills. Also be sure to get plenty of rest. Some people with lupus need up to 12 hours of sleep a night. Lupus and kidney problems As lupus progresses, it can interfere with the body\u2019s organs. About three out of four people with lupus develop kidney problems. These problems may not cause symptoms, though some people notice swelling in their legs or ankles. Most patients only learn about their kidney trouble when a urine test reveals blood or abnormal protein levels. Lupus and heart problems The most common heart problem linked to lupus is an inflammation of the sac around the heart. This may cause severe pain in the left side of the chest. People with lupus are also more likely to develop plaques that narrow or clog the arteries. This can lead to coronary artery disease. Other complications include heart valve disease and inflammation of the heart muscle. Call 911 immediately for chest pain, rather than trying figure out the cause yourself. Lupus and lung problems The tissue surrounding the lungs becomes inflamed in about a third of people with lupus. This may lead to painful breathing, or chest pain, or it may not cause any symptoms at all. Sometimes lupus causes chest pain that is not related to the lungs or the heart. Instead, the pain comes from an inflamed chest muscle or rib joint. Any chest pain should be promptly evaluated by a doctor. Lupus and digestive problems Digestive problems are not common with lupus, but some people may experience belly pain, nausea, vomiting, difficulty swallowing, or inflammation of the liver or pancreas. This can be related to lupus itself or medications used to treat the disease. Some people tend to lose weight during lupus flare-ups. Lupus and anemia Lupus and the medications used to treat it can contribute to anemia in some patients. This means the body has too few red blood cells, because it is not making enough, or red blood cells are being destroyed more quickly than they can be replaced. Symptoms include fatigue, a rapid heartbeat, and shortness of breath. Lupus and the nervous system Lupus can trigger a wide range of problems with the nervous system, most commonly headaches. Mild memory problem is a less common complaint that may come and go. Some people with lupus have a greater risk for a stroke, and in rare cases, the disease can lead to seizures. Lupus and mental health Depression and anxiety are a risk for people with lupus. This may be the result of the condition\u2019s affect on the nervous system combined with the emotional strain of coping with a chronic illness. Be sure to discuss any concerns about your mood with your doctor or other health care provider. There are highly effective treatments for depression and anxiety. Lupus and pregnancy Most women with lupus can get pregnant, though the condition increases the risk of complications during pregnancy. Because lupus symptoms come and go, the best time to get pregnant is when symptoms are at a minimum. Women who conceive when symptoms are in remission are less likely to have flare-ups or complications. Make sure your obstetrician knows you have lupus. You medications may be modified and you may undergo extra monitoring to ensure a successful pregnancy. Neonatal lupus Most babies born to women with lupus are entirely healthy. But in rare cases, the newborn of a mom with lupus may have neonatal lupus. This condition can cause a skin rash, anemia, or liver problems. The symptoms usually go away after a few months and don\u2019t cause permanent damage. However, some babies with neonatal lupus are born with a serious heart defect. Living with lupus The fatigue and joint pain associated with lupus can make it more difficult to do your job or care for your children. You may have to cut back on activities or ask for help when symptoms flare up. But most people with lupus are able to continue with their usual activities. Outlook for lupus Thanks to improvements in treatments for lupus, people with the condition are living significantly longer. The outlook for any given individual depends on how severe the disease is, and whether any vital organs are affected. But most people with lupus can expect to live a normal or nearly normal life span.",

            "en": "1 3            13. KILLER If it was anyone but Jacob, i thought to myself, shaking my head as I drove down  the forest-lined highway to La Push. I still wasn't sure if I was doing the right thing, but I'd made a compromise with myself. I couldn't condone what Jacob and his friends, his pack, were doing. I understood now what he'd said last night\u2014that I might not want to see him again\u2014and I could have called him as he'd suggested, but that felt cowardly. I owed him a face-to-face conversation, at least. I would tell him to his face that I couldn't just overlook what was going on. I couldn't be friends with a killer and say nothing, let the killing continue\u2026 That would make me a monster, too. But I couldn't not warn him, either. I had to do what I could to protect him. I pulled up to the Blacks' house with my lips pressed together into a hard line. It was bad enough that my best friend was a werewolf. Did he have to be a monster, too? The house was dark, no lights in the windows, but I didn't care if I woke them. My fist thudded against the front door with angry energy; the sound reverberated through the walls. \"Come in,\" I heard Billy call after a minute, and a light flicked on. I twisted the knob; it was unlocked. Billy was leaning around an open doorway just off the little kitchen, a bathrobe around his shoulders, not in his chair yet. When he saw who it was, his eyes widened briefly, and then his face turned stoic. \"Well, good morning, Bella. What are you doing up so early?\" \"Hey, Billy. I need to talk to Jake\u2014where is he?\" \"Um\u2026 I don't really know,\" he lied, straight-faced. \"Do you know what Charlie is doing this morning?\" I demanded, sick of the stalling. \"Should I?\" \"He and half the other men in town are all out in the woods with guns, hunting giant wolves.\" Billy's expression flickered, and then went blank. \"So I'd like to talk to Jake about that, if you don't mind,\" I continued. Billy pursed his thick lips for a long moment. \"I'd bet he's still asleep,\" he finally said, nodding toward the tiny hallway off the front room. \"He's out late a lot these days. Kid needs his rest\u2014probably you shouldn't wake him.\" \"It's my turn,\" I muttered under my breath as I stalked to the hallway. Billy sighed. Jacob's tiny closet of a room was the only door in the yard-long hallway. I didn't bother to knock. I threw the door open; it slammed against the wall with a bang. Jacob\u2014still wearing just the same black cut-off sweats he'd worn last night\u2014was stretched diagonally across the double bed that took up all of his room but a few inches around the edges. Even on a slant, it wasn't long enough; his feet hung off the one end and his head off the other. He was fast asleep, snoring lightly with his mouth hanging open. The sound of the door hadn't even made him twitch. His face was peaceful with deep sleep, all the angry lines smoothed out. There were circles under his eyes that I hadn't noticed before. Despite his ridiculous size, he looked very young now, and very weary. Pity shook me. I stepped back out, and shut the door quietly behind me. Billy stared with curious, guarded eyes as I walked slowly back into the front room. \"I think I'll let him get some rest.\" Billy nodded, and then we gazed at each other for a minute. I was dying to ask him about his part in this. What did he think of what his son had become? But I knew how he'd supported Sam from the very beginning, and so I supposed the murders must not bother him. How he justified that to himself I couldn't imagine. I could see many questions for me in his dark eyes, but he didn't voice them either. \"Look,\" I said, breaking the loud silence. \"I'll be down at the beach for a while. When he wakes up, tell him I'm waiting for him, okay?\" \"Sure, sure,\" Billy agreed. I wondered if he really would. Well, if he didn't, I'd tried, right? I drove down to First Beach and parked in the empty dirt lot. It was still dark\u2014the gloomy predawn of a cloudy day\u2014and when I cut the headlights it was hard to see. I had to let my eyes adjust before I could find the path that led through the tall hedge of weeds. It was colder here, with the wind whipping off the black water, and I shoved my hands deep into the pockets of my winter jacket. At least the rain had stopped. I paced down the beach toward the north seawall. I couldn't see St. James or the other islands, just the vague shape of the water's edge. I picked my way carefully across the rocks, watching out for driftwood that might trip me. I found what I was looking for before I realized I was looking for it. It materialized out of the gloom when it was just a few feet away: a long bone-white driftwood tree stranded deep on the rocks. The roots twisted up at the seaward end, like a hundred brittle tentacles. I couldn't be sure that it was the same tree where Jacob and I had had our first conversation\u2014a conversation that had begun so many different, tangled threads of my life\u2014but it seemed to be in about the same place I sat down where I'd sat before, and stared out across the invisible sea. Seeing Jacob like that\u2014innocent and vulnerable in sleep\u2014had stolen all my revulsion, dissolved all my anger. I still couldn't turn a blind eye to what was happening, like Billy seemed to, but I couldn't condemn Jacob for it either. Love didn't work that way, I decided. Once you cared about a person, it was impossible to be logical about them anymore. Jacob was my friend whether he killed people or not. And I didn't know what I was going to do about that. When I pictured him sleeping so peacefully, I felt an overpowering urge to protect him. Completely illogical. Illogical or not, I brooded over the memory his peaceful face, trying to come up with some answer, some way to shelter him, while the sky slowly turned gray. \"Hi, Bella.\" Jacob's voice came from the darkness and made me jump. It was soft, almost shy, but I'd been expecting some forewarning from the noisy rocks, and so it still startled me. I could see his silhouette against the coming sunrise\u2014it looked enormous. \"Jake?\" He stood several paces away, shifting his weight from foot to foot anxiously. \"Billy told me you came by\u2014didn't take you very long, did it? I knew you could figure it out.\" \"Yeah, I remember the right story now,\" I whispered. It was quiet for a long moment and, though it was still too dark to see well, my skin prickled as if his eyes were searching my face. There must have been enough light for him to read my expression, because when he spoke again, his voice was suddenly acidic. \"You could have just called,\" he said harshly. I nodded. \"I know.\" Jacob started pacing along the rocks. If I listened very hard, I could just hear the gentle brush of his feet on the rocks behind the sound of the waves. The rocks had clattered like castanets for me. \"Why did you come?\" he demanded, not halting his angry stride. \"I thought it would be better face-to-face.\" He snorted. \"Oh, much better.\" \"Jacob, I have to warn you\u2014\" \"About the rangers and the hunters? Don't worry about it. We already know.\" \"Don't worry about it?\" I demanded in disbelief. \"Jake, they've got guns! They're setting traps and offering rewards and\u2014\" \"We can take care of ourselves,\" he growled, still pacing. \"They're not going to catch anything. They're only making it more difficult\u2014they'll start disappearing soon enough, too.\" \"Jake!\" I hissed. \"What? It's just a fact.\" My voice was pale with revulsion. \"How can you\u2026 feel that way? You know these people. Charlie's out there!\" The thought made my stomach twist. He came to an abrupt stop. \"What more can we do?\" he retorted. The sun turned the clouds a slivery pink above us. I could see his expression now; it was angry, frustrated, betrayed. \"Could you\u2026 well, try to not be a\u2026 werewolf?\" I suggested in a whisper. He threw his hands up in the air. \"Like I have a choice about it!\" he shouted. \"And how would that help anything, if you're worried about people disappearing?\" \"I don't understand you.\" He glared at me, his eyes narrowing and his mouth twisting into a snarl. \"You know what makes me so mad I could just spit?\" I flinched away from his hostile expression. He seemed to be waiting for an answer, so I shook my head. \"You're such a hypocrite, Bella\u2014there you sit, terrified of me! How is that fair?\" His hands shook with anger. \"Hypocrite? How does being afraid of a monster make me a hypocrite?\" \"Ugh!\" he groaned, pressing his trembling fists to his temples and squeezing his eyes shut. \"Would you listen to yourself?\" \"What?\" He took two steps toward me, leaning over me and glaring with fury. \"Well, I'm so sorry that I can't be the right kind of monster for you, Bella. I guess I'm just not as great as a bloodsucker, am I?\" I jumped to my feet and glared back. \"No, you're not!\" I shouted. \"It's not what you are, stupid, it's what you do!\" \"What's that supposed to mean?\" He roared, his entire frame quivering with rage. I was taken entirely by surprise when Edward's voice cautioned me. \"Be very careful, Bella,\" his velvet voice warned. \"Don't push him too far. You need to calm him down.\" Even the voice in my head was making no sense today. I listened to him, though. I would do anything for that voice. \"Jacob,\" I pleaded, making my tone soft and even. \"Is it really necessary to kill people, Jacob? Isn't there some other way? I mean, if vampires can find a way to survive without murdering people, couldn't you give it a try, too?\" He straightened up with a jerk, like my words had sent an electric shock through him. His eyebrows shot up and his eyes stared wide. \"Killing people?\" he demanded. \"What did you think we were talking about?\" He wasn't trembling anymore. He looked at me with half-hopeful disbelief. \"I thought we were talking about your disgust for werewolves.\" \"No, Jake, no. It's not that you're a\u2026 wolf. That's fine,\" I promised him, and I knew as I said the words that I meant them. I really didn't care if he turned into a big wolf\u2014he was still Jacob. \"If you could just find a way not to hurt people\u2026 that's all that upsets me. These ate innocent people, Jake, people like Charlie, and I can't just look the other way while you\u2014\" \"Is that all? Really?\" he interrupted me, a smile breaking across his face. \"You're just scared because I'm a murderer? That's the only reason?\" \"Isn't that reason enough?\" He started to laugh. \"Jacob Black, this is so not funny!\" \"Sure, sure,\" he agreed, still chortling. He took one long stride and caught me in another vice-tight bear hug. \"You really, honestly don't mind that I morph into a giant dog?\" he asked, his voice joyful in my ear. \"No,\" I gasped. \"Can't\u2014breathe\u2014Jake!\" He let me go, but took both my hands. \"I'm not a killer, Bella.\" I studied his face, and it was clear that this was the truth. Relief pulsed through me. \"Really?\" I asked. \"Really,\" he promised solemnly. I threw my arms around him. It reminded me of that first day with the motorcycles\u2014he was bigger, though, and I felt even more like a child now. Like that other time, he stroked my hair. \"Sorry I called you a hypocrite,\" he apologized. \"Sorry I called you a murderer.\" He laughed. I thought of something then, and pulled away from him so that I could see his face. My eyebrows furrowed in anxiety. \"What about Sam? And the others?\" He shook his head, smiling like a huge burden had been removed from his shoulders.  \"Of course not. Don't you remember what we call ourselves?\" The memory was clear\u2014I'd just been thinking of that very day. \"Protectors?\" \"Exactly.\" \"But I don't understand. What's happening in the woods? The missing hikers, the blood?\" His face was serious, worried at once. \"We're trying to do our job, Bella. We're trying to protect them, but we're always just a little too late.\" \"Protect them from what? Is there really a bear out there, too?\" \"Bella, honey, we only protect people from one thing\u2014our one enemy. It's the reason we exist\u2014because they do.\" I stared at him blankly for one second before I understood. Then the blood drained from my face and a thin, wordless cry of horror broke through my lips. He nodded. \"I thought you, of all people, would realize what was really going on.\" \"Laurent,\" I whispered. \"He's still here.\" Jacob blinked twice, and cocked his head to one side. \"Who's Laurent?\" I tried to sort out the chaos in my head so that I could answer. \"You know\u2014you saw him in the meadow. You were there\u2026\" The words came out in a wondering tone as it all sunk in. \"You were there, and you kept him from killing me\u2026\" \"Oh, the black-haired leech?\" He grinned, a tight, fierce grin. \"Was that his name?\" I shuddered. \"What were you thinking?\" I whispered. \"He could have killed you! Jake, you don't realize how dangerous\u2014\" Another laugh interrupted me \"Bella, one lone vampire isn't much of a problem for a pack as big as ours. It was so easy, it was hardly even fun!\" \"What was so easy?\" \"Killing the bloodsucker who was going to kill you. Now, I don't count that towards the whole murder thing,\" he added quickly. \"Vampires don't count as people.\" I could only mouth the words. \"You\u2026 killed\u2026 Laurent?\" He nodded. \"Well, it was a group effort,\" he qualified. \"Laurent is dead?\" I whispered. His expression changed. \"You're not upset about that, are you? He was going to kill you\u2014he was going for the kill, Bella, we were sure of that before we attacked. You know that, right?\" \"I know that. No, I'm not upset\u2014I'm\u2026\" I had to sit down. I stumbled back a step until I felt the driftwood against my calves, and then sank down onto it. \"Laurent is dead. He's not coming back for me.\" \"You're not mad? He wasn't one of your friends or anything, was he?\" \"My friend?\" I stared up at him, confused and dizzy with relief. I started babbling, my eyes getting moist. \"No, Jake. I'm so\u2026 so relieved. I thought he was going to find me\u2014I've been waiting for him every night, just hoping that he'd stop with me and leave Charlie alone. I've been so frightened, Jacob\u2026 But how? He was a vampire! How did you kill him? He was so strong, so hard, like marble\u2026\" He sat down next to me and put one big arm around me <em>comfortingly</em>. \"It's what we're made for, Bells. \u00a0We're strong, too. I wish you would have told me that you were so afraid. You didn't need to be.\" \"You weren't around,\" I mumbled, lost in thought. \"Oh, right.\" \"Wait, Jake\u2014I thought you knew, though. Last night, you said it wasn't safe for you to be in my room. I thought you knew that a vampire might be coming. Isn't that what you were talking about?\" He looked confused for a minute, and then he ducked his head. \"No, that's not what I meant.\" \"Then why didn't you think it was safe for you there?\" He looked at me with guilt-ridden eyes. \"I didn't say it wasn't safe for me. I was thinking of you.\" \"What do you mean?\" He looked down and kicked a rock. \"There's more than one reason I'm not supposed to be around you, Bella. I wasn't supposed to tell you our secret, for one thing, but the other part is that it's not safe for you.\u00a0 If I get too mad\u2026 too upset\u2026 you might get hurt.\" I thought about that carefully. \"When you were mad before\u2026 when I was yelling at you\u2026 and you were shaking\u2026 ?\" \"Yeah.\" His face dropped even lower. \"That was pretty stupid of me. I have to keep a better hold on myself. I swore I wasn't going to get mad, no matter what you said to me. But\u2026 I just got so upset that I was going to lose you\u2026 that you couldn't deal with what I am\u2026\" \"What would happen\u2026 if you got too mad?\" I whispered. \"I'd turn into a wolf,\" he whispered back. \"You don't need a full moon.\" He rolled his eyes. \"Hollywood's version doesn't get much right.\" Then he sighed, and was serious again. \"You don't need to be so stressed out, Bells. We're going to take care of this. And we're keeping a special eye on Charlie and the others\u2014we won't let anything happen to him. Trust me on that.\" Something very, very obvious, something I should have grasped at once\u2014but I'd been so distracted by the idea of Jacob and his friends fighting with Laurent, that I'd completely missed it at the time\u2014occurred to me only then, when Jacob used the present tense again. We're going to take care of this. It wasn't over. \"Laurent is dead,\" I gasped, and my entire body went ice cold. \"Bella?\" Jacob asked anxiously, touching my ashen cheek. \"If Laurent died\u2026 a week ago\u2026 then someone else is killing people now.\" Jacob nodded; his teeth clenched together, and he spoke through them. \"There were two of them. We thought his mate would want to fight us\u2014in our stories, they usually get pretty pissed off if you kill their mate\u2014but she just keeps running away, and then coming back again. If we could figure out what she was after, it would be easier to take her down. But she makes no sense. She keeps dancing around the edges, like she's testing our defenses, looking for a way in\u2014but in where? Where does she want to go?\u00a0 Sam thinks she's trying to separate us, so she'll have a better chance\u2026\" His voice faded until it sounded like it was coming through a long tunnel; I couldn't make out the individual words anymore. My forehead dewed with sweat and my stomach rolled like I had the stomach flu again. Exactly like I had the flu. I turned away from him quickly, and leaned over the tree trunk. My body convulsed with useless heaves, my empty stomach contracting with horrified nausea, though there was nothing in it to expel. Victoria was here. Looking for me. Killing strangers in the woods. The woods where Charlie was searching\u2026 My head spun sickeningly. Jacob's hands caught my shoulders\u2014kept me from sliding forward onto the rocks. I could feel his hot breath on my cheek. \"Bella! What's wrong?\" \"Victoria,\" I gasped as soon as I could catch my breath around the nauseous spasms. In my head, Edward snarled in fury at the name. I felt Jacob pull me up from my slump. He draped me awkwardly across his lap, laying my limp head against his shoulder. He struggled to balance me, to keep me from sagging over, one way or the other he brushed the sweaty hair back from my face. \"Who?\" Jacob asked. \"Can you hear me, Bella? Bella?\" \"She wasn't Laurent's mate,\" I moaned into his shoulder. \"They were just old friends\u2026\" \"Do you need some water? A doctor? Tell me what to do,\" he demanded, frantic. \"I'm not sick\u2014I'm scared,\" I explained in a whisper. The word scared didn't really seem to cover it. Jacob patted my back. \"Scared of this Victoria?\" I nodded, shuddering. \"Victoria is the red-haired female?\" I trembled again, and whimpered, \"Yes.\" \"How do you know she wasn't his mate?\" \"Laurent told me James was her mate,\" I explained, automatically flexing the hand with the scar. He pulled my face around, holding it steady in his big hand. He stared intently into my eyes. \"Did he tell you anything else, Bella? This is important. Do you know what she wants?\" \"Of course,\" I whispered. \"She wants me.\" His eyes flipped wide, then narrowed into slits. \"Why?\" he demanded. \"Edward killed James,\" I whispered. Jacob held me so tightly that there was no need for me to clutch at the hole\u2014he kept me in one piece. \"She did get\u2026 pissed off. But Laurent said she thought it was fairer to kill me than Edward. Mate for mate. She didn't know\u2014still doesn't know, I guess\u2014that\u2026 that\u2026\" I swallowed hard. \"That things aren't like that with us anymore. Not for Edward, anyway.\" Jacob was distracted by that, his face torn between several different expressions. \"Is that what happened? Why the Cullens left?\" \"I'm nothing but a human, after all. Nothing special,\" I explained, shrugging weakly. Something like a growl\u2014not a real growl, just a human approximation\u2014rumbled in Jacob's chest under my ear. \"If that idiot bloodsucker is honestly stupid enough\u2014\" \"Please,\" I moaned. \"Please. Don't.\" Jacob hesitated, then nodded once. \"This is important,\" he said again, his face all business now. \"This is exactly what we needed to know.We've got to tell the others right away.\" He stood, pulling me to my feet. He kept two hands on my waist until he was sure I wasn't going to fall. \"I'm okay,\" I lied. He traded his hold on my waist for one of my hands. \"Let's go.\" He pulled me back toward the truck. \"Where are we going?\" I asked. \"I'm not sure yet,\" he admitted. \"I'll call a meeting. Hey, wait here for just a minute, okay?\" He leaned me against the side of the truck and released my hand. \"Where are you going?\" \"I'll be right back,\" he promised. Then he turned and sprinted through the parking lot, across the road, and into the bordering forest. He flitted into the trees, swift and sleek as a deer. \"Jacob!\" I yelled after him hoarsely, but he was already gone. It was not a good time to be left alone. Seconds after Jacob was out of sight, I was hyperventilating. I dragged myself into the cab of the truck, and mashed the locks down at once. It didn't make me feel any better. Victoria was already hunting me. It was just luck that she hadn't found me yet\u2014just luck and five teenage werewolves. I exhaled sharply. No matter what Jacob said, the thought of him coming anywhere close to Victoria was horrifying. I didn't care what he could turn into when he got mad. I could see her in my head, her face wild, her hair like flames, deadly, indestructible\u2026 But, according to Jacob, Laurent was gone. Was that really possible? Edward\u2014I clutched automatically at my chest\u2014had told me how difficult it was to kill a vampire. Only another vampire could do the job. Yet Jake said this was what werewolves were made for\u2026 He said they were keeping a special eye on Charlie\u2014that I should trust the werewolves to keep my father safe. How could I trust that? None of us were safe! Jacob the very least of all, if he was trying to put himself between Victoria and Charlie\u2026 between Victoria and me. I felt like I might be about to throw up again. A sharp rap on the truck's window made me yelp in terror\u2014but it was just Jacob, back already. I unlocked the door with trembling, grateful fingers. \"You're really scared, aren't you?\" he asked as he climbed in. I nodded. \"Don't be. We'll take care of you\u2014and Charlie, too. I promise.\" \"The idea of you finding Victoria is scarier than the idea of her finding me,\" I whispered. He laughed. \"You've got to have a little more confidence in us than that. It's insulting.\" I just shook my head. I'd seen too many vampires in action. \"Where did you go just now?\" I asked. He pursed his lips, and said nothing. \"What? Is it a secret?\" He frowned. \"Not really. It's kind of weird, though. I don't want to freak you out.\" \"I'm sort of used to weird by this point, you know.\" I tried to smile without much success. Jacob grinned back easily. \"Guess you'd have to be. Okay. See, when we're wolves, we can\u2026 hear each other.\" My eyebrows pulled down in confusion. \"Not hear sounds,\" he went on, \"but we can hear\u2026 thoughts\u2014each other's anyway\u2014no matter how far away from each other we are. It really helps when we hunt, but it's a big pain otherwise. It's embarrassing\u2014having no secrets like that. Freaky, eh?\" \"Is that what you meant last night, when you said you would tell them you'd seen me, even though you didn't want to?\" \"You're quick.\" \"Thanks.\" \"You're also very good with weird. I thought that would bother you.\" \"It's not\u2026 well, you're not the first person I've known who could do that. So it doesn't seem so weird to me.\" \"Really?\u2026 Wait\u2014are you talking about your bloodsuckers?\" \"I wish you wouldn't call them that.\" He laughed. \"Whatever. The Cullens, then?\" \"Just\u2026 just Edward.\" I pulled one arm surreptitiously around my torso. Jacob looked surprised\u2014unpleasantly so. \"I thought those were just stories. I've heard legends about vampires who could do\u2026 extra stuff, but I thought that was just a myth.\" \"Is anything just a myth anymore?\" I asked him wryly. He scowled. \"Guess not. Okay, we're going to meet Sam and the others at the place we go to ride our bikes.\" I started the truck and headed back up the road. \"So did you just turn into a wolf now, to talk to Sam?\" I asked, curious. Jacob nodded, seeming embarrassed. \"I kept it real short\u2014I tried not to think about you so they wouldn't know what was going on. I was afraid Sam would tell me I couldn't bring you.\" \"That wouldn't have stopped me.\" I couldn't get rid of my perception of Sam as the bad guy. My teeth clenched together whenever I heard his name. \"Well, it would have stopped me,\" Jacob said, morose now. \"Remember how I couldn't finish my sentences last night? How I couldn't just tell you the whole story?\" \"Yeah. You looked like you were choking on something.\" He chuckled darkly. \"Close enough. Sam told me I couldn't tell you. He's\u2026 the head of the pack, you know. He's the Alpha. When he tells us to do something, or not to do something\u2014when he really means it, well, we can't just ignore him.\" \"Weird,\" I muttered. \"Very,\" he agreed. \"It's kind of a wolf thing.\" \"Huh\" was the best response I could think of. \"Yeah, there's a load of stuff like that\u2014wolf things. I'm still learning. I can't imagine what it was like for Sam, trying to deal with this alone.\u00a0 It sucks bad enough to go through it with a whole pack for support.\" \"Sam was alone?\" \"Yeah.\" Jacob's voice lowered. \"When I\u2026 changed, it was the most\u2026 horrible, the most terrifying thing I've ever been through\u2014worse than anything I could have imagined. But I wasn't alone\u2014there were the voices there, in my head, telling me what had happened and what I had to do. That kept me from losing my mind, I think. But Sam\u2026\" He shook his head. \"Sam had no help.\" This was going to take some adjusting. When Jacob explained it like that, it was hard not to feel compassion for Sam. I had to keep reminding myself that there was no reason to hate him anymore. \"Will they be angry that I'm with you?\" I asked. He made a face. \"Probably.\" \"Maybe I shouldn't\u2014\" \"No, it's okay,\" he assured me. \"You know a ton of things that can help us. It's not like you're just some ignorant human. You're like a\u2026 I don't know, spy or something. You've been behind enemy lines.\" I frowned to myself. Was that what Jacob would want from me? Insider information to help them destroy their enemies? I wasn't a spy, though. I hadn't been collecting that kind of information. Already, his words made me feel like a traitor. But I wanted him to stop Victoria, didn't I? No. I did want Victoria to be stopped, preferably before she tortured me to death or ran into Charlie or killed another stranger. I just didn't want Jacob to be the one to stop her, or rather to try. I didn't want Jacob within a hundred miles of her. \"Like the stuff about the mind-reading bloodsucker,\" he continued, oblivious to my reverie. \"That's the kind of thing we need to know about. That really sucks that those stories are true. It makes everything more complicated. Hey, do you think this Victoria can do anything special?\" \"I don't think so,\" I hesitated, and then sighed. \"He would have mentioned it.\" \"He? Oh, you mean Edward\u2014oops, sorry. I forgot. You don't like to say his name. Or hear it.\" I squeezed my midsection, trying to ignore the throbbing around the edges of my chest. \"Not really, no.\" \"Sorry.\" \"How do you know me so well, Jacob? Sometimes it's like you can read my mind.\" \"Naw. I just pay attention.\" We were on the little dirt road where Jacob had first taught me to ride the motorcycle. \"This good?\" I asked. \"Sure, sure.\" I pulled over and cut the engine. \"You're still pretty unhappy, aren't you?\" he murmured. I nodded, staring unseeingly into the gloomy forest. \"Did you ever think\u2026 that maybe\u2026 you're better off?\" I inhaled slowly, and then let my breath out. \"No.\" \"'Cause he wasn't the best\u2014\" \"Please, Jacob,\" I interrupted, begging in a whisper. \"Could we please not talk about this? I can't stand it.\" \"Okay.\" He took a deep breath. \"I'm sorry I said anything.\" \"Don't feel bad. If things were different, it would be nice to finally be able to talk to someone about it.\" He nodded. \"Yeah, I had a hard time keeping a secret from you for two weeks. It must be hell to not be able to talk to anyone.\" \"Hell,\" I agreed. Jacob sucked in a sharp breath. \"They're here. Let's go.\" \"Are you sure?\" I asked while he popped his door open. \"Maybe I shouldn't be here.\" \"They'll deal with it,\" he said, and then he grinned. \"Who's afraid of the big, bad wolf?\" \"Ha ha,\" I said. But I got out of the truck, hurrying around the front end to stand close beside Jacob. I remembered only too clearly the giant monsters in the meadow. My hands were trembling like Jacob's had been before, but with fear rather than rage. Jake took my hand and squeezed it. \"Here we go.\"",

VISITOR UNNATURALLY STILL AND WHITE, WITH LARGE BLACK EYES intent on my face, my visitor waited perfectly motionless in the center of the hall, beautiful beyond imagining. My knees trembled for a second, and I nearly fell. Then I hurled myself at her. \"Alice, oh, Alice!\" I cried, as I slammed into her. I'd forgotten how hard she was; it was like running headlong into a wall of cement. \"Bella?\" There was a strange mingling of relief and confusion in her voice. I locked my arms around her, gasping to inhale as much of the scent of her skin as possible. It wasn't like anything else\u2014not floral or spice, citrus or musk. No perfume in the world could compare. My memory hadn't done it justice. I didn't notice when the gasping turned into something else\u2014I only realized I was sobbing when Alice dragged me to the living room couch and pulled me into her lap. It was like curling up into a cool stone, but a stone that was contoured <em>comfortingly</em> to the shape of my body. She rubbed my back in a gentle rhythm, waiting for me to get control of myself. \"I'm\u2026 sorry,\" I blubbered. \"I'm just\u2026 so happy\u2026 to see you!\" \"It's okay, Bella. Everything's okay.\" \"Yes,\" I bawled. And, for once, it seemed that way. Alice sighed. \"I'd forgotten how exuberant you are,\" she said, and her tone was disapproving. I looked up at her through my streaming eyes. Alice's neck was tight, straining away from me, her lips pressed together firmly. Her eyes were black as pitch. \"Oh,\" I puffed, as I realized the problem. She was thirsty. And I smelled appetizing. It had been a while since I'd had to think about that kind of thing. \"Sorry.\" \"It's my own fault. It's been too long since I hunted. I shouldn't let myself get so thirsty. But I was in a hurry today.\" The look she directed at me then was a glare. \"Speaking of which, would you like to explain to me how you're alive?\" That brought me up short and stopped the sobs. I realized what must have happened immediately, and why Alice was here. I swallowed loudly. \"You saw me fall.\" \"No,\" she disagreed, her eyes narrowing. \"I saw you jump.\" I pursed my lips as I tried to think of an explanation that wouldn't sound nuts. Alice shook her head. \"I told him this would happen, but he didn't believe me. 'Bella promised,'\" her voice imitated his so perfectly that I froze in shock while the pain ripped through my torso. \"'Don't be looking for her future, either,'\" she continued to quote him. '\"We've done enough damage.\" \"But just because I'm not looking, doesn't mean I don't see\" she went on. \"I wasn't \u00a0keeping tabs on you,\u00a0 I swear, Bella. It's just that I'm already attuned to you\u2026 when I saw you jumping, I didn't think, I just got on a plane. I knew I would be too late, but I couldn't do nothing. And then I get here, thinking maybe I could help Charlie somehow, and you drive up.\" She shook her head, this time in confusion. Her voice was strained. \"I saw you go into the water and I waited and waited for you to come up, but you didn't. \u00a0\u00a0What happened? And how could you do that to Charlie? Did you stop to think what this would do to him? And my brother? Do you have any idea what Edward\u2014\" I cut her off then, as soon as she said his name. I'd let her go on, even after I realized the misunderstanding she was under, just to hear the perfect bell tone of her voice. But it was time to interrupt. \"Alice, I wasn't committing suicide.\" She eyed me dubiously. \"Are you saying you didn't jump off a cliff?\" \"No, but\u2026\" I grimaced. \"It was for recreational purposes only.\" Her expression hardened. \"I'd seen some of Jacob's friends cliff diving,\" I insisted. \"It looked like\u2026 fun, and I was bored\u2026\" She waited. \"I didn't think about how the storm would affect the currents. Actually, I didn't think about the water much at all.\" Alice didn't buy it. I could see that she still thought I had been trying to kill myself. I decided to redirect. \"So if you saw me go in, why didn't you see Jacob?\" She cocked her head to the side, distracted. I continued. \"It's true that I probably would have drowned if Jacob hadn't jumped in after me. Well, okay, there's no probably about it. But he did, and he pulled me out, and I guess he towed me back to shore, though I was kind of out for that part. It couldn't have been more than a minute that I was under before he grabbed me. How come you didn't see that?\" She frowned in perplexity. \"Someone pulled you out?\" \"Yes. Jacob saved me.\" I watched curiously as an enigmatic range of emotions flitted across her face. Something was bothering her\u2014her imperfect vision? But I wasn't sure. Then she deliberately leaned in and sniffed my shoulder. I froze. \"Don't be ridiculous,\" she muttered, sniffing at me some more. \"What are you doing?\" She ignored my question. \"Who was with you out there just now? It sounded like you were arguing.\" \"Jacob Black. He's\u2026 sort of my best friend, I guess. At least, he was\u2026\" I thought of Jacob's angry, betrayed face, and wondered what he was to me now. Alice nodded, seeming preoccupied. \"What?\" \"I don't know,\" she said. \"I'm not sure what it means.\" \"Well, I'm not dead, at least.\" She rolled her eyes. \"He was a fool to think you could survive alone. I've never seen anyone so prone to life-threatening idiocy.\" \"I survived,\" I pointed out. She was thinking of something else. \"So, if the currents were too much for you, how did this Jacob manage?\" \"Jacob is\u2026 strong.\" She heard the reluctance in my voice, and her eyebrows rose. I gnawed on my lip for a second. Was this a secret, or not? And if it was, then who was my greatest allegiance to? Jacob, or Alice? It was too hard to keep secrets, I decided. Jacob knew everything, why not Alice, too? \"See, well, he's\u2026 sort of a werewolf,\" I admitted in a rush. \"The Quileutes turn into \u00a0wolves when there are vampires around. They know Carlisle from a long time ago. Were you with Carlisle back then?\" Alice gawked at me for a moment, and then recovered herself, blinking rapidly. \"Well, I guess that explains the smell,\" she muttered. \"But does it explain what I didn't see?\" She frowned, her porcelain forehead creasing. \"The smell?\" I repeated. \"You smell awful,\" she said absently, still frowning. \"A werewolf? Are you sure about that?\"  \"Very sure,\" I promised, wincing as I remembered Paul and Jacob fighting in the road. \"I guess you weren't with Carlisle the last time there were werewolves here in Forks?\" \"No. I hadn't found him yet.\" Alice was still lost in thought. Suddenly, her eyes widened, and she turned to stare at me with a shocked expression. \"Your best friend is a \u00a0werewolf?\" I nodded sheepishly. \"How long has this been going on?\" \"Not long,\" I said, my voice sounding defensive. \"He's only been a werewolf for just a few weeks.\" She glowered at me. \"A young werewolf? Even worse! Edward was right\u2014you're a magnet for danger. Weren't you supposed to be staying out of trouble?\" \"There's nothing wrong with werewolves,\" I grumbled, stung by her critical tone. \"Until they lose their tempers.\" She shook her head sharply from side to side. \"Leave it to you, Bella.  Anyone else would be better off when the vampires left town. But you have to start hanging out with the first monsters you can find.\" I didn't want to argue with Alice\u2014I was still trembling with joy that she was really, truly here, that I could touch her marble skin and hear her wind-chime voice\u2014but she had it all wrong. \"No, Alice, the vampires didn't really leave\u2014not all of them, anyway. That's the whole trouble. If it weren't for the werewolves, Victoria would have gotten me by now. Well, if it weren't for Jake and his friends, Laurent would have gotten me before she could, I guess, so\u2014\" \"Victoria?\" she hissed. \"Laurent?\" I nodded, a teensy bit alarmed by the expression in her black eyes. I pointed at my chest. \"Danger magnet, remember?\" She shook her head again. \"Tell me everything\u2014start at the beginning.\" I glossed over the beginning, skipping the motorcycles and the voices, but telling her everything else right up to today's misadventure. Alice didn't like my thin explanation about boredom and the cliffs, so I hurried on to the strange flame I'd seen on the water and what I thought it meant. Her eyes narrowed almost to slits at that part. It was strange to see her look so\u2026 so dangerous\u2014like a vampire. I swallowed hard and went on with the rest about Harry. She listened to my story without interrupting. Occasionally, she would shake her head, and the crease in her forehead deepened until it looked like it was carved permanently into the marble of her skin. She didn't speak and, finally, I fell quiet, struck again by the borrowed grief at Harry's passing. I thought of Charlie; he would be home soon. What condition would he be in? \"Our leaving didn't do you any good at all, did it?\" Alice murmured. I laughed once\u2014it was a slightly hysterical sound. \"That was never the point, though, was it? It's not like you left for my benefit.\" Alice scowled at the floor for a moment. \"Well\u2026 I guess I acted impulsively today. I probably shouldn't have intruded.\" I could feel the blood draining from my face. My stomach dropped. \"Don't go, Alice,\" I whispered. My fingers locked around the collar of her white shirt and I began to hyperventilate. \"Please don't leave me.\" Her eyes opened wider. \"All right,\" she said, enunciating each word with slow precision. \"I'm not going anywhere tonight. Take a deep breath.\" I tried to obey, though I couldn't quite locate my lungs. She watched my face while I concentrated on my breathing. She waited till I was calmer to comment.  \"You look like hell, Bella.\" \"I drowned today,\" I reminded her. \"It goes deeper than that. You're a mess.\" I flinched. \"Look, I'm doing my best.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"It hasn't been easy. I'm working on it.\" She frowned. \"I told him,\" she said to herself. \"Alice,\" I sighed. \"What did you think you were going to find? I mean, besides me dead? Did you expect to find me skipping around and whistling show tunes? You know me better than that.\" \"I do. But I hoped.\" \"Then I guess I don't have the corner on the idiocy market.\" The phone rang. \"That has to be Charlie,\" I said, staggering to my feet. I grabbed Alice's stone hand and dragged her with me to the kitchen. I wasn't about to let her out of my sight. \"Charlie?\" I answered the phone. \"No, it's me,\" Jacob said. \"Jake!\" Alice scrutinized my expression. \"Just making sure you were still alive,\" Jacob said sourly. \"I'm fine. I told you that it wasn't\u2014\" \"Yeah. I got it. 'Bye.\" Jacob hung up on me. I sighed and let my head hang back, staring at the ceiling. \"That's going to be a problem.\" Alice squeezed my hand. \"They aren't excited I'm here.\" \"Not especially. But it's none of their business anyway.\" Alice put her arm around me. \"So what do we do now?\" she mused. She seemed to talk to herself for a moment. \"Things to do. Loose ends to tie.\" \"What things to do?\" Her face was suddenly careful. \"I don't know for sure\u2026 I need to see Carlisle.\" Would she leave so soon? My stomach dropped. \"Could you stay?\" I begged. \"Please? For just a little while. I've missed you so much.\" My voice broke. \"If you think that's a good idea.\" Her eyes were unhappy. \"I do. You can stay here\u2014Charlie would love that.\" \"I have a house, Bella.\" I nodded, disappointed but resigned. She hesitated, studying me. \"Well, I need to go get a suitcase of clothes, at the very least.\" I threw my arms around her. \"Alice, you're the best!\" \"And I think I'll need to hunt. Immediately,\" she added in a strained voice. \"Oops.\" I took a step back. \"Can you stay out of trouble for one hour?\" she asked skeptically. Then, before I could \u00a0answer, she held up one finger and closed her eyes. Her face went smooth and blank for a few seconds. And then her eyes opened and she answered her own question. \"Yes, you'll be fine. For tonight, anyway.\" She grimaced. Even making faces, she looked like an angel. \"You'll come back?\" I asked in a small voice. \"I promise\u2014one hour.\" I glanced at the clock over the kitchen table. She laughed and leaned in quickly to kiss me on the cheek. Then she was gone. I took a deep breath. Alice would be back. I suddenly felt so much better. I had plenty to do to keep myself busy while I waited. A shower was definitely first on the agenda. I sniffed my shoulders as I undressed, but I couldn't smell anything but the brine and seaweed scent of the ocean. I wondered what Alice had meant about me smelling bad. When I was cleaned up, I went back to the kitchen. I couldn't see any signs that Charlie had eaten recently, and he would probably be hungry when he got back. I hummed tunelessly to myself as I moved around the kitchen. While Thursday's casserole rotated in the microwave, I made up the couch with sheets and an old pillow. Alice wouldn't need it, but Charlie would need to see it. I was careful not to watch the clock. There was no reason to start myself panicking; Alice had promised. I hurried through my dinner, not tasting it\u2014just feeling the ache as it slid down my raw throat. Mostly I was thirsty; I must have drunk a half gallon of water by the time I was finished. All the salt in my system had dehydrated me. I went to go try to watch TV while I waited. Alice was already there, sitting on her improvised bed. Her eyes were a liquid butterscotch. She smiled and patted the pillow. \"Thanks.\" \"You're early,\" I said, elated. I sat down next to her and leaned my head on her shoulder. She put her cold arms around me and sighed. \"Bella. What are we going to do with you?\" \"I don't know,\" I admitted. \"I really have been trying my hardest.\" \"I believe you.\" It was silent. \"Does\u2014does he\u2026\" I took a deep breath. It was harder to say his name out loud, even though I was able to think it now. \"Does Edward know you're here?\" I couldn't help asking. It was my pain, after all. I'd deal with it when she was gone, I promised myself, and felt sick at the thought. \"No.\" There was only one way that could be true. \"He's not with Carlisle and Esme?\" \"He checks in every few months.\" \"Oh.\" He must still be out enjoying his distractions. I focused my curiosity on a safer topic. \"You said you flew here\u2026 Where did you come from?\" \"I was in Denali. Visiting Tanya's family.\" \"Is Jasper here? Did he come with your'\" She shook her head. \"He didn't approve of my interfering. We promised\u2026\" she trailed off, and then her tone changed. \"And you think Charlie won't mind my being here?\" she asked, sounding worried. \"Charlie thinks you're wonderful, Alice.\" \"Well, we're about to find out.\" Sure enough, a few seconds later I heard the cruiser pull into the driveway. I jumped up and hurried to open the door. Charlie trudged slowly up the walk, his eyes on the ground and his shoulders slumped. I walked forward to meet him; he didn't even see me until I hugged him around the waist. He embraced me back fiercely. \"I'm so sorry about Harry, Dad.\" \"I'm really going to miss him,\" Charlie mumbled. \"How's Sue doing?\" \"She seems dazed, like she hasn't grasped it yet. Sam's staying with her\u2026\" The volume of his voice faded in and out. \"Those poor kids. Leah's just a year older than you, and Seth is only fourteen\u2026\" He shook his head. He kept his arms tight around me as he started toward the door again. \"Um, Dad?\" I figured I'd better warn him. \"You'll never guess who's here.\" He looked at me blankly. His head swiveled around, and he spied the Mercedes across the street, the porch light reflecting off the glossy black paint. Before he could react, Alice was in the doorway. \"Hi, Charlie,\" she said in a subdued voice. \"I'm sorry I came at such a bad time.\" \"Alice Cullen?\" he peered at the slight figure in front of him as if he doubted what his eyes were telling him. \"Alice, is that you?\" \"It's me,\" she confirmed. \"I was in the neighborhood.\" \"Is Carlisle\u2026?\" \"No, I'm alone.\" Both Alice and I knew he wasn't really asking about Carlisle. His arm tightened over my shoulder. \"She can stay here, can't she?\" I pleaded. \"I already asked her.\" \"Of course,\" Charlie said mechanically. \"We'd love to have you, Alice.\" \"Thank you, Charlie. I know it's horrid timing.\" \"No, it's fine, really. I'm going to be really busy doing what I can for Harry's family; it will be nice for Bella to have some company.\" \"There's dinner for you on the table, Dad,\" I told him. \"Thanks, Bell.\" He gave me one more squeeze before he shuffled toward the kitchen. Alice went back to the couch, and I followed her. This time, she was the one to pull me against her shoulder. \"You look tired.\" \"Yeah,\" I agreed, and shrugged. \"Near-death experiences do that to me\u2026 So, what does Carlisle think of you being here?\" \"He doesn't know. He and Esme were on a hunting trip. I'll hear from him in a few days, when he gets back.\" \"You won't tell him, though\u2026 when he checks in again?\" I asked. She knew I didn't mean Carlisle now. \"No. He'd bite my head off,\" Alice said grimly. I laughed once, and then sighed. I didn't want to sleep. I wanted to stay up all night talking to Alice. And it didn't make sense for me to be tired, what with crashing on Jacob's couch all day. But drowning really had taken a lot out of me, and my eyes wouldn't stay open. I rested my head on her stone shoulder, and drifted into a more peaceful oblivion than I had any hope of. I woke early, from a deep and dreamless sleep, feeling well-rested, but stiff. I was on the couch tucked under the blankets I'd laid out for Alice, and I could hear her and Charlie talking in the kitchen. It sounded like Charlie was fixing her breakfast. \"How bad was it, Charlie?\" Alice asked softly, and at first I thought they were talking about the Clear waters. Charlie sighed. \"Real bad.\" \"Tell me about it. I want to know exactly what happened when we left.\" There was a pause while a cupboard door was closed and a dial on the stove was clicked off. I waited, cringing. \"I've never felt so helpless,\" Charlie began slowly. \"I didn't know what to do. That first week\u2014I thought I was going to have to hospitalize her. She wouldn't eat or drink, she wouldn't move. Dr. Gerandy was throwing around words like 'catatonic,' but I didn't let him up to see her. I was afraid it would scare her.\" \"She snapped out of it though?\" \"I had Renee come to take her to Florida. I just didn't want to be the one\u2026 if she had to go to a hospital or something. I hoped being with her mother would help. But when we started packing her clothes, she woke up with a vengeance. I've never seen Bella throw a fit like that. She was never one for the tantrums, but, boy, did she fly into a fury. She threw her clothes everywhere and screamed that we couldn't make her leave\u2014and then she finally started crying. I thought that would be the turning point. I didn't argue when she insisted on staying here\u2026 and she did seem to get better at first\u2026\" Charlie trailed off. It was hard listening to this, knowing how much pain I'd caused him. \"But?\" Alice prompted. \"She went back to school and work, she ate and slept and did her homework. She answered when someone asked her a direct question. But she was\u2026 empty. Her eyes were blank. There were lots of little things\u2014she wouldn't listen to music anymore; I found a bunch of CDs broken in the trash. She didn't read; she wouldn't be in the same room when the TV was on, not that she watched it so much before. I finally figured it out\u2014she was avoiding everything that might remind her of\u2026 him. \"We could hardly talk; I was so worried about saying something that would upset her\u2014the littlest things would make her flinch\u2014and she never volunteered anything. She would just answer if I asked her something. \"She was alone all the time. She didn't call her friends back, and after a while, they stopped calling. \"It was night of the living dead around here. I still hear her screaming in her sleep\u2026\" I could almost see him shuddering. I shuddered, too, remembering. And then I sighed. I hadn't fooled him at all, not for one second. \"I'm so sorry, Charlie,\" Alice said, voice glum. \"It's not your fault.\" The way he said it made it perfectly clear that he was holding someone responsible. \"You were always a good friend to her.\" \"She seems better now, though.\" \"Yeah. Ever since she started hanging out with Jacob Black, I've noticed a real improvement. She has some color in her cheeks when she comes home, some light in her eyes. She's happier.\" He paused, and his voice was different when he spoke again. \"He's a year or so younger than her, and I know she used to think of him as a friend, but I think maybe it's something more now, or headed that direction, anyway.\" Charlie said this in a tone that was almost belligerent. It was a warning, not for Alice, but for her to pass along. \"Jake's old for his years,\" he continued, still sounding defensive. \"He's taken care of his father physically the way Bella took care of her mother \u00a0emotionally. It matured him. He's a good-looking kid, too\u2014takes after his mom's side. He's good for Bella, you know,\" Charlie insisted.  \"Then it's good she has him,\" Alice agreed. Charlie sighed out a big gust of air, folding quickly to the lack of opposition. \"Okay, so I guess that's overstating things. I don't know\u2026 even with Jacob, now and then I see something in her eyes, and I wonder if I've ever grasped how much pain she's really in It's not normal, Alice, and it\u2026 it frightens me. Not normal at all. Not like someone\u2026 left her, but like someone died.\" His voice cracked. It was like someone had died\u2014like I had died. Because it had been more than just losing the truest of true loves, as if that were not enough to kill anyone. It was also losing a whole future, a whole family\u2014the whole life that I'd chosen\u2026 Charlie went on in a hopeless tone. \"I don't know if she's going to get over it\u2014I'm not sure if it's in her nature to heal from something like this. She's always been such a constant little thing. She doesn't get past things, change her mind.\" \"She's one of a kind,\" Alice agreed in a dry voice. \"And Alice\u2026\" Charlie hesitated. \"Now, you know how fond I am of you, and I can tell that she's happy to see you, but\u2026 I'm a little worried about what your visit will do to her.\" \"So am I, Charlie, so am I. I wouldn't have come if I'd had any idea. I'm sorry.\" \"Don't apologize, honey. Who knows? Maybe it will be good for her.\" \"I hope you're right.\" There was a long break while forks scraped plates and Charlie chewed. I wondered where Alice was hiding the food. \"Alice, I have to ask you something,\" Charlie said awkwardly. Alice was calm. \"Go ahead.\" \"He's not coming back to visit, too, is he?\" I could hear the suppressed anger in Charlie's voice. Alice answered in a soft, reassuring tone. \"He doesn't even know I'm here. The last time I spoke with him, he was in South America.\" I stiffened as I heard this new information, and listened harder. \"That's something, at least.\" Charlie snorted. \"Well, I hope he's enjoying himself.\" For the first time, Alice's voice had a bit of steel in it. \"I wouldn't make assumptions, Charlie.\" I knew how her eyes would flash when she used that tone. A chair scooted from the table, scraping loudly across the floor. I pictured Charlie getting up; there was no way Alice would make that kind of noise. The faucet ran, splashing against a dish. It didn't sound like they were going to say anything more about Edward, so I decided it was time to wake up. I turned over, bouncing against the springs to make them squeak. Then I yawned loudly. All was quiet in the kitchen. I stretched and groaned. \"Alice?\" I asked innocently; the soreness rasping in my throat added nicely to the charade. \"I'm in the kitchen, Bella,\" Alice called, no hint in her voice that she suspected my eavesdropping. But she was good at hiding things like that. Charlie had to leave then\u2014he was helping Sue Clearwater with the funeral arrangements. It would have been a very long day without Alice. She never spoke about leaving, and I didn't ask her. I knew it was inevitable, but I put it out of my mind. Instead, we talked about her family\u2014all but one. Carlisle was working nights in Ithaca and teaching part time at Cornell. Esme was restoring a seventeenth century house, a historical monument, in the forest north of the city. Emmett and Rosalie had gone to Europe for a few months on another honeymoon, but they were back now. Jasper was at Cornell, too, studying philosophy this time. And Alice had been doing some personal research, concerning the information I'd accidentally uncovered for her last spring. She'd successfully tracked down the asylum where she'd spent the last years of her human life. The life she had no memory of. \"My name was Mary Alice Brandon,\" she told me quietly. \"I had a little sister named Cynthia. Her daughter\u2014my niece\u2014is still alive in Biloxi.\" \"Did you find out why they put you in\u2026 that place?\" What would drive parents to that extreme? Even if their daughter saw visions of the future\u2026 She just shook her head, her topaz eyes thoughtful. \"I couldn't find much about them. I went through all the old newspapers on microfiche. My family wasn't mentioned often; they weren't part of the social circle that made the papers. My parents' engagement was there, and Cynthia's.\" The name fell uncertainly from her tongue. \"My birth was announced\u2026 and my death. I found my grave. I also filched my admissions sheet from the old asylum archives. The date on the admission and the date on my tombstone are the same.\" I didn't know what to say, and, after a short pause, Alice moved on to lighter topics. The Cullens were reassembled now, with the one exception, spending Cornell's spring break in Denali with Tanya and her family. I listened too eagerly to even the most trivial news. She never mentioned the one I was most interested in, and for that I was grateful. It was enough to listen to the stories of the family I'd once dreamed of belonging to. Charlie didn't get back until after dark, and he looked more worn than he had the night before. He would be headed back to the reservation first thing in the morning for Harry's funeral, so he turned in early. I stayed on the couch with Alice again. Charlie was almost a stranger when he came down the stairs before the sun was up, wearing an old suit I'd never seen him in before. The jacket hung open; I guessed it was too tight to fasten the buttons. His tie was a bit wide for the current style. He tiptoed to the door, trying not to wake us up. I let him go, pretending to sleep, as Alice did on the recliner. As soon as he was out the door, Alice sat up. Under the quilt, she was fully dressed. \"So, what are we doing today?\" she asked. \"I don't know\u2014do you see anything interesting happening?\" She smiled and shook her head. \"But it's still early.\" All the time I'd been spending in La Push meant a pile of things I'd been neglecting at home, and I decided to catch up on my chores. I wanted to do something, anything that might make life easier for Charlie\u2014maybe it would make him feel just a little better to come home to a clean, organized house. I started with the bathroom\u2014it showed the most signs of neglect. While I worked, Alice leaned against the doorjamb and asked nonchalant questions about my, well, our high school friends and what they been up to since she'd left. Her face stayed casual and emotionless, but I sensed her disapproval when she realized how little I could tell her. Or maybe I just had a guilty conscience after eavesdropping on her conversation with Charlie yesterday morning. I was literally up to my elbows in Comet, scrubbing the floor of the bathtub, when the doorbell rang. I looked to Alice at once, and her expression was perplexed, almost worried, which was strange; Alice was never taken by surprise. \"Hold on!\" I shouted in the general direction of the front door, getting up and hurrying to the sink to rinse my arms off. \"Bella,\" Alice said with a trace of frustration in her voice, \"I have a fairly good guess who that might be, and I think I'd better step out.\" \"Guess?\" I echoed. Since when did Alice have to guess anything? \"If this is a repeat of my egregious lapse in foresight yesterday, then it's most likely Jacob Black or one of his\u2026 friends.\" I stared at her, putting it together. \"You can't see werewolves?\" She grimaced. \"So it would seem.\" She was obviously annoyed by this fact\u2014very annoyed. The doorbell rang again\u2014buzzing twice quickly and impatiently. \"You don't have go anywhere, Alice. You were here first.\" She laughed her silvery little laugh\u2014it had a dark edge. \"Trust me\u2014it wouldn't be a good idea to have me and Jacob Black in a room together.\" She kissed my cheek swiftly before she vanished through Charlie's door\u2014and out his back window, no doubt.
