            "en": "7 REPETITION        7 REPETITION I wasn't sure what the hell i was doing here. Was I trying to push myself back into the zombie stupor? Had I turned <em>masochistic</em> \u2014 developed a taste for torture? I should have gone straight down to La Push I felt much, much healthier around Jacob. This was not a healthy thing to do. But I continued to drive slowly down the overgrown lane, twisting through the trees that arched over me like a green, living tunnel. My hands were shaking, so I tightened my grip on the steering wheel. I knew that part of the reason I did this was the nightmare, now that I was really awake, the nothingness of the dream gnawed on my nerves, a dog worrying a bone. There was something to search for. Unattainable and impossible, uncaring and\u00a0\u00a0 distracted\u2026 but he was out there, somewhere. I had to believe that. The other part was the strange sense of repetition I'd felt at school today, the coincidence of the date. The feeling that I was starting over\u2014perhaps the way my first day would have gone if I'd really been the most unusual person in the cafeteria that afternoon. The words ran through my head, tonelessly, like I was reading them rather than hearing them spoken: It will be as if I'd never existed. I was lying to myself by splitting my reason for coming here into just two parts. I didn't want to admit the strongest motivation. Because it was mentally unsound. The truth was that I wanted to hear his voice again, like I had in the strange delusion Friday night. For that brief moment, when his voice came from some other part of me than my conscious memory, when his voice was perfect and honey smooth rather than the pale echo my memories usually produced, I was able to remember without pain. It hadn't lasted; the pain had caught up with me, as I was sure it would for this fool's errand. But those precious moments when I could hear him again were an irresistible lure. I had to find some way to repeat the experience\u2026 or maybe the better word was episode. I was hoping that d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu was the key. So I was going to his home, a place I hadn't been since my ill-fated birthday party, so many months ago. The thick, almost jungle-like growth crawled slowly past my windows. The drive wound on and on. I started to go faster, getting edgy. How long had I been driving? Shouldn't I have reached the house yet? The lane was so overgrown that it did not look familiar. What if I couldn't find it? I shivered. What if there was no tangible proof at all? Then there was the break in the trees that I was looking for, only it was not so\u00a0 pronounced as before. The flora here did not wait long to reclaim any land that was left unguarded. The tall ferns had infiltrated the meadow around the house, crowding against the trunks of the cedars, even the wide porch. It was like the lawn had been flooded\u2014waist-high\u2014with green, feathery waves. And the house was there, but it was not the same. Though nothing had changed on the outside, the emptiness screamed from the blank windows. It was creepy. For the first time since I'd seen the beautiful house, it looked like a fitting haunt for vampires. I hit the brakes, looking away. I was afraid to go farther. But nothing happened. No voice in my head. So I left the engine running and jumped out into the fern sea. Maybe, like Friday night, if I walked forward\u2026 I approached the barren, vacant face slowly, my truck rumbling out a comforting roar behind me. I stopped when I got to the porch stairs, because there was nothing here. No lingering sense of their presence\u2026 of his presence. The house was solidly here, but it meant little. Its concrete reality would not counteract the nothingness of the nightmares. I didn't go any closer. I didn't want to look in the windows. I wasn't sure which would be harder to see. If the rooms were bare, echoing empty from floor to ceiling, that would certainly hurt. Like my grandmother's funeral, when my mother had insisted that I stay outside during the viewing. She had said that I didn't need to see Gran that way, to remember her that way, rather than alive. But wouldn't it be worse if there were no change? If the couches sat just as I'd last seen them, the paintings on the walls\u2014worse still, the piano on its low platform? It would be second only to the house disappearing all together, to see that there was no physical possession that tied them in anyway. That everything remained, untouched and forgotten, behind them. Just like me. I turned my back on the gaping emptiness and hurried to my truck. I nearly ran. I was anxious to be gone, to get back to the human world. I felt hideously empty, and I wanted to see Jacob. Maybe I was developing a new kind of sickness, another addiction, like the numbness before. I didn't care. I pushed my truck as fast as it would go as I barreled toward my fix. Jacob was waiting for me. My chest seemed to relax as soon as I saw him, making it easier to breathe. \"Hey, Bella,\" he called. I smiled in relief. \"Hey, Jacob,\" I waved at Billy, who was looking out the window. \"Let's get to work,\" Jacob said in a low but eager voice. I was somehow able to laugh. \"You seriously aren't sick of me yet?\" I wondered. He must be starting to ask himself how desperate I was for company. Jacob led the way around the house to his garage. \"Nope. Not yet.\" \"Please let me know when I start getting on your nerves. I don't want to be a pain.\" \"Okay.\" He laughed, a throaty sound. \"I wouldn't hold your breath for that, though.\" When I walked into the garage, I was shocked to see the red bike standing up, looking like a motorcycle rather than a pile of jagged metal. \"Jake, you're amazing,\" I breathed. He laughed again. \"I get obsessive when I have a project.\" He shrugged. \"If I had any brains I'd drag it out a little bit.\" \"Why?\" He looked down, pausing for so long that I wondered if he hadn't heard my question. Finally, he asked me, \"Bella, if I told you that I couldn't fix these bikes, what would you say?\" I didn't answer right away, either, and he glanced up to check my expression. \"I would say\u2026 that's too bad, but I'll bet we could figure out something else to do. If we got really desperate, we could even do homework.\" Jacob smiled, and his shoulders relaxed. He sat down next to the bike and picked up a wrench. \"So you think you'll still come over when I'm done, then?\" \"Is that what you meant?\" I shook my head. \"I guess I am taking advantage of your very underpriced mechanical skills. But as long as you let me come over, I'll be here.\" \"Hoping to see Quil again?\" he teased. \"You caught me.\" He chuckled. \"You really like spending time with me?\" he asked, marveling. \"Very, very much. And I'll prove it. I have to work tomorrow, but Wednesday we'll do something nonmechanical.\" \"Like what?\" \"I have no idea. We can go to my place so you won't be tempted to be obsessive. You could bring your schoolwork\u2014you have to be getting behind, because I know I am.\" \"Homework might be a good idea.\" He made a face, and I wondered how much he was leaving undone to be with me. \"Yes,\" I agreed. \"We'll have to start being responsible occasionally, or Billy and Charlie aren't going to be so easygoing about this.\" I made a gesture indicating the two of us as a single entity. He liked that\u2014he beamed. \"Homework once a week?\" he proposed. \"Maybe we'd better go with twice,\" I suggested, thinking of the pile I'd just been assigned today. He sighed a heavy sigh. Then he reached over his toolbox to a paper grocery sack. He pulled out two cans of soda, cracking one open and handing it to me. He opened the second, and held it up ceremoniously. \"Here's to responsibility,\" he toasted. \"Twice a week.\" \"And recklessness every day in between,\" I emphasized. He grinned and touched his can to mine. I got home later than I'd planned and found Charlie had ordered a pizza rather than wait for me. He wouldn't let me apologize. \"I don't mind,\" he assured me. \"You deserve a break from all the cooking, anyway.\" I knew he was just relieved that I was still acting like a normal person, and he was not about to rock the boat. I checked my e-mail before I started on my homework, and there was a long one from Renee. She gushed over every detail I'd provided her with, so I sent back another exhaustive description of my day. Everything but the motorcycles. Even happy-go-lucky Renee was likely to be alarmed by that. School Tuesday had its ups and downs. Angela and Mike seemed ready to welcome me back with open arms\u2014to kindly overlook my few months of aberrant behavior. Jess was more resistant. I wondered if she needed a formal written apology for the Port Angeles incident. Mike was animated and chatty at work. It was like he'd stored up the semester's worth of talk, and it was all spilling out now. I found that I was able to smile and laugh with him, though it wasn't as effortless as it was with Jacob. It seemed harmless enough, until quitting time. Mike put the closed sign in the window while I folded my vest and shoved it under the counter. \"This was fun tonight,\" Mike said happily. \"Yeah,\" I agreed, though I'd much rather have spent the afternoon in the garage. \"It's too bad that you had to leave the movie early last week.\" I was a little confused by his train of thought. I shrugged. \"I'm just a wimp, I guess.\" \"What I mean is, you should go to a better movie, something you'd enjoy,\" he explained. \"Oh,\" I muttered, still confused. \"Like maybe this Friday. With me. We could go see something that isn't scary at all.\" I bit my lip. I didn't want to screw things up with Mike, not when he was one of the only people ready to forgive me for being crazy. But this, again, felt far too familiar. Like the last year had never happened. I wished I had Jess as an excuse this time. \"Like a date?\" I asked. Honesty was probably the best policy at this point. Get it over with. He processed the tone of my voice \"If you want. But it doesn't have to be like that.\" \"I don't date,\" I said slowly, realizing how true that was. That whole world seemed impossibly distant. \"Just as friends?\" he suggested. His clear blue eyes were not as eager now. I hoped he really meant that we could be friends anyway. \"That would be fun. But I actually have plans already this Friday, so maybe next week?\" \"What are you doing?\" he asked, less casually than I think he wanted to sound. \"Homework. I have a\u2026 study session planned with a friend.\" \"Oh. Okay. Maybe next week.\" He walked me to my car, less exuberant than before. It reminded me so clearly of my first months in Forks. I'd come full circle, and now everything felt like an echo\u2014an empty echo, devoid of the interest it used to have. The next night, Charlie didn't seem the smallest bit surprised to find Jacob and me sprawled across the living room floor with our books scattered around us, so I guessed that he and Billy were talking behind our backs. \"Hey, kids,\" he said, his eyes straying to the kitchen. The smell of the lasagna I'd spent the afternoon making\u2014while Jacob watched and occasionally sampled\u2014wafted down the hall; I was being good, trying to atone for all the pizza. Jacob stayed for dinner, and took a plate home for Billy. He grudgingly added another year to my negotiable age for being a good cook. Friday was the garage, and Saturday, after my shift at Newton's, was homework again. Charlie felt secure enough in my sanity to spend the day fishing with Harry. When he got back, we were all done\u2014feeling very sensible and mature about it, too\u2014and watching Monster Garage on the Discovery Channel. \"I probably ought to go.\" Jacob sighed. \"It's later than I thought.\" \"Okay, fine,\" I grumbled. \"I'll take you home.\" He laughed at my unwilling expression\u2014it seemed to please him. \"Tomorrow, back to work,\" I said as soon as we were safe in the truck. \"What time do you want me to come up?\" There was an unexplained excitement in his answering smile. \"I'll call you first, okay?\" \"Sure.\" I frowned to myself, wondering what was up. His smile widened. I cleaned the house the next morning\u2014waiting for Jacob to call and trying to shake off the Litest nightmare. The scenery had changed. Last night I'd wandered in a wide sea of ferns interspersed with huge hemlock trees. There was nothing else there, and I was lost, wandering aimless and alone, searching for nothing. I wanted to kick myself for the stupid field trip last week. I shoved the dream out of my conscious mind, hoping it would stay locked up somewhere and not escape again. Charlie was outside washing the cruiser, so when the phone rang, I dropped the toilet brush and ran downstairs to answer it. \"Hello?\" I asked breathlessly. \"Bella,\" Jacob said, a strange, formal tone to his voice. \"Hey, Jake.\" \"I believe that\u2026 we have a date\" he said, his tone thick with implications. It took me a second before I got it. \"They're done? I can't believe it!\" What perfect timing. I needed something to distract me from nightmares and nothingness. \"Yeah, they run and everything.\" \"Jacob, you are absolutely, without a doubt, the most talented and wonderful person I know. You get ten years for this one.\" \"Cool! I'm middle-aged now.\" I laughed. \"I'm on my way up!\" I threw the cleaning supplies under the bathroom counter and grabbed my jacket. \"Headed to see Jake,\" Charlie said when I ran past him. It wasn't really a question. \"Yep,\" I replied as I jumped in my truck. \"I'll be at the station later,\" Charlie called after me. \"Okay,\" I yelled back, turning the key. Charlie said something else, but I couldn't hear him clearly over the roar of the engine. It sounded sort of like, \"Where's the fire?\" I parked my truck off to the side of the Blacks' house, close to the trees, to make it easier for us to sneak the bikes out. When I got out, a splash of color caught my eye\u2014two shiny motorcycles, one red, one black, were hidden under a spruce, invisible from the house. Jacob was prepared. There was a piece of blue ribbon tied in a small bow around each of the handlebars. I was laughing at that when Jacob ran out of the house. \"Ready?\" he asked in a low voice, his eyes sparkling. I glanced over his shoulder, and there was no sign of Billy. \"Yeah,\" I said, but I didn't feel quite as excited as before; I was trying to imagine myself actually on the motorcycle. Jacob loaded the bikes into the bed of the truck with ease, laying them carefully on their sides so they didn't show. \"Let's go,\" he said, his voice higher than usual with excitement. \"I know the perfect spot\u2014no one will catch us there.\" We drove south out of town. The dirt road wove in and out of the forest\u2014sometimes there was nothing but trees, and then there would suddenly be a breathtaking glimpse of the Pacific Ocean, reaching to the horizon, dark gray under the clouds. We were above the shore, on top of the cliffs that bordered the beach here and the view seemed to stretch on forever. I was driving slowly, so that I could safely stare out across the ocean now and then, as the road wound closer to the sea cliffs. Jacob was talking about finishing the bikes, but his descriptions were getting technical, so I wasn't paying close attention. That was when I noticed four figures standing on a rocky ledge, much too close to the precipice. I couldn't tell from the distance how old they were, but I assumed they were men. Despite the chill in the air today, they seemed to be wearing only shorts. As I watched, the tallest person stepped closer to the brink. I slowed automatically, my foot hesitating over the brake pedal. And then he threw himself off the edge. \"No!\" I shouted, stomping down on the brake. \"What's wrong?\" Jacob shouted back, alarmed.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \"That guy\u2014he just jumped off the cliff! Why didn't they stop him? We've got to call an ambulance!\" I threw open my door and started to get out, which made no sense at all. The fastest way to a phone was to drive back to Billy's. But I couldn't believe what I'd just seen. Maybe, subconsciously, I hoped I would see something different without the glass of the windshield in the way. Jacob laughed, and I spun to stare at him wildly. How could he be so calloused, so cold-blooded? \"They're just cliff diving, Bella. Recreation. La Push doesn't have a mall, you know.\" He was teasing, but there was a strange note of irritation in his voice. \"Cliff diving?\" I repeated, dazed. I stared in disbelief as a second figure stepped to the edge, paused, and then very gracefully leaped into space. He fell for what seemed like an eternity to me, finally cutting smoothly into the dark gray waves below. \"Wow. It's so high.\" I slid back into my seat, still staring wide-eyed at the two remaining divers. \"It must be a hundred feet.\" \"Well, yeah, most of us jump from lower down, that rock that juts out from the cliff about halfway.\" He pointed out his window. The place he indicated did seem much more reasonable. \"Those guys are insane. Probably showing off how tough they are. I mean, really, it's freezing today. That water can't feel good.\" He made a disgruntled face, as if the stunt personally offended him. It surprised me a little. I would have thought Jacob was nearly impossible to upset. \"You jump off the cliff?\" I hadn't missed the \"us.\" \"Sure, sure.\" He shrugged and grinned. \"It's fun. A little scary, kind of a rush.\" I looked back at the cliffs, where the third figure was pacing the edge. I'd never witnessed anything so reckless in all my life. My eyes widened, and I smiled. \"Jake, you have to take me cliff diving.\" He frowned back at me, his face disapproving. \"Bella, you just wanted to call an ambulance for Sam,\" he reminded me. I was surprised that he could tell who it was from this distance. \"I want to try,\" I insisted, start ing to get out of the car again. Jacob grabbed my wrist. \"Not today, all right? Can we at least wait for a warmer day?\" \"Okay, fine,\" I agreed. With the door open, the glacial breeze was raising goose bumps on my arm. \"But I want to go soon.\" \"Soon.\" He rolled his eyes. \"Sometimes you're a little strange, Bella. Do you know that?\" I sighed. \"Yes.\" \"And we're not jumping off the top.\" I watched, fascinated, as the third boy made a running start and flung himself farther into the empty air than the other two. He twisted and cart wheeled through space as he fell, like he was skydiving. He looked absolutely free\u2014 unthinking and utterly irresponsible. \"Fine,\" I agreed. \"Not the first time, anyway.\" Now Jacob sighed. \"Are we going to try out the bikes or not?\" he demanded. \"Okay, okay,\" I said, tearing my eyes away from the last person waiting on the cliff. I put my seat belt back on and closed the door. The engine was still running, roaring as it idled. We started down the road again. \"So who were those guys\u2014the crazy ones?\" I wondered. He made a disgusted sound in the back of his throat. \"The La Push gang.\" \"You have a gang?\" I asked. I realized that I sounded impressed. He laughed once at my reaction. \"Not like that. I swear, they're like hall monitors gone bad. They don't start fights, they keep the peace.\" He snorted. \"There was this guy from up somewhere by the Makah rez, big guy too, scary-looking. Well, word got around that he was selling meth to kids, and Sam Uley and his disciples ran him off our land. They're all about our land, and tribe pride\u2026 it's getting ridiculous. The worst part is that the council takes them seriously. Embry said that the council actually meets with Sam.\" He shook his head, face full of resentment. \"Embry also heard from Leah Clearwater that they call themselves 'protectors' or something like that.\" Jacob's hands were clenched into fists, as if he'd like to hit something. I'd never seen this side of him.  I was surprised to hear Sam Uley's name. I didn't want it to bring back the images from my nightmare, so I made a quick observation to distract myself. \"You don't like them very much.\" \"Does it show?\" he asked sarcastically. \"Well\u2026 It doesn't sound like they're doing anything bad.\" I tried to soothe him, to make him cheerful again. \"Just sort of annoyingly goody-two-shoes for a gang.\" \u201cYeah. Annoying is a good word. They're always showing off\u2014like the cliff thing. They act like\u2026 like, I don't know. Like tough guys. I was hanging out at the store with Embry and Quil once, last semester, and Sam came by with his followers, Jared and Paul. Quil said something, you know how he's got a big mouth, and it pissed Paul off. His eyes got all dark, and he sort of smiled\u2014no, he showed his teeth but he didn't smile\u2014and it was like he was so mad he was shaking or something. But Sam put his hand against Paul's chest and shook his head. Paul looked at him for a minute and calmed down. Honestly, it was like Sam was holding him back\u2014like Paul was going to tear us up if Sam didn't stop him.\" He groaned. \"Like a bad western. You know, Sam's a pretty big guy, he's twenty. But Paul's just sixteen, too, shorter than me and not as beefy as Quil. I think any one of us could take him.\" \"Tough guys,\" I agreed. I could see it in my head as he described it, and it reminded me of something\u2026 a trio of tall, dark men standing very still and close together in my father's living room. The picture was sideways, because my head was lying against the couch while Dr. Gerandy and Charlie leaned over me\u2026 Had that been Sam's gang? I spoke quickly again to divert myself from the bleak memories. \"Isn't Sam a little too old for this kind of thing?\" \"Yeah. He was supposed to go to college, but he stayed. And no one gave him any crap about it, either.\u00a0 The whole council pitched a fit when my sister turned down a partial scholarship and got married. But, oh no, Sam Uley can do no wrong.\" His face was set in unfamiliar lines of outrage\u2014outrage and something else I didn't recognize at first. \"It all sounds really annoying and\u2026 strange. But I don't get why you're taking it so personally.\" I peeked over at his face, hoping I hadn't offended him. He was suddenly calm, staring out the side window. \"You just missed the turn,\" he said in an even voice. I executed a very wide U-turn, nearly hitting a tree as my circle ran the truck halfway off the road. \"Thanks for the heads-up,\" I muttered as I started up the side road. \"Sorry, I wasn't paying attention.\" It was quiet for a brief minute. \"You can stop anywhere along here,\" he said softly. I pulled over and cut the engine. My ears rang in the silence that followed. We both got out, and Jacob headed around to the back to get the bikes. I tried to read his expression. Something more was bothering him. I'd hit a nerve. He smiled halfheartedly as he pushed the red bike to my side. \"Happy late birthday. Are you ready for this?\" \"I think so.\" The bike suddenly looked intimidating, frightening, as I realized I would soon be astride it. \"We'll take it slow,\" he promised. I gingerly leaned the motorcycle against the truck's fender while he went to get his. \"Jake\u2026\"I hesitated as he came back around the truck. \"Yeah?\" \"What's really bothering you? About the Sam thing, I mean? Is there something else?\" I watched his face. He grimaced, but he didn't seem angry. He looked at the dirt and kicked his shoe against the front tire of his bike again and again, like he was keeping time. He sighed. \"It's just\u2026 the way they treat me. It creeps me out.\" The words started to rush out now. \"You know, the council is supposed to be made up of equals, but if there was a leader, it would be my dad. I've never been able to figure out why people treat him the way they do. Why his opinion counts the most. It's got something to do with his father and his father's father. My great-grandpa, Ephraim Black, was sort of the last chief we had, and they still listen to Billy, maybe because of that.\u201d  \"But I'm just like everyone else. Nobody treats me special\u2026 until now.\" That caught me off guard. \"Sam treats you special?\" \"Yeah,\" he agreed, looking up at me with troubled eyes. \"He looks at me like he's waiting for something\u2026 like I'm going to join his stupid gang someday. He pays more attention to me than any of the other guys. I hate it.\" \"You don't have to join anything.\" My voice was angry. This was really upsetting Jacob, and that infuriated me. Who did these \"protectors\" think they were? \"Yeah.\" His foot kept up its rhythm against the tire. \"What?\" I could tell there was more.  He frowned, his eyebrows pulling up in a way that looked sad and worried rather than angry. \"It's Embry. He's been avoiding me lately.\" The thoughts didn't seem connected, but I wondered if I was to blame for the problems with his friend. \"You've been hanging out with me a lot,\" I reminded him, feeling selfish. I'd been monopolizing him. \"No, that's not it. It's not just me\u2014it's Quil, too, and everyone. Embry missed a week of school, but he was never home when we tried to see him. And when he came back, he looked\u2026 he looked freaked out. Terrified. Quil and I both tried to get him to tell us what was wrong, but he wouldn't talk to either one of us.\" I stared at Jacob, biting my lip anxiously\u2014he was really frightened. But he didn't look at me. He watched his own foot kicking the rubber as if it belonged to someone else. The tempo increased. \"Then this week, out of nowhere, Embry's hanging out with Sam and the rest of them. He was out on the cliffs today.\" His voice was low and tense. He finally looked at me. \"Bella, they bugged him even more than they bother me. He didn't want anything to do with them. And now Embry's following Sam around like he's joined a cult. \"And that's the way it was with Paul. Just exactly the same. He wasn't friends with Sam at all. Then he stopped coming to school for a few weeks, and, when he came back, suddenly Sam owned him. I don't know what it means. I can't figure it out, and I feel like I have to, because Embry's my friend and\u2026 Sam's looking at me funny.. and\u2026\" He trailed off. \"Have you talked to Billy about this?\" I asked. His horror was spreading to me. I had chills running on the back of my neck. Now there was anger on his face. \"Yes,\" he snorted. \"That was helpful.\" \"What did he say?\" Jacob's expression was sarcastic, and when he spoke, his voice mocked the deep tones of his father's voice. \"It's nothing you need to worry about now, Jacob. In a few years, if you don't\u2026 well, I'll explain later.\" And then his voice was his own. \"What am I supposed to get from that? Is he trying to say it's some stupid puberty, coming-of-age thing? This is something else. Something wrong.\" He was biting his lower lip and clenching his hands. He looked like he was about to cry. I threw my arms around him instinctively, wrapping them around his waist and pressing my face against his chest. He was so big, I felt like I was a child hugging a grown-up. \"Oh, Jake, it'll be okay!\" I promised. \"If it gets worse you can come live with me and Charlie. Don't be scared, we'll think of something!\" He was frozen for a second, and then his long arms wrapped hesitantly around me. \"Thanks, Bella.\" His voice was huskier than usual. We stood like that for a moment, and it didn't upset me; in fact, I felt comforted by the contact. This didn't feel anything like the last time someone had embraced me this way. This was friendship. And Jacob was very warm. It was strange for me, being this close\u2014emotionally rather than physically, though the physical was strange for me, too\u2014to another human being. It wasn't my usual style. I didn't normally relate to people so easily, on such a basic level. Not human beings. \"If this is how you're going to react, I'll freak out more often.\" Jacob's voice was light, normal again, and his laughter rumbled against my ear. His fingers touched my hair, soft and tentative. Well, it was friendship for me. I pulled away quickly, laughing with him, but determined to put things back in perspective at once. \"It's hard to believe I'm two years older than you,\" I said, emphasizing the word older. \"You make me feel like a dwarf.\" Standing this close to him, I really had to crane my neck to see his face. \"You're forgetting I'm in my forties, of course.\" \"Oh, that's right.\" He patted my head. \"You're like a little doll,\" he teased. \"A porcelain doll.\" I rolled my eyes, taking another step away. \"Let's not start with the albino cracks.\" \"Seriously, Bella, are you sure you're not?\" He stretched his russet arm out next to mine. The difference wasn't flattering. \"I've never seen anyone paler than you\u2026 well, except for\u2014\" He broke off, and I looked away, trying to not understand what he had been about to say. \"So are we going to ride or what?\" \"Let's do it,\" I agreed, more enthusiastic than I would have been half a minute ago. His unfinished sentence reminded me of why I was here.",

            "en": "2-2songngu        2. STITCHES CARLISLE WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO STAYED calm. Centuries of\u00a0 experience in the emergency room were evident in his quiet, authoritative voice. \"Emmett, Rose, get Jasper outside.\" Unsmiling for once, Emmett nodded. \"Come on, Jasper.\" Jasper struggled against Emmett's unbreakable grasp, twisting around, reaching toward his brother with his bared teeth, his eyes still past reason. Edward's face was whiter than bone as he wheeled to crouch over me, taking a clearly defensive position. A low warning growl slid from between his clenched teeth. I could tell that he wasn't breathing. Rosalie, her divine face strangely smug, stepped in front of Jasper\u2014keeping a careful distance from his teeth\u2014and helped Emmett wrestle him through the glass door that Esme held open, one hand pressed over her mouth and nose. Esme's heart-shaped face was ashamed. \"I'm so sorry, Bella,\" she cried as she followed the others into the yard. \"Let me by, Edward,\" Carlisle murmured. A second passed, and then Edward nodded slowly and relaxed his stance. Carlisle knelt beside me, leaning close to examine my arm. I could feel the shock frozen on my face, and I tried to compose it. \"Here, Carlisle,\" Alice said, handing him a towel. He shook his head. \"Too much glass in the wound.\" He reached over and ripped a long, thin scrap from the bottom of the white tablecloth. He twisted it around my arm above the elbow to form a tourniquet. The smell of the blood was making me dizzy. My ears rang. \"Bella,\" Carlisle said softly. \"Do you want me to drive you to the hospital, or would you like me to take care of it here?\" \"Here, please,\" I whispered. If he took me to the hospital, there would be no way to keep this from Charlie. \"I'll get your bag,\" Alice said. \"Let's take her to the kitchen table,\" Carlisle said to Edward. Edward lifted me effortlessly, while Carlisle kept the pressure steady on my arm. \"How are you doing, Bella?\" Carlisle asked. \"I'm fine.\" My voice was reasonably steady, which pleased me. Edward's face was like stone. Alice was there. Carlisle's black bag was already on the table, a small but brilliant desk light plugged into the wall. Edward sat me gently into a chair, and Carlisle pulled up another. He went to work at once. Edward stood over me, still protective, still not breathing. \"Just go, Edward,\" I sighed. \"I can handle it,\" he insisted. But his jaw was rigid; his eyes burned with the intensity of the thirst he fought, so much worse for him than it was for the others. \"You don't need to be a hero,\" I said. \"Carlisle can fix me up without your help. Get some fresh air.\" I winced as Carlisle did something to my arm that stung. \"I'll stay,\" he said. \"Why are you so <em>masochistic</em>?\" I mumbled. Carlisle decided to intercede. \"Edward, you may as well go find Jasper before he gets too far. I'm sure he's upset with himself, and I doubt he'll listen to anyone but you right now.\" \"Yes,\" I eagerly agreed. \"Go find Jasper.\" \"You might as well do something useful,\" Alice added. Edward's eyes narrowed as we ganged up on him, but, finally, he nodded once and sprinted smoothly through the kitchen's back door. I was sure he hadn't taken a breath since I'd sliced my finger. A numb, dead feeling was spreading through my arm. Though it erased the sting, it reminded me of the gash, and I watched Carlisle's face carefully to distract me from what his hands were doing. His hair gleamed gold in the bright light as he bent over my arm. I could feel the faint stirrings of unease in the pit of my stomach, but I was determined not to let my usual squeamishness get the best of me. There was no pain now, just a gentle tugging sensation that I tried to ignore. No reason to get sick like a baby. If she hadn't been in my line of sight, I wouldn't have noticed Alice give up and steal out of the room. With a tiny, apologetic smile on her lips, she disappeared through the kitchen doorway. \"Well, that's everyone,\" I sighed. \"I can clear a room, at least.\" \"It's not your fault,\" Carlisle comforted me with a chuckle. \"It could happen to anyone.\" \"Could\" I repeated. \"But it usually just happens to me.\" He laughed again. His relaxed calm was only more amazing set in direct contrast with everyone else's reaction. I couldn't find any trace of anxiety in his face. He worked with quick, sure movements. The only sound besides our quiet breathing was the soft plink, plink as the tiny fragments of glass dropped one by one to the table. \"How can you do this?\" I demanded. \"Even Alice and Esme\u2026\" I trailed off, shaking my head in wonder. Though the rest of them had given up the traditional diet of vampires just as absolutely as Carlisle had, he was the only one who could bear the smell of my blood without suffering from the intense temptation. Clearly, this was much more difficult than he made it seem. \"Years and years of practice,\" he told me. \"I barely notice the scent anymore.\" \"Do you think it would be harder if you took a vacation from the hospital for a long time. And weren't around any blood?\" \"Maybe.\" He shrugged his shoulders, but his hands remained steady. \"I've never felt the need for an extended holiday.\" He flashed a brilliant smile in my direction. \"I enjoy my work too much.\" Plink, plink, plink. I was surprised at how much glass there seemed to be in my arm. I was tempted to glance at the growing pile, just to check the size, but I knew that idea would not be helpful to my no-vomiting strategy. \"What is it that you enjoy?\" I wondered. It didn't make sense to me\u2014the years of struggle and self-denial he must have spent to get to the point where he could endure this so easily. Besides, I wanted to keep him talking; the conversation kept my mind off the queasy feeling in my stomach. His dark eyes were calm and thoughtful as he answered. \"Hmm. What I enjoy the very most is when my\u2026 enhanced abilities let me save someone who would otherwise have been lost. It's pleasant knowing that, thanks to what I can do, some people's lives are better because I exist. Even the sense of smell is a useful diagnostic tool at times.\" One side of his mouth pulled up in half a smile. I mulled that over while he poked around, making sure all the glass splinters were gone. Then he rummaged in his bag for new tools, and I tried not to picture a needle and thread. \"You try very hard to make up for something that was never your fault,\" I suggested while a new kind of tugging started at the edges of my skin. \"What I mean is, it's not like you asked for this. You didn't choose this kind of life, and yet you have to work so hard to be good.\" \"I don't know that I'm making up for anything,\" he disagreed lightly. \"Like everything in life, I just had to decide what to do with what I was given.\" \"That makes it sound too easy.\" He examined my arm again. \"There,\" he said, snipping a thread. \"All done.\" He wiped an oversized Q-tip, dripping with some syrup-colored liquid, thoroughly across the operation site. The smell was strange; it made my head spin. The syrup stained my skin. \"In the beginning, though,\" I pressed while he taped another long piece of gauze securely in place, sealing it to my skin. \"Why did you even think to try a different way than the obvious one?\" His lips turned up in a private smile. \"Hasn't Edward told you this story?\" \"Yes. But I'm trying to understand what you were thinking\u2026\" His face was suddenly serious again, and I wondered if his thoughts had gone to the same place that mine had. Wondering what I would be thinking when\u2014I refused to think if\u2014it was me. n\u1ebfu \"You know my father was a clergyman,\" he mused as he cleaned the table carefully, rubbing everything down with wet gauze, and then doing it again. The smell of alcohol burned in my nose. \"He had a rather harsh view of the world, which I was already beginning to question before the time that I changed.\" Carlisle put all the dirty gauze and the glass slivers into an empty crystal bowl. I didn't understand what he was doing, even when he lit the match. Then he threw it onto the alcohol-soaked fibers, and the sudden blaze made me jump. \"Sorry,\" he apologized. \"That ought to do it\u2026 So I didn't agree with my father's particular brand of faith. But never, in the nearly four hundred years now since I was born, have I ever seen anything to make me doubt whether God exists in some form or the other. Not even the reflection in the mirror.\" I pretended to examine the dressing on my arm to hide my surprise at the direction our conversation had taken. Religion was the last thing I expected, all things considered. My own life was fairly devoid of belief. Charlie considered himself a Lutheran, because that's what his parents had been, but Sundays he worshipped by the river with a fishing pole in his hand. Renee tried out a church now and then, but, much like her brief affairs with tennis, pottery, yoga, and French classes, she moved on by the time I was aware of her newest fad.  \"I'm sure all this sounds a little bizarre, coming from a vampire.\" He grinned, knowing how their casual use of that word never failed to shock me. \"But I'm hoping that there is still a point to this life, even for us.\u00a0 It's a long shot, I'll admit,\" he continued in an offhand voice. \"By all accounts, we're damned regardless. But I hope, maybe foolishly, that we'll get some measure of credit for trying.\" \"I don't think that's foolish,\" I mumbled. I couldn't imagine anyone, deity included, who wouldn't be impressed by Carlisle. Besides, the only kind of heaven I could appreciate would have to include Edward. \"And I don't think anyone else would, either.\" \"Actually, you're the very first one to agree with me.\" \"The rest of them don't feel the same?\" I asked, surprised, thinking of only one person in particular. Carlisle guessed the direction of my thoughts again. \"Edward's with me up to a point. God and heaven exist\u2026 and so does hell. But he doesn't believe there is an afterlife for our kind.\" Carlisle's voice was very soft; he stared out the big window over the sink, into the darkness. \"You see, he thinks we've lost our souls.\" I immediately thought of Edward's words this afternoon: unless you want to die\u2014or whatever it is that we do. The light bulb flicked on over my head. \"That's the real problem, isn't it?\" I guessed. \"That's why he's being so difficult about me.\" \u00a0Carlisle spoke slowly. \"I look at my\u2026 son. His strength, his goodness, the brightness that shines out of him\u2014and it only fuels that hope, that faith, more than ever. How could there not be more for one such as Edward?\" I nodded in fervent agreement. \"But if I believed as he does\u2026\" He looked down at me with unfathomable eyes. \"If you believed as he did. Could you take away his soul?\" The way he phrased the question thwarted my answer. If he'd asked me whether I would risk my soul for Edward, the reply would be obvious. But would I risk Edward's soul? I pursed my lips unhappily. That wasn't a fair exchange. \"You see the problem.\" I shook my head, aware of the stubborn set of my chin. Carlisle sighed. \"It's my choice,\" I insisted. \"It's his, too.\" He held up his hand when he could see that I was about to argue. \"Whether he is responsible for doing that to you.\" \"He's not the only one able to do it.\" I eyed Carlisle speculatively. He laughed, abruptly lightening the mood. \"Oh, no! You're going to have to work this out with him.\" But then he sighed. \"That's the one part I can never be sure of. I think, in most other ways, that I've done the best I could with what I had to work with. But was it right to doom the others to this life? I can't decide.\" I didn't answer. I imagined what my life would be like if Carlisle had resisted the temptation to change his lonely existence\u2026 and shuddered. \"It was Edward's mother who made up my mind.\" Carlisle's voice was almost a whisper. He stared unseeingly out the black windows. \"His mother?\" Whenever I'd asked Edward about his parents, he would merely say that they had died long ago, and his memories were vague. I realized Carlisle's memory of them, despite the brevity of their contact, would be perfectly clear. \"Yes. Her name was Elizabeth. Elizabeth Masen. His father, Edward Senior, never regained consciousness in the hospital. He died in the first wave of the influenza. But Elizabeth was alert until almost the very end. Edward looks a great deal like her\u2014she had that same strange bronze shade to her hair, and her eyes were exactly the same color green.\" \"His eyes were green?\" I murmured, trying to picture it. \"Yes\u2026\" Carlisle's ocher eyes were a hundred years away now. \"Elizabeth worried obsessively over her son. She hurt her own chances of survival trying to nurse him from her sickbed. I expected that he would go first, he was so much worse off than she was. When the end came for her, it was very quick. It was just after sunset, and I'd arrived to relieve the doctors who'd been working all day. That was a hard time to pretend\u2014there was so much work to be done, and I had no need of rest. How I hated to go back to my house, to hide in the dark and pretend to sleep while so many were dying. \"I went to check Elizabeth and her son first. I'd grown attached\u2014always a dangerous thing to do considering the fragile nature of humans. I could see at once that she'd taken a bad turn. The fever was raging out of control, and her body was too weak to fight anymore. She didn't look weak, though, when she glared up at me from her cot. \"Save him!' she commanded me in the hoarse voice that was all her throat could manage. \"I'll do everything in my power,' I promised her, taking her hand. The fever was so high, she probably couldn't even tell how unnaturally cold mine felt. Everything felt cold to her skin. \"You must,\" she insisted, clutching at my hand with enough strength that I wondered if she wouldn't pull through the crisis after all. Her eyes were hard, like stones, like emeralds. 'You must do everything in your power. What others cannot do, that is what you must do for my Edward.\" \"It frightened me. She looked it me with those piercing eyes, and, for one instant, I felt certain that she knew my secret. Then the fever overwhelmed her, and she never regained consciousness. She died within an hour of making her demand. \"I'd spent decades considering the idea of creating a companion for myself. Just one other creature who could really know me, rather than what I pretended to be. But I could never justify it to myself\u2014doing what had been done to me. \"There Edward lay, dying. It was clear that he had only hours left. Beside him, his mother, her face somehow not yet peaceful, not even in death.\" Carlisle saw it all again, his memory unburned by the intervening century. I could see it clearly, too, as he spoke\u2014the despair of the hospital, the overwhelming atmosphere of death. Edward burning with fever, his life slipping away with each tick of the clock\u2026 I shuddered again, and forced the picture from my mind. \"Elizabeth's words echoed in my head. How could she guess what I could do? Could anyone really want that for her son? \"I looked at Edward. Sick as he was, he was still beautiful. There was something pure and good about his face. The kind of face I would have wanted my son to have. \"After all those years of indecision, I simply acted on a whim. I wheeled his mother to the morgue first, and then I came back for him. No one noticed that he was still breathing. There weren't enough hands, enough eyes, to keep track of half of what the patients needed. The morgue was empty\u2014of the living, at least. I stole him out the back door, and carried him across the rooftops back to my home. \"I wasn't sure what had to be done. I settled for recreating the wounds I'd received myself, so many centuries earlier in London. I felt bad about that later. It was more painful and lingering than necessary. \"I wasn't sorry, though. I've never been sorry that I saved Edward.\" He shook his head, coming back to the present. He smiled at me. \"I suppose I should take you home now.\" \"I'll do that,\" Edward said. He came through the shadowy dining room, walking slowly for him. His face was smooth, unreadable, but there was something wrong with his eyes\u2014something he was trying very hard to hide. I felt a spasm of unease in my stomach. \"Carlisle can take me,\" I said. I looked down at my shirt; the light blue cotton was soaked and spotted with my blood. My right shoulder was covered in thick pink frosting. \"I'm fine.\" Edward's voice was unemotional. \"You'll need to change anyway. You'd give Charlie a heart attack the way you look. I'll have Alice get you something.\" He strode out the kitchen door again. I looked at Carlisle anxiously. \"He's very upset.\" \"Yes,\" Carlisle agreed. \"Tonight is exactly the kind of thing that he fears the most. You being put in danger, because of what we are.\" \"It's not his fault.\" \"It's not yours, either.\" I looked away from his wise, beautiful eyes. I couldn't agree with that. Carlisle offered me his hand and helped me up from the table. I followed him out into the main room. Esme had come back; she was mopping the floor where I'd fallen\u2014with straight bleach from the smell of it. \"Esme, let me do that.\" I could feel that my face was bright red again. \"I'm already done.\" She smiled up at me. \"How do you feel?\" \"I'm fine,\" I assured her. \"Carlisle sews faster than any other doctor I've had.\" They both chuckled. Alice and Edward came in the back doors. Alice hurried to my side, but Edward hung back, his face indecipherable. \"C'mon,\" Alice said. \"I'll get you something less macabre to wear.\" She found me a shirt of Esme's that was close to the same color mine had been. Charlie wouldn't notice, I was sure. The long white bandage on my arm didn't look nearly as serious when I was no longer spattered in gore. Charlie was never surprised to see me bandaged. \"Alice,\" I whispered as she headed back to the door. \"Yes?\" She kept her voice low, too, and looked at me curiously, her head cocked to the side. \"How bad is it?\" I couldn't be sure if my whispering was a wasted effort. Even though we were upstairs, with the door closed, perhaps he could hear me. Her face tensed. \"I'm not sure yet.\" \"How's Jasper?\" She sighed. \"He's very unhappy with himself. It's all so much more of challenge for him, and he hates feeling weak.\" \"It's not his fault. You'll tell him that I'm not mad at him, not at all, won't you?\" \"Of course.\" Edward was waiting for me by the front door. As I got to the bottom of the staircase, he held it open without a word. \"Take your things!\" Alice cried as I walked warily toward Edward. She scooped up the two packages, one half-opened, and my camera from under the piano, and pressed them into my good arm. \"You can thank me later, when you've opened them.\" Esme and Carlisle both said a quiet goodnight. I could see them stealing quick glances at their impassive son, much like I was. It was a relief to be outside; I hurried past the lanterns and the roses, now unwelcome reminders.  Edward kept pace with me silently. He opened the passenger side for me, and I climbed in without complaint. On the dashboard was a big red ribbon, stuck to the new stereo. I pulled it off, throwing it to the floor. As Edward slid into the other side, I kicked the ribbon under my seat. He didn't look at me or the stereo. Neither of us switched it on, and the silence was somehow intensified by the sudden thunder of the engine. He drove too fast down the dark, serpentine lane. The silence was making me insane. \"Say something,\" I finally begged as he turned onto the freeway. \"What do you want me to say?\" he asked in a detached voice. I cringed at his remoteness. 'Tell me you forgive me.\" That brought a flicker of life to his face\u2014a flicker of anger. \"Forgive you? For what?\" \"If I'd been more careful, nothing would have happened.\" \"Bella, you gave yourself a paper cut\u2014that hardly deserves the death penalty.\" \"It's still my fault.\" My words opened up the floodgate. \"Your fault? If you'd cut yourself at Mike Newton's house, with Jessica there and Angela and your other normal friends, the worst that could possibly have happened would be what? Maybe they couldn't find you a bandage? If you'd tripped and knocked over a pile of glass plates on your own\u2014without someone throwing you into them\u2014even then, what's the worst? You'd get blood on the seats when they drove you to the emergency room? Mike Newton could have held your hand while they stitched you up\u2014and he wouldn't be righting the urge to kill you the whole time he was there. Don't try to take any of this on yourself, Bella. It will only make me more disgusted with myself.\" \"How the hell did Mike Newton end up in this conversation?\" I demanded. \"Mike Newton ended up in this conversation because Mike Newton would be a hell of a lot healthier for you to be with,\" he growled. \"I'd rather die than be with Mike Newton,\" I protested. \"I'd rather die than be with anyone but you.\" \"Don't be melodramatic, please.\" \"Well then, don't you be ridiculous.\" He didn't answer. He glared through the windshield, his expression black. I racked my brain for some way to salvage the evening. When we pulled up in front of my house, I still hadn't come up with anything. He killed the engine, but his hands stayed clenched around the steering wheel. \"Will you stay tonight?\" I asked. \"I should go home.\" The last thing I wanted was for him to go wallow in remorse. \"For my birthday,\" I pressed. \"You can't have it both ways\u2014either you want people to ignore your birthday or you don't. One or the other.\" His voice was stern, but not as serious as before. I breathed a silent sigh of relief. \"Okay. I've decided that I don't want you to ignore my birthday. I'll see you upstairs.\" I hopped out, reaching back in for my packages. He frowned. \"You don't have to take those.\" \"I want them,\" I responded automatically, and then wondered if he was using reverse psychology. \"No, you don't. Carlisle and Esme spent money on you.\" \"I'll live.\" I tucked the presents awkwardly under my good arm and slammed the door behind me. He was out of the truck and by my side in less than a second. \"Let me carry them, at least.\" he said as he took them away. \"I'll be in your room.\" I smiled. \"Thanks.\" \"Happy birthday,\" he sighed, and leaned down to touch his lips to mine. I reached up on my toes to make the kiss last longer when he pulled away. He smiled my favorite crooked smile, and then he disappeared into the darkness. The game was still on; as soon as I walked through the front door I could hear the announcer rambling over the babble of the crowd. \"Bell?\" Charlie called. \"Hey, Dad,\" I said as I came around the corner. I held my arm close to my side. The slight pressure burned, and I wrinkled my nose. The anesthetic was apparently losing its effectiveness. \"How was it?\" Charlie lounged across the sofa with his bare feet propped up on the arm.  What was left of his curly brown hair was crushed flat on one side. \"Alice went overboard. Flowers, cake, candles, presents\u2014the whole bit.\" \"What did they get you?\" \"A stereo for my truck.\" And various unknowns. \"Wow.\" \"Yeah,\" I agreed. \"Well, I'm calling it a night.\" \"I'll see you in the morning.\" I waved. \"See ya.\" \"What happened to your arm?\" I flushed and cursed silently. \"I tripped. It's nothing.\" \"Bella,\" he sighed, shaking his head. \"Goodnight, Dad.\" I hurried up to the bathroom, where I kept my pajamas for just such nights as these. I shrugged into the matching tank top and cotton pants that I'd gotten to replace the holey sweats I used to wear to bed, wincing as the movement pulled at the stitches. I washed my face one-handed, brushed my teeth, and then skipped to my room. He was sitting in the center of my bed, toying idly with one of the silver boxes. \"Hi,\" he said. His voice was sad. He was wallowing. I went to the bed, pushed the presents out of his hands, and climbed into his lap. \"Hi.\" I snuggled into his stone chest. \"Can I open my presents now?\" \"Where did the enthusiasm come from?\" he wondered. \"You made me curious.\" I picked up the long flat rectangle that must have been from Carlisle and Esme. \"Allow me,\" he suggested. He took the gift from my hand and tore the silver paper off with one fluid movement. He handed the rectangular white box back to me. \"Are you sure I can handle lifting the lid?\" I muttered, but he ignored me. Inside the box was a long thick piece of paper with an overwhelming amount of fine print. It took me a minute to get the gist of the information. \"We're going to Jacksonville?\" And I was excited, in spite of myself. It was a voucher for plane tickets, for both me and Edward. \"That's the idea.\" \"I can't believe it. Renee is going to flip! You don't mind, though, do you? It's sunny, you'll have to stay inside all day.\" \"I think I can handle it,\" he said, and then frowned. \"If I'd had any idea that you could respond to a gift this appropriately, I would have made you open it in front of Carlisle and Esme. I thought you'd complain.\" \"Well, of course it's too much. But I get to take you with me!\" He chuckled. \"Now I wish I'd spent money on your present. I didn't realize that you were capable of being reasonable.\" I set the tickets aside and reached for his present, my curiosity rekindled. He took it from me and unwrapped it like the first one. He handed back a clear CD jewel case, with a blank silver CD inside. \"What is it?\" I asked, perplexed. He didn't say anything; he took the CD and reached around me to put it in the CD player on the bedside table. He hit play, and we waited in silence. Then the music began. I listened, speechless and wide-eyed. I knew he was waiting for my reaction, but I couldn't talk. Tears welled up, and I reached up to wipe them away before they could spill over. \"Does your arm hurt?\" he asked anxiously. \"No, it's not my arm. It's beautiful, Edward. You couldn't have given me anything I would love more. I can't believe it.\" I shut up, so I could listen. It was his music, his compositions. The first piece on the CD was my lullaby. \"I didn't think you would let me get a piano so I could play for you here,\" he explained. \"You're right.\" \"How does your arm feel?\" \"Just fine.\" Actually, it was starting to blaze under the bandage. I wanted ice. I would have settled for his hand, but that would have given me away. \"I'll get you some Tylenol.\" \"I don't need anything,\" I protested, but he slid me off his lap and headed for the door. \"Charlie,\" I hissed. Charlie wasn't exactly aware that Edward frequently stayed over. In fact, he would have a stroke if that fact were brought to his attention. But I didn't feel too guilty for deceiving him.\u00a0\u00a0  It wasn't as if we were up to anything he wouldn't want me to be up to. Edward and his rules\u2026 \"He won't catch me,\" Edward promised as he disappeared silently out the door . . and returned, catching the door before it had swung back to touch the frame. He had the glass from the bathroom and the bottle of pills in one hand. I took the pills he handed me without arguing\u2014I knew I would lose the argument And my arm really was starting to bother me. My lullaby continued, soft and lovely, in the background. \"It's late,\" Edward noted. He scooped me up off the bed with one arm, and pulled the cover back with the other. He put me down with my head on my pillow and tucked the quilt around me. He lay down next to me\u2014on top of the blanket so I wouldn't get chilled\u2014and put his arm over me. I leaned my head against his shoulder and sighed happily. \"Thanks again,\" I whispered. \"You're welcome.\" It was quiet for a long moment as I listened to my lullaby drift to a close. Another song began. I recognized Esme's favorite. \"What are you thinking about?'\" I wondered in a whisper. He hesitated for a second before he told me. \"I was thinking about right and wrong, actually.\" I felt a chill tingle along my spine. \"Remember how I decided that I wanted you to not ignore my birthday?\" I asked quickly, hoping it wasn't too clear that I was trying to distract him. \"Yes,\" he agreed, wary. \"Well, I was thinking, since it's still my birthday, that I'd like you to kiss me again.\" \"You're greedy tonight.\" \"Yes, I am\u2014but please, don't do anything you don't want to do,\" I added, piqued. He laughed, and then sighed. \"Heaven forbid that I should do anything I don't want to do,\" he said in a strangely desperate tone as he put his hand under my chin and pulled my face up to his. The kiss began much the same as usual\u2014Edward was as careful as ever, and my heart began to overreact like it always did. And then something seemed to change. Suddenly his lips became much more urgent, his free hand twisted into my hair and held my face securely to his. And, though my hands tangled in his hair, too, and though I was clearly beginning to cross his cautious lines, for once he didn't stop me. His body was cold through the thin quilt, but I crushed myself against him eagerly. When he stopped it was abrupt; he pushed me away with gentle, firm hands. I collapsed back onto my pillow, gasping, my head spinning. Something tugged at my memory, elusive, on the edges. \"Sorry,\" he said, and he was breathless, too. \"That was out of line.\" \"I don't mind,\" I panted. He frowned at me in the darkness. \"Try to sleep. Bella.\" \"No, I want you to kiss me again.\" \"You're overestimating my self-control.\" \"Which is tempting you more, my blood or my body?\" I challenged. \"It's a tie.\" He grinned briefly in spite of himself, and then was serious again. \"Now. why don't you stop pushing your luck and go to sleep?\" \"Fine,\" I agreed, snuggling closer to him. I really did feel exhausted. It had been a long day in so many ways, yet I felt no sense of relief at its end. Almost as if something worse was coming tomorrow. It was a silly premonition\u2014what could be worse than today?' Just the shock catching up with me, no doubt. Trying to be sneaky about it, I pressed my injured arm against his shoulder, so his cool skin would sooth the burning. It felt better at once. I was halfway asleep, maybe more, when I realized what his kiss had reminded me of: last spring, when he'd had to leave me to throw James off my trail, Edward had kissed me goodbye, not knowing when\u2014or if\u2014we would see each other again. This kiss had the same almost painful edge for some reason I couldn't imagine. I shuddered into unconsciousness, as if I were already having a nightmare.",

            "en": "13        13. CONFESSIONS Edward in the sunlight was shocking. I couldn't get used to it, though I'd been staring at him all afternoon. His skin, white despite the faint flush from yesterday's hunting trip, literally sparkled, like thousands of tiny diamonds were embedded in the surface. He lay perfectly still in the grass, his shirt open over his sculpted, incandescent chest, his scintillating arms bare. His glistening, pale lavender lids were shut, though of course he didn't sleep. A perfect statue, carved in some unknown stone, smooth like marble, glittering like crystal. Now and then, his lips would move, so fast it looked like they were trembling. But, when I asked, he told me he was singing to himself; it was too low for me to hear. I enjoyed the sun, too, though the air wasn't quite dry enough for my taste. I would have liked to lie back, as he did, and let the sun warm my face. But I stayed curled up, my chin resting on my knees, unwilling to take my eyes off him. The wind was gentle; it tangled my hair and ruffled the grass that swayed around his motionless form. The meadow, so spectacular to me at first, paled next to his magnificence. Hesitantly, always afraid, even now, that he would disappear like a mirage, too beautiful to be real\u2026 hesitantly, I reached out one finger and stroked the back of his shimmering hand, where it lay within my reach. I marveled again at the perfect texture, satin smooth, cool as stone. When I looked up again, his eyes were open, watching me. Butterscotch today, lighter, warmer after hunting. His quick smile turned up the corners of his flawless lips. \"I don't scare you?\" he asked playfully, but I could hear the real curiosity in his soft voice. \"No more than usual.\" He smiled wider; his teeth flashed in the sun. I inched closer, stretched out my whole hand now to trace the contours of his forearm with my fingertips. I saw that my fingers trembled, and knew it wouldn't escape his notice. \"Do you mind?\" I asked, for he had closed his eyes again. \"No,\" he said without opening his eyes. \"You can't imagine how that feels.\" He sighed. I lightly trailed my hand over the perfect muscles of his arm, followed\u00a0 the faint pattern of bluish veins inside the crease at his elbow. With my other hand, I reached to turn his hand over. Realizing what I wished, he flipped his palm up in one of those blindingly fast, disconcerting movements of his. It startled me; my fingers froze on his arm for a brief second. \"Sorry,\" he murmured. I looked up in time to see his golden eyes close again. \"It's too easy to be myself with you.\" I lifted his hand, turning it this way and that as I watched the sun glitter on his palm. I held it closer to my face, trying to see the hidden facets in his skin. \"Tell me what you're thinking,\" he whispered. I looked to see his eyes watching me, suddenly intent. \"It's still so strange for me, not knowing.\" \"You know, the rest of us feel that way all the time.\" \"It's a hard life.\" Did I imagine the hint of regret in his tone? \"But you didn't tell me.\" \"I was wishing I could know what you were thinking\u2026\" I hesitated. \"And?\" \"I was wishing that I could believe that you were real. And I was wishing that I wasn't afraid.\" \"I don't want you to be afraid.\" His voice was just a soft murmur. I heard what he couldn't truthfully say, that I didn't need to be afraid, that there was nothing to fear. \"Well, that's not exactly the fear I meant, though that's certainly something to think about.\" So quickly that I missed his movement, he was half sitting, propped up on his right arm, his left palm still in my hands. His angel's face was only a few inches from mine. I might have \u2014 should have \u2014 flinched away from his unexpected closeness, but I was unable to move.  His golden eyes mesmerized me. \"What are you afraid of, then?\" he whispered intently. But I couldn't answer. As I had just that once before, I smelled his cool breath in my face. Sweet, delicious, the scent made my mouth water. It was unlike anything else. Instinctively, unthinkingly, I leaned closer, inhaling. And he was gone, his hand ripped from mine. In the time it took my eyes to focus, he was twenty feet away, standing at the edge of the small meadow, in the deep shade of a huge fir tree. He stared at me, his eyes dark in the shadows, his expression unreadable. I could feel the hurt and shock on my face. My empty hands stung. \"I'm\u2026 sorry\u2026 Edward,\" I whispered. I knew he could hear. \"Give me a moment,\" he called, just loud enough for my less sensitive ears. I sat very still. After ten incredibly long seconds, he walked back, slowly for him. He stopped, still several feet away, and sank gracefully to the ground, crossing his legs. His eyes never left mine.  He took two deep breaths, and then smiled in apology. \"I am so very sorry.\" He hesitated. \"Would you understand what I meant if I said I was only human?\" I nodded once, not quite able to smile at his joke. Adrenaline pulsed through my veins as the realization of danger slowly sank in. He could smell that from where he sat. His smile turned mocking. \"I'm the world's best predator, aren't I? Everything about me invites you in \u2014 my voice, my face, even my smell. As if I need any of that!\" Unexpectedly, he was on his feet, bounding away, instantly out of sight, only to appear beneath the same tree as before, having circled the meadow in half a second. \"As if you could outrun me,\" he laughed bitterly. He reached up with one hand and, with a deafening crack, effortlessly ripped a two-foot-thick branch from the trunk of the spruce. He balanced it in that hand for a moment, and then threw it with blinding speed, shattering it against another huge tree, which shook and trembled at the blow. And he was in front of me again, standing two feet away, still as a stone. \"As if you could fight me off,\" he said gently. I sat without moving, more frightened of him than I had ever been. I'd never seen him so completely freed of that carefully cultivated facade. He'd never been less human\u2026 or more beautiful. Face ashen, eyes wide, I sat like a bird locked in the eyes of a snake. His lovely eyes seem to glow with rash excitement. Then, as the seconds passed, they dimmed. His expression slowly folded into a mask of ancient sadness. \"Don't be afraid,\" he murmured, his velvet voice unintentionally seductive. \"I promise\u2026\" He hesitated. \"I swear not to hurt you.\" He seemed more concerned with convincing himself than me. \"Don't be afraid,\" he whispered again as he stepped closer, with exaggerated slowness. He sat sinuously, with deliberately unhurried movements, till our faces were on the same level, just a foot apart. \"Please forgive me,\" he said formally. \"I can control myself. You caught me off guard. But I'm on my best behavior now.\" He waited, but I still couldn't speak. \"I'm not thirsty today, honestly.\" He winked. At that I had to laugh, though the sound was shaky and breathless. \"Are you all right?\" he asked tenderly, reaching out slowly, carefully, to place his marble hand back in mine. I looked at his smooth, cold hand, and then at his eyes. They were soft, repentant. I looked back at his hand, and then deliberately returned to tracing the lines in his hand with my fingertip. I looked up and smiled timidly. His answering smile was dazzling. \"So where were we, before I behaved so rudely?\" he asked in the gentle cadences of an earlier century. \"I honestly can't remember.\" He smiled, but his face was ashamed. \"I think we were talking about why you were afraid, besides the obvious reason.\" \"Oh, right.\" \"Well?\" I looked down at his hand and doodled aimlessly across his smooth, iridescent palm. The seconds ticked by. \"How easily frustrated I am,\" he sighed. I looked into his eyes, abruptly grasping that this was every bit as new to him as it was to me. As many years of unfathomable experience as he had, this was hard for him, too. I took courage from that thought. \"I was afraid\u2026 because, for, well, obvious reasons, I can't stay with you. And I'm afraid that I'd like to stay with you, much more than I should.\" I looked down at his hands as I spoke. It was difficult for me to say this aloud. \"Yes,\" he agreed slowly. \"That is something to be afraid of, indeed. Wanting to be with me. That's really not in your best interest.\" I frowned. \"I should have left long ago,\" he sighed. \"I should leave now. But I don't know if I can.\" \"I don't want you to leave,\" I mumbled pathetically, staring down again. \"Which is exactly why I should. But don't worry. I'm essentially a selfish creature. I crave your company too much to do what I should.\" \"I'm glad.\" \"Don't be!\" He withdrew his hand, more gently this time; his voice was harsher than usual. Harsh for him, still more beautiful than any human voice. It was hard to keep up \u2014 his sudden mood changes left me always a step behind, dazed. \"It's not only your company I crave! Never forget that. Never forget I am more dangerous to you than I am to anyone else.\" He stopped, and I looked to see him gazing unseeingly into the forest. I thought for a moment. \"I don't think I understand exactly what you mean \u2014 by that last part anyway,\" I said. He looked back at me and smiled, his mood shifting yet again. \"How do I explain?\" he mused. \"And without frightening you again\u2026 hmmmm.\" Without seeming to think about it, he placed his hand back in mine; I held it tightly in both of mine. He looked at our hands. \"That's amazingly pleasant, the warmth.\" He sighed. A moment passed as he assembled his thoughts. \"You know how everyone enjoys different flavors?\" he began. \"Some people love chocolate ice cream, others prefer strawberry?\" I nodded. \"Sorry about the food analogy \u2014 I couldn't think of another way to explain.\" I smiled. He smiled ruefully back. \"You see, every person smells different, has a different essence. If you locked an alcoholic in a room full of stale beer, he'd gladly drink it. But he could resist, if he wished to, if he were a recovering alcoholic. Now let's say you placed in that room a glass of hundred-year-old brandy, the rarest, finest cognac \u2014 and filled the room with its warm aroma \u2014 how do you think he would fare then?\" We sat silently, looking into each other's eyes \u2014 trying to read each other's thoughts. He broke the silence first. \"Maybe that's not the right comparison. Maybe it would be too easy to turn down the brandy. Perhaps I should have made our alcoholic a heroin addict instead.\" \"So what you're saying is, I'm your brand of heroin?\" I teased, trying to lighten the mood. He smiled swiftly, seeming to appreciate my effort. \"Yes, you are exactly my brand of heroin.\" \"Does that happen often?\" I asked. He looked across the treetops, thinking through his response. \"I spoke to my brothers about it.\" He still stared into the distance. \"To Jasper, every one of you is much the same. He's the most recent to join our family. It's a struggle for him to abstain at all. He hasn't had time to grow sensitive to the differences in smell, in flavor.\" He glanced swiftly at me, his expression apologetic. \"Sorry,\" he said. \"I don't mind. Please don't worry about offending me, or frightening me, or whichever. That's the way you think. I can understand, or I can try to at least. Just explain however you can.\" He took a deep breath and gazed at the sky again. \"So Jasper wasn't sure if he'd ever come across someone who was as\" \u2014 he hesitated, looking for the right word \u2014 \"appealing as you are to me.\u00a0 Which makes me think not. Emmett has been on the wagon longer, so to speak, and he understood what I meant. He says twice, for him, once stronger than the other.\" \"And for you?\" \"Never.\" The word hung there for a moment in the warm breeze. \"What did Emmett do?\" I asked to break the silence. It was the wrong question to ask. His face grew dark, his hand clenched into a fist inside mine. He looked away. I waited, but he wasn't going to answer. \"I guess I know,\" I finally said. He lifted his eyes; his expression was wistful, pleading. \"Even the strongest of us fall off the wagon, don't we?\" \"What are you asking? My permission?\" My voice was sharper than I'd intended. I tried to make my tone kinder \u2014 I could guess what his honesty must cost him. \"I mean, is there no hope, then?\" How calmly I could discuss my own death! \"No, no!\" He was instantly contrite. \"Of course there's hope! I mean, of course I won't\u2026\" He left the sentence hanging. His eyes burned into mine. \"It's different for us. Emmett\u2026 these were strangers he happened across. It was a long time ago, and he wasn't as\u2026 practiced, as careful, as he is now.\" He fell silent and watched me intently as I thought it through. \"So if we'd met\u2026 oh, in a dark alley or something\u2026\" I trailed off. \"It took everything I had not to jump up in the middle of that class full of children and \u2014\" He stopped abruptly, looking away. \"When you walked past me, I could have ruined everything Carlisle has built for us, right then and there. If I hadn't been denying my thirst for the last, well, too many years, I wouldn't have been able to stop myself.\" He paused, scowling at the trees. He glanced at me grimly, both of us remembering. \"You must have thought I was possessed.\" \"I couldn't understand why. How you could hate me so quickly\u2026\" \"To me, it was like you were some kind of demon, summoned straight from my own personal hell to ruin me. The fragrance coming off your skin\u2026 I thought it would make me deranged that first day. In that one hour, I thought of a hundred different ways to lure you from the room with me, to get you alone. And I fought them each back, thinking of my family, what I could do to them. I had to run out, to get away before I could speak the words that would make you follow\u2026\" He looked up then at my staggered expression as I tried to absorb his bitter memories. His golden eyes scorched from under his lashes, hypnotic and deadly. \"You would have come,\" he promised. I tried to speak calmly. \"Without a doubt.\" He frowned down at my hands, releasing me from the force of his stare. \"And then, as I tried to rearrange my schedule in a pointless attempt to avoid you, you were there \u2014 in that close, warm little room, the scent was maddening. I so very nearly took you then. There was only one other frail human there \u2014 so easily dealt with.\" I shivered in the warm sun, seeing my memories anew through his eyes, only now grasping the danger. Poor Ms. Cope; I shivered again at how close I'd come to being inadvertently responsible for her death. \"But I resisted. I don't know how. I forced myself not to wait for you, not to follow you from the school. It was easier outside, when I couldn't smell you anymore, to think clearly, to make the right decision. I left the others near home \u2014 I was too ashamed to tell them how weak I was, they only knew something was very wrong \u2014 and then I went straight to Carlisle, at the hospital, to tell him I was leaving.\" I stared in surprise.  \"I traded cars with him \u2014 he had a full tank of gas and I didn't want to stop. I didn't dare to go home, to face Esme. She wouldn't have let me go without a scene. She would have tried to convince me that it wasn't necessary\u2026 \"By the next morning I was in Alaska.\" He sounded ashamed, as if admitting a great cowardice. \"I spent two days there, with some old acquaintances\u2026 but I was homesick. I hated knowing I'd upset Esme, and the rest of them, my adopted family. In the pure air of the mountains it was hard to believe you were so irresistible. I convinced myself it was weak to run away. I'd dealt with temptation before, not of this magnitude, not even close, but I was strong. Who were you, an insignificant little girl\" \u2014 he grinned suddenly \u2014 \"to chase me from the place I wanted to be? So I came back\u2026\" He stared off into space. I couldn't speak. \"I took precautions, hunting, feeding more than usual before seeing you again. I was sure that I was strong enough to treat you like any other human. I was arrogant about it. \"It was unquestionably a complication that I couldn't simply read your thoughts to know what your reaction was to me. I wasn't used to having to go to such circuitous measures, listening to your words in Jessica's mind\u2026 her mind isn't very original, and it was annoying to have to stoop to that. And then I couldn't know if you really meant what you said. It was all extremely irritating.\" He frowned at the memory. \"I wanted you to forget my behavior that first day, if possible, so I tried to talk with you like I would with any person. I was eager actually, hoping to decipher some of your thoughts. But you were too interesting, I found myself caught up in your expressions\u2026 and every now and then you would stir the air with your hand or your hair, and the scent would stun me again\u2026 \"Of course, then you were nearly crushed to death in front of my eyes. Later I thought of a perfectly good excuse for why I acted at that moment \u2014 because if I hadn't saved you, if your blood had been spilled there in front of me, I don't think I could have stopped myself from exposing us for what we are. But I only thought of that excuse later. At the time, all I could think was, 'Not her.'\" He closed his eyes, lost in his agonized confession. I listened, more eager than rational. Common sense told me I should be terrified. Instead, I was relieved to finally understand. And I was filled with compassion for his suffering, even now, as he confessed his craving to take my life. I finally was able to speak, though my voice was faint. \"In the hospital?\" His eyes flashed up to mine. \"I was appalled. I couldn't believe I had put us in danger after all, put myself in your power \u2014 you of all people. As if I needed another motive to kill you.\"  We both flinched as that word slipped out. \"But it had the opposite effect,\" he continued quickly. \"I fought with Rosalie, Emmett, and Jasper when they suggested that now was the time\u2026 the worst fight we've ever had. Carlisle sided with me, and Alice.\" He grimaced when he said her name. I couldn't imagine why. \"Esme told me to do whatever I had to in order to stay.\" He shook his head indulgently. \"All that next day I eavesdropped on the minds of everyone you spoke to, shocked that you kept your word. I didn't understand you at all. But I knew that I couldn't become more involved with you. I did my very best to stay as far from you as possible. And every day the perfume of your skin, your breath, your hair\u2026 it hit me as hard as the very first day.\" He met my eyes again, and they were surprisingly tender. \"And for all that,\" he continued, \"I'd have fared better if I had exposed us all at that first moment, than if now, here \u2014 with no witnesses and nothing to stop me \u2014 I were to hurt you.\" I was human enough to have to ask. \"Why?\" \"Isabella.\" He pronounced my full name carefully, then playfully ruffled my hair with his free hand. A shock ran through my body at his casual touch. \"Bella, I couldn't live with myself if I ever hurt you. You don't know how it's tortured me.\" He looked down, ashamed again. \"The thought of you, still, white, cold\u2026 to never see you blush scarlet again, to never see that flash of intuition in your eyes when you see through my pretenses\u2026 it would be unendurable.\" He lifted his glorious, agonized eyes to mine. \"You are the most important thing to me now. The most important thing to me ever.\" My head was spinning at the rapid change in direction our conversation had taken. From the cheerful topic of my impending demise, we were suddenly declaring ourselves. He waited, and even though I looked down to study our hands between us, I knew his golden eyes were on me.  \"You already know how I feel, of course,\" I finally said. \"I'm here\u2026 which, roughly translated, means I would rather die than stay away from you.\" I frowned. \"I'm an idiot.\" \"You are an idiot,\" he agreed with a laugh. Our eyes met, and I laughed, too. We laughed together at the idiocy and sheer impossibility of such a moment. \"And so the lion fell in love with the lamb\u2026\" he murmured. I looked away, hiding my eyes as I thrilled to the word. \"What a stupid lamb,\" I sighed. \"What a sick, <em>masochistic</em> lion.\" He stared into the shadowy forest for a long moment, and I wondered where his thoughts had taken him. \"Why\u2026 ?\" I began, and then paused, not sure how to continue. He looked at me and smiled; sunlight glinted off his face, his teeth.  \"Yes?\" \"Tell me why you ran from me before.\" His smile faded. \"You know why.\" \"No, I mean, exactly what did I do wrong? I'll have to be on my guard, you see, so I better start learning what I shouldn't do. This, for example\" \u2014 I stroked the back of his hand \u2014 \"seems to be all right.\" He smiled again. \"You didn't do anything wrong, Bella. It was my fault.\" \"But I want to help, if I can, to not make this harder for you.\" \"Well\u2026\" He contemplated for a moment. \"It was just how close you were. Most humans instinctively shy away from us, are repelled by our alienness\u2026 I wasn't expecting you to come so close. And the smell of your throat.\" He stopped short, looking to see if he'd upset me. \"Okay, then,\" I said flippantly, trying to alleviate the suddenly tense atmosphere. I tucked my chin. \"No throat exposure.\" It worked; he laughed. \"No, really, it was more the surprise than anything else.\" He raised his free hand and placed it gently on the side of my neck. I sat very still, the chill of his touch a natural warning \u2014 a warning telling me to be terrified. But there was no feeling of fear in me. There were, however, other feelings\u2026 \"You see,\" he said. \"Perfectly fine.\" My blood was racing, and I wished I could slow it, sensing that this must make everything so much more difficult \u2014 the thudding of my pulse in my veins. Surely he could hear it. \"The blush on your cheeks is lovely,\" he murmured. He gently freed his other hand. My hands fell limply into my lap. Softly he brushed my cheek, then held my face between his marble hands. \"Be very still,\" he whispered, as if I wasn't already frozen. Slowly, never moving his eyes from mine, he leaned toward me. Then abruptly, but very gently, he rested his cold cheek against the hollow at the base of my throat. I was quite unable to move, even if I'd wanted to. I listened to the sound of his even breathing, watching the sun and wind play in his bronze hair, more human than any other part of him. With deliberate slowness, his hands slid down the sides of my neck. I shivered, and I heard him catch his breath. But his hands didn't pause as they softly moved to my shoulders, and then stopped. His face drifted to the side, his nose skimming across my collarbone. He came to rest with the side of his face pressed tenderly against my chest. Listening to my heart. \"Ah,\" he sighed. I don't know how long we sat without moving. It could have been hours.  Eventually the throb of my pulse quieted, but he didn't move or speak again as he held me. I knew at any moment it could be too much, and my life could end \u2014 so quickly that I might not even notice. And I couldn't make myself be afraid. I couldn't think of anything, except that he was touching me. And then, too soon, he released me.  His eyes were peaceful. \"It won't be so hard again,\" he said with satisfaction. \"Was that very hard for you?\" \"Not nearly as bad as I imagined it would be. And you?\" \"No, it wasn't bad\u2026 for me.\" He smiled at my inflection. \"You know what I mean.\" I smiled. \"Here.\" He took my hand and placed it against his cheek. \"Do you feel how warm it is?\" And it was almost warm, his usually icy skin. But I barely noticed, for I was touching his face, something I'd dreamed of constantly since the first day I'd seen him. \"Don't move,\" I whispered. No one could be still like Edward. He closed his eyes and became as immobile as stone, a carving under my hand. I moved even more slowly than he had, careful not to make one unexpected move. I caressed his cheek, delicately stroked his eyelid, the purple shadow in the hollow under his eye. I traced the shape of his perfect nose, and then, so carefully, his flawless lips. His lips parted under my hand, and I could feel his cool breath on my fingertips. I wanted to lean in, to inhale the scent of him. So I dropped my hand and leaned away, not wanting to push him too far. He opened his eyes, and they were hungry. Not in a way to make me fear, but rather to tighten the muscles in the pit of my stomach and send my pulse hammering through my veins again. \"I wish,\" he whispered, \"I wish you could feel the\u2026 complexity\u2026 the confusion\u2026 I feel. That you could understand.\" He raised his hand to my hair, then carefully brushed it across my face. \"Tell me,\" I breathed. \"I don't think I can. I've told you, on the one hand, the hunger \u2014 the thirst \u2014 that, deplorable creature that I am, I feel for you. And I think you can understand that, to an extent. Though\" \u2014 he half-smiled \u2014 \"as you are not addicted to any illegal substances, you probably can't empathize completely. \"But\u2026\" His fingers touched my lips lightly, making me shiver again. \"There are other hungers. Hungers I don't even understand, that are foreign to me.\" \"I may understand that better than you think.\" \"I'm not used to feeling so human. Is it always like this?\" \"For me?\" I paused. \"No, never. Never before this.\" He held my hands between his. They felt so feeble in his iron strength. \"I don't know how to be close to you,\" he admitted. \"I don't know if I can.\" I leaned forward very slowly, cautioning him with my eyes. I placed my cheek against his stone chest. I could hear his breath, and nothing else. \"This is enough,\" I sighed, closing my eyes. In a very human gesture, he put his arms around me and pressed his face against my hair. \"You're better at this than you give yourself credit for,\" I noted. \"I have human instincts \u2014 they may be buried deep, but they're there.\" We sat like that for another immeasurable moment; I wondered if he could be as unwilling to move as I was. But I could see the light was fading, the shadows of the forest beginning to touch us, and I sighed. \"You have to go.\" \"I thought you couldn't read my mind.\" \"It's getting clearer.\" I could hear a smile in his voice. He took my shoulders and I looked into his face. \"Can I show you something?\" he asked, sudden excitement flaring in his eyes. \"Show me what?\" \"I'll show you how I travel in the forest.\" He saw my expression. \"Don't worry, you'll be very safe, and we'll get to your truck much faster.\" His mouth twitched up into that crooked smile so beautiful my heart nearly stopped. \"Will you turn into a bat?\" I asked warily. He laughed, louder than I'd ever heard. \"Like I haven't heard that one before!\" \"Right, I'm sure you get that all the time.\" \"Come on, little coward, climb on my back.\" I waited to see if he was kidding, but, apparently, he meant it. He smiled as he read my hesitation, and reached for me. My heart reacted; even though he couldn't hear my thoughts, my pulse always gave me away. He then proceeded to sling me onto his back, with very little effort on my part, besides, when in place, clamping my legs and arms so tightly around him that it would choke a normal person. It was like clinging to a stone. \"I'm a bit heavier than your average backpack,\" I warned.  \"Hah!\" he snorted. I could almost hear his eyes rolling. I'd never seen him in such high spirits before. He startled me, suddenly grabbing my hand, pressing my palm to his face, and inhaling deeply. \"Easier all the time,\" he muttered. And then he was running. If I'd ever feared death before in his presence, it was nothing compared to how I felt now. He streaked through the dark, thick underbrush of the forest like a bullet, like a ghost. There was no sound, no evidence that his feet touched the earth. His breathing never changed, never indicated any effort. But the trees flew by at deadly speeds, always missing us by inches. I was too terrified to close my eyes, though the cool forest air whipped against my face and burned them. I felt as if I were stupidly sticking my head out the window of an airplane in flight. And, for the first time in my life, I felt the dizzy faintness of motion sickness. Then it was over. We'd hiked hours this morning to reach Edward's meadow, and now, in a matter of minutes, we were back to the truck. \"Exhilarating, isn't it?\" His voice was high, excited. He stood motionless, waiting for me to climb down. I tried, but my muscles wouldn't respond. My arms and legs stayed locked around him while my head spun uncomfortably. \"Bella?\" he asked, anxious now. \"I think I need to lie down,\" I gasped. \"Oh, sorry.\" He waited for me, but I still couldn't move. \"I think I need help,\" I admitted. He laughed quietly, and gently unloosened my stranglehold on his neck. There was no resisting the iron strength of his hands. Then he pulled me around to face him, cradling me in his arms like a small child. He held me for a moment, then carefully placed me on the springy ferns. \"How do you feel?\" he asked. I couldn't be sure how I felt when my head was spinning so crazily. \"Dizzy, I think.\" \"Put your head between your knees.\" I tried that, and it helped a little. I breathed in and out slowly, keeping my head very still. I felt him sitting beside me. The moments passed, and eventually I found that I could raise my head. There was a hollow ringing sound in my ears. \"I guess that wasn't the best idea,\" he mused. I tried to be positive, but my voice was weak. \"No, it was very interesting.\" \"Hah! You're as white as a ghost \u2014 no, you're as white as me!\" \"I think I should have closed my eyes.\" \"Remember that next time.\" \"Next time!\" I groaned. He laughed, his mood still radiant. \"Show-off,\" I muttered. \"Open your eyes, Bella,\" he said quietly. And he was right there, his face so close to mine. His beauty stunned my mind \u2014 it was too much, an excess I couldn't grow accustomed to. \"I was thinking, while I was running\u2026\" He paused. \"About not hitting the trees, I hope.\" \"Silly Bella,\" he chuckled. \"Running is second nature to me, it's not something I have to think about.\" \"Show-off,\" I muttered again. He smiled. \"No,\" he continued, \"I was thinking there was something I wanted to try.\" And he took my face in his hands again. I couldn't breathe. He hesitated \u2014 not in the normal way, the human way. Not the way a man might hesitate before he kissed a woman, to gauge her reaction, to see how he would be received. Perhaps he would hesitate to prolong the moment, that ideal moment of anticipation, sometimes better than the kiss itself. Edward hesitated to test himself, to see if this was safe, to make sure he was still in control of his need. And then his cold, marble lips pressed very softly against mine. What neither of us was prepared for was my response. Blood boiled under my skin, burned in my lips. My breath came in a wild gasp. My fingers knotted in his hair, clutching him to me. My lips parted as I breathed in his heady scent. Immediately I felt him turn to unresponsive stone beneath my lips. His hands gently, but with irresistible force, pushed my face back. I opened my eyes and saw his guarded expression. \"Oops,\" I breathed. \"That's an understatement.\" His eyes were wild, his jaw clenched in acute restraint, yet he didn't lapse from his perfect articulation. He held my face just inches from his. He dazzled my eyes. \"Should I\u2026 ?\" I tried to disengage myself, to give him some room. His hands refused to let me move so much as an inch. \"No, it's tolerable. Wait for a moment, please.\" His voice was polite, controlled. I kept my eyes on his, watched as the excitement in them faded and gentled. Then he smiled a surprisingly impish grin. \"There,\" he said, obviously pleased with himself. \"Tolerable?\" I asked. He laughed aloud. \"I'm stronger than I thought. It's nice to know.\" \"I wish I could say the same. I'm sorry.\" \"You are only human, after all.\" \"Thanks so much,\" I said, my voice acerbic. He was on his feet in one of his lithe, almost invisibly quick movements. He held out his hand to me, an unexpected gesture. I was so used to our standard of careful non-contact. I took his icy hand, needing the support more than I thought. My balance had not yet returned. \"Are you still faint from the run? Or was it my kissing expertise?\" How lighthearted, how human he seemed as he laughed now, his seraphic face untroubled. He was a different Edward than the one I had known. And I felt all the more besotted by him. It would cause me physical pain to be separated from him now. \"I can't be sure, I'm still woozy,\" I managed to respond. \"I think it's some of both, though.\" \"Maybe you should let me drive.\" \"Are you insane?\" I protested. \"I can drive better than you on your best day,\" he teased. \"You have much slower reflexes.\" \"I'm sure that's true, but I don't think my nerves, or my truck, could take it.\" \"Some trust, please, Bella.\" My hand was in my pocket, curled tightly around the key. I pursed my lips, deliberated, then shook my head with a tight grin. \"Nope. Not a chance.\" He raised his eyebrows in disbelief. I started to step around him, heading for the driver's side. He might have let me pass if I hadn't wobbled slightly. Then again, he might not have. His arm created an inescapable snare around my waist. \"Bella, I've already expended a great deal of personal effort at this point to keep you alive. I'm not about to let you behind the wheel of a vehicle when you can't even walk straight. Besides, friends don't let friends drive drunk,\" he quoted with a chuckle. I could smell the unbearably sweet fragrance coming off his chest. \"Drunk?\" I objected. \"You're intoxicated by my very presence.\" He was grinning that playful smirk again. \"I can't argue with that,\" I sighed.; I couldn't resist him in anything. I held the key high and dropped it, watching his hand flash like lightning to catch it soundlessly. \"Take it easy \u2014 my truck is a senior citizen.\" \"Very sensible,\" he approved. \"And are you not affected at all?\" I asked, irked. \"By my presence?\" Again his mobile features transformed, his expression became soft, warm.
