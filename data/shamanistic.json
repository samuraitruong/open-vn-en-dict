Aside from a morning session, the emperor would spend much of the evening participating in Buddhist prayer or <em>shamanistic</em> rituals, passed down through his Manchurian heritage. All major rituals, such as those respecting Heaven and Earth, or soil and grain ceremonies, were sure to be attended and led by the emperor personally.",
