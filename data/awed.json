            "en": "16           16. CARLISLE He led me back to the room that he'd pointed out as Carlisle's office. He paused outside the door for an instant. \"Come in,\" Carlisle's voice invited. Edward opened the door to a high-ceilinged room with tall, west-facing windows. The walls were paneled again, in a darker wood \u2014 where they were visible. Most of the wall space was taken up by towering bookshelves that reached high above my head and held more books than I'd ever seen outside a library. Carlisle sat behind a huge mahogany desk in a leather chair. He was just placing a bookmark in the pages of the thick volume he held. The room was how I'd always imagined a college dean's would look \u2014 only Carlisle looked too young to fit the part. \"What can I do for you?\" he asked us pleasantly, rising from his seat.  \"I wanted to show Bella some of our history,\" Edward said. \"Well, your history, actually.\" \"We didn't mean to disturb you,\" I apologized. \"Not at all. Where are you going to start?\" \"The Waggoner,\" Edward replied, placing one hand lightly on my shoulder and spinning me around to look back toward the door we'd just come through. Every time he touched me, in even the most casual way, my heart had an audible reaction. It was more embarrassing with Carlisle there. The wall we faced now was different from the others. Instead of bookshelves, this wall was crowded with framed pictures of all sizes, some in vibrant colors, others dull monochromes. I searched for some logic, some binding motif the collection had in common, but I found nothing in my hasty examination. Edward pulled me toward the far left side, standing me in front of a small square oil painting in a plain wooden frame. This one did not stand out among the bigger and brighter pieces; painted in varying tones of sepia, it depicted a miniature city full of steeply slanted roofs, with thin spires atop a few scattered towers. A wide river filled the foreground, crossed by a bridge covered with structures that looked like tiny cathedrals. \"London in the sixteen-fifties,\" Edward said. \"The London of my youth,\" Carlisle added, from a few feet behind us. I flinched; I hadn't heard him approach. Edward squeezed my hand.  \"Will you tell the story?\" Edward asked. I twisted a little to see Carlisle's reaction. He met my glance and smiled. \"I would,\" he replied. \"But I'm actually running a bit late. The hospital called this morning \u2014 Dr. Snow is taking a sick day. Besides, you know the stories as well as I do,\" he added, grinning at Edward now. It was a strange combination to absorb \u2014 the everyday concerns of the town doctor stuck in the middle of a discussion of his early days in seventeenth-century London. It was also unsettling to know that he spoke aloud only for my benefit. After another warm smile for me, Carlisle left the room. I stared at the little picture of Carlisle's hometown for a long moment.  \"What happened then?\" I finally asked, staring up at Edward, who was watching me. \"When he realized what had happened to him?\" He glanced back to the paintings, and I looked to see which image caught his interest now. It was a larger landscape in dull fall colors \u2014 an empty, shadowed meadow in a forest, with a craggy peak in the distance. \"When he knew what he had become,\" Edward said quietly, \"he rebelled against it. He tried to destroy himself. But that's not easily done.\" \"How?\" I didn't mean to say it aloud, but the word broke through my shock. \"He jumped from great heights,\" Edward told me, his voice impassive. \"He tried to drown himself in the ocean\u2026 but he was young to the new life, and very strong. It is amazing that he was able to resist\u2026 feeding\u2026 while he was still so new. The instinct is more powerful then, it takes over everything. But he was so repelled by himself that he had the strength to try to kill himself with starvation.\" \"Is that possible?\u201dMy voice was faint. \"No, there are very few ways we can be killed.\" I opened my mouth to ask, but he spoke before I could. \"So he grew very hungry, and eventually weak. He strayed as far as he could from the human populace, recognizing that his willpower was weakening, too.  For months he wandered by night, seeking the loneliest places, loathing himself. \"One night, a herd of deer passed his hiding place. He was so wild with thirst that he attacked without a thought. His strength returned and he realized there was an alternative to being the vile monster he feared. Had he not eaten venison in his former life? Over the next months his new philosophy was born. He could exist without being a demon. He found himself again. \"He began to make better use of his time. He'd always been intelligent, eager to learn. Now he had unlimited time before him. He studied by night, planned by day. He swam to France and \u2014\" \"He swam to France?\" \"People swim the Channel all the time, Bella,\" he reminded me patiently. \"That's true, I guess. It just sounded funny in that context. Go on.\" \"Swimming is easy for us \u2014\" \"Everything is easy for you,\" I griped. He waited, his expression amused. \"I won't interrupt again, I promise.\" He chuckled darkly, and finished his sentence. \"Because, technically, we don't need to breathe.\" \"You \u2014\" \"No, no, you promised.\" He laughed, putting his cold finger lightly to my lips. \"Do you want to hear the story or not?\" \"You can't spring something like that on me, and then expect me not to say anything,\" I mumbled against his finger. He lifted his hand, moving it to rest against my neck. The speed of my heart reacted to that, but I persisted. \"You don't have to breathe?\" I demanded. \"No, it's not necessary. Just a habit.\" He shrugged. \"How long can you go\u2026 without breathing?\" \"Indefinitely, I suppose; I don't know. It gets a bit uncomfortable \u2014 being without a sense of smell.\" \"A bit uncomfortable,\" I echoed. I wasn't paying attention to my own expression, but something in it made him grow somber. His hand dropped to his side and he stood very still, his eyes intent on my face. The silence lengthened. His features were immobile as stone. \"What is it?\" I whispered, touching his frozen face. His face softened under my hand, and he sighed. \"I keep waiting for it to happen.\" \"For what to happen?\" \"I know that at some point, something I tell you or something you see is going to be too much. And then you'll run away from me, screaming as you go.\" He smiled half a smile, but his eyes were serious. \"I won't stop you. I want this to happen, because I want you to be safe. And yet, I want to be with you. The two desires are impossible to reconcile\u2026\" He trailed off, staring at my face. Waiting. \"I'm not running anywhere,\" I promised. \"We'll see,\" he said, smiling again. I frowned at him. \"So, go on \u2014 Carlisle was swimming to France.\" He paused, getting back into his story. Reflexively, his eyes flickered to another picture \u2014 the most colorful of them all, the most ornately framed, and the largest; it was twice as wide as the door it hung next to. The canvas overflowed with bright figures in swirling robes, writhing around long pillars and off marbled balconies. I couldn't tell if it represented Greek mythology, or if the characters floating in the clouds above were meant to be biblical. \"Carlisle swam to France, and continued on through Europe, to the universities there. By night he studied music, science, medicine \u2014 and found his calling, his penance, in that, in saving human lives.\" His expression became <em>awed</em>, almost reverent. \"I can't adequately describe the struggle; it took Carlisle two centuries of torturous effort to perfect his self-control. Now he is all but immune to the scent of human blood, and he is able to do the work he loves without agony. He finds a great deal of peace there, at the hospital\u2026\" Edward stared off into space for a long moment. Suddenly he seemed to recall his purpose. He tapped his finger against the huge painting in front of us. \"He was studying in Italy when he discovered the others there. They were much more civilized and educated than the wraiths of the London sewers.\" He touched a comparatively sedate quartet of figures painted on the highest balcony, looking down calmly on the mayhem below them. I examined the grouping carefully and realized, with a startled laugh, that I recognized the golden-haired man. \"Solimena was greatly inspired by Carlisle's friends. He often painted them as gods,\" Edward chuckled. \"Aro, Marcus, Caius,\" he said, indicating the other three, two black-haired, one snowy-white. \"Nighttime patrons of the arts.\" \"What happened to them?\" I wondered aloud, my fingertip hovering a centimeter from the figures on the canvas. \"They're still there.\" He shrugged. \"As they have been for who knows how many millennia. Carlisle stayed with them only for a short time, just a few decades. He greatly admired their civility, their refinement, but they persisted in trying to cure his aversion to 'his natural food source,' as they called it. They tried to persuade him, and he tried to persuade them, to no avail. At that point, Carlisle decided to try the New World. He dreamed of finding others like himself. He was very lonely, you see. \"He didn't find anyone for a long time. But, as monsters became the stuff of fairy tales, he found he could interact with unsuspecting humans as if he were one of them. He began practicing medicine. But the companionship he craved evaded him; he couldn't risk familiarity. \"When the influenza epidemic hit, he was working nights in a hospital in Chicago. He'd been turning over an idea in his mind for several years, and he had almost decided to act \u2014 since he couldn't find a companion, he would create one. He wasn't absolutely sure how his own transformation had occurred, so he was hesitant. And he was loath to steal anyone's life the way his had been stolen. It was in that frame of mind that he found me. There was no hope for me; I was left in a ward with the dying. He had nursed my parents, and knew I was alone. He decided to try\u2026\" His voice, nearly a whisper now, trailed off. He stared unseeingly through the west windows. I wondered which images filled his mind now, Carlisle's memories or his own. I waited quietly. When he turned back to me, a gentle angel's smile lit his expression. \"And so we've come full circle,\" he concluded. \"Have you always stayed with Carlisle, then?\" I wondered. \"Almost always.\" He put his hand lightly on my waist and pulled me with him as he walked through the door. I stared back at the wall of pictures, wondering if I would ever get to hear the other stories. Edward didn't say any more as we walked down the hall, so I asked, \"Almost?\" He sighed, seeming reluctant to answer. \"Well, I had a typical bout of rebellious adolescence \u2014 about ten years after I was\u2026 born\u2026 created, whatever you want to call it. I wasn't sold on his life of abstinence, and I resented him for curbing my appetite. So I went off on my own for a time.\" \"Really?\" I was intrigued, rather than frightened, as I perhaps should have been. He could tell. I vaguely realized that we were headed up the next flight of stairs, but I wasn't paying much attention to my surroundings. \"That doesn't repulse you?\" \"No.\" \"Why not?\" \"I guess\u2026 it sounds reasonable.\" He barked a laugh, more loudly than before. We were at the top of the stairs now, in another paneled hallway. \"From the time of my new birth,\" he murmured, \"I had the advantage of knowing what everyone around me was thinking, both human and non-human alike. That's why it took me ten years to defy Carlisle \u2014 I could read his perfect sincerity, understand exactly why he lived the way he did. \"It took me only a few years to return to Carlisle and recommit to his vision. I thought I would be exempt from the\u2026 depression\u2026 that accompanies a conscience. Because I knew the thoughts of my prey, I could pass over the innocent and pursue only the evil. If I followed a murderer down a dark alley where he stalked a young girl \u2014 if I saved her, then surely I wasn't so terrible.\" I shivered, imagining only too clearly what he described \u2014 the alley at night, the frightened girl, the dark man behind her. And Edward, Edward as he hunted, terrible and glorious as a young god, unstoppable. Would she have been grateful, that girl, or more frightened than before? \"But as time went on, I began to see the monster in my eyes. I couldn't escape the debt of so much human life taken, no matter how justified. And I went back to Carlisle and Esme. They welcomed me back like the prodigal. It was more than I deserved.\" We'd come to a stop in front of the last door in the hall. \"My room,\" he informed me, opening it and pulling me through. His room faced south, with a wall-sized window like the great room below. The whole back side of the house must be glass. His view looked down on the winding Sol Duc River, across the untouched forest to the Olympic Mountain range. The mountains were much closer than I would have believed. The western wall was completely covered with shelf after shelf of CDs. His room was better stocked than a music store. In the corner was a sophisticated-looking sound system, the kind I was afraid to touch because I'd be sure to break something. There was no bed, only a wide and inviting black leather sofa. The floor was covered with a thick golden carpet, and the walls were hung with heavy fabric in a slightly darker shade. \"Good acoustics?\" I guessed. He chuckled and nodded. He picked up a remote and turned the stereo on. It was quiet, but the soft jazz number sounded like the band was in the room with us. I went to look at his mind-boggling music collection. \"How do you have these organized?\" I asked, unable to find any rhyme or reason to the titles. He wasn't paying attention. \"Ummm, by year, and then by personal preference within that frame,\" he said absently. I turned, and he was looking at me with a peculiar expression in his eyes. \"What?\" \"I was prepared to feel\u2026 relieved. Having you know about everything, not needing to keep secrets from you. But I didn't expect to feel more than that. I like it. It makes me\u2026 happy.\" He shrugged, smiling slightly. \"I'm glad,\" I said, smiling back. I'd worried that he might regret telling me these things. It was good to know that wasn't the case. But then, as his eyes dissected my expression, his smile faded and his forehead creased. \"You're still waiting for the running and the screaming, aren't you?\" I guessed. A faint smile touched his lips, and he nodded. \"I hate to burst your bubble, but you're really not as scary as you think you are. I don't find you scary at all, actually,\" I lied casually. He stopped, raising his eyebrows in blatant disbelief. Then he flashed a wide, wicked smile. \"You really shouldn't have said that,\" he chuckled. He growled, a low sound in the back of his throat; his lips curled back over his perfect teeth. His body shifted suddenly, half-crouched, tensed like a lion about to pounce. I backed away from him, glaring. \"You wouldn't.\" \u00a0\" I didn't see him leap at me \u2014 it was much too fast. I only found myself suddenly airborne, and then we crashed onto the sofa, knocking it into the wall. All the while, his arms formed an iron cage of protection around me \u2014 I was barely jostled. But I still was gasping as I tried to right myself. He wasn't having that. He curled me into a ball against his chest, holding me more securely than iron chains. I glared at him in alarm, but he seemed well in control, his jaw relaxed as he grinned, his eyes bright only with humor. \"You were saying?\" he growled playfully. \"That you are a very, very terrifying monster,\" I said, my sarcasm marred a bit by my breathless voice. \"Much better,\" he approved. \"Um.\" I struggled. \"Can I get up now?\" He just laughed. \"Can we come in?\" a soft voice sounded from the hall. I struggled to free myself, but Edward merely readjusted me so that I was somewhat more conventionally seated on his lap. I could see it was Alice, then, and Jasper behind her in the doorway. My cheeks burned, but Edward seemed at ease. \"Go ahead.\" Edward was still chuckling quietly. Alice seemed to find nothing unusual in our embrace; she walked \u2014 almost danced, her movements were so graceful \u2014 to the center of the room, where she folded herself sinuously onto the floor. Jasper, however, paused at the door, his expression a trifle shocked. He stared at Edward's face, and I wondered if he was tasting the atmosphere with his unusual sensitivity. \"It sounded like you were having Bella for lunch, and we came to see if you would share,\" Alice announced. I stiffened for an instant, until I realized Edward was grinning \u2014 whether at her comment or my response, I couldn't tell. \"Sorry, I don't believe I have enough to spare,\" he replied, his arms holding me recklessly close. \"Actually,\" Jasper said, smiling despite himself as he walked into the room, \"Alice says there's going to be a real storm tonight, and Emmett wants to play ball. Are you game?\" The words were all common enough, but the context confused me. I gathered that Alice was a bit more reliable than the weatherman, though. Edward's eyes lit up, but he hesitated. \"Of course you should bring Bella,\" Alice chirped. I thought I saw Jasper throw a quick glance at her. \"Do you want to go?\" Edward asked me, excited, his expression vivid. \"Sure.\" I couldn't disappoint such a face. \"Um, where are we going?\" \"We have to wait for thunder to play ball \u2014 you'll see why,\" he promised. \"Will I need an umbrella?\" They all three laughed aloud. \"Will she?\" Jasper asked Alice. \"No.\" She was positive. \"The storm will hit over town. It should be dry enough in the clearing.\" \"Good, then.\" The enthusiasm in Jasper's voice was catching, naturally. I found myself eager, rather than scared stiff. \"Let's go see if Carlisle will come.\" Alice bounded up and to the door in a fashion that would break any ballerina's heart. \"Like you don't know,\" Jasper teased, and they were swiftly on their way. Jasper managed to inconspicuously close the door behind them. \"What will we be playing?\" I demanded. \"You will be watching,\" Edward clarified. \"We will be playing baseball.\" I rolled my eyes. \"Vampires like baseball?\" \"It's the American pastime,\" he said with mock solemnity.",

            "en": "4         4. INVITATIONS In my dream it was very dark, and what dim light there was seemed to be radiating from Edward's skin. I couldn't see his face, just his back as he walked away from me, leaving me in the blackness. No matter how fast I ran, I couldn't catch up to him; no matter how loud I called, he never turned. Troubled, I woke in the middle of the night and couldn't sleep again for what seemed like a very long time. After that, he was in my dreams nearly every night, but always on the periphery, never within reach. The month that followed the accident was uneasy, tense, and, at first, embarrassing. To my dismay, I found myself the center of attention for the rest of that week. Tyler Crowley was impossible, following me around, obsessed with making amends to me somehow. I tried to convince him what I wanted more than anything else was for him to forget all about it \u2014 especially since nothing had actually happened to me \u2014 but he remained insistent. He followed me between classes and sat at our now-crowded lunch table. Mike and Eric were even less friendly toward him than they were to each other, which made me worry that I'd gained another unwelcome fan. No one seemed concerned about Edward, though I explained over and over that he was the hero \u2014 how he had pulled me out of the way and had nearly been crushed, too. I tried to be convincing. Jessica, Mike, Eric, and everyone else always commented that they hadn't even seen him there till the van was pulled away. I wondered to myself why no one else had seen him standing so far away, before he was suddenly, impossibly saving my life. With chagrin, I realized the probable cause \u2014 no one else was as aware of Edward as I always was. No one else watched him the way I did. How pitiful. Edward was never surrounded by crowds of curious bystanders eager for his firsthand account. People avoided him as usual. The Cullens and the Hales sat at the same table as always, not eating, talking only among themselves. None of them, especially Edward, glanced my way anymore.  When he sat next to me in class, as far from me as the table would allow, he seemed totally unaware of my presence. Only now and then, when his fists would suddenly ball up \u2014 skin stretched even whiter over the bones \u2014 did I wonder if he wasn't quite as oblivious as he appeared.  He wished he hadn't pulled me from the path of Tyler's van \u2014 there was no other conclusion I could come to. I wanted very much to talk to him, and the day after the accident I tried. The last time I'd seen him, outside the ER, we'd both been so furious. I still was angry that he wouldn't trust me with the truth, even though I was keeping my part of the bargain flawlessly. But he had in fact saved my life, no matter how he'd done it. And, overnight, the heat of my anger faded into <em>awed</em> gratitude. He was already seated when I got to Biology, looking straight ahead. I sat down, expecting him to turn toward me. He showed no sign that he realized I was there. \"Hello, Edward,\" I said pleasantly, to show him I was going to behave myself. He turned his head a fraction toward me without meeting my gaze, nodded once, and then looked the other way. And that was the last contact I'd had with him, though he was there, a foot away from me, every day. I watched him sometimes, unable to stop myself\u2014 from a distance, though, in the cafeteria or parking lot. I\u00a0 watched as his golden eyes grew perceptibly darker day by day. But in class I gave no more notice that he existed than he showed toward me. I was miserable. And the dreams continued. Despite my outright lies, the tenor of my e-mails alerted Ren\u00e9e to my depression, and she called a few times, worried. I tried to convince her it was just the weather that had me down. Mike, at least, was pleased by the obvious coolness between me and my lab partner. I could see he'd been worried that Edward's daring rescue might have impressed me, and he was relieved that it seemed to have the opposite effect. He grew more confident, sitting on the edge of my table to talk before Biology class started, ignoring Edward as completely as he ignored us. The snow washed away for good after that one dangerously icy day. Mike was disappointed he'd never gotten to stage his snowball fight, but pleased that the beach trip would soon be possible. The rain continued heavily, though, and the weeks passed. Jessica made me aware of another event looming on the horizon \u2014 she called the first Tuesday of March to ask my permission to invite Mike to the girls' choice spring dance in two weeks. \"Are you sure you don't mind\u2026 you weren't planning to ask him?\" she persisted when I told her I didn't mind in the least. \"No, Jess, I'm not going,\" I assured her. Dancing was glaringly outside my range of abilities. \"It will be really fun.\" Her attempt to convince me was halfhearted. I suspected that Jessica enjoyed my inexplicable popularity more than my actual company. \"You have fun with Mike,\" I encouraged. The next day, I was surprised that Jessica wasn't her usual gushing self in Trig and Spanish. She was silent as she walked by my side between classes, and I was afraid to ask her why. If Mike had turned her down, I was the last person she would want to tell. My fears were strengthened during lunch when Jessica sat as far from Mike as possible, chatting animatedly with Eric. Mike was unusually quiet.  Mike was still quiet as he walked me to class, the uncomfortable look on his face a bad sign. But he didn't broach the subject until I was in my seat and he was perched on my desk. As always, I was electrically aware of Edward sitting close enough to touch, as distant as if he were merely an invention of my imagination. \"So,\" Mike said, looking at the floor, \"Jessica asked me to the spring dance.\" \"That's great.\" I made my voice bright and enthusiastic. \"You'll have a lot of fun with Jessica.\" \"Well\u2026\" He floundered as he examined my smile, clearly not happy with my response. \"I told her I had to think about it.\" \"Why would you do that?\" I let disapproval color my tone, though I was relieved he hadn't given her an absolute no. His face was bright red as he looked down again. Pity shook my resolve. \"I was wondering if\u2026 well, if you might be planning to ask me.\" I paused for a moment, hating the wave of guilt that swept through me. But I saw, from the corner of my eye, Edward's head tilt reflexively in my direction. \"Mike, I think you should tell her yes,\" I said.  \"Did you already ask someone?\" Did Edward notice how Mike's eyes flickered in his direction? \"No,\" I assured him. \"I'm not going to the dance at all.\" \"Why not?\" Mike demanded. I didn't want to get into the safety hazards that dancing presented, so I quickly made new plans. \"I'm going to Seattle that Saturday,\" I explained. I needed to get out of town anyway \u2014 it was suddenly the perfect time to go. \"Can't you go some other weekend?\" \"Sorry, no,\" I said. \"So you shouldn't make Jess wait any longer \u2014 it's rude.\" \"Yeah, you're right,\" he mumbled, and turned, dejected, to walk back to his seat. I closed my eyes and pressed my fingers to my temples, trying to push the guilt and sympathy out of my head. Mr. Banner began talking.  I sighed and opened my eyes. And Edward was staring at me curiously, that same, familiar edge of frustration even more distinct now in his black eyes. I stared back, surprised, expecting him to look quickly away. But instead he continued to gaze with probing intensity into my eyes. There was no question of me looking away. My hands started to shake. \"Mr. Cullen?\" the teacher called, seeking the answer to a question that I hadn't heard. \"The Krebs Cycle,\" Edward answered, seeming reluctant as he turned to look at Mr. Banner. I looked down at my book as soon as his eyes released me, trying to find my place. Cowardly as ever, I shifted my hair over my right shoulder to hide my face. I couldn't believe the rush of emotion pulsing through me \u2014 just because he'd happened to look at me for the first time in a half-dozen weeks. I couldn't allow him to have this level of influence over me. It was pathetic. More than pathetic, it was unhealthy. I tried very hard not to be aware of him for the rest of the hour, and, since that was impossible, at least not to let him know that I was aware of him. When the bell rang at last, I turned my back to him to gather my things, expecting him to leave immediately as usual. \"Bella?\" His voice shouldn't have been so familiar to me, as if I'd known the sound of it all my life rather than for just a few short weeks. I turned slowly, unwillingly. I didn't want to feel what I knew I would feel when I looked at his too-perfect face. My expression was wary when I finally turned to him; his expression was unreadable. He didn't say anything. \"What? Are you speaking to me again?\" I finally asked, an unintentional note of petulance in my voice. His lips twitched, fighting a smile. \"No, not really,\" he admitted. I closed my eyes and inhaled slowly through my nose, aware that I was gritting my teeth. He waited. \"Then what do you want, Edward?\" I asked, keeping my eyes closed; it was easier to talk to him coherently that way. \"I'm sorry.\" He sounded sincere. \"I'm being very rude, I know. But it's better this way, really.\" I opened my eyes. His face was very serious. \"I don't know what you mean,\" I said, my voice guarded. \"It's better if we're not friends,\" he explained. \"Trust me.\" My eyes narrowed. I'd heard that before. \"It's too bad you didn't figure that out earlier,\" I hissed through my teeth. \"You could have saved yourself all this regret.\" \"Regret?\" The word, and my tone, obviously caught him off guard. \"Regret for what?\" \"For not just letting that stupid van squish me.\" He was astonished. He stared at me in disbelief. When he finally spoke, he almost sounded mad. \"You think I regret saving your life?\" \"I know you do,\" I snapped. \"You don't know anything.\" He was definitely mad. I turned my head sharply away from him, clenching my jaw against all the wild accusations I wanted to hurl at him. I gathered my books together, then stood and walked to the door. I meant to sweep dramatically out of the room, but of course I caught the toe of my boot on the door jamb and dropped my books. I stood there for a moment, thinking about leaving them. Then I sighed and bent to pick them up. He was there; he'd already stacked them into a pile. He handed them to me, his face hard. \"Thank you,\" I said icily. His eyes narrowed. \"You're welcome,\" he retorted. I straightened up swiftly, turned away from him again, and stalked off to Gym without looking back. Gym was brutal. We'd moved on to basketball. My team never passed me the ball, so that was good, but I fell down a lot. Sometimes I took people with me. Today I was worse than usual because my head was so filled with Edward. I tried to concentrate on my feet, but he kept creeping back into my thoughts just when I really needed my balance. It was a relief, as always, to leave. I almost ran to the truck; there were just so many people I wanted to avoid. The truck had suffered only minimal damage in the accident. I'd had to replace the taillights, and if I'd had a real paint job, I would have touched that up. Tyler's parents had to sell their van for parts. I almost had a stroke when I rounded the corner and saw a tall, dark figure leaning against the side of my truck. Then I realized it was just Eric. I started walking again. \"Hey, Eric,\" I called. \"Hi, Bella.\" \"What's up?\" I said as I was unlocking the door. I wasn't paying attention to the uncomfortable edge in his voice, so his next words took me by surprise. \"Uh, I was just wondering\u2026 if you would go to the spring dance with me?\" His voice broke on the last word. \"I thought it was girls' choice,\" I said, too startled to be diplomatic. \"Well, yeah,\" he admitted, shamefaced. I recovered my composure and tried to make my smile warm. \"Thank you for asking me, but I'm going to be in Seattle that day.\" \"Oh,\" he said. \"Well, maybe next time.\" \"Sure,\" I agreed, and then bit my lip. I wouldn't want him to take that too literally. He slouched off, back toward the school. I heard a low chuckle. Edward was walking past the front of my truck, looking straight forward, his lips pressed together. I yanked the door open and jumped inside, slamming it loudly behind me. I revved the engine deafeningly and reversed out into the aisle. Edward was in his car already, two spaces down, sliding out smoothly in front of me, cutting me off. He stopped there \u2014 to wait for his family; I could see the four of them walking this way, but still by the cafeteria. I considered taking out the rear of his shiny Volvo, but there were too many witnesses. I looked in my rearview mirror. A line was beginning to form. Directly behind me, Tyler Crowley was in his recently acquired used Sentra, waving.  I was too aggravated to acknowledge him. While I was sitting there, looking everywhere but at the car in front of me, I heard a knock on my passenger side window. I looked over; it was Tyler. I glanced back in my rearview mirror, confused. His car was still running, the door left open. I leaned across the cab to crank the window down. It was stiff. I got it halfway down, then gave up. \"I'm sorry, Tyler, I'm stuck behind Cullen.\" I was annoyed \u2014 obviously the holdup wasn't my fault. \"Oh, I know \u2014 I just wanted to ask you something while we're trapped here.\" He grinned. This could not be happening. \"Will you ask me to the spring dance?\" he continued. \"I'm not going to be in town, Tyler.\" My voice sounded a little sharp. I had to remember it wasn't his fault that Mike and Eric had already used up my quota of patience for the day. \"Yeah, Mike said that,\" he admitted. \"Then why \u2014\" He shrugged. \"I was hoping you were just letting him down easy.\" Okay, it was completely his fault. \"Sorry, Tyler,\" I said, working to hide my irritation. \"I really am going out of town.\" \"That's cool. We still have prom.\" And before I could respond, he was walking back to his car. I could feel the shock on my face. I looked forward to see Alice, Rosalie, Emmett, and Jasper all sliding into the Volvo. In his rearview mirror, Edward's eyes were on me. He was unquestionably shaking with laughter, as if he'd heard every word Tyler had said. My foot itched toward the gas pedal\u2026 one little bump wouldn't hurt any of them, just that glossy silver paint job. I revved the engine. But they were all in, and Edward was speeding away. I drove home slowly, carefully, muttering to myself the whole way. When I got home, I decided to make chicken enchiladas for dinner. It was a long process, and it would keep me busy. While I was simmering the onions and chilies, the phone rang. I was almost afraid to answer it, but it might be Charlie or my mom. It was Jessica, and she was jubilant; Mike had caught her after school to accept her invitation. I celebrated with her briefly while I stirred. She had to go, she wanted to call Angela and Lauren to tell them. I suggested \u2014 with casual innocence \u2014 that maybe Angela, the shy girl who had Biology with me, could ask Eric. And Lauren, a \u00a0standoffish girl who had always ignored me at the lunch table, could ask Tyler; I'd heard he was still available. Jess thought that was a great idea. Now that she was sure of Mike, she actually sounded sincere when she said she wished I would go to the dance. I gave her my Seattle excuse. After I hung up, I tried to concentrate on dinner \u2014 dicing the chicken especially; I didn't want to take another trip to the emergency room. But my head was spinning, trying to analyze every word Edward had spoken today. What did he mean, it was better if we weren't friends?  My stomach twisted as I realized what he must have meant. He must see how absorbed I was by him; he must not want to lead me on\u2026 so we couldn't even be friends\u2026 because he wasn't interested in me at all. Of course he wasn't interested in me, I thought angrily, my eyes stinging \u2014 a delayed reaction to the onions. I wasn't interesting. And he was. Interesting\u2026 and brilliant\u2026 and mysterious\u2026 and perfect\u2026 and beautiful\u2026 and possibly able to lift full-sized vans with one hand. Well, that was fine. I could leave him alone. I would leave him alone. I would get through my self-imposed sentence here in purgatory, and then hopefully some school in the Southwest, or possibly Hawaii, would offer me a scholarship. I focused my thoughts on sunny beaches and palm trees as I finished the enchiladas and put them in the oven. Charlie seemed suspicious when he came home and smelled the green peppers. I couldn't blame him \u2014 the closest edible Mexican food was probably in southern California. But he was a cop, even if just a small-town cop, so he was brave enough to take the first bite. He seemed to like it. It was fun to watch as he slowly began trusting me in the kitchen. \"Dad?\" I asked when he was almost done. \"Yeah, Bella?\" \"Um, I just wanted to let you know that I'm going to Seattle for the day a week from Saturday\u2026 if that's okay?\" I didn't want to ask permission \u2014 it set a bad precedent \u2014 but I felt rude, so I tacked it on at the end. \"Why?\" He sounded surprised, as if he were unable to imagine something that Forks couldn't offer. \"Well, I wanted to get few books \u2014 the library here is pretty limited \u2014 and maybe look at some clothes.\" I had more money than I was used to having, since, thanks to Charlie, I hadn't had to pay for a car. Not that the truck didn't cost me quite a bit in the gas department. \"That truck probably doesn't get very good gas mileage,\" he said, echoing my thoughts. \"I know, I'll stop in Montesano and Olympia \u2014 and Tacoma if I have to.\" \"Are you going all by yourself?\" he asked, and I couldn't tell if he was suspicious I had a secret boyfriend or just worried about car trouble. \"Yes.\" \"Seattle is a big city \u2014 you could get lost,\" he fretted. \"Dad, Phoenix is five times the size of Seattle \u2014 and I can read a map, don't worry about it.\" \"Do you want me to come with you?\" I tried to be crafty as I hid my horror. \"That's all right, Dad, I'll probably just be in dressing rooms all day \u2014 very boring.\" \"Oh, okay.\" The thought of sitting in women's clothing stores for any period of time immediately put him off. \"Thanks.\" I smiled at him. \"Will you be back in time for the dance?\" Grrr. Only in a town this small would a father know when the high school dances were. \"No \u2014 I don't dance, Dad.\" He, of all people, should understand that \u2014 I didn't get my balance problems from my mother. He did understand. \"Oh, that's right,\" he realized. The next morning, when I pulled into the parking lot, I deliberately parked as far as possible from the silver Volvo. I didn't want to put myself in the path of too much temptation and end up owing him a new car. Getting out of the cab, I fumbled with my key and it fell into a puddle at my feet. As I bent to get it, a white hand flashed out and grabbed it before I could. I jerked upright. Edward Cullen was right next to me, leaning casually against my truck. \"How do you do that?\" I asked in amazed irritation. \"Do what?\" He held my key out as he spoke. As I reached for it, he dropped it into my palm. \"Appear out of thin air.\" \"Bella, it's not my fault if you are exceptionally unobservant.\" His voice was quiet as usual \u2014 velvet, muted. I scowled at his perfect face. His eyes were light again today, a deep, golden honey color. Then I had to look down, to reassemble my now-tangled thoughts. \"Why the traffic jam last night?\" I demanded, still looking away. \"I thought you were supposed to be pretending I don't exist, not irritating me to death.\" \"That was for Tyler's sake, not mine. I had to give him his chance.\" He snickered. \"You\u2026\" I gasped. I couldn't think of a bad enough word. It felt like the heat of my anger should physically burn him, but he only seemed more amused. \"And I'm not pretending you don't exist,\" he continued. \"So you are trying to irritate me to death? Since Tyler's van didn't do the job?\" Anger flashed in his tawny eyes. His lips pressed into a hard line, all signs of humor gone. \"Bella, you are utterly absurd,\" he said, his low voice cold. My palms tingled \u2014 I wanted so badly to hit something. I was surprised at myself. I was usually a nonviolent person. I turned my back and started to walk away. \"Wait,\" he called. I kept walking, sloshing angrily through the rain. But he was next to me, easily keeping pace. \"I'm sorry, that was rude,\" he said as we walked. I ignored him. \"I'm not saying it isn't true,\" he continued, \"but it was rude to say it, anyway.\" \"Why won't you leave me alone?\" I grumbled. \"I wanted to ask you something, but you sidetracked me,\" he chuckled. He seemed to have recovered his good humor. \"Do you have a multiple personality disorder?\" I asked severely. \"You're doing it again.\" I sighed. \"Fine then. What do you want to ask?\" \"I was wondering if, a week from Saturday \u2014 you know, the day of the spring dance \u2014\" \"Are you trying to be funny?\" I interrupted him, wheeling toward him. My face got drenched as I looked up at his expression. His eyes were wickedly amused. \"Will you please allow me to finish?\" I bit my lip and clasped my hands together, interlocking my fingers, so I couldn't do anything rash. \"I heard you say you were going to Seattle that day, and I was wondering if you wanted a ride.\" That was unexpected. \"What?\" I wasn't sure what he was getting at. \"Do you want a ride to Seattle?\" \"With who?\" I asked, mystified. \"Myself, obviously.\" He enunciated every syllable, as if he were talking to someone mentally handicapped. I was still stunned. \"Why?\" \"Well, I was planning to go to Seattle in the next few weeks, and, to be honest, I'm not sure if your truck can make it.\" \"My truck works just fine, thank you very much for your concern.\" I started to walk again, but I was too surprised to maintain the same level of anger. \"But can your truck make it there on one tank of gas?\" He matched my pace again. \"I don't see how that is any of your business.\" Stupid, shiny Volvo owner. \"The wasting of finite resources is everyone's business.\" \"Honestly, Edward.\" I felt a thrill go through me as I said his name, and I hated it. \"I can't keep up with you. I thought you didn't want to be my friend.\" \"I said it would be better if we weren't friends, not that I didn't want to be.\" \"Oh, thanks, now that's all cleared up.\" Heavy sarcasm. I realized I had stopped walking again. We were under the shelter of the cafeteria roof now, so I could more easily look at his face. Which certainly didn't help my clarity of thought. \"It would be more\u2026 prudent for you not to be my friend,\" he explained.  \"But I'm tired of trying to stay away from you, Bella.\" His eyes were gloriously intense as he uttered that last sentence, his voice smoldering. I couldn't remember how to breathe. \"Will you go with me to Seattle?\" he asked, still intense. I couldn't speak yet, so I just nodded. He smiled briefly, and then his face became serious. \"You really should stay away from me,\" he warned. \"I'll see you in class.\" He turned abruptly and walked back the way we'd come.",

            "en": "5         6. FRIENDS THE MOTORCYCLES DIDN'T NEED TO BE HIDDEN ANY further than simply placing them in Jacob's shed. Billy's wheelchair couldn't maneuver the uneven ground separating it from the house. Jacob started pulling the first bike\u2014the red one, which was destined for me\u2014to pieces immediately. He opened up the passenger door of the Rabbit so I could sit on the seat instead of the ground. While he worked, Jacob chattered happily, needing only the lightest of nudges from me to keep the conversation rolling. He updated me on the progress of his sophomore year of school, running on about his classes and his two best friends. \"Quil and Embry?\u201dI interrupted. \"Those are unusual names.\" Jacob chuckled. \"Quil's is a hand-me-down, and I think Embry got named after a soap opera star. I can't say anything, though. They fight dirty if you start on their names\u2014they'll tag team you.\" \"Good friends.\u201dI raised one eyebrow. \"No, they are. Just don't mess with their names.\" Just then a call echoed in the distance. \"Jacob?\u201dsomeone shouted. \"Is that Billy?\u201dI asked. \"No.\u201dJacob ducked his head, and it looked like he was blushing under his brown skin. \"Speak of the devil,\u201dhe mumbled, \"and the devil shall appear.\" \"Jake? Are you out here?\u201dThe shouting voice was closer now. \"Yeah!\u201dJacob shouted back, and sighed. We waited through the short silence until two tall, dark-skinned boys strolled around the corner into the shed. One was slender, and almost as tall as Jacob. His black hair was chin-length and parted down the middle, one side tucked behind his left ear while the right side swung free. The shorter boy was more burly. His white T-shirt strained over his well-developed chest, and he seemed gleefully conscious of that fact. His hair was so short it was almost a buzz. Both boys stopped short when they saw me. The thin boy glanced swiftly back and forth between Jacob and me, while the brawny boy kept his eyes on me, a slow smile spreading across his face. \"Hey, guys,\u201dJacob greeted them halfheartedly. \"Hey, Jake,\u201dthe short one said without looking away from me. I had to smile in response, his grin was so impish. When I did, he winked at me. \"Hi, there.\" \"Quil, Embry\u2014this is my friend, Bella.\" Quil and Embry, I still didn't know which was which, exchanged a loaded look. \"Charlie's kid, right?\u201dthe brawny boy asked me, holding out his hand. \"That's right,\u201dI confirmed, shaking hands with him. His grasp was firm; it looked like he was flexing his bicep. \"I'm Quil Ateara,\u201dhe announced grandly before releasing my hand. \"Nice to meet you, Quil.\" \"Hey, Bella. I'm Embry, Embry Call\u2014you probably already figured that out, though.\u201dEmbry smiled a shy smile and waved with one hand, which he then shoved in the pocket of his jeans. I nodded. \"Nice to meet you, too.\" \"So what are you guys doing?\u201dQuil asked, still looking at me. \"Bella and I are going to fix up these bikes,\u201dJacob explained inaccurately. But bikes seemed to be the magic word. Both boys went to examine Jacob's project, drilling him with educated questions. Many of the words they used were unfamiliar to me, and I figured I'd have to have a Y chromosome to really understand the excitement. They were still immersed in talk of parts and pieces when I decided that I needed to head back home before Charlie showed up here. With a sigh, I slid out of the Rabbit. Jacob looked up, apologetic. \"We're boring you, aren't we?\" \"Naw.\u201dAnd it wasn't a lie. I was enjoying myself\u2014how strange. \"I just have to go cook dinner for Charlie.\" \"Oh\u2026 well, I'll finish taking these apart tonight and figure out what more we'll need to get started rebuilding them. When do you want to work on them again?\" \"Could I come back tomorrow?\u201d\u00a0 Sundays were the bane of my existence. There was never enough homework to keep me busy. Quil nudged Embry's arm and they exchanged grins. Jacob smiled in delight. \"That would be great!\" \"If you make a list, we can go shop for parts,\u201dI suggested. Jacob's face fell a little. \"I'm still not sure I should let you pay for everything.\" I shook my head. \"No way. I'm bankrolling this party. You just have to supply the labor and expertise.\" Embry rolled his eyes at Quil. \"That doesn't seem right,\u201dJacob shook his head. \"Jake, if I took these to a mechanic, how much would he charge me?\u201dI pointed out. He smiled. \"Okay, you're getting a deal.\" \"Not to mention the riding lessons,\u201dI added. Quil grinned widely at Embry and whispered something I didn't catch. Jacob's hand flashed out to smack the back of Quil's head. \"That's it, get out,\u201dhe muttered. \"No, really, I have to go,\u201dI protested, heading for the door. \"I'll see you tomorrow, Jacob.\" As soon as I was out of sight, I heard Quil and Embry chorus, \"Wooooo!\" The sound of a brief scuffle followed, interspersed with an \"ouch\u201dand a \"hey!\" \"If either of you set so much as one toe on my land tomorrow\u2026\u201dI heard Jacob threaten. His voice was lost as I walked through the trees. I giggled quietly. The sound made my eyes widen in wonder. I was laughing, actually laughing, and there wasn't even anyone watching. I felt so weightless that I laughed again, just make the feeling last longer. I beat Charlie home. When he walked in I was just taking the fried chicken out of the pan and laying it on a pile of paper towels. \"Hey, Dad.\u201dI flashed him a grin. Shock flitted across his face before he pulled his expression together. \"Hey, honey,\u201dhe said, his voice uncertain. \"Did you have fun with Jacob?\" I started moving the food to the table. \"Yeah, I did.\" \"Well, that's good.\u201dHe was still cautious. \"What did you two do?\" Now it was my turn to be cautious. \"I hung out in his garage and watched him work. Did you know he's rebuilding a Volkswagen?\" \"Yeah, I think Billy mentioned that.\" The interrogation had to stop when Charlie began chewing, but he continued to study my face as he ate.  After dinner, I dithered around, cleaning the kitchen twice, and then did my homework slowly in the front room while Charlie watched a hockey game. I waited as long as I could, but finally Charlie mentioned the late hour. When I didn't respond, he got up, stretched, and then left, turning out the light behind him. Reluctantly, I followed. As I climbed the stairs, I felt the last of the afternoon's abnormal sense of well-being drain from my system, replaced by a dull fear at the thought of what I was going to have to live through now. I wasn't numb anymore. Tonight would, no doubt, be as horrific as last night. I lay down on my bed and curled into a ball in preparation for the onslaught. I squeezed my eyes shut and\u2026 the next thing I knew, it was morning. I stared at the pale silver light coming through my window, stunned. For the first time in more than four months, I'd slept without dreaming. Dreaming or screaming. I couldn't tell which emotion was stronger\u2014the relief or the shock. I lay still in my bed for a few minutes, waiting for it to come back. Because something must be coming. If not the pain, then the numbness. I waited, but nothing happened. I felt more rested than I had in a long time. I didn't trust this to last. It was a slippery, precarious edge that I balanced on, and it wouldn't take much to knock me back down. Just glancing around my room with these suddenly clear eyes\u2014noticing how strange it looked, too tidy, like I didn't live here at all\u2014was dangerous. I pushed that thought from my mind, and concentrated, as I got dressed, on the fact that I was going to see Jacob again today. The thought made me feel almost\u2026 hopeful. Maybe it would be the same as yesterday. Maybe I wouldn't have to remind myself to look interested and to nod or smile at appropriate intervals, the way I had to with everyone else. Maybe\u2026 but I wouldn't trust this to last, either. Wouldn't trust it to be the same\u2014so easy\u2014as yesterday. I wasn't going to set myself up for disappointment like that. At breakfast, Charlie was being careful, too. He tried to hide his scrutiny, keeping his eyes on his eggs until he thought I wasn't looking. \"What are you up to today?\u201dhe asked, eyeing a loose thread on the edge of his cuff like he wasn't paying much attention to my answer. \"I'm going to hang out with Jacob again.\" He nodded without looking up. \"Oh,\u201dhe said. \"Do you mind?\u201dI pretended to worry. \"I could stay\u2026\" He glanced up quickly, a hint of panic in his eyes. \"No, no! You go ahead. Harry was going to come up to watch the game with me anyway.\" \"Maybe Harry could give Billy a ride up,\u201dI suggested. The fewer witnesses the better. \"That's a great idea.\" I wasn't sure if the game was just an excuse for kicking me out, but he looked excited enough now. He headed to the phone while I donned my rain jacket. I felt self-conscious with the checkbook shoved in my jacket pocket. It was something I never used. Outside, the rain came down like water slopped from a bucket. I had to drive more slowly than I wanted to; I could hardly see a car length in front of the truck. But I finally made it through the muddy lanes to Jacob's house. Before I'd killed the engine, the front door opened and Jacob came running out with a huge black umbrella. He held it over my door while I opened it. \"Charlie called\u2014said you were on your way,\u201dJacob explained with a grin. Effortlessly, without a conscious command to the muscles around my lips, my answering smile spread across my face. A strange feeling of warmth bubbled up in my throat, despite the icy rain splattering on my cheeks. \"Hi, Jacob.\" \"Good call on inviting Billy up.\u201dHe held up his hand for a high five. \u00a0I had to reach so high to slap his hand that he laughed. Harry showed up to get Billy just a few minutes later. Jacob took me on a brief tour of his tiny room while we waited to be unsupervised. \"So where to, Mr. Goodwrench?\u201dI asked as soon as the door closed behind Billy. Jacob pulled a folded paper out of his pocket and smoothed it out. \"We'll start at the dump first, see if we can get lucky. This could get a little expensive,\u201dhe warned me. \"Those bikes are going to need a lot of help before they'll run again.\u201dMy face didn't look worried enough, so he continued. \"I'm talking about maybe more than a hundred dollars here.\" I pulled my checkbook out, fanned myself with it, and rolled my eyes at his worries. \"We're covered.\" It was a very strange kind of day. I enjoyed myself. Even at the dump, in the slopping rain and ankle-deep mud. I wondered at first if it was just the aftershock of losing the numbness, but I didn't think that was enough of an explanation. I was beginning to think it was mostly Jacob. It wasn't just that he was always so happy to see me, or that he didn't watch me out of the corner of his eye, waiting for me to do something that would mark me as crazy or depressed. It was nothing that related to me at all. It was Jacob himself. Jacob was simply a perpetually happy person, and he carried that happiness with him like an aura, sharing it with whoever was near him. Like an earthbound sun, whenever someone was within his gravitational pull, Jacob warmed them. It was natural, a part of who he was. No wonder I was so eager to see him. Even when he commented on the gaping hole in my dashboard, it didn't send me into a panic like it should have. \"Did the stereo break?\u201dhe wondered. \"Yeah,\u201dI lied. He poked around in the cavity. \"Who took it out? There's a lot of damage\u2026\" \"I did,\u201dI admitted. He laughed. \"Maybe you shouldn't touch the motorcycles too much.\" \"No problem.\" According to Jacob, we did get lucky at the dump. He was very excited about several grease-blackened pieces of twisted metal that he found; I was just impressed that he could tell what they were supposed to be. From there we went to the Checker Auto Parts down in Hoquiam. In my truck, it was more than a two hour drive south on the winding freeway, but the time passed easily with Jacob. He chattered about his friends and his school, and I found myself asking questions, not even pretending, truly curious to hear what he had to say. \"I'm doing all the talking,\u201dhe complained after a long story about Quil and the trouble he'd stirred up by asking out a senior's steady girlfriend. \"Why don't you take a turn? What's going on in Forks? It has to be more exciting than La Push.\" \"Wrong,\u201dI sighed. \"There's really nothing. Your friends are a lot more interesting than mine. I like your friends. Quil's funny.\" He frowned. \"I think Quil likes you, too.\" I laughed. \"He's a little young for me.\" Jacob's frown deepened. \"He's not that much younger than you. It's just a year and a few months.\" I had a feeling we weren't talking about Quil anymore. I kept my voice light, teasing. \"Sure, but, considering the difference in maturity between guys and girls, don't you have to count that in dog years? What does that make me, about twelve years older?\" He laughed, rolling his eyes. \"Okay, but if you're going to get picky like that, you have to average in size, too. You're so small, I'll have to knock ten years off your total.\" \"Five foot four is perfectly average.\u201dI sniffed. \"It's not my fault you're a freak.\" We bantered like that till Hoquiam, still arguing over the correct formula to determine age\u2014I lost two more years because I didn't know how to change a tire, but gained one back for being in charge of the bookkeeping at my house\u2014until we were in Checker, and Jacob had to concentrate again. We found everything left on his list, and Jacob felt confident that he could make a lot of progress with our haul. By the time we got back to La Push, I was twenty-three and he was thirty\u2014he was definitely weighting skills in his favor. I hadn't forgotten the reason for what I was doing. And, even though I was enjoying myself more than I'd thought possible, there was no lessening of my original desire. I still wanted to cheat. It was senseless, and I really didn't care. I was going to be as reckless as I could possibly manage in Forks. I would not be the only keeper of an empty contract. Getting to spend time with Jacob was just a much bigger perk than I'd expected. Billy wasn't back yet, so we didn't have to be sneaky about unloading our day's spoils. As soon as we had everything laid out on the plastic floor next to Jacob's toolbox, he went right to work, still talking and laughing while his fingers combed expertly through the metal pieces in front of him. Jacob's skill with his hands was fascinating. They looked too big for the delicate tasks they performed with ease and precision. While he worked, he seemed almost graceful. Unlike when he was on his feet; there, his height and big feet made him nearly as dangerous as I was. Quil and Embry did not show up, so maybe his threat yesterday had been taken seriously. The day passed too quickly. It got dark outside the mouth of the garage before I was expecting it, and then we heard Billy calling for us. I jumped up to help Jacob put things away, hesitating because I wasn't sure what I should touch. \"Just leave it,\u201dhe said. \"I'll work on it later tonight.\" \"Don't forget your schoolwork or anything,\u201dI said, feeling a little guilty. I didn't want him to get in trouble. That plan was just for me. \"Bella?\" Both our heads snapped up as Charlie's familiar voice wafted through the trees, sounding closer than the house. \"Shoot,\u201dI muttered. \"Coming!\u201dI yelled toward the house. \"Let's go.\u201dJacob smiled, enjoying the cloak-and-dagger. He snapped the light off, and for a moment I was blind. Jacob grabbed my hand and towed me out of the garage and through the trees, his feet finding the familiar path easily. His hand was rough, and very warm. Despite the path, we were both tripping over our feet in the darkness. So we were also both laughing when the house came into view. The laughter did not go deep; it was light and superficial, but still nice. I was sure he wouldn't notice the faint hint of hysteria. I wasn't used to laughing, and it felt right and also very wrong at the same time. Charlie was standing under the little back porch, and Billy was sitting in the doorway behind them. \"Hey, Dad,\u201dwe both said at the same time, and that started us laughing again. Charlie stared at me with wide eyes that flashed down to note Jacob's hand around mine. \"Billy invited us for dinner,\u201dCharlie said to us in an absentminded tone. \"My super secret recipe for spaghetti. Handed down for generations,\u201dBilly said gravely. Jacob snorted. \"I don't think Ragu's actually been around that long.\" The house was crowded. Harry Clearwater was there, too, with his family\u2014his wife, Sue, whom I knew vaguely from my childhood summers in Forks, and his two children. Leah was a senior like me, but a year older. She was beautiful in an exotic way\u2014perfect copper skin, glistening black hair, eyelashes like feather dusters\u2014and preoccupied. She was on Billy's phone when we got in, and she never let it go. Seth was fourteen; he hung on Jacob's every word with idolizing eyes. There were too many of us for the kitchen table, so Charlie and Harry brought chairs out to the yard, and we ate spaghetti off plates on our laps in the dim light from Billy's open door. The men talked about the game, and Harry and Charlie made fishing plans. Sue teased her husband about his cholesterol and tried, unsuccessfully, to shame him into eating something green and leafy. Jacob talked mostly to me and Seth, who interrupted eagerly whenever Jacob seemed in danger of forgetting him. Charlie watched me, trying to be inconspicuous about it, with pleased but cautious eyes.  It was loud and sometimes confusing as everyone talked over everyone else, and the laughter from one joke interrupted the telling of another. I didn't have to speak often, but I smiled a lot, and only because I felt like it. I didn't want to leave. This was Washington, though, and the inevitable rain eventually broke up the party; Billy's living room was much too small to provide an option for continuing the get-together. Harry had driven Charlie down, so we rode together in my truck on the way back home. He asked about my day, and I told mostly the truth\u2014that I'd gone with Jacob to look at parts and then watched him work in his garage. \"You think you'll visit again anytime soon?\u201dhe wondered, trying to be casual about it. \"Tomorrow after school,\u201dI admitted. \"I'll take homework, don't worry.\" \"You be sure to do that,\u201dhe ordered, trying to disguise his satisfaction. I was nervous when we got to the house. I didn't want to go upstairs. The warmth of Jacob's presence was fading and, in its absence, the anxiety grew stronger. I was sure I wouldn't get away with two peaceful nights of sleep in a row. To put bedtime off, I checked my e-mail; there was a new message from Renee. She wrote about her day, a new book club that rilled the time slot of the meditation classes she'd just quit, her week subbing in the second grade, missing her kindergarteners. She wrote that Phil was enjoying his new coaching job, and that they were planning a second honeymoon trip to Disney World. And I noticed that the whole thing read like a journal entry, rather than a letter to someone else. Remorse flooded through me, leaving an uncomfortable sting behind. Some daughter I was. I wrote back to her quickly, commenting on each part of her letter, volunteering information of my own\u2014describing the spaghetti party at Billy's and how I felt watching Jacob build useful things out of small pieces of metal\u2014<em>awed</em> and slightly envious. I made no reference to the change this letter would be from the ones she'd received in the last several months. I could barely remember what I'd written to her even as recently as last week, but I was sure it wasn't very responsive. The more I thought about it, the guiltier I felt; I really must have worried her. I stayed up extra late after that, finishing more homework than strictly necessary. But neither sleep deprivation nor the time spent with Jacob\u2014being almost happy in a shallow kind of way\u2014could keep the dream away for two nights in a row. I woke shuddering, my scream muffled by the pillow. As the dim morning light filtered through the fog outside my window, I lay still in bed and tried to shake off the dream. There had been a small difference last night, and I concentrated on that. Last night I had not been alone in the woods. Sam Uley\u2014the man who had pulled me from the forest floor that night I couldn't bear to think of consciously\u2014was there. It was an odd, unexpected alteration. The man's dark eyes had been surprisingly unfriendly, filled with some secret he didn't seem inclined to share. I'd stared at him as often as my frantic searching had allowed; it made me uncomfortable, under all the usual panic, to have him there. Maybe that was because, when I didn't look directly at him, his shape seemed to shiver and change in my peripheral vision. Yet he did nothing but stand and watch. Unlike the time when we had met in reality, he did not offer me his help. Charlie stared at me during breakfast, and I tried to ignore him. I supposed I deserved it. I couldn't expect him not to worry. It would probably be weeks before he stopped watching for the return of the zombie, and I would just have to try to not let it bother me. After all, I would be watching for the return of the zombie, too. Two days was hardly long enough to call me cured. School was the opposite. Now that I was paying attention, it was clear that no one was watching here. I remembered the first day I'd come to Forks High School\u2014how desperately I'd wished that I could turn gray, fade into the wet concrete of the sidewalk like an oversized chameleon. It seemed I was getting that wish answered, a year late. It was like I wasn't there. Even my teachers' eyes slid past my seat as if it were empty. I listened all through the morning, hearing once again the voices of the people around me. I tried to catch up on what was going on, but the conversations were so disjointed that I gave up. Jessica didn't look up when I sat down next to her in Calculus. \"Hey, Jess,\u201dI said with put-on nonchalance. \"How was the rest of your weekend?\" She looked at me with suspicious eyes. Could she still be angry? Or was she just too impatient to deal with a crazy person? \"Super,\u201dshe said, turning back to her book. \"That's good,\u201dI mumbled. The figure of speech cold shoulder seemed to have some literal truth to it. I could feel the warm air blowing from the floor vents, but I was still too cold. I took the jacket off the back of my chair and put it on again. My fourth hour class got out late, and the lunch table I always sat at was full by the time I arrived. Mike was there, Jessica and Angela, Conner, Tyler, Eric and Lauren. Katie Marshall, the redheaded junior who lived around the corner from me, was sitting with Eric, and Austin Marks\u2014older brother to the boy with the motorcycles\u2014was next to her. I wondered how long they'd been sitting here, unable to remember if this was the first day or something that was a regular habit. I was beginning to get annoyed with myself. I might as well have been packed in Styrofoam peanuts through the last semester. No one looked up when I sat down next to Mike, even though the chair squealed stridently against the linoleum as I dragged it back. I tried to catch up with the conversation. Mike and Conner were talking sports, so I gave up on that one at once. \"Where's Ben today?\u201dLauren was asking Angela. I perked up, interested. I wondered if that meant Angela and Ben were still together. I barely recognized Lauren. She'd cut off all her blond, corn-silk hair\u2014now she had a pixie cut so short that the back was shaved like a boy. What an odd thing for her to do. I wished I knew the reason behind it. Did she get gum stuck in it? Did she sell it? Had all the people she was habitually nasty to caught her behind the gym and scalped her? I decided it wasn't fair for me to judge her now by my former opinion. For all I knew, she'd turned into a nice person. \"Ben's got the stomach flu,\u201dAngela said in her quiet, calm voice. \"Hopefully it's just some twenty-four hour thing. He was really sick last night.\" Angela had changed her hair, too. She'd grown out her layers. \"What did you two do this weekend?\u201dJessica asked, not sounding as if she cared about the answer. I'd bet that this was just an opener so she could tell her own stories. I wondered if she would talk about Port Angeles with me sitting two seats away? Was I that invisible, that no one would feel uncomfortable discussing me while I was here? \"We were going to have a picnic Saturday, actually, but\u2026 we changed our minds,\u201dAngela said. There was an edge to her voice that caught my interest. Jess, not so much. \"That's too bad,\u201dshe said, about to launch into her story. But I wasn't the only one who was paying attention. \"What happened?\u201dLauren asked curiously. \"Well,\u201dAngela said, seeming more hesitant than usual, though she was always reserved, \"we drove up north, almost to the hot springs\u2014there's a good spot just about a mile up the trail. But, when we were halfway there\u2026 we saw something.\" \"Saw something? What?\u201dLauren's pale eyebrows pulled together. Even Jess seemed to be listening now. \"I don't know,\u201dAngela said. \"We think it was a bear. It was black, anyway, but it seemed\u2026 too big.\" Lauren snorted. \"Oh, not you, too!\u201dHer eyes turned mocking, and I decided I didn't need to give her the benefit of the doubt. Obviously her personality had not changed as much as her hair. \"Tyler tried to sell me that one last week.\" \"You're not going to see any bears that close to the resort,\u201dJessica said, siding with Lauren.  \"Really,\u201dAngela protested in a low voice, looking down at the table. \"We did see it.\" Lauren snickered. Mike was still talking to Conner, not paying attention to the girls. \"No, she's right,\u201dI threw in impatiently. \"We had a hiker in just Saturday who saw the bear, too, Angela.\u00a0 He said it was huge and black and just outside of town, didn't he, Mike?\" There was a moment of silence. Every pair of eyes at the table turned to stare at me in shock. The new girl, Katie, had her mouth hanging open like she'd just witnessed an explosion. Nobody moved. \"Mike?\u201dI muttered, mortified. \"Remember the guy with the bear story?\" \"S-sure,\u201dMike stuttered after a second. I didn't know why he was looking at me so strangely. I talked to him at work, didn't I? Did I? I thought so\u2026 Mike recovered. \"Yeah, there was a guy who said he saw a huge black bear right at the trailhead\u2014bigger than a grizzly,\u201dhe confirmed. \"Hmph.\u201dLauren turned to Jessica, her shoulders stiff, and changed the subject. \"Did you hear back from USC?\u201dshe asked. Everyone else looked away, too, except for Mike and Angela. Angela smiled at me tentatively, and I hurried to return the smile. \"So, what did you do this weekend, Bella?\u201dMike asked, curious, but oddly wary. Everyone but Lauren looked back, waiting for my response. \"Friday night, Jessica and I went to a movie in Port Angeles. And then I spent Saturday afternoon and most of Sunday down at La Push.\" The eyes flickered to Jessica and back to me. Jess looked irritated. I wondered if she didn't want anyone to know she'd gone out with me, or whether she just wanted to be the one to tell the story. \"What movie did you see?\u201dMike asked, starting to smile. \"Dead End\u2014the one with the zombies.\u201dI grinned in encouragement. Maybe some of the damage I'd done in these past zombie months was reparable. \"I heard that was scary. Did you think so?\u201dMike was eager to continue the conversation. \"Bella had to leave at the end, she was so freaked,\u201dJessica inserted with a sly smile. I nodded, trying to look embarrassed. \"It was pretty scary.\" Mike didn't stop asking me questions till lunch was over. Gradually, the others were able to start up their own conversations again, though they still looked at me a lot. Angela talked mostly to Mike and me, and, when I got up to dump my tray, she followed. \"Thanks,\u201dshe said in a low voice when we were away from the table. \"For what?\" \"Speaking up, sticking up for me.\" \"No problem.\" She looked at me with concern, but not the offensive, maybe-she's-lost-it kind. \"Are you okay?\" This is why I'd picked Jessica over Angela\u2014though I'd always liked Angela more\u2014for the girls' night movie. Angela was too perceptive. \"Not completely,\u201dI admitted. \"But I'm a little bit better.\" \"I'm glad,\u201dshe said. \"I've missed you.\" Lauren and Jessica strolled by us then, and I heard Lauren whisper loudly, \"Oh, joy Bella's back.\" Angela rolled her eyes at them, and smiled at me in encouragement. I sighed It was like I was starting all over again. \"What's today's date?\u201dI wondered suddenly. \"It's January nineteenth.\" \"Hmm.\" \"What is it?\u201dAngela asked. \"It was a year ago yesterday that I had my first day here,\u201dI mused. \"Nothing's changed much,\u201dAngela muttered, looking after Lauren and Jessica. \"I know,\u201d I agreed.\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI was just thinking the same thing.\"",

            "en": "5          5. BLOOD TYPE I made my way to English in a daze. I didn't even realize when I first walked in that class had already started. \"Thank you for joining us, Miss Swan,\" Mr. Mason said in a disparaging tone. I flushed and hurried to my seat. It wasn't till class ended that I realized Mike wasn't sitting in his usual seat next to me. I felt a twinge of guilt. But he and Eric both met me at the door as usual, so I figured I wasn't totally unforgiven. Mike seemed to become more himself as we walked, gaining enthusiasm as he talked about the weather report for this weekend. The rain was supposed to take a minor break, and so maybe his beach trip would be possible. I tried to sound eager, to make up for disappointing him yesterday. It was hard; rain or no rain, it would still only be in the high forties, if we were lucky. The rest of the morning passed in a blur. It was difficult to believe that I hadn't just imagined what Edward had said, and the way his eyes had looked. Maybe it was just a very convincing dream that I'd confused with reality. That seemed more probable than that I really appealed to him on any level. So I was impatient and frightened as Jessica and I entered the cafeteria. I wanted to see his face, to see if he'd gone back to the cold, indifferent person I'd known for the last several weeks. Or if, by some miracle, I'd really heard what I thought I'd heard this morning. Jessica babbled on and on about her dance plans \u2014 Lauren and Angela had asked the other boys and they were all going together \u2014 completely unaware of my inattention. Disappointment flooded through me as my eyes unerringly focused on his table. The other four were there, but he was absent. Had he gone home? I followed the still-babbling Jessica through the line, crushed. I'd lost my appetite \u2014 I bought nothing but a bottle of lemonade. I just wanted to go sit down and sulk. \"Edward Cullen is staring at you again,\" Jessica said, finally breaking through my abstraction with his name. \"I wonder why he's sitting alone today.\" My head snapped up. I followed her gaze to see Edward, smiling crookedly, staring at me from an empty table across the cafeteria from where he usually sat. Once he'd caught my eye, he raised one hand and motioned with his index finger for me to join him. As I stared in disbelief, he winked. \"Does he mean you?\" Jessica asked with insulting astonishment in her voice. \"Maybe he needs help with his Biology homework,\" I muttered for her benefit. \"Um, I'd better go see what he wants.\" I could feel her staring after me as I walked away. When I reached his table, I stood behind the chair across from him, unsure. \"Why don't you sit with me today?\" he asked, smiling. I sat down automatically, watching him with caution. He was still smiling. It was hard to believe that someone so beautiful could be real. I was afraid that he might disappear in a sudden puff of smoke, and I would wake up. He seemed to be waiting for me to say something. \"This is different,\" I finally managed. \"Well\u2026\" He paused, and then the rest of the words followed in a rush. \"I decided as long as I was going to hell, I might as well do it thoroughly.\" I waited for him to say something that made sense. The seconds ticked by. \"You know I don't have any idea what you mean,\" I eventually pointed out. \"I know.\" He smiled again, and then he changed the subject. \"I think your friends are angry with me for stealing you.\" \"They'll survive.\" I could feel their stares boring into my back. \"I may not give you back, though,\" he said with a wicked glint in his eyes. I gulped. He laughed. \"You look worried.\" \"No,\" I said, but, ridiculously, my voice broke. \"Surprised, actually\u2026 what brought all this on?\" \"I told you \u2014 I got tired of trying to stay away from you. So I'm giving up.\" He was still smiling, but his ocher eyes were serious. \"Giving up?\" I repeated in confusion. \"Yes \u2014 giving up trying to be good. I'm just going to do what I want now, and let the chips fall where they may.\" His smile faded as he explained, and a hard edge crept into his voice. \"You lost me again.\" The breathtaking crooked smile reappeared. \"I always say too much when I'm talking to you \u2014 that's one of the problems.\" \"Don't worry \u2014 I don't understand any of it,\" I said wryly. \"I'm counting on that.\" \"So, in plain English, are we friends now?\" \"Friends\u2026\" he mused, dubious. \"Or not,\" I muttered. He grinned. \"Well, we can try, I suppose. But I'm warning you now that I'm not a good friend for you.\" Behind his smile, the warning was real.  \"You say that a lot,\" I noted, trying to ignore the sudden trembling in my stomach and keep my voice even. \"Yes, because you're not listening to me. I'm still waiting for you to believe it. If you're smart, you'll avoid me.\" \"I think you've made your opinion on the subject of my intellect clear, too.\" My eyes narrowed. He smiled apologetically. \"So, as long as I'm being\u2026 not smart, we'll try to be friends?\" I struggled to sum up the confusing exchange. \"That sounds about right.\" I looked down at my hands wrapped around the lemonade bottle, not sure what to do now. \"What are you thinking?\" he asked curiously. I looked up into his deep gold eyes, became befuddled, and, as usual, blurted out the truth. \"I'm trying to figure out what you are.\" His jaw tightened, but he kept his smile in place with some effort. \"Are you having any luck with that?\" he asked in an offhand tone. \"Not too much,\" I admitted. He chuckled. \"What are your theories?\" I blushed. I had been vacillating during the last month between Bruce Wayne and Peter Parker. There was no way I was going to own up to that. \"Won't you tell me?\" he asked, tilting his head to one side with a shockingly tempting smile. I shook my head. \"Too embarrassing.\" \"That's really frustrating, you know,\" he complained. \"No,\" I disagreed quickly, my eyes narrowing, \"I can't imagine why that would be frustrating at all \u2014 just because someone refuses to tell you what they're thinking, even if all the while they're making cryptic little remarks specifically designed to keep you up at night wondering what they could possibly mean\u2026 now, why would that be frustrating?\" He grimaced. \"Or better,\" I continued, the pent-up annoyance flowing freely now, \"say that person also did a wide range of bizarre things \u2014 from saving your life under impossible circumstances one day to treating you like a pariah the next, and he never explained any of that, either, even after he promised. That, also, would be very non-frustrating.\" \"You've got a bit of a temper, don't you?\" \"I don't like double standards.\" We stared at each other, unsmiling. He glanced over my shoulder, and then, unexpectedly, he snickered. \"What?\" \"Your boyfriend seems to think I'm being unpleasant to you \u2014 he's debating whether or not to come break up our fight.\" He snickered again. \"I don't know who you're talking about,\" I said frostily. \"But I'm sure you're wrong, anyway.\" \"I'm not. I told you, most people are easy to read.\" \"Except me, of course.\" \"Yes. Except for you.\" His mood shifted suddenly; his eyes turned brooding. \"I wonder why that is.\" I had to look away from the intensity of his stare. I concentrated on unscrewing the lid of my lemonade. I took a swig, staring at the table without seeing it. \"Aren't you hungry?\" he asked, distracted. \"No.\" I didn't feel like mentioning that my stomach was already full \u2014 of butterflies. \"You?\" I looked at the empty table in front of him. \"No, I'm not hungry.\" I didn't understand his expression \u2014 it looked like he was enjoying some private joke. \"Can you do me a favor?\" I asked after a second of hesitation. He was suddenly wary. \"That depends on what you want.\" \"It's not much,\" I assured him. He waited, guarded but curious. \"I just wondered\u2026 if you could warn me beforehand the next time you decide to ignore me for my own good. Just so I'm prepared.\" I looked at the lemonade bottle as I spoke, tracing the circle of the opening with my pinkie finger. \"That sounds fair.\" He was pressing his lips together to keep from laughing when I looked up. \"Thanks.\" \"Then can I have one answer in return?\" he demanded. \"One.\" \"Tell me one theory.\" Whoops. \"Not that one.\" \"You didn't qualify, you just promised one answer,\" he reminded me. \"And you've broken promises yourself,\" I reminded him back. \"Just one theory \u2014 I won't laugh.\" \"Yes, you will.\" I was positive about that. He looked down, and then glanced up at me through his long black lashes, his ocher eyes scorching. \"Please?\" he breathed, leaning toward me. I blinked, my mind going blank. Holy crow, how did he do that? \"Er, what?\" I asked, dazed. \"Please tell me just one little theory.\" His eyes still smoldered at me. \"Um, well, bitten by a radioactive spider?\" Was he a hypnotist, too? Or was I just a hopeless pushover? \"That's not very creative,\" he scoffed. \"I'm sorry, that's all I've got,\" I said, miffed. \"You're not even close,\" he teased. \"No spiders?\" \"Nope.\" \"And no radioactivity?\" \"None.\" \"Dang,\" I sighed. \"Kryptonite doesn't bother me, either,\" he chuckled. \"You're not supposed to laugh, remember?\" He struggled to compose his face. \"I'll figure it out eventually,\" I warned him. \"I wish you wouldn't try.\" He was serious again. \"Because\u2026 ?\" \"What if I'm not a superhero? What if I'm the bad guy?\" He smiled playfully, but his eyes were impenetrable. \"Oh,\" I said, as several things he'd hinted fell suddenly into place. \"I see.\" \"Do you?\" His face was abruptly severe, as if he were afraid that he'd accidentally said too much. \"You're dangerous?\" I guessed, my pulse quickening as I intuitively realized the truth of my own words. He was dangerous. He'd been trying to tell me that all along. He just looked at me, eyes full of some emotion I couldn't comprehend. \"But not bad,\" I whispered, shaking my head. \"No, I don't believe that you're bad.\" \"You're wrong.\" His voice was almost inaudible. He looked down, stealing my bottle lid and then spinning it on its side between his fingers. I stared at him, wondering why I didn't feel afraid. He meant what he was saying \u2014 that was obvious. But I just felt anxious, on edge\u2026 and, more than anything else, fascinated. The same way I always felt when I was near him. The silence lasted until I noticed that the cafeteria was almost empty. I jumped to my feet. \"We're going to be late.\" \"I'm not going to class today,\" he said, twirling the lid so fast it was just a blur. \"Why not?\" \"It's healthy to ditch class now and then.\" He smiled up at me, but his eyes were still troubled. \"Well, I'm going,\" I told him. I was far too big a coward to risk getting caught. He turned his attention back to his makeshift top. \"I'll see you later, then.\" I hesitated, torn, but then the first bell sent me hurrying out the door \u2014 with a last glance confirming that he hadn't moved a centimeter. As I half-ran to class, my head was spinning faster than the bottle cap. So few questions had been answered in comparison to how many new questions had been raised. At least the rain had stopped. I was lucky; Mr. Banner wasn't in the room yet when I arrived. I settled quickly into my seat, aware that both Mike and Angela were staring at me. Mike looked resentful; Angela looked surprised, and slightly <em>awed</em>. Mr. Banner came in the room then, calling the class to order. He was juggling a few small cardboard boxes in his arms. He put them down on Mike's table, telling him to start passing them around the class. \"Okay, guys, I want you all to take one piece from each box,\" he said as he produced a pair of rubber gloves from the pocket of his lab jacket and pulled them on. The sharp sound as the gloves snapped into place against his wrists seemed ominous to me. \"The first should be an indicator card,\" he went on, grabbing a white card with four squares marked on it and displaying it. \"The second is a four-pronged applicator \u2014\" he held up something that looked like a nearly toothless hair pick \"\u2014 and the third is a sterile micro-lancet.\" He held up a small piece of blue plastic and split it open. The barb was invisible from this distance, but my stomach flipped. \"I'll be coming around with a dropper of water to prepare your cards, so please don't start until I get to you.\" He began at Mike's table again, carefully putting one drop of water in each of the four squares. \"Then I want you to carefully prick your finger with the lancet\u2026\" He grabbed Mike's hand and jabbed the spike into the tip of Mike's middle finger. Oh no. Clammy moisture broke out across my forehead. \"Put a small drop of blood on each of the prongs.\" He demonstrated, squeezing Mike's finger till the blood flowed. I swallowed convulsively, my stomach heaving. \"And then apply it to the card,\" he finished, holding up the dripping red card for us to see. I closed my eyes, trying to hear through the ringing\u00a0 in my ears. \"The Red Cross is having a blood drive in Port Angeles next weekend, so I thought you should all know your blood type.\" He sounded proud of himself. \"Those of you who aren't eighteen yet will need a parent's permission \u2014 I have slips at my desk.\" He continued through the room with his water drops. I put my cheek against the cool black tabletop and tried to hold on to my consciousness. All around me I could hear squeals, complaints, and giggles as my classmates skewered their fingers. I breathed slowly in and out through my mouth. \"Bella, are you all right?\" Mr. Banner asked. His voice was close to my head, and it sounded alarmed. \"I already know my blood type, Mr. Banner,\" I said in a weak voice. I was afraid to raise my head. \"Are you feeling faint?\" \"Yes, sir,\" I muttered, internally kicking myself for not ditching when I had the chance. \"Can someone take Bella to the nurse, please?\" he called. I didn't have to look up to know that it would be Mike who volunteered.  \"Can you walk?\" Mr. Banner asked. \"Yes,\" I whispered. Just let me get out of here, I thought. I'll crawl. Mike seemed eager as he put his arm around my waist and pulled my arm over his shoulder. I leaned against him heavily on the way out of the classroom. Mike towed me slowly across campus. When we were around the edge of the cafeteria, out of sight of building four in case Mr. Banner was watching, I stopped. \"Just let me sit for a minute, please?\" I begged. He helped me sit on the edge of the walk. \"And whatever you do, keep your hand in your pocket,\" I warned. I was still so dizzy. I slumped over on my side, putting my cheek against the freezing, damp cement of the sidewalk, closing my eyes. That seemed to help a little. \"Wow, you're green, Bella,\" Mike said nervously. \"Bella?\" a different voice called from the distance. No! Please let me be imagining that horribly familiar voice. \"What's wrong \u2014 is she hurt?\" His voice was closer now, and he sounded upset. I wasn't imagining it. I squeezed my eyes shut, hoping to die. Or, at the very least, not to throw up. Mike seemed stressed. \"I think she's fainted. I don't know what happened, she didn't even stick her finger.\" \"Bella.\" Edward's voice was right beside me, relieved now. \"Can you hear me?\" \"No,\" I groaned. \"Go away.\" He chuckled. \"I was taking her to the nurse,\" Mike explained in a defensive tone, \"but she wouldn't go any farther.\" \"I'll take her,\" Edward said. I could hear the smile still in his voice. \"You can go back to class.\" \"No,\" Mike protested. \"I'm supposed to do it.\" Suddenly the sidewalk disappeared from beneath me. My eyes flew open in shock. Edward had scooped me up in his arms, as easily as if I weighed ten pounds instead of a hundred and ten. \"Put me down!\" Please, please let me not vomit on him. He was walking before I was finished talking. \"Hey!\" Mike called, already ten paces behind us. Edward ignored him. \"You look awful,\" he told me, grinning. \"Put me back on the sidewalk,\" I moaned. The rocking movement of his walk was not helping. He held me away from his body, gingerly, supporting all my weight with just his arms \u2014 it didn't seem to bother him.  \"So you faint at the sight of blood?\" he asked. This seemed to entertain him. I didn't answer. I closed my eyes again and fought the nausea with all my strength, clamping my lips together. \"And not even your own blood,\" he continued, enjoying himself.  I don't know how he opened the door while carrying me, but it was suddenly warm, so I knew we were inside. \"Oh my,\" I heard a female voice gasp. \"She fainted in Biology,\" Edward explained. I opened my eyes. I was in the office, and Edward was striding past the front counter toward the nurse's door. Ms. Cope, the redheaded front office receptionist, ran ahead of him to hold it open. The grandmotherly nurse looked up from a novel, astonished, as Edward swung me into the room and placed me gently on the crackly paper that covered the brown vinyl mattress on the one cot. Then he moved to stand against the wall as far across the narrow room as possible. His eyes were bright, excited. \"She's just a little faint,\" he reassured the startled nurse. \"They're blood typing in Biology.\" The nurse nodded sagely. \"There's always one.\" He muffled a snicker. \"Just lie down for a minute, honey; it'll pass.\" \"I know,\" I sighed. The nausea was already fading. \"Does this happen a lot?\" she asked. \"Sometimes,\" I admitted. Edward coughed to hide another laugh. \"You can go back to class now,\" she told him. \"I'm supposed to stay with her.\" He said this with such assured authority that \u2014 even though she pursed her lips \u2014 the nurse didn't argue it further. \"I'll go get you some ice for your forehead, dear,\" she said to me, and then bustled out of the room. \"You were right,\" I moaned, letting my eyes close. \"I usually am \u2014 but about what in particular this time?\" \"Ditching is healthy.\" I practiced breathing evenly. \"You scared me for a minute there,\" he admitted after a pause. His tone made it sound like he was confessing a humiliating weakness. \"I thought Newton was dragging your dead body off to bury it in the woods.\" \"Ha ha.\" I still had my eyes closed, but I was feeling more normal every minute. \"Honestly \u2014 I've seen corpses with better color. I was concerned that I might have to avenge your murder.\" \"Poor Mike. I'll bet he's mad.\" \"He absolutely loathes me,\" Edward said cheerfully. \"You can't know that,\" I argued, but then I wondered suddenly if he could. \"I saw his face \u2014 I could tell.\" \"How did you see me? I thought you were ditching.\" I was almost fine now, though the queasiness would probably pass faster if I'd eaten something for lunch. On the other hand, maybe it was lucky my stomach was empty. \"I was in my car, listening to a CD.\" Such a normal response \u2014 it surprised me. I heard the door and opened my eyes to see the nurse with a cold compress in her hand. \"Here you go, dear.\" She laid it across my forehead. \"You're looking better,\" she added. \"I think I'm fine,\" I said, sitting up. Just a little ringing in my ears, no spinning. The mint green walls stayed where they should. I could see she was about to make me lie back down, but the door opened just then, and Ms. Cope stuck her head in. \"We've got another one,\" she warned. I hopped down to free up the cot for the next invalid. I handed the compress back to the nurse. \"Here, I don't need this.\" And then Mike staggered through the door, now supporting a sallow-looking Lee Stephens, another boy in our Biology class. Edward and I drew back against the wall to give them room. \"Oh no,\" Edward muttered. \"Go out to the office, Bella.\" I looked up at him, bewildered. \"Trust me \u2014 go.\" I spun and caught the door before it closed, darting out of the infirmary. I could feel Edward right behind me. \"You actually listened to me.\" He was stunned. \"I smelled the blood,\" I said, wrinkling my nose. Lee wasn't sick from watching other people, like me. \"People can't smell blood,\" he contradicted. \"Well, I can \u2014 that's what makes me sick. It smells like rust\u2026 and salt.\" He was staring at me with an unfathomable expression. \"What?\" I asked. \"It's nothing.\" Mike came through the door then, glancing from me to Edward. The look he gave Edward confirmed what Edward had said about loathing. He looked back at me, his eyes glum. \"You look better,\" he accused. \"Just keep your hand in your pocket,\" I warned him again. \"It's not bleeding anymore,\" he muttered. \"Are you going back to class?\" \"Are you kidding? I'd just have to turn around and come back.\" \"Yeah, I guess\u2026 So are you going this weekend? To the beach?\" While he spoke, he flashed another glare toward Edward, who was standing against the cluttered counter, motionless as a sculpture, staring off into space. I tried to sound as friendly as possible. \"Sure, I said I was in.\" \"We're meeting at my dad's store, at ten.\" His eyes flickered to Edward again, wondering if he was giving out too much information. His body language made it clear that it wasn't an open invitation. \"I'll be there,\" I promised. \"I'll see you in Gym, then,\" he said, moving uncertainly toward the door.  \"See you,\" I replied. He looked at me once more, his round face slightly pouting, and then as he walked slowly through the door, his shoulders slumped. A swell of sympathy washed over me. I pondered seeing his disappointed face again\u2026 in Gym.  \"Gym,\" I groaned. \"I can take care of that.\" I hadn't noticed Edward moving to my side, but he spoke now in my ear. \"Go sit down and look pale,\" he muttered. That wasn't a challenge; I was always pale, and my recent swoon had left a light sheen of sweat on my face. I sat in one of the creaky folding chairs and rested my head against the wall with my eyes closed. Fainting spells always exhausted me. I heard Edward speaking softly at the counter. \"Ms. Cope?\" \"Yes?\" I hadn't heard her return to her desk. \"Bella has Gym next hour, and I don't think she feels well enough. Actually, I was thinking I should take her home now. Do you think you could excuse her from class?\" His voice was like melting honey. I could imagine how much more overwhelming his eyes would be. \"Do you need to be excused, too, Edward?\" Ms. Cope fluttered. Why couldn't I do that? \"No, I have Mrs. Goff, she won't mind.\" \"Okay, it's all taken care of. You feel better, Bella,\" she called to me. I nodded weakly, hamming it up just a bit. \"Can you walk, or do you want me to carry you again?\" With his back to the receptionist, his expression became sarcastic. \"I'll walk.\" I stood carefully, and I was still fine. He held the door for me, his smile polite but his eyes mocking. I walked out into the cold, fine mist that had just begun to fall. It felt nice \u2014 the first time I'd enjoyed the constant moisture falling out of the sky \u2014 as it washed my face clean of the sticky perspiration. \"Thanks,\" I said as he followed me out. \"It's almost worth getting sick to miss Gym.\" \"Anytime.\" He was staring straight forward, squinting into the rain. \"So are you going? This Saturday, I mean?\" I was hoping he would, though it seemed unlikely. I couldn't picture him loading up to carpool with the rest of the kids from school; he didn't belong in the same world. But just hoping that he might gave me the first twinge of enthusiasm I'd felt for the outing. \"Where are you all going, exactly?\" He was still looking ahead, expressionless. \"Down to La Push, to First Beach.\" I studied his face, trying to read it. His eyes seemed to narrow infinitesimally. He glanced down at me from the corner of his eye, smiling wryly. \"I really don't think I was invited.\" I sighed. \"I just invited you.\" \"Let's you and I not push poor Mike any further this week. We don't want him to snap.\" His eyes danced; he was enjoying the idea more than he should. \"Mike-schmike.\" I muttered, preoccupied by the way he'd said \"you and I.\" I liked it more than I should.  We were near the parking lot now. I veered left, toward my truck. Something caught my jacket, yanking me back. \"Where do you think you're going?\" he asked, outraged. He was gripping a fistful of my jacket in one hand. I was confused. \"I'm going home.\" \"Didn't you hear me promise to take you safely home? Do you think I'm going to let you drive in your condition?\" His voice was still indignant. \"What condition? And what about my truck?\" I complained.  \"I'll have Alice drop it off after school.\" He was towing me toward his car now, pulling me by my jacket. It was all I could do to keep from falling backward. He'd probably just drag me along anyway if I did. \"Let go!\" I insisted. He ignored me. I staggered along sideways across the wet sidewalk until we reached the Volvo. Then he finally freed me \u2014 I stumbled against the passenger door. \"You are so pushy!\" I grumbled. \"It's open,\" was all he responded. He got in the driver's side. \"I am perfectly capable of driving myself home!\" I stood by the car, fuming. It was raining harder now, and I'd never put my hood up, so my hair was dripping down my back. He lowered the automatic window and leaned toward me across the seat. \"Get in, Bella.\" I didn't answer. I was mentally calculating my chances of reaching the truck before he could catch me. I had to admit, they weren't good. \"I'll just drag you back,\" he threatened, guessing my plan. I tried to maintain what dignity I could as I got into his car. I wasn't very successful \u2014 I looked like a half-drowned cat and my boots squeaked. \"This is completely unnecessary,\" I said stiffly. He didn't answer. He fiddled with the controls, turning the heater up and the music down. As he pulled out of the parking lot, I was preparing to give him the silent treatment \u2014 my face in full pout mode \u2014 but then I recognized the music playing, and my curiosity got the better of my intentions. \"Clair de Lune?\" I asked, surprised. \"You know Debussy?\" He sounded surprised, too. \"Not well,\" I admitted. \"My mother plays a lot of classical music around the house \u2014 I only know my favorites.\" \"It's one of my favorites, too.\" He stared out through the rain, lost in thought. I listened to the music, relaxing against the light gray leather seat. It was impossible not to respond to the familiar, soothing melody. The rain blurred everything outside the window into gray and green smudges. I began to realize we were driving very fast; the car moved so steadily, so evenly, though, I didn't feel the speed. Only the town flashing by gave it away. \"What is your mother like?\" he asked me suddenly. I glanced over to see him studying me with curious eyes. \"She looks a lot like me, but she's prettier,\" I said. He raised his eyebrows. \"I have too much Charlie in me. She's more outgoing than I am, and braver. She's irresponsible and slightly eccentric, and she's a very unpredictable cook. She's my best friend.\" I stopped. Talking about her was making me depressed. \"How old are you, Bella?\" His voice sounded frustrated for some reason I couldn't imagine. He'd stopped the car, and I realized we were at Charlie's house already. The rain was so heavy that I could barely see the house at all. It was like the car was submerged under a river. \"I'm seventeen,\" I responded, a little confused. \"You don't seem seventeen.\" His tone was reproachful; it made me laugh. \"What?\" he asked, curious again. \"My mom always says I was born thirty-five years old and that I get more middle-aged every year.\" I laughed, and then sighed. \"Well, someone has to be the adult.\" I paused for a second. \"You don't seem much like a junior in high school yourself,\" I noted. He made a face and changed the subject. \"So why did your mother marry Phil?\" I was surprised he would remember the name; I'd mentioned it just once, almost two months ago. It took me a moment to answer. \"My mother\u2026 she's very young for her age. I think Phil makes her feel even younger. At any rate, she's crazy about him.\" I shook my head. The attraction was a mystery to me. \"Do you approve?\" he asked. \"Does it matter?\" I countered. \"I want her to be happy\u2026 and he is who she wants.\" \"That's very generous\u2026 I wonder,\" he mused. \"What?\" \"Would she extend the same courtesy to you, do you think? No matter who your choice was?\" He was suddenly intent, his eyes searching mine. \"I-I think so,\" I stuttered. \"But she's the parent, after all. It's a little bit different.\" \"No one too scary then,\" he teased. I grinned in response. \"What do you mean by scary? Multiple facial piercings and extensive tattoos?\" \"That's one definition, I suppose.\" \"What's your definition?\" But he ignored my question and asked me another. \"Do you think that I could be scary?\" He raised one eyebrow, and the faint trace of a smile lightened his face. I thought for a moment, wondering whether the truth or a lie would go over better. I decided to go with the truth. \"Hmmm\u2026 I think you could be, if you wanted to.\" \"Are you frightened of me now?\" The smile vanished, and his heavenly face was suddenly serious. \"No.\" But I answered too quickly. The smile returned. \"So, now are you going to tell me about your family?\" I asked to distract him. \"It's got to be a much more interesting story than mine.\" He was instantly cautious. \"What do you want to know?\" \"The Cullens adopted you?\" I verified. \"Yes.\" I hesitated for a moment. \"What happened to your parents?\" \"They died many years ago.\" His tone was matter-of-fact. \"I'm sorry,\" I mumbled. \"I don't really remember them that clearly. Carlisle and Esme have been my parents for a long time now.\" \"And you love them.\" It wasn't a question. It was obvious in the way he spoke of them. \"Yes.\" He smiled. \"I couldn't imagine two better people.\" \"You're very lucky.\" \"I know I am.\" \"And your brother and sister?\" He glanced at the clock on the dashboard. \"My brother and sister, and Jasper and Rosalie for that matter, are going to be quite upset if they have to stand in the rain waiting for me.\" \"Oh, sorry, I guess you have to go.\" I didn't want to get out of the car. \"And you probably want your truck back before Chief Swan gets home, so you don't have to tell him about the Biology incident.\" He grinned at me. \"I'm sure he's already heard. There are no secrets in Forks.\" I sighed. He laughed, and there was an edge to his laughter. \"Have fun at the beach\u2026 good weather for sunbathing.\" He glanced out at the sheeting rain. \"Won't I see you tomorrow?\" \"No. Emmett and I are starting the weekend early.\" \"What are you going to do?\" A friend could ask that, right? I hoped the disappointment wasn't too apparent in my voice. \"We're going to be hiking in the Goat Rocks Wilderness, just south of Rainier.\" I remembered Charlie had said the Cullens went camping frequently. \"Oh, well, have fun.\" I tried to sound enthusiastic. I don't think I fooled him, though. A smile was playing around the edges of his lips. \"Will you do something for me this weekend?\" He turned to look me straight in the face, utilizing the full power of his burning gold eyes. I nodded helplessly. \"Don't be offended, but you seem to be one of those people who just attract accidents like a magnet. So\u2026 try not to fall into the ocean or get run over or anything, all right?\" He smiled crookedly. The helplessness had faded as he spoke. I glared at him.  \"I'll see what I can do,\" I snapped as I jumped out into the rain. I slammed the door behind me with excessive force. He was still smiling as he drove away.",

            "en": "14         714. MIND OVER MATTER He could drive well, when he kept the speed reasonable, I had to admit.  Like so many things, it seemed to be effortless to him. He barely looked at the road, yet the tires never deviated so much as a centimeter from the center of the lane. He drove one-handed, holding my hand on the seat. Sometimes he gazed into the setting sun, sometimes he glanced at me \u2014 my face, my hair blowing out the open window, our hands twined together. He had turned the radio to an oldies station, and he sang along with a song I'd never heard. He knew every line. \"You like fifties music?\" I asked.  \"Music in the fifties was good. Much better than the sixties, or the seventies, ugh!\" He shuddered. \"The eighties were bearable.\" \"Are you ever going to tell me how old you are?\" I asked, tentative, not wanting to upset his buoyant humor. \"Does it matter much?\" His smile, to my relief, remained unclouded. \"No, but I still wonder\u2026\" I grimaced. \"There's nothing like an unsolved mystery to keep you up at night.\" \"I wonder if it will upset you,\" he reflected to himself. He gazed into the sun; the minutes passed. \"Try me,\" I finally said. He sighed, and then looked into my eyes, seeming to forget the road completely for a time. Whatever he saw there must have encouraged him. He looked into the sun \u2014 the light of the setting orb glittered off his skin in ruby-tinged sparkles \u2014 and spoke.  \"I was born in Chicago in 1901.\" He paused and glanced at me from the corner of his eyes. My face was carefully unsurprised, patient for the rest. He smiled a tiny smile and continued. \"Carlisle found me in a hospital in the summer of 1918. I was seventeen, and dying of the Spanish influenza.\" He heard my intake of breath, though it was barely audible to my own ears. He looked down into my eyes again. \"I don't remember it well \u2014 it was a very long time ago, and human memories fade.\" He was lost in his thoughts for a short time before he went on. \"I do remember how it felt, when Carlisle saved me. It's not an easy thing, not something you could forget.\" \"Your parents?\" \"They had already died from the disease. I was alone. That was why he chose me. In all the chaos of the epidemic, no one would ever realize I was gone.\" \"How did he\u2026 save you?\" A few seconds passed before he answered. He seemed to choose his words carefully. \"It was difficult. Not many of us have the restraint necessary to accomplish it. But Carlisle has always been the most humane, the most compassionate of us\u2026 I don't think you could find his equal throughout all of history.\" He paused. \"For me, it was merely very, very painful.\" I could tell from the set of his lips, he would say no more on this subject. I suppressed my curiosity, though it was far from idle. There were many things I needed to think through on this particular issue, things that were only beginning to occur to me. No doubt his quick mind had already comprehended every aspect that eluded me.  His soft voice interrupted my thoughts. \"He acted from loneliness. That's usually the reason behind the choice. I was the first in Carlisle's family, though he found Esme soon after. She fell from a cliff. They brought her straight to the hospital morgue, though, somehow, her heart was still beating.\" \"So you must be dying, then, to become\u2026\" We never said the word, and I couldn't frame it now. \"No, that's just Carlisle. He would never do that to someone who had another choice.\" The respect in his voice was profound whenever he spoke of his father figure. \"It is easier he says, though,\" he continued, \"if the blood is weak.\" He looked at the now-dark road, and I could feel the subject closing again. \"And Emmett and Rosalie?\" \"Carlisle brought Rosalie to our family next. I didn't realize till much later that he was hoping she would be to me what Esme was to him \u2014 he was careful with his thoughts around me.\" He rolled his eyes. \"But she was never more than a sister. It was only two years later that she found Emmett. She was hunting \u2014 we were in Appalachia at the time \u2014 and found a bear about to finish him off. She carried him back to Carlisle, more than a hundred miles, afraid she wouldn't be able to do it herself. I'm only beginning to guess how difficult that journey was for her.\" He threw a pointed glance in my direction, and raised our hands, still folded together, to brush my cheek with the back of his hand. \"But she made it,\" I encouraged, looking away from the unbearable beauty of his eyes. \"Yes,\" he murmured. \"She saw something in his face that made her strong enough. And they've been together ever since. Sometimes they live separately from us, as a married couple. But the younger we pretend to be, the longer we can stay in any given place. Forks seemed perfect, so we all enrolled in high school.\" He laughed. \"I suppose we'll have to go to their wedding in a few years, again.\" \"Alice and Jasper?\" \"Alice and Jasper are two very rare creatures. They both developed a conscience, as we refer to it, with no outside guidance. Jasper belonged to another\u2026 family, a very different kind of family. He became depressed, and he wandered on his own. Alice found him. Like me, she has certain gifts above and beyond the norm for our kind.\" \"Really?\" I interrupted, fascinated. \"But you said you were the only one who could hear people's thoughts.\" \"That's true. She knows other things. She sees things \u2014 things that might happen, things that are coming. But it's very subjective. The future isn't set in stone. Things change.\" His jaw set when he said that, and his eyes darted to my face and away so quickly that I wasn't sure if I only imagined it. \"What kinds of things does she see?\" \"She saw Jasper and knew that he was looking for her before he knew it himself. She saw Carlisle and our family, and they came together to find us. She's most sensitive to non-humans. She always sees, for example, when another group of our kind is coming near. And any threat they may pose.\" \"Are there a lot of\u2026 your kind?\" I was surprised. How many of them could walk among us undetected? \"No, not many. But most won't settle in any one place. Only those like us, who've given up hunting you people\" \u2014 a sly glance in my direction \u2014 \"can live together with humans for any length of time. We've only found one other family like ours, in a small village in Alaska. We lived together for a time, but there were so many of us that we became too noticeable. Those of us who live\u2026 differently tend to band together.\"  \"And the others?\" \"Nomads, for the most part. We've all lived that way at times. It gets tedious, like anything else. But we run across the others now and then, because most of us prefer the North.\" \"Why is that?\" We were parked in front of my house now, and he'd turned off the truck.  It was very quiet and dark; there was no moon. The porch light was off so I knew my father wasn't home yet.  \"Did you have your eyes open this afternoon?\" he teased. \"Do you think I could walk down the street in the sunlight without causing traffic accidents? There's a reason why we chose the Olympic Peninsula, one of the most sunless places in the world. It's nice to be able to go outside in the day. You wouldn't believe how tired you can get of nighttime in eighty-odd years.\" \"So that's where the legends came from?\" \"Probably.\" \"And Alice came from another family, like Jasper?\" \"No, and that is a mystery. Alice doesn't remember her human life at all.  And she doesn't know who created her. She awoke alone. Whoever made her walked away, and none of us understand why, or how, he could. If she hadn't had that other sense, if she hadn't seen Jasper and Carlisle and known that she would someday become one of us, she probably would have turned into a total savage.\" There was so much to think through, so much I still wanted to ask. But, to my great embarrassment, my stomach growled. I'd been so intrigued, I hadn't even noticed I was hungry. I realized now that I was ravenous.  \"I'm sorry, I'm keeping you from dinner.\" \"I'm fine, really.\" \"I've never spent much time around anyone who eats food. I forget.\" \"I want to stay with you.\" It was easier to say in the darkness, knowing as I spoke how my voice would betray me, my hopeless addiction to him.  \"Can't I come in?\" he asked. \"Would you like to?\" I couldn't picture it, this godlike creature sitting in my father's shabby kitchen chair. \"Yes, if it's all right.\" I heard the door close quietly, and almost simultaneously he was outside my door, opening it for me. \"Very human,\" I complimented him. \"It's definitely resurfacing.\" He walked beside me in the night, so quietly I had to peek at him constantly to be sure he was still there. In the darkness he looked much more normal. Still pale, still dreamlike in his beauty, but no longer the fantastic sparkling creature of our sunlit afternoon. He reached the door ahead of me and opened it for me. I paused halfway through the frame. \"The door was unlocked?\" \"No, I used the key from under the eave.\" I stepped inside, flicked on the porch light, and turned to look at him with my eyebrows raised. I was sure I'd never used that key in front of him. \"I was curious about you.\" \"You spied on me?\" But somehow I couldn't infuse my voice with the proper outrage. I was flattered. He was unrepentant. \"What else is there to do at night?\" I let it go for the moment and went down the hall to the kitchen. He was there before me, needing no guide. He sat in the very chair I'd tried to picture him in. His beauty lit up the kitchen. It was a moment before I could look away. I concentrated on getting my dinner, taking last night's lasagna from the fridge, placing a square on a plate, heating it in the microwave. It revolved, filling the kitchen with the smell of tomatoes and oregano. I didn't take my eyes from the plate of food as I spoke. \"How often?\" I asked casually. \"Hmmm?\" He sounded as if I had pulled him from some other train of thought. I still didn't turn around. \"How often did you come here?\" \"I come here almost every night.\" I whirled, stunned. \"Why?\" \"You're interesting when you sleep.\" He spoke matter-of-factly. \"You talk.\" \"No!\" I gasped, heat flooding my face all the way to my hairline. I gripped the kitchen counter for support. I knew I talked in my sleep, of course; my mother teased me about it. I hadn't thought it was something I needed to worry about here, though. His expression shifted instantly to chagrin. \"Are you very angry with me?\" \"That depends!\" I felt and sounded like I'd had the breath knocked out of me. He waited. \"On?\" he urged. \"What you heard!\" I wailed. Instantly, silently, he was at my side, taking my hands carefully in his.  \"Don't be upset!\" he pleaded. He dropped his face to the level of my eyes, holding my gaze. I was embarrassed. I tried to look away.  \"You miss your mother,\" he whispered. \"You worry about her. And when it rains, the sound makes you restless. You used to talk about home a lot, but it's less often now. Once you said, 'It's too green.'\" He laughed softly, hoping, I could see, not to offend me further. \"Anything else?\" I demanded. He knew what I was getting at. \"You did say my name,\" he admitted. I sighed in defeat. \"A lot?\" \"How much do you mean by 'a lot,' exactly?\" \"Oh no!\" I hung my head. He pulled me against his chest, softly, naturally. \"Don't be self-conscious,\" he whispered in my ear. \"If I could dream at all, it would be about you. And I'm not ashamed of it.\" Then we both heard the sound of tires on the brick driveway, saw the headlights flash through the front windows, down the hall to us. I stiffened in his arms. \"Should your father know I'm here?\" he asked. \"I'm not sure\u2026\" I tried to think it through quickly. \"Another time then\u2026\" And I was alone. \"Edward!\" I hissed. I heard a ghostly chuckle, then nothing else. My father's key turned in the door. \"Bella?\" he called. It had bothered me before; who else would it be? Suddenly he didn't seem so far off base. \"In here.\" I hoped he couldn't hear the hysterical edge to my voice. I grabbed my dinner from the microwave and sat at the table as he walked in. His footsteps sounded so noisy after my day with Edward.  \"Can you get me some of that? I'm bushed.\" He stepped on the heels of his boots to take them off, holding the back of Edward's chair for support. I took my food with me, scarfing it down as I got his dinner. It burned my tongue. I filled two glasses with milk while his lasagna was heating, and gulped mine to put out the fire. As I set the glass down, I noticed the milk trembling and realized my hand was shaking. Charlie sat in the chair, and the contrast between him and its former occupant was comical. \"Thanks,\" he said as I placed his food on the table. \"How was your day?\" I asked. The words were rushed; I was dying to escape to my room. \"Good. The fish were biting\u2026 how about you? Did you get everything done that you wanted to?\" \"Not really \u2014 it was too nice out to stay indoors.\" I took another big bite. \"It was a nice day,\" he agreed. What an understatement, I thought to myself. Finished with the last bite of lasagna, I lifted my glass and chugged the remains of my milk. Charlie surprised me by being observant. \"In a hurry?\" \"Yeah, I'm tired. I'm going to bed early.\" \"You look kinda keyed up,\" he noted. Why, oh why, did this have to be his night to pay attention? \"Do I?\" was all I could manage in response. I quickly scrubbed my dishes clean in the sink, and placed them upside down on a dish towel to dry. \"It's Saturday,\" he mused. I didn't respond. \"No plans tonight?\" he asked suddenly. \"No, Dad, I just want to get some sleep.\" \"None of the boys in town your type, eh?\" He was suspicious, but trying to play it cool. \"No, none of the boys have caught my eye yet.\" I was careful not to over-emphasize the word boys in my quest to be truthful with Charlie. \"I thought maybe that Mike Newton\u2026 you said he was friendly.\" \"He's Just a friend, Dad.\" \"Well, you're too good for them all, anyway. Wait till you get to college to start looking.\" Every father's dream, that his daughter will be out of the house before the hormones kick in. \"Sounds like a good idea to me,\" I agreed as I headed up the stairs. \"'Night, honey,\" he called after me. No doubt he would be listening carefully all evening, waiting for me to try to sneak out. \"See you in the morning, Dad.\" See you creeping into my room tonight at midnight to check on me. I worked to make my tread sound slow and tired as I walked up the stairs to my room. I shut the door loud enough for him to hear, and then sprinted on my tiptoes to the window. I threw it open and leaned out into the night. My eyes scanned the darkness, the impenetrable shadows of the trees. \"Edward?\" I whispered, feeling completely idiotic. The quiet, laughing response came from behind me. \"Yes?\" I whirled, one hand flying to my throat in surprise. He lay, smiling hugely, across my bed, his hands behind his head, his feet dangling off the end, the picture of ease. \"Oh!\" I breathed, sinking unsteadily to the floor.  \"I'm sorry.\" He pressed his lips together, trying to hide his amusement. \"Just give me a minute to restart my heart.\" He sat up slowly, so as not to startle me again. Then he leaned forward and reached out with his long arms to pick me up, gripping the tops of my arms like I was a toddler. He sat me on the bed beside him. \"Why don't you sit with me,\" he suggested, putting a cold hand on mine. \"How's the heart?\" \"You tell me \u2014 I'm sure you hear it better than I do.\" I felt his quiet laughter shake the bed. We sat there for a moment in silence, both listening to my heartbeat slow. I thought about having Edward in my room, with my father in the house. \"Can I have a minute to be human?\" I asked. \"Certainly.\" He gestured with one hand that I should proceed. \"Stay,\" I said, trying to look severe. \"Yes, ma'am.\" And he made a show of becoming a statue on the edge of my bed. I hopped up, grabbing my pajamas from off the floor, my bag of toiletries off the desk. I left the light off and slipped out, closing the door. I could hear the sound from the TV rising up the stairs. I banged the bathroom door loudly, so Charlie wouldn't come up to bother me. I meant to hurry. I brushed my teeth fiercely, trying to be thorough and speedy, removing all traces of lasagna. But the hot water of the shower couldn't be rushed. It unknotted the muscles in my back, calmed my pulse. The familiar smell of my shampoo made me feel like I might be the same person I had been this morning. I tried not to think of Edward, sitting in my room, waiting, because then I had to start all over with the calming process. Finally, I couldn't delay anymore. I shut off the water, toweling hastily, rushing again. I pulled on my holey t-shirt and gray sweatpants. Too late to regret not packing the Victoria's Secret silk pajamas my mother got me two birthdays ago, which still had the tags on them in a drawer somewhere back home. I rubbed the towel through my hair again, and then yanked the brush through it quickly. I threw the towel in the hamper, flung my brush and toothpaste into my bag. Then I dashed down the stairs so Charlie could see that I was in my pajamas, with wet hair. \"'Night, Dad.\" \"'Night, Bella.\" He did look startled by my appearance. Maybe that would keep him from checking on me tonight. I took the stairs two at a time, trying to be quiet, and flew into my room, closing the door tightly behind me. Edward hadn't moved a fraction of an inch, a carving of Adonis perched on my faded quilt. I smiled, and his lips twitched, the statue coming to life. His eyes appraised me, taking in the damp hair, the tattered shirt. He raised one eyebrow. \"Nice.\" I grimaced. \"No, it looks good on you.\" \"Thanks,\" I whispered. I went back to his side, sitting cross-legged beside him. I looked at the lines in the wooden floor. \"What was all that for?\" \"Charlie thinks I'm sneaking out.\" \"Oh.\" He contemplated that. \"Why?\" As if he couldn't know Charlie's mind much more clearly than I could guess. \"Apparently, I look a little overexcited.\" He lifted my chin, examining my face. \"You look very warm, actually.\" He bent his face slowly to mine, laying his cool cheek against my skin. I held perfectly still. \"Mmmmmm\u2026\" he breathed. It was very difficult, while he was touching me, to frame a coherent question. It took me a minute of scattered concentration to begin. \"It seems to be\u2026 much easier for you, now, to be close to me.\" \"Does it seem that way to you?\" he murmured, his nose gliding to the corner of my jaw. I felt his hand, lighter than a moth's wing, brushing my damp hair back, so that his lips could touch the hollow beneath my ear. \"Much, much easier,\" I said, trying to exhale. \"Hmm.\" \"So I was wondering\u2026\" I began again, but his fingers were slowly tracing my collarbone, and I lost my train of thought. \"Yes?\" he breathed. \"Why is that,\" my voice shook, embarrassing me, \"do you think?\" I felt the tremor of his breath on my neck as he laughed. \"Mind over matter.\" I pulled back; as I moved, he froze \u2014 and I could no longer hear the sound of his breathing. We stared cautiously at each other for a moment, and then, as his clenched jaw gradually relaxed, his expression became puzzled. \"Did I do something wrong?\" \"No \u2014 the opposite. You're driving me crazy,\" I explained.  He considered that briefly, and when he spoke, he sounded pleased. \"Really?\" A triumphant smile slowly lit his face. \"Would you like a round of applause?\" I asked sarcastically. He grinned. \"I'm just pleasantly surprised,\" he clarified. \"In the last hundred years or so,\" his voice was teasing, \"I never imagined anything like this. I didn't believe I would ever find someone I wanted to be with\u2026 in another way than my brothers and sisters. And then to find, even though it's all new to me, that I'm good at it\u2026 at being with you\u2026\" \"You're good at everything,\" I pointed out. He shrugged, allowing that, and we both laughed in whispers. \"But how can it be so easy now?\" I pressed. \"This afternoon\u2026\" \"It's not easy,\" he sighed. \"But this afternoon, I was still\u2026 undecided. I am sorry about that, it was unforgivable for me to behave so.\" \"Not unforgivable,\" I disagreed. \"Thank you.\" He smiled. \"You see,\" he continued, looking down now, \"I wasn't sure if I was strong enough\u2026\" He picked up one of my hands and pressed it lightly to his face. \"And while there was still that possibility that I might be\u2026 overcome\" \u2014 he breathed in the scent at my wrist \u2014 \"I was\u2026 susceptible. Until I made up my mind that I was strong enough, that there was no possibility at all that I would\u2026 that I ever could\u2026\" I'd never seen him struggle so hard for words. It was so\u2026 human. \"So there's no possibility now?\" \"Mind over matter,\" he repeated, smiling, his teeth bright even in the darkness. \"Wow, that was easy,\" I said. He threw back his head and laughed, quietly as a whisper, but still exuberantly. \"Easy for you!\" he amended, touching my nose with his fingertip. And then his face was abruptly serious. \"I'm trying,\" he whispered, his voice pained. \"If it gets to be\u2026 too much, I'm fairly sure I'll be able to leave.\" I scowled. I didn't like the talk of leaving. \"And it will be harder tomorrow,\" he continued. \"I've had the scent of you in my head all day, and I've grown amazingly desensitized. If I'm away from you for any length of time, I'll have to start over again. Not quite from scratch, though, I think.\" \"Don't go away, then,\" I responded, unable to hide the longing in my voice. \"That suits me,\" he replied, his face relaxing into a gentle smile. \"Bring on the shackles \u2014 I'm your prisoner.\" But his long hands formed manacles around my wrists as he spoke. He laughed his quiet, musical laugh. He'd laughed more tonight than I'd ever heard in all the time I'd spent with him. \"You seem more\u2026 optimistic than usual,\" I observed. \"I haven't seen you like this before.\" \"Isn't it supposed to be like this?\" He smiled. \"The glory of first love, and all that. It's incredible, isn't it, the difference between reading about something, seeing it in the pictures, and experiencing it?\" \"Very different,\" I agreed. \"More forceful than I'd imagined.\" \"For example\" \u2014 his words flowed swiftly now, I had to concentrate to catch it all \u2014 \"the emotion of jealousy. I've read about it a hundred thousand times, seen actors portray it in a thousand different plays and movies. I believed I understood that one pretty clearly. But it shocked me\u2026\" He grimaced. \"Do you remember the day that Mike asked you to the dance?\" I nodded, though I remembered that day for a different reason. \"The day you started talking to me again.\" \"I was surprised by the flare of resentment, almost fury, that I felt \u2014 I didn't recognize what it was at first. I was even more aggravated than usual that I couldn't know what you were thinking, why you refused him. Was it simply for your friend's sake? Was there someone else? I knew I had no right to care either way. I tried not to care. \"And then the line started forming,\" he chuckled. I scowled in the darkness. \"I waited, unreasonably anxious to hear what you would say to them, to watch your expressions. I couldn't deny the relief I felt, watching the annoyance on your face. But I couldn't be sure. \"That was the first night I came here. I wrestled all night, while watching you sleep, with the chasm between what I knew was right, moral, ethical, and what I wanted. I knew that if I continued to ignore you as I should, or if I left for a few years, till you were gone, that someday you would say yes to Mike, or someone like him. It made me angry. \"And then,\" he whispered, \"as you were sleeping, you said my name. You spoke so clearly, at first I thought you'd woken. But you rolled over restlessly and mumbled my name once more, and sighed. The feeling that coursed through me then was unnerving, staggering. And I knew I couldn't ignore you any longer.\" He was silent for a moment, probably listening to the suddenly uneven pounding of my heart. \"But jealousy\u2026 it's a strange thing. So much more powerful than I would have thought. And irrational! Just now, when Charlie asked you about that vile Mike Newton\u2026\" He shook his head angrily. \"I should have known you'd be listening,\" I groaned. \"Of course.\" \"That made you feel jealous, though, really?\" \"I'm new at this; you're resurrecting the human in me, and everything feels stronger because it's fresh.\" \"But honestly,\" I teased, \"for that to bother you, after I have to hear that Rosalie \u2014 Rosalie, the incarnation of pure beauty, Rosalie \u2014 was meant for you. Emmett or no Emmett, how can I compete with that?\" \"There's no competition.\" His teeth gleamed. He drew my trapped hands around his back, holding me to his chest. I kept as still as I could, even breathing with caution. \"I know there's no competition,\" I mumbled into his cold skin. \"That's the problem.\" \"Of course Rosalie is beautiful in her way, but even if she wasn't like a sister to me, even if Emmett didn't belong with her, she could never have one tenth, no, one hundredth of the attraction you hold for me.\" He was serious now, thoughtful. \"For almost ninety years I've walked among my kind, and yours\u2026 all the time thinking I was complete in myself, not realizing what I was seeking. And not finding anything, because you weren't alive yet.\" \"It hardly seems fair,\" I whispered, my face still resting on his chest, listening to his breath come and go. \"I haven't had to wait at all. Why should I get off so easily?\" \"You're right,\" he agreed with amusement. \"I should make this harder for you, definitely.\" He freed one of his hands, released my wrist, only to gather it carefully into his other hand. He stroked my wet hair softly, from the top of my head to my waist. \"You only have to risk your life every second you spend with me, that's surely not much. You only have to turn your back on nature, on humanity\u2026 what's that worth?\" \"Very little \u2014 I don't feel deprived of anything.\" \"Not yet.\" And his voice was abruptly full of ancient grief. I tried to pull back, to look in his face, but his hand locked my wrists in an unbreakable hold. \"What \u2014\" I started to ask, when his body became alert. I froze, but he suddenly released my hands, and disappeared. I narrowly avoided falling on my face. \"Lie down!\" he hissed. I couldn't tell where he spoke from in the darkness. I rolled under my quilt, balling up on my side, the way I usually slept. I heard the door crack open, as Charlie peeked in to make sure I was where I was supposed to be. I breathed evenly, exaggerating the movement. A long minute passed. I listened, not sure if I'd heard the door close. Then Edward's cool arm was around me, under the covers, his lips at my ear. \"You are a terrible actress \u2014 I'd say that career path is out for you.\" \"Darn it,\" I muttered. My heart was crashing in my chest. He hummed a melody I didn't recognize; it sounded like a lullaby. He paused. \"Should I sing you to sleep?\" \"Right,\" I laughed. \"Like I could sleep with you here!\" \"You do it all the time,\" he reminded me. \"But I didn't know you were here,\" I replied icily. \"So if you don't want to sleep\u2026\" he suggested, ignoring my tone. My breath caught. \"If I don't want to sleep\u2026 ?\" He chuckled. \"What do you want to do then?\" I couldn't answer at first. \"I'm not sure,\" I finally said. \"Tell me when you decide.\" I could feel his cool breath on my neck, feel his nose sliding along my jaw, inhaling. \"I thought you were desensitized.\" \"Just because I'm resisting the wine doesn't mean I can't appreciate the bouquet,\" he whispered. \"You have a very floral smell, like lavender\u2026 or freesia,\" he noted. \"It's mouthwatering.\" \"Yeah, it's an off day when I don't get somebody telling me how edible I smell.\" He chuckled, and then sighed. \"I've decided what I want to do,\" I told him. \"I want to hear more about you.\" \"Ask me anything.\" I sifted through my questions for the most vital. \"Why do you do it?\" I said. \"I still don't understand how you can work so hard to resist what you\u2026 are. Please don't misunderstand, of course I'm glad that you do. I just don't see why you would bother in the first place.\" He hesitated before answering. \"That's a good question, and you are not the first one to ask it. The others \u2014 the majority of our kind who are quite content with our lot \u2014 they, too, wonder at how we live. But you see, just because we've been\u2026 dealt a certain hand\u2026 it doesn't mean that we can't choose to rise above \u2014 to conquer the boundaries of a destiny that none of us wanted. To try to retain whatever essential humanity we can.\" I lay unmoving, locked in <em>awed</em> silence. \"Did you fall asleep?\" he whispered after a few minutes. \"No.\" \"Is that all you were curious about?\" I rolled my eyes. \"Not quite.\" \"What else do you want to know?\" \"Why can you read minds \u2014 why only you? And Alice, seeing the future\u2026 why does that happen?\" I felt him shrug in the darkness. \"We don't really know. Carlisle has a theory\u2026 he believes that we all bring something of our strongest human traits with us into the next life, where they are intensified \u2014 like our minds, and our senses. He thinks that I must have already been very sensitive to the thoughts of those around me. And that Alice had some precognition, wherever she was.\" \"What did he bring into the next life, and the others?\" \"Carlisle brought his compassion. Esme brought her ability to love passionately. Emmett brought his strength, Rosalie her\u2026 tenacity. Or you could call it pigheadedness.\" he chuckled. \"Jasper is very interesting. He was quite charismatic in his first life, able to influence those around him to see things his way. Now he is able to manipulate the emotions of those around him \u2014 calm down a room of angry people, for example, or excite a lethargic crowd, conversely. It's a very subtle gift.\" I considered the impossibilities he described, trying to take it in. He waited patiently while I thought. \"So where did it all start? I mean, Carlisle changed you, and then someone must have changed him, and so on\u2026\" \"Well, where did you come from? Evolution? Creation? Couldn't we have evolved in the same way as other species, predator and prey? Or, if you don't believe that all this world could have just happened on its own, which is hard for me to accept myself, is it so hard to believe that the same force that created the delicate angelfish with the shark, the baby seal and the killer whale, could create both our kinds together?\" \"Let me get this straight \u2014 I'm the baby seal, right?\" \"Right.\" He laughed, and something touched my hair \u2014 his lips? I wanted to turn toward him, to see if it was really his lips against my hair. But I had to be good; I didn't want to make this any harder for him than it already was. \"Are you ready to sleep?\" he asked, interrupting the short silence. \"Or do you have any more questions?\" \"Only a million or two.\" \"We have tomorrow, and the next day, and the next\u2026\" he reminded me. I smiled, euphoric at the thought.  \"Are you sure you won't vanish in the morning?\" I wanted this to be certain. \"You are mythical, after all.\" \"I won't leave you.\" His voice had the seal of a promise in it. \"One more, then, tonight\u2026\" And I blushed. The darkness was no help \u2014 I'm sure he could feel the sudden warmth under my skin. \"What is it?\" \"No, forget it. I changed my mind.\" \"Bella, you can ask me anything.\" I didn't answer, and he groaned. \"I keep thinking it will get less frustrating, not hearing your thoughts. But it just gets worse and worse.\" \"I'm glad you can't read my thoughts. It's bad enough that you eavesdrop on my sleep-talking.\" \"Please?\" His voice was so persuasive, so impossible to resist. I shook my head. \"If you don't tell me, I'll just assume it's something much worse than it is,\" he threatened darkly. \"Please?\" Again, that pleading voice. \"Well,\" I began, glad that he couldn't see my face. \"Yes?\" \"You said that Rosalie and Emmett will get married soon\u2026 Is that\u2026 marriage\u2026 the same as it is for humans?\" He laughed in earnest now, understanding. \"Is that what you're getting at?\" I fidgeted, unable to answer. \"Yes, I suppose it is much the same,\" he said. \"I told you, most of those human desires are there, just hidden behind more powerful desires.\" \"Oh,\" was all I could say. \"Was there a purpose behind your curiosity?\" \"Well, I did wonder\u2026 about you and me\u2026 someday\u2026\" He was instantly serious, I could tell by the sudden stillness of his body. I froze, too, reacting automatically. \"I don't think that\u2026 that\u2026 would be possible for us.\" \"Because it would be too hard for you, if I were that\u2026 close?\" \"That's certainly a problem. But that's not what I was thinking of. It's just that you are so soft, so fragile. I have to mind my actions every moment that we're together so that I don't hurt you. I could kill you quite easily, Bella, simply by accident.\" His voice had become just a soft murmur. He moved his icy palm to rest it against my cheek. \"If I was too hasty\u2026 if for one second I wasn't paying enough attention, I could reach out, meaning to touch your face, and crush your skull by mistake. You don't realize how incredibly breakable you are. I can never, never afford to lose any kind of control when I'm with you.\" He waited for me to respond, growing anxious when I didn't. \"Are you scared?\" he asked. I waited for a minute to answer, so the words would be true. \"No. I'm fine.\" He seemed to deliberate for a moment. \"I'm curious now, though,\" he said, his voice light again. \"Have you ever\u2026 ?\" He trailed off suggestively. \"Of course not.\" I flushed. \"I told you I've never felt like this about anyone before, not even close.\" \"I know. It's just that I know other people's thoughts. I know love and lust don't always keep the same company.\" \"They do for me. Now, anyway, that they exist for me at all,\" I sighed. \"That's nice. We have that one thing in common, at least.\" He sounded satisfied. \"Your human instincts\u2026\" I began. He waited. \"Well, do you find me attractive, in that way, at all?\" He laughed and lightly rumpled my nearly dry hair.  \"I may not be a human, but I am a man,\" he assured me. I yawned involuntarily. \"I've answered your questions, now you should sleep,\" he insisted. \"I'm not sure if I can.\" \"Do you want me to leave?\" \"No!\" I said too loudly.
