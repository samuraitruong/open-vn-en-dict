Lina <em>Medina</em>, Born on september 27, 1933 confirmed to be the worlds youngest mother in recorded history. She gave birth to Gerardo on may 14, 1939, by a caesarean section necessitated by her small pelvis.We have heard of young girls having babies, however, an age of 1 digit number? 5 year old??!!!! OMG!! She was 5 years and seven months old when her parents thought she had a tumor in her stomach.They took her to the hospital. Several doctors examined her, and decided; she was 7 months pregnant. indeed, those who have examined her condition stated that her reproductive system had fully developed by the age of two and half. Until the age of 10 Gerardo, her son, believed that <em>Medina</em> was his older sister. In young adulthood, she worked as a secretary in the Lima clinic of Lozada, who gave her an education and helped put her son through high school. Gerardo lived to be 40 years old, when he passed away from a bone marrow disease. Are you still left with the question of: how did she get pregnant in the first place? So do we.. the biological father who impregnated Lina was never identified.",
