            "en": "8 Things in Your Home That May Be Harming You        Home sweet home, right? Well, sort of. You may be unaware of the potential health dangers lurking in your abode \u2014 from critters in the kitchen to bugs in the bedroom. Here\u2019s what you need to know and what to do. By Sarah Jio v Your kitchen sponge Maybe you\u2019ve heard about the germs on your kitchen sponge (gross news flash\u2014there may be as many as 20 million microbes on it right now). But here\u2019s the deal: Your method for \u201ccleaning\u201d that sponge may be leaving it loaded with potentially hazardous bacteria that can make you ill. Researchers at the USDA\u2019s Agricultural Research Service found that some common cleaning methods for sponges\u2014soaking them in a bleach solution, lemon juice or water\u2014did not eradicate the germs. What to do The best ways to clean a dirty sponge, they say, are in the microwave (on high for one minute) and in the dishwasher, which will kill 99.9 percent of all germs. v Your bed Have you been on a trip recently? If so, you may have brought home some hitchhikers\u2014of the creepy-crawly variety. Bedbugs, tiny <em>bloodthirsty</em> insects, are hosts to organisms that cause hepatitis B and Chagas disease, say health experts. But the real problem seems to be the infections and allergic reactions that can sometimes result from bedbug bites. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, bedbugs are on the rise and becoming an increasing health problem. The insects, which hide in the crevices of mattresses and bedding, are showing up everywhere, from hostels to the swankiest hotels, and they often find their way into people\u2019s luggage, transporting themselves to unsuspecting homes. What to do If you\u2019ve done some traveling recently, and especially if you\u2019ve noticed any mysterious bug bites, wash everything in your luggage and consider scrubbing your suitcase with a stiff brush before giving it a good vacuuming. v Your laptop You\u2019re the only one who uses it, so how dirty can it be? In a word: filthy. A study by researchers at the University of North Carolina Health Care System found that keyboards were loaded with germs. Even more disgusting, the average public toilet bowl contains 41 germs per square inch. The average personal keyboard? Some 21,000 germs per square inch. \u201cToilet bowls get cleaned,\u201d says Philip M. Tierno Jr., Ph.D., director of clinical microbiology and immunology at New York University Langone Medical Center, \u201cbut keyboards rarely do.\u201d What to do Tierno says the best way to keep your laptop or computer\u2019s keyboard clean is to gently wipe it down daily with disinfecting wipes. v Your shower curtain According to research by the Center for Health, Environment & Justice, shower curtains and liners made from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) may be harmful to your health. Their study suggests that PVC releases potentially harmful chemicals into your bathroom. While there is still some debate among health experts about how much of these chemicals could be deemed harmful, many believe that limiting your exposure to chemicals, wherever possible, makes sense. What to do Check your shower curtain\u2019s label to see if it\u2019s made of vinyl or PVC. While not all manufacturers disclose this information, some retailers, like Ikea, have banned PVC shower curtains altogether, and Target has promised to phase out the material in its shower-curtain products in the months ahead. v Your laundry Nobody thinks of the washing machine as a germ magnet\u2014that\u2019s where clothes get clean, right? Not if you\u2019re using a public machine, and especially if that machine uses water that\u2019s not hot enough, says Tierno. Here\u2019s why: Lower temperatures can encourage the spread of germs. Researchers at the University of Arizona found that intestinal viruses such as hepatitis A can be easily transferred from underwear to other garments during the washing process. Even worse, some germs can lurk in public washing machines and find their way to your clothes. What to do Wash your underwear and towels separately, using bleach if possible, and wash all towels in water that\u2019s at least 155 degrees, which will kill most germs. Not sure if your apartment\u2019s water temperature is hot enough? Talk to the building manager. v Your humidifier Watch out for the humidifier, say germ experts. \u201cIf it\u2019s not cleaned properly, a humidifier can become a repository for legionella and other pathogens that cause respiratory infections,\u201d says Tierno. What to do If you like sleeping with a humidifier in your room, be sure to clean it often\u2014at least a few times a week\u2014by mixing a solution of one-part bleach to 19 parts water (for most humidifiers, this would equal about a half or full cup of bleach) and letting it sit for a few minutes before rinsing well.  v Your doorknob Think of the people who have touched your front doorknob in the past 48 hours: the UPS man, a neighbor, a solicitor, your friends\u2014it\u2019s easy to lose count. Now think of all the places they\u2019ve been\u2014the subway, public restrooms, grocery stores. Those germs are all on your doorknob right now, says Tierno. Most people let their guard down when it comes to their own door handles, he says, but we shouldn\u2019t: \u201cViruses can survive for days on doorknobs, and you can easily get cross contamination from them,\u201d he says. What to do Make a habit of wiping down your doorknob frequently with sanitizing wipes or sprays. Have a copper doorknob? You may be in luck. Researchers in England found that copper door handles had 95 percent fewer microorganisms on them compared with other doorknobs. Scientists believe that many germs, including MRSA, may not be able to survive on copper. v Your salt and pepper shakers When\u2019s the last time you cleaned your salt and pepper shakers? Exactly. These unassuming little items get touched in all parts of the meal-prep process. Example: You give your sauce a dash of salt after touching raw chicken and then later set the shaker on the table. What to do Nobody thinks of cleaning their salt and pepper shakers, says Elizabeth Scott, Ph.D., assistant professor and co-director Simmons Center for Hygiene and Health in Home and Community at Simmons College, but to avoid cross-contamination and food poisoning, you should. \u201cBest to wipe them with an EPA-registered disinfectant,\u201d she says. \u201cBut better still, always wash your hands after handling raw foods and before touching anything else.\u201d Ngu\u1ed3n: http://health.msn.com/health-topics/slideshow.aspx?cp-documentid=100243934&imageindex=1",

            "en": "It made me sad that he had to try so hard. I comforted myself with the knowledge that I wouldn\u2019t be causing him pain much longer.  I heard Charlie approaching then, stamping his feet on the way to express his customary displeasure with our guest. Edward\u2019s eyes snapped open and he let our hands fall, keeping them twined.     \u201cGood evening, Charlie.\u201d Edward was always flawlessly polite, though Charlie didn\u2019t deserve it. Charlie grunted at him, and then stood there with his arms crossed over his chest. He was taking the idea of parental supervision to extremes lately.  \u201cI brought another set of applications,\u201d Edward told me then, holding up a stuffed manila envelope. He was wearing a roll of stamps like a ring around his littlest finger.    I groaned. How were there any colleges left that he hadn\u2019t forced me to apply to already? And how did he keep finding these loophole openings? It was so late in the year.  He smiled as if he could read my thoughts; they must have been very obvious on my face. \u201cThere are still a few open deadlines. And a few places willing to make exceptions.\u201d    I could just imagine the motivations behind such exceptions. And the dollar amounts involved.  Edward laughed at my expression.  \u201cShall we?\u201d he asked, towing me toward the kitchen table.  Charlie huffed and followed behind, though he could hardly complain about the activity on tonight\u2019s agenda. He\u2019d been pestering me to make a decision about college on a daily basis.    I cleared the table quickly while Edward organized an intimidating stack of forms. When I moved Wuthering Heights to the counter, Edward raised one eyebrow. I knew what he was thinking, but Charlie interrupted before Edward could comment.  \u201cSpeaking of college applications, Edward,\u201d Charlie said, his tone even more sullen \u2014 he tried to avoid addressing Edward directly, and when he had to, it exacerbated his bad mood. \u201cBella and I were just talking about next year. Have you decided where you\u2019re going to school?\u201d      Edward smiled up at Charlie and his voice was friendly. \u201cNot yet. I\u2019ve received a few acceptance letters, but I\u2019m still weighing my options.\u201d  \u201cWhere have you been accepted?\u201d Charlie pressed.  \u201cSyracuse . . . Harvard . . . Dartmouth . . . and I just got accepted to the University of Alaska Southeast today.\u201d Edward turned his face slightly to the side so that he could wink at me. I stifled a giggle.    \u201cHarvard? Dartmouth?\u201d Charlie mumbled, unable to conceal his awe. \u201cWell that\u2019s pretty . . . that\u2019s something. Yeah, but the University of Alaska . . . you wouldn\u2019t really consider that when you could go Ivy League. I mean, your father would want you to . . .\u201d  \u201cCarlisle\u2019s always fine with whatever I choose to do,\u201d Edward told him serenely.  \u201cHmph.\u201d     \u201cGuess what, Edward?\u201d I asked in a bright voice, playing along.  \u201cWhat, Bella?\u201d  I pointed to the thick envelope on the counter. \u201cI just got my acceptance to the University of Alaska!\u201d  \u201cCongratulations!\u201d He grinned. \u201cWhat a coincidence.\u201d  Charlie\u2019s eyes narrowed and he glared back and forth between the two of us. \u201cFine,\u201d he muttered after a minute. \u201cI\u2019m going to go watch the game, Bella. Nine-thirty.\u201d  That was his usual parting command.     \u201cEr, Dad? Remember the very recent discussion about my freedom . . . ?\u201d  He sighed. \u201cRight. Okay, ten -thirty. You still have a curfew on school nights.\u201d  \u201cBella\u2019s no longer grounded?\u201d Edward asked. Though I knew he wasn\u2019t really surprised, I couldn\u2019t detect any false note to the sudden excitement in his voice.  \u201cConditionally,\u201d Charlie corrected through his teeth. \u201cWhat\u2019s it to you?\u201d  I frowned at my dad, but he didn\u2019t see.  \u201cIt\u2019s just good to know,\u201d Edward said. \u201cAlice has been itching for a shopping partner, and I\u2019m sure Bella would love to see some city lights.\u201d He smiled at me.  But Charlie growled, \u201cNo!\u201d and his face flushed purple.      \u201cDad! What\u2019s the problem?\u201d  He made an effort to unclench his teeth. \u201cI don\u2019t want you going to Seattle right now.\u201d  \u201cHuh?\u201d  \u201cI told you about that story in the paper \u2014 there\u2019s some kind of gang on a killing spree in Seattle and I want you to steer clear, okay?\u201d    I rolled my eyes. \u201cDad, there\u2019s a better chance that I\u2019ll get struck by lightning than that the one day I\u2019m in Seattle \u2014\u201d  \u201cNo, that\u2019s fine, Charlie,\u201d Edward said, interrupting me. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean Seattle. I was thinking Portland, actually. I wouldn\u2019t have Bella in Seattle, either. Of course not.\u201d  I looked at him in disbelief, but he had Charlie\u2019s newspaper in his hands and he was reading the front page intently     He must have been trying to appease my father. The idea of being in danger from even the most deadly of humans while I was with Alice or Edward was downright hilarious.  It worked. Charlie stared at Edward for one second more, and then shrugged. \u201cFine.\u201d He stalked off toward the living room, in a bit of a hurry now \u2014 maybe he didn\u2019t want to miss tip-off.  I waited till the TV was on, so that Charlie wouldn\u2019t be able to hear me.  \u201cWhat \u2014,\u201d I started to ask.  \u201cHold on,\u201d Edward said without looking up from the paper. His eyes stayed focused on the page as he pushed the first application toward me across the table. \u201cI think you can recycle your essays for this one. Same questions.\u201d     Charlie must still be listening. I sighed and started to fill out the repetitive information: name, address, social. . . . After a few minutes I glanced up, but Edward was now staring pensively out the window. As I bent my head back to my work, I noticed for the first time the name of the school.  I snorted and shoved the papers aside.      \u201cBella?\u201d  \u201cBe serious, Edward. Dartmouth ?\u201d  Edward lifted the discarded application and laid it gently in front of me again. \u201cI think you\u2019d like New Hampshire,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a full complement of night courses for me, and the forests are very conveniently located for the avid hiker. Plentiful wildlife.\u201d He pulled out the crooked smile he knew I couldn\u2019t resist.     I took a deep breath through my nose.  \u201cI\u2019ll let you pay me back, if that makes you happy,\u201d he promised. \u201cIf you want, I can charge you interest.\u201d  \u201cLike I could even get in without some enormous bribe. Or was that part of the loan? The new Cullen wing of the library? Ugh. Why are we having this discussion again?\u201d     \u201cWill you just fill out the application, please, Bella? It won\u2019t hurt you to apply.\u201d  My jaw flexed. \u201cYou know what? I don\u2019t think I will.\u201d  I reached for the papers, planning to crumple them into a suitable shape for lobbing at the trashcan, but they were already gone. I stared at the empty table for a moment, and then at Edward. He didn\u2019t appear to have moved, but the application was probably already tucked away in his jacket.      \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I demanded.  \u201cI sign your name better than you do yourself. You\u2019ve already written the essays.\u201d  \u201cYou\u2019re going way overboard with this, you know.\u201d I whispered on the off chance that Charlie wasn\u2019t completely lost in his game. \u201cI really don\u2019t need to apply anywhere else. I\u2019ve been accepted in Alaska. I can almost afford the first semester\u2019s tuition. It\u2019s as good an alibi as any. There\u2019s no need to throw away a bunch of money, no matter whose it is.\u201d  A pained looked tightened his face. \u201cBella \u2014\u201d  \u201cDon\u2019t start. I agree that I need to go through the motions for Charlie\u2019s sake, but we both know I\u2019m not going to be in any condition to go to school next fall. To be anywhere near people.\u201d     My knowledge of those first few years as a new vampire was sketchy. Edward had never gone into details \u2014 it wasn\u2019t his favorite subject \u2014 but I knew it wasn\u2019t pretty. Self-control was apparently an acquired skill. Anything more than correspondence school was out of the question.  \u201cI thought the timing was still undecided,\u201d Edward reminded me softly. \u201cYou might enjoy a semester or two of college. There are a lot of human experiences you\u2019ve never had.\u201d  \u201cI\u2019ll get to those afterward.\u201d  \u201cThey won\u2019t be human experiences afterward. You don\u2019t get a second chance at humanity, Bella.\u201d  I sighed. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be reasonable about the timing, Edward. It\u2019s just too dangerous to mess around with.\u201d     \u201cThere\u2019s no danger yet,\u201d he insisted.  I glared at him. No danger? Sure. I only had a sadistic vampire trying to avenge her mate\u2019s death with my own, preferably through some slow and torturous method. Who was worried about Victoria? And, oh yeah, the Volturi \u2014 the vampire royal family with their small army of vampire warriors \u2014 who insisted that my heart stop beating one way or another in the near future, because humans weren\u2019t allowed to know they existed. Right. No reason at all to panic.  Even with Alice keeping watch \u2014 Edward was relying on her uncannily accurate visions of the future to give us advance warning \u2014 it was insane to take chances.    Besides, I\u2019d already won this argument. The date for my transformation was tentatively set for shortly after my graduation from high school, only a handful of weeks away.  A sharp jolt of unease pierced my stomach as I realized how short the time really was. Of course this change was necessary \u2014 and the key to what I wanted more than everything else in the world put together \u2014 but I was deeply conscious of Charlie sitting in the other room enjoying his game, just like every other night. And my mother, Ren\u00e9e, far away in sunny Florida, still pleading with me to spend the summer on the beach with her and her new husband. And Jacob, who, unlike my parents, would know exactly what was going on when I disappeared to some distant school. Even if my parents didn\u2019t grow suspicious for a long time, even if I could put off visits with excuses about travel expenses or study loads or illnesses, Jacob would know the truth.    For a moment, the idea of Jacob\u2019s certain revulsion overshadowed every other pain.  \u201cBella,\u201d Edward murmured, his face twisting when he read the distress in mine. \u201cThere\u2019s no hurry. I won\u2019t let anyone hurt you. You can take all the time you need.\u201d  \u201cI want to hurry,\u201d I whispered, smiling weakly, trying to make a joke of it. \u201cI want to be a monster, too.\u201d     His teeth clenched; he spoke through them. \u201cYou have no idea what you\u2019re saying.\u201d Abruptly, he flung the damp newspaper onto the table in between us. His finger stabbed the headline on the front page:  DEATH TOLL ON THE RISE, POLICE FEAR GANG ACTIVITY  \u201cWhat does that have to do with anything?\u201d  \u201cMonsters are not a joke, Bella.\u201d  I stared at the headline again, and then up to his hard expression. \u201cA . . . avampire is doing this?\u201d I whispered.     He smiled without humor. His voice was low and cold. \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised, Bella, at how often my kind are the source behind the horrors in your human news. It\u2019s easy to recognize, when you know what to look for. The information here indicates a newborn vampire is loose in Seattle. <em>Bloodthirsty</em>, wild, out of control. The way we all were.\u201d  I let my gaze drop to the paper again, avoiding his eyes.     \u201cWe\u2019ve been monitoring the situation for a few weeks. All the signs are there \u2014 the unlikely disappearances, always in the night, the poorly disposed-of corpses, the lack of other evidence. . . . Yes, someone brand-new. And no one seems to be taking responsibility for the neophyte. . . .\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not our problem. We wouldn\u2019t even pay attention to the situation if wasn\u2019t going on so close to home. Like I said, this happens all the time. The existence of monsters results in monstrous consequences.\u201d      I tried not to see the names on the page, but they jumped out from the rest of the print like they were in bold. The five people whose lives were over, whose families were mourning now. It was different from considering murder in the abstract, reading those names. Maureen Gardiner, Geoffrey Campbell, Grace Razi, Michelle O\u2019Connell, Ronald Albrook. People who\u2019d had parents and children and friends and pets and jobs and hopes and plans and memories and futures. . . .  \u201cIt won\u2019t be the same for me,\u201d I whispered, half to myself. \u201cYou won\u2019t let me be like that. We\u2019ll live in Antarctica.\u201d     Edward snorted, breaking the tension. \u201cPenguins. Lovely.\u201d  I laughed a shaky laugh and knocked the paper off the table so I wouldn\u2019t have to see those names; it hit the linoleum with a thud. Of course Edward would consider the hunting possibilities. He and his \u201cvegetarian\u201d family \u2014 all committed to protecting human life \u2014 preferred the flavor of large predators for satisfying their dietary needs. \u201cAlaska, then, as planned. Only somewhere much more remote than Juneau \u2014 somewhere with grizzlies galore.\u201d  \u201cBetter,\u201d he allowed. \u201cThere are polar bears, too. Very fierce. And the wolves get quite large.\u201d      My mouth fell open and my breath blew out in a sharp gust.  \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked. Before I could recover, the confusion vanished and his whole body seemed to harden. \u201cOh. Never mind the wolves, then, if the idea is offensive to you.\u201d His voice was stiff, formal, his shoulders rigid.  \u201cHe was my best friend, Edward,\u201d I muttered. It stung to use the past tense. \u201cOf course the idea offends me.\u201d  \u201cPlease forgive my thoughtlessness,\u201d he said, still very formal. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have suggested that.\u201d  \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d I stared at my hands, clenched into a double fist on the table.  We were both silent for a moment, and then his cool finger was under my chin, coaxing my face up. His expression was much softer now.       \u201cSorry. Really.\u201d  \u201cI know. I know it\u2019s not the same thing. I shouldn\u2019t have reacted that way. It\u2019s just that . . . well, I was already thinking about Jacob before you came over.\u201d I hesitated. His tawny eyes seemed to get a little bit darker whenever I said Jacob\u2019s name. My voice turned pleading in response. \u201cCharlie says Jake is having a hard time. He\u2019s hurting right now, and . . . it\u2019s my fault.\u201d  \u201cYou\u2019ve done nothing wrong, Bella.\u201d  I took a deep breath. \u201cI need to make it better, Edward. I owe him that. And it\u2019s one of Charlie\u2019s conditions, anyway \u2014\u201d     His face changed while I spoke, turning hard again, statue-like.  \u201cYou know it\u2019s out of the question for you to be around a werewolf unprotected, Bella. And it would break the treaty if any of us cross over onto their land. Do you want us to start a war?\u201d  \u201cOf course not!\u201d  \u201cThen there\u2019s really no point in discussing the matter further.\u201d He dropped his hand and looked away, searching for a subject change. His eyes paused on something behind me, and he smiled, though his eyes stayed wary.  \u201cI\u2019m glad Charlie has decided to let you out \u2014 you\u2019re sadly in need of a visit to the bookstore. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re reading Wuthering Heights again. Don\u2019t you know it by heart yet?\u201d     \u201cNot all of us have photographic memories,\u201d I said curtly.  \u201cPhotographic memory or not, I don\u2019t understand why you like it. The characters are ghastly people who ruin each others\u2019 lives. I don\u2019t know how Heathcliff and Cathy ended up being ranked with couples like Romeo and Juliet or Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy. It isn\u2019t a love story, it\u2019s a hate story.\u201d     \u201cYou have some serious issues with the classics,\u201d I snapped.  \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s because I\u2019m not impressed by antiquity.\u201d He smiled, evidently satisfied that he\u2019d distracted me. \u201cHonestly, though, why do you read it over and over?\u201d His eyes were vivid with real interest now, trying \u2014 again \u2014 to unravel the convoluted workings of my mind. He reached across the table to cradle my face in his hand. \u201cWhat is it that appeals to you?\u201d    His sincere curiosity disarmed me. \u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d I said, scrambling for coherency while his gaze unintentionally scattered my thoughts. \u201cI think it\u2019s something about the inevitability. How nothing can keep them apart \u2014 not her selfishness, or his evil, or even death, in the end. . . .\u201d  His face was thoughtful as he considered my words. After a moment he smiled a teasing smile. \u201cI still think it would be a better story if either of them had one redeeming quality.\u201d     \u201cI think that may be the point,\u201d I disagreed. \u201cTheir love is their only redeeming quality.\u201d  \u201cI hope you have better sense than that \u2014 to fall in love with someone so . . . malignant.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s a bit late for me to worry about who I fall in love with,\u201d I pointed out. \u201cBut even without the warning, I seem to have managed fairly well.\u201d      He laughed quietly. \u201cI\u2019m glad you think so.\u201d  \u201cWell, I hope you\u2019re smart enough to stay away from someone so selfish. Catherine is really the source of all the trouble, not Heathcliff.\u201d  \u201cI\u2019ll be on my guard,\u201d he promised.  I sighed. He was so good at distractions.  I put my hand over his to hold it to my face. \u201cI need to see Jacob.\u201d  His eyes closed. \u201cNo.\u201d      \u201cIt\u2019s truly not dangerous at all,\u201d I said, pleading again. \u201cI used to spend all day in La Push with the whole lot of them, and nothing ever happened.\u201d  But I made a slip; my voice faltered at the end because I realized as I was saying the words that they were a lie. It was not true that nothing had ever happened. A brief flash of memory \u2014 an enormous gray wolf crouched to spring, baring his dagger-like teeth at me \u2014 had my palms sweating with an echo of remembered panic.  Edward heard my heart accelerate and nodded as if I\u2019d acknowledged the lie aloud. \u201cWerewolves are unstable. Sometimes, the people near them get hurt. Sometimes, they get killed.\u201d     I wanted to deny it, but another image slowed my rebuttal. I saw in my head the once beautiful face of Emily Young, now marred by a trio of dark scars that dragged down the corner of her right eye and left her mouth warped forever into a lopsided scowl.  He waited, grimly triumphant, for me to find my voice.  \u201cYou don\u2019t know them,\u201d I whispered.  \u201cI know them better than you think, Bella. I was here the last time.\u201d  \u201cThe last time?\u201d     \u201cWe started crossing paths with the wolves about seventy years ago. . . . We had just settled near Hoquiam. That was before Alice and Jasper were with us. We outnumbered them, but that wouldn\u2019t have stopped it from turning into a fight if not for Carlisle. He managed to convince Ephraim Black that coexisting was possible, and eventually we made the truce.\u201d  Jacob\u2019s great-grandfather\u2019s name startled me.    \u201cWe thought the line had died out with Ephraim,\u201d Edward muttered; it sounded like he was talking to himself now. \u201cThat the genetic quirk which allowed the transmutation had been lost. . . .\u201d He broke off and stared at me accusingly. \u201cYour bad luck seems to get more potent every day. Do you realize that your insatiable pull for all things deadly was strong enough to recover a pack of mutant canines from extinction? If we could bottle your luck, we\u2019d have a weapon of mass destruction on our hands.\u201d  I ignored the ribbing, my attention caught by his assumption \u2014 was he serious? \u201cBut I didn\u2019t bring them back. Don\u2019t you know?\u201d     \u201cKnow what?\u201d  \u201cMy bad luck had nothing to do with it. The werewolves came back because the vampires did.\u201d  Edward stared at me, his body motionless with surprise.  \u201cJacob told me that your family being here set things in motion. I thought you would already know. . . .\u201d  His eyes narrowed. \u201cIs that what they think?\u201d  \u201cEdward, look at the facts. Seventy years ago, you came here, and the werewolves showed up. You come back now, and the werewolves show up again. Do you think that\u2019s a coincidence?\u201d     He blinked and his glare relaxed. \u201cCarlisle will be interested in that theory.\u201d  \u201cTheory,\u201d I scoffed.  He was silent for a moment, staring out the window into the rain; I imagined he was contemplating the fact that his family\u2019s presence was turning the locals into giant dogs.  \u201cInteresting, but not exactly relevant,\u201d he murmured after a moment. \u201cThe situation remains the same.\u201d  I could translate that easily enough: no werewolf friends.  I knew I must be patient with Edward. It wasn\u2019t that he was unreasonable, it was just that he didn\u2019t understand. He had no idea how very much I owed Jacob Black \u2014 my life many times over, and possibly my sanity, too.     I didn\u2019t like to talk about that barren time with anyone, and especially not Edward. He had only been trying to save me when he\u2019d left, trying to save my soul. I didn\u2019t hold him responsible for all the stupid things I\u2019d done in his absence, or the pain I had suffered.  He did.  So I would have to word my explanation very carefully.  I got up and walked around the table. He opened his arms for me and I sat on his lap, nestling into his cool stone embrace. I looked at his hands while I spoke.    \u201cPlease just listen for a minute. This is so much more important than some whim to drop in on an old friend. Jacob is in pain.\u201d My voice distorted around the word. \u201cI can\u2019t not try to help him \u2014 I can\u2019t give up on him now, when he needs me. Just because he\u2019s not human all the time. . . . Well, he was there for me when I was . . . not so human myself. You don\u2019t know what it was like. . . .\u201d I hesitated. Edward\u2019s arms were rigid around me; his hands were in fists now, the tendons standing out. \u201cIf Jacob hadn\u2019t helped me . . . I\u2019m not sure what you would have come home to. I owe him better than this, Edward.\u201d     I looked up at his face warily. His eyes were closed, and his jaw was strained.  \u201cI\u2019ll never forgive myself for leaving you,\u201d he whispered. \u201cNot if I live a hundred thousand years.\u201d  I put my hand against his cold face and waited until he sighed and opened his eyes.  \u201cYou were just trying to do the right thing. And I\u2019m sure it would have worked with anyone less mental than me. Besides, you\u2019re here now. That\u2019s the part that matters.\u201d  \u201cIf I\u2019d never left, you wouldn\u2019t feel the need to go risk your life to comfort a dog .\u201d  I flinched. I was used to Jacob and all his derogatory slurs \u2014bloodsucker, leech, parasite . . . .    Somehow it sounded harsher in Edward\u2019s velvet voice.  \u201cI don\u2019t know how to phrase this properly,\u201d Edward said, and his tone was bleak. \u201cIt\u2019s going to sound cruel, I suppose. But I\u2019ve come too close to losing you in the past. I know what it feels like to think I have. I am not going to tolerate anything dangerous.\u201d  \u201cYou have to trust me on this. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d  His face was pained again. \u201cPlease, Bella,\u201d he whispered.  I stared into his suddenly burning golden eyes. \u201cPlease what?\u201d  \u201cPlease, for me. Please make a conscious effort to keep yourself safe. I\u2019ll do everything I can, but I would appreciate a little help.\u201d      \u201cI\u2019ll work on it,\u201d I murmured.  \u201cDo you really have any idea how important you are to me? Any concept at all of how much I love you?\u201d He pulled me tighter against his hard chest, tucking my head under his chin.  I pressed my lips against his snow-cold neck. \u201cI know how much I love you ,\u201d I answered.  \u201cYou compare one small tree to the entire forest.\u201d  I rolled my eyes, but he couldn\u2019t see. \u201cImpossible.\u201d  He kissed the top of my head and sighed.  \u201cNo werewolves.\u201d  \u201cI\u2019m not going along with that. I have to see Jacob.\u201d  \u201cThen I\u2019ll have to stop you.\u201d    He sounded utterly confident that this wouldn\u2019t be a problem.  I was sure he was right.  \u201cWe\u2019ll see about that,\u201d I bluffed anyway. \u201cHe\u2019s still my friend.\u201d  I could feel Jacob\u2019s note in my pocket, like it suddenly weighed ten pounds. I could hear the words in his voice, and he seemed to be agreeing with Edward \u2014 something that would never happen in reality.  Doesn\u2019t change anything. Sorry.",

            "en": "These violent delights have violent ends And in their triumph die, like fire and powder, Which, as they kiss, consume        These violent delights have violent ends, And in their triumph die, like fire and powder, Which, as they kiss, consume. Romeo and Juliet, Act II, Scene VI PREFACE I FELT LIKE I WAS TRAPPED IN ONE OF THOSE TERRIFYING nightmares, the one where you have to run, run till your lungs burst, but you can't make your body move fast enough. My legs seemed to move slower and slower as I fought my way through the callous crowd, but the hands on the huge clock tower didn't slow. With relentless, uncaring force, they turned inexorably toward the end \u2014the end of everything. But this was no dream, and, unlike the nightmare, I wasn't running for my life; I was racing to save something infinitely more precious. My own life meant little to me today. Alice had said there was a good chance we would both die here. Perhaps the outcome would be different if she weren't trapped by the brilliant sunlight; only I was free to run across this bright, crowded square. And I couldn't run fast enough. So it didn't matter to me that we were surrounded by our extraordinarily dangerous enemies. As the clock began to toll out the hour, vibrating under the soles of my sluggish feet, I knew I was too late\u2014and I was glad something <em>bloodthirsty</em> waited in the wings. For in failing at this, I forfeited any desire to live. The clock tolled again, and the sun beat down from the exact center point of the sky. 1. PARTY I WAS NINETY-NINE POINT NINE PERCENT SURE I WAS dreaming. The reasons I was so certain were that, first, I was standing in a bright shaft of sunlight\u2014the kind of blinding clear sun that never shone on my drizzly new hometown in Forks, Washington\u2014and second, I was looking at my Grandma Marie. Gran had been dead for six years now, so that was solid evidence toward the dream theory. Gran hadn't changed much; her face looked just the same as I remembered it. The skin was soft and withered, bent into a thousand tiny creases that clung gently to the bone underneath. Like a dried apricot, but with a puff of thick white hair standing out in a cloud around it. Our mouths\u2014hers a wizened picker \u2014spread into the same surprised half-smile at just the same time. Apparently, she hadn't been expecting to see me, either. I was about to ask her a question; I had so many\u2014What was she doing here in my dream? What had she been up to in the past six years? Was Pop okay, and had they found each other, wherever they were?\u2014but she opened her mouth when I did, so I stopped to let her go first. She paused, too, and then we both smiled at the little awkwardness. \"Bella!\" It wasn't Gran who called my name, and we both turned to see the addition to our small reunion. I didn't have to look to know who it was; this was a voice I would know anywhere\u2014know, and respond to, whether I was awake or asleep\u2026 or even dead, I'd bet. The voice I'd walk through fire for\u2014or, less dramatically, slosh every day through the cold and endless rain for. Edward. Even though I was always thrilled to see him\u2014 conscious or otherwise\u2014and even though I was almost positive that I was dreaming, I panicked as Edward walked toward us through the glaring sunlight. I panicked because Gran didn't know that I was in love with a vampire\u2014nobody knew that\u2014so how was I supposed to explain the fact that the brilliant sunbeams were shattering off his skin into a thousand rainbow shards like he was made of crystal or diamond? Well, Gran, you might have noticed that my boyfriend glitters. It's just something he does in the sun. Don't worry about it\u2026 What was he doing? The whole reason he lived in Forks, the rainiest place in the world, was so that he could be outside in the daytime without exposing his family's secret. Yet here he was, strolling gracefully toward me\u2014with the most beautiful smile on his angel's face\u2014as if I were the only one here. In that second, I wished that I was not the one exception to his mysterious talent; I usually felt grateful that I was the only person whose thoughts he couldn't hear just as clearly as if they were spoken aloud. But now I wished he could hear me, too, so that he could hear the warning I was screaming in my head. I shot a panicked glance back at Gran, and saw that it was too late. She was just turning to stare back at me, her eyes as alarmed as mine. Edward\u2014still smiling so beautifully that my heart felt like it was going to swell up and burst through my chest\u2014put his arm around my shoulder and turned to face my grandmother. Gran's expression surprised me. Instead of looking horrified, she was staring at me sheepishly, as if waiting for a scolding. And she was standing in such a strange position\u2014one arm held awkwardly away from her body, stretched out and then curled around the air. Like she had her arm around someone I couldn't see, someone invisible\u2026 Only then, as I looked at the bigger picture, did I notice the huge gilt frame that enclosed my grandmother's form. Uncomprehending, I raised the hand that wasn't wrapped around Edward's waist and reached out to touch her. She mimicked the movement exactly, mirrored it. But where our fingers should have met, there was nothing but cold glass\u2026 With a dizzying jolt, my dream abruptly became a nightmare. There was no Gran. That was me. Me in a mirror. Me\u2014ancient, creased, and withered. Edward stood beside me, casting no reflection, excruciatingly lovely and forever\u00a0 seventeen. He pressed his icy, perfect lips against my wasted cheek. \"Happy birthday,\" he whispered. I woke with a start \u2014my eyelids popping open wide\u2014and gasped. Dull gray light, the familiar light of an overcast morning, took the place of the blinding sun in my dream. Just a dream, I told myself. It was only a dream. I took a deep breath, and then jumped again when my alarm went off. The little calendar in the corner of the clock's display informed me that today was September thirteenth. Only a dream, but prophetic enough in one way, at least. Today was my birthday. I was officially eighteen years old. I'd been dreading this day for months. All through the perfect summer\u2014the happiest summer I had ever had, the happiest summer anyone anywhere had ever had, and the rainiest summer in the history of the Olympic Peninsula\u2014this bleak date had lurked in ambush, waiting to spring. And now that it had hit, it was even worse than I'd feared it would be. I could feel it\u2014I was older. Every day I got older, but this was different, worse, quantifiable. I was eighteen.  And Edward never would be. When I went to brush my teeth, I was almost surprised that the face in the mirror hadn't changed. I stared at myself, looking for some sign of impending wrinkles in my ivory skin. The only creases were the ones on my forehead, though, and I knew that if I could manage to relax, they would disappear. I couldn't. My eyebrows stayed lodged in a worried line over my anxious brown eyes. It was just a dream, I reminded myself again. Just a dream\u2026 but also my worst\u00a0 nightmare. I skipped breakfast, in a hurry to get out of the house as quickly as possible. I wasn't entirely able to avoid my dad, and so I had to spend a few minutes acting cheerful. I honestly tried to be excited about the gifts I'd asked him not to get me, but every time I had to smile, it felt like I might start crying. I struggled to get a grip on myself as I drove to school. The vision of Gran\u2014I would not think of it as me\u2014was hard to get out of my head. I couldn't feel anything but despair until I pulled into the familiar parking lot behind Forks High School and spotted Edward leaning motionlessly against his polished silver Volvo, like a marble tribute to some forgotten pagan god of beauty. The dream had not done him justice. And he was waiting there for me, just the same as every other day. Despair momentarily vanished; wonder took its place. Even after half a year with him, I still couldn't believe that I deserved this degree of good fortune. His sister Alice was standing by his side, waiting for me, too. Of course Edward and Alice weren't really related (in Forks the story was that all the Cullen siblings were adopted by Dr. Carlisle Culler and his wife, Esme, both plainly too young to have teenage children), but their skin was precisely the same pale shade, their eyes had the same strange golden tint, with the same deep, bruise-like shadows beneath them. Her face, like his, was also startlingly beautiful. To someone in the know\u2014someone like me\u2014these similarities marked them for what they were. The sight of Alice waiting there\u2014her tawny eyes brilliant with excitement, and a small silver-wrapped square in her hands\u2014made me frown. I'd told Alice I didn't want anything, anything, not gifts or even attention, for my birthday. Obviously, my wishes were being ignored. I slammed the door of my '53 Chevy truck\u2014a shower of rust specks fluttered down to the wet blacktop \u2014and walked slowly toward where they waited. Alice skipped forward to meet me, her pixie face glowing under her spiky black hair. \"Happy birthday, Bella!\" \"Shh!\" I hissed, glancing around the lot to make sure no one had heard her. The last thing I wanted was some kind of celebration of the black event. She ignored me. \"Do you want to open your present now or later?\" she asked eagerly as we made our way to where Edward still waited. \"No presents,\" I protested in a mumble. She finally seemed to process my mood. \"Okay\u2026 later, then. Did you like the scrapbook your mom sent you? And the camera from Charlie?\" I sighed. Of course she would know what my birthday presents were. Edward wasn't the only member of his family with unusual skills. Alice would have \"seen\" what my parents were planning as soon as they'd decided that themselves. \"Yeah. They're great.\" \"I think it's a nice idea. You're only a senior once. Might as well document the\u00a0 experience.\" \"How many times have you been a senior?\" \"That's different.\" We reached Edward then, and he held out his hand for mine. I took it eagerly, forgetting, for a moment, my glum mood. His skin was, as always, smooth, hard, and very cold. He gave my fingers a gentle squeeze. I looked into his liquid topaz eyes, and my heart gave a not-quite-so-gentle squeeze of its own. Hearing the stutter in my heartbeats, he smiled again. He lifted his free hand and traced one cool fingertip around the outside of my lips as he spoke. \"So, as discussed, I am not allowed to wish you a happy birthday, is that correct?\" \"Yes. That is correct.\" I could never quite mimic the flow of his perfect, formal articulation. It was something that could only be picked up in an earlier century. \"Just checking.\" He ran his hand through his tousled bronze hair. \"You might have changed your mind.\u00a0 Most people seem to enjoy things like birthdays and gifts.\" Alice laughed, and the sound was all silver, a wind chime. \"Of course you'll enjoy it. Everyone is supposed to be nice to you today and give you your way, Bella. What's the worst that could happen?\" She meant it as a rhetorical question. \"Getting older,\" I answered anyway, and my voice was not as steady as I wanted it to be. Beside me, Edward's smile tightened into a hard line. \"Eighteen isn't very old,\" Alice said. \"Don't women usually wait till they're twenty-nine to get upset over birthdays?\" \"It's older than Edward,\" I mumbled. He sighed. \"Technically,\" she said, keeping her tone light. \"Just by one little year, though.\" And I supposed\u2026 if I could be sure of the future I wanted, sure that I would get to spend forever with Edward, and Alice and the rest of the Cullens (preferably not as a wrinkled little old lady)\u2026 then a year or two one direction or the other wouldn't matter to me so much. But Edward was dead set against any future that changed me. Any future that made me like him\u2014that made me immortal, too. An impasse, he called it. I couldn't really see Edward's point, to be honest. What was so great about mortality? Being a vampire didn't look like such a terrible thing\u2014not the way the Cullens did it, anyway. \"What time will you be at the house?\" Alice continued, changing the subject. From her expression, she was up to exactly the kind of thing I'd been hoping to avoid. \"I didn't know I had plans to be there.\" \"Oh, be fair, Bella!\" she complained. \"You aren't going to ruin all our fun like that, are you?\" \"I thought my birthday was about what I want.\" \"I'll get her from Charlie's right after school,\" Edward told her, ignoring me altogether. \"I have to work,\" I protested. \"You don't, actually,\" Alice told me smugly. \"I already spoke to Mrs. Newton about it. She's trading your shifts. She said to tell you 'Happy Birthday.'\" \"I\u2014I still can't come over,\" I stammered, scrambling for an excuse. \"I, well, I haven't watched Romeo and Juliet yet for English.\" Alice snorted. \"You have Romeo and Juliet memorized.\" \"But Mr. Berty said we needed to see it performed to fully appreciate it\u2014that's how Shakespeare intended it to be presented.\" Edward rolled his eyes. \"You've already seen the movie,\" Alice accused. \"But not the nineteen-sixties version. Mr. Berty said it was the best.\" Finally, Alice lost the smug smile and glared at me. \"This can be easy, or this can be hard, Bella, but one way or the other\u2014\" Edward interrupted her threat. \"Relax, Alice. If Bella wants to watch a movie, then she can. It's her birthday.\" \"So there,\" I added. \u00a0\"I'll bring her over around seven,\" he continued. \"That will give you more time to set up.\" Alice's laughter chimed again. \"Sounds good. See you tonight, Bella! It'll be fun, you'll see.\" She grinned\u2014the wide smile exposed all her perfect, glistening teeth\u2014then pecked me on the cheek and danced off toward her first class before I could respond. \"Edward, please\u2014\" I started to beg, but he pressed one cool finger to my lips. \"Let's discuss it later. We're going to be late for class.\" No one bothered to stare at us as we took our usual seats in the back of the classroom (we had almost every class together now\u2014it was amazing the favors Edward could get the female administrators to do for him). Edward and I had been together too long now to be an object of gossip anymore. Even Mike Newton didn't bother to give me the glum stare that used to make me feel a little guilty. He smiled now instead, and I was glad he seemed to have accepted that we could only be friends. Mike had changed over the summer\u2014his face had lost some of the roundness, making his cheekbones more prominent, and he was wearing his pale blond hair a new way; instead of bristly, it was longer and gelled into a carefully casual disarray. It was easy to see where his inspiration came from\u2014but Edward's look wasn't something that could be achieved through imitation. As the day progressed, I considered ways to get out of whatever was going down at the Cullen house tonight. It would be bad enough to have to celebrate when I was in the mood to mourn. But, worse than that, this was sure to involve attention and gifts. Attention is never a good thing, as any other accident-prone klutz would agree. No one wants a spotlight when they're likely to fall on their face. And I'd very pointedly asked\u2014well, ordered really\u2014that no one give me any presents this year. It looked like Charlie and Renee weren't the only ones who had decided to overlook that. I'd never had much money, and that had never bothered me. Renee had raised me on a kindergarten teacher's salary. Charlie wasn't getting rich at his job, either\u2014he was the police chief here in the tiny town of Forks. My only personal income came from the three days a week I worked at the local sporting goods store. In a town this small, I was lucky to have a job. Every penny I made went into my microscopic college fund. (College was Plan B. I was still hoping for Plan A, but Edward was just so stubborn about leaving me human\u2026) Edward had a lot of money\u2014I didn't even want to think about how much. Money meant next to nothing to Edward or the rest of the Cullens. It was just something that accumulated when you had unlimited time on your hands and a sister who had an uncanny ability to predict trends in the stock market. Edward didn't seem to understand why I objected to him spending money on me\u2014why it made me uncomfortable if he took me to an expensive restaurant in Seattle, why he wasn't allowed to buy me a car that could reach speeds over fifty-five miles an hour, or why I wouldn't let him pay my college tuition (he was ridiculously enthusiastic about Plan B). Edward thought I was being unnecessarily difficult. But how could I let him give me things when I had nothing to reciprocate with? He, for some unfathomable reason, wanted to be with me. Anything he gave me on top of that just threw us more out of balance. As the day went on, neither Edward nor Alice brought my birthday up again, and I began to relax a little. We sat at our usual table for lunch. A strange kind of truce existed at that table. The three of us\u2014Edward, Alice, and I\u2014sat on the extreme southern end of the table. Now that the \"older\" and somewhat scarier (in Emmett's case, certainly) Cullen siblings had graduated, Alice and Edward did not seem quite so intimidating, and we did not sit here alone. My other friends, Mike and Jessica (who were in the awkward post-breakup friendship phase), Angela and Ben (whose relationship had survived the summer), Eric, Conner, Tyler, and Lauren (though that last one didn't really count in the friend category) all sat at the same table, on the other side of an invisible line. That line dissolved on sunny days when Edward and Alice always skipped school, and then the conversation would swell out effortlessly to include me.  Edward and Alice didn't find this minor ostracism odd or hurtful the way I would have. They barely noticed it. People always felt strangely ill at ease with the Cullens, almost afraid for some reason they couldn't explain to themselves. I was a rare exception to that rule. Sometimes it bothered Edward how very comfortable I was with being close to him. He thought he was hazardous to my health\u2014an opinion I rejected vehemently whenever he voiced it. \u00a0The afternoon passed quickly. School ended, and Edward walked me to my truck as he usually did. But this time, he held the passenger door open for me. Alice must have been taking his car home so that he could keep me from making a run for it. I folded my arms and made no move to get out of the rain. \"It's my birthday, don't I get to drive?\" \"I'm pretending it's not your birthday, just as you wished.\" \"If it's not my birthday, then I don't have to go to your house tonight\u2026\" \"All right.\" He shut the passenger door and walked past me to open the driver's side. \"Happy birthday.\" \"Shh,\" I shushed him halfheartedly. I climbed in the opened door, wishing he'd taken the other offer. Edward played with the radio while I drove, shaking his head in disapproval. \"Your radio has horrible reception.\" I frowned. I didn't like it when he picked on my truck. The truck was great\u2014it had\u00a0 personality. \"You want a nice stereo? Drive your own car.\" I was so nervous about Alice's plans, on top of my already gloomy mood, that the words came out sharper than I'd meant them. I was hardly ever bad-tempered with Edward, and my tone made him press his lips together to keep from smiling. When I parked in front of Charlie's house, he reached over to take my face in his hands. He handled me very carefully, pressing just the tips of his fingers softly against my temples, my cheekbones, my jaw line. Like I was especially breakable. Which was exactly the case\u2014compared with him, at least. \"You should be in a good mood, today of all days,\" he whispered. His sweet breath fanned across my face. \"And if I don't want to be in a good mood?\" I asked, my breathing uneven. His golden eyes smoldered. \"Too bad.\" My head was already spinning by the time he leaned closer and pressed his icy lips against mine. As he intended, no doubt, I forgot all about my worries, and concentrated on remembering how to inhale and exhale. His mouth lingered on mine, cold and smooth and gentle, until I wrapped my arms around his neck and threw myself into the kiss with a little too much enthusiasm. I could feel his lips curve upward as he let go of my face and reached back to unlock my grip on him. Edward had drawn many careful lines for our physical relationship, with the intent being to keep me alive. Though I respected the need for maintaining a safe distance between my skin and his razor-sharp, venom-coated teeth, I tended to forget about trivial things like that when he was kissing me. \"Be good, please,\" he breathed against my cheek. He pressed his lips gently to mine one more time and then pulled away, folding my arms across my stomach. My pulse was thudding in my ears. I put one hand over my heart. It drummed hyperactively under my palm. \u00a0\"Do you think I'll ever get better at this?\" I wondered, mostly to myself. \"That my heart might someday stop trying to jump out of my chest whenever you touch me?\" \"I really hope not,\" he said, a bit smug. I rolled my eyes. \"Let's go watch the Capulets and Montagues hack each other up, all right?\" \"Your wish, my command.\" Edward sprawled across the couch while I started the movie, fast-forwarding through the opening credits. When I perched on the edge of the sofa in front of him, he wrapped his arms around my waist and pulled me against his chest. It wasn't exactly as comfortable as a sofa cushion would be, what with his chest being hard and cold\u2014and perfect\u2014as an ice sculpture, but it was definitely preferable. He pulled the old afghan off the back of the couch and draped it over me so I wouldn't freeze beside his body. \"You know, I've never had much patience with Romeo,\" he commented as the movie started. \"What's wrong with Romeo?\" I asked, a little offended. Romeo was one of my favorite fictional characters. Until I'd met Edward, I'd sort of had a thing for him. \"Well, first of all, he's in love with this Rosaline\u2014don't you think it makes him seem a little fickle? And then, a few minutes after their wedding, he kills Juliet's cousin. That's not very brilliant. Mistake after mistake. Could he have destroyed his own happiness any more thoroughly?\" I sighed. \"Do you want me to watch this alone?\" \"No, I'll mostly be watching you, anyway.\" His fingers traced patterns across the skin of my arm, raising goose bumps. \"Will you cry?\" \"Probably,\" I admitted, \"if I'm paying attention.\" \"I won't distract you then.\" But I felt his lips on my hair, and it was very distracting. The movie eventually captured my interest, thanks in large part to Edward whispering Romeo's lines in my ear\u2014his irresistible, velvet voice made the actor's voice sound weak and coarse by comparison. And I did cry, to his amusement, when Juliet woke and found her new husband dead. \"I'll admit, I do sort of envy him here,\" Edward said, drying the tears with a lock of my hair. \"She's very pretty.\" He made a disgusted sound. \"I don't envy him the girl\u2014just the ease of the suicide,\" he clarified in a teasing tone. \"You humans have it so easy! All you have to do is throw down one tiny vial of plant extracts\u2026\" \"What?\" I gasped. \"It's something I had to think about once, and I knew from Carlisle's experience that it wouldn't be simple. I'm not even sure how many ways Carlisle tried to kill himself in the beginning\u2026 after he realized what he'd become\u2026\" His voice, which had grown serious, turned light again. \"And he's clearly still in excellent health.\" I twisted around so that I could read his face. \"What are you talking about?\" I demanded. \"What do you mean, this something you had to think about once?\" \"Last spring, when you were\u2026 nearly killed\u2026\" He paused to take a deep breath, snuggling to return to his teasing tone. \"Of course I was trying to focus on finding you alive, but part of my mind was making contingency plans. Like I said, it's not as easy for me as it is for a human.\" For one second, the memory of my last trip to Phoenix washed through my head and made me feel dizzy. I could see it all so clearly\u2014the blinding sun, the heat waves coming off the concrete as I ran with desperate haste to find the sadistic vampire who wanted to torture me to death. James, waiting in the mirrored room with my mother as his hostage\u2014or so I'd thought. I hadn't known it was all a ruse. Just as James hadn't known that Edward was racing to save me; Edward made it in time, but it had been a close one. Unthinkingly, my fingers traced the crescent-shaped scar on my hand that was always just a few degrees cooler than the rest of my skin. I shook my head\u2014as if I could shake away the bad memories\u2014and tried to grasp what Edward meant. My stomach plunged uncomfortably. \"Contingency plans?\" I repeated. \"Well, I wasn't going to live without you.\" He rolled his eyes as if that fact were\u00a0\u00a0 childishly obvious. \"But I wasn't sure how to do it\u2014I knew Emmett and Jasper would never help\u2026 so I was thinking maybe I would go to Italy and do something to provoke the Volturi.\" I didn't want to believe he was serious, but his golden eyes were brooding, focused on something far away in the distance as he contemplated ways to end his own life. Abruptly, I was furious. \"What is a Volturi?\" I demanded. \u00a0\"The Volturi are a family,\" he explained, his eyes still remote. \"A very old, very powerful family of our kind. They are the closest thing our world has to a royal family, I suppose. Carlisle lived with them briefly in his early years, in Italy, before he settled in America\u2014do you remember the story?\" \"Of course I remember.\" I would never forget the first time I'd gone to his home, the huge white mansion buried deep in the forest beside the river, or the room where Carlisle\u2014Edward's father in so many real ways\u2014kept a wall of paintings that illustrated his personal history. The most vivid, most wildly colorful canvas there, the largest, was from Carlisle's time in Italy. Of course I remembered the calm quartet of men, each with the exquisite face of a seraph, painted into the highest balcony overlooking the swirling mayhem of color. Though the painting was centuries old, Carlisle\u2014the blond angel\u2014remained unchanged. And I remembered the three others, Carlisle's early acquaintances. Edward had never used the name Volturi for the beautiful trio, two black-haired, one snow white. He'd called them Aro, Caius, and Marcus, nighttime patrons of the arts\u2026 \"Anyway, you don't irritate the Volturi,\" Edward went on, interrupting ray reverie. \"Not unless you want to die\u2014or whatever it is we do.\" His voice was so calm, it made him sound almost bored by the prospect. My anger turned to horror. I took his marble face between my hands and held it very tightly. \"You must never, never, never think of anything like that again!\" I said. \"No matter what might ever happen to me, you are not allowed to hurt yourself!\" \"I'll never put you in danger again, so it's a moot point.\" \"Put me in danger! I thought we'd established that all the bad luck is my fault?\" I was getting angrier.\u00a0 \"How dare you even think like that?\" The idea of Edward ceasing to exist, even if I were dead, was impossibly painful. \"What would you do, if the situation were reversed?\" he asked. \"That's not the same thing.\" He didn't seem to understand the difference. He chuckled. \"What if something did happen to you?\" I blanched at the thought. \"Would you want me to go off myself?\" A trace of pain touched his perfect features. \"I guess I see your point\u2026 a little,\" he admitted. \"But what would I do without you?\" \"Whatever you were doing before I came along and complicated your existence.\" He sighed. \"You make that sound so easy.\" \"It should be. I'm not really that interesting.\" He was about to argue, but then he let it go. \"Moot point,\" he reminded me. Abruptly, he pulled himself up into a more formal posture, shifting me to the side so that we were no longer touching. \"Charlie?\" I guessed. Edward smiled. After a moment, I heard the sound of the police cruiser pulling into the driveway. I reached out and took his hand firmly. My dad could deal with that much. Charlie came in with a pizza box in his hands. \"Hey, kids.\" He grinned at me. \"I thought you'd like a break from cooking and washing dishes for your birthday. Hungry?\" \"Sure. Thanks, Dad.\" Charlie didn't comment on Edward's apparent lack of appetite. He was used to Edward passing on dinner. \"Do you mind if I borrow Bella for the evening?\" Edward asked when Charlie and I were done. I looked at Charlie hopefully. Maybe he had some concept of birthdays as stay-at-home, family affairs\u2014this was my first birthday with him, the first birthday since my mom, Renee, had remarried and gone to live in Florida, so I didn't know what he would expect. \"That's fine\u2014the Mariners are playing the Sox tonight,\" Charlie explained, and my hope disappeared. \"So I won't be any kind of company\u2026 Here.\" He scooped up the camera he'd gotten me on Renee's suggestion (because I would need pictures to fill up my scrap-book), and threw it to me. He ought to know better than that\u2014I'd always been coordination ally challenged. The camera glanced off the tip of my finger, and tumbled toward the floor. Edward snagged it before it could crash onto the linoleum. \"Nice save,\" Charlie noted. \"If they're doing something fun at the Cullens' tonight, Bella, you should take some pictures. You know how your mother gets\u2014she'll be wanting to see the pictures faster than you can take them.\" \"Good idea, Charlie,\" Edward said, handing me the camera. I turned the camera on Edward, and snapped the first picture. \"It works.\" \"That's good. Hey, say hi to Alice for me. She hasn't been over in a while.\" Charlie's mouth pulled down at one corner. \"It's been three days, Dad,\" I reminded him. Charlie was crazy about Alice. He'd become attached last spring when she'd helped me through my awkward convalescence; Charlie would be forever grateful to her for saving him from the horror of an almost-adult daughter who needed help showering. \"I'll tell her.\" \"Okay. You kids have fun tonight.\" It was clearly a dismissal. Charlie was already edging toward the living room and the TV. Edward smiled, triumphant, and took my hand to pull me from the kitchen. When we got to the truck, he opened the passenger door for me again, and this time I didn't argue. I still had a hard time finding the obscure turnoff to his house in the dark. Edward drove north through Forks, visibly chafing at the speed limit enforced by my prehistoric Chevy. The engine groaned even louder than usual as he pushed it over fifty. \"Take it easy,\" I warned him. \"You know what you would love? A nice little Audi coupe. Very quiet, lots of power\u2026\" \"There's nothing wrong with my truck. And speaking of expensive nonessentials, if you know what's good for you, you didn't spend any money on birthday presents.\" \"Not a dime,\" he said virtuously. \"Good.\" \"Can you do me a favor?\" \"That depends on what it is.\" He sighed, his lovely face serious. \"Bella, the last real birthday any of us had was Emmett in 1935. Cut us a little slack, and don't be too difficult tonight. They're all very excited.\" It always startled me a little when he brought up things like that. \"Fine, I'll behave.\" \"I probably should warn you\u2026\" \"Please do.\" \"When I say they're all excited\u2026 I do mean all of them.\" \"Everyone?\" I choked. \"I thought Emmett and Rosalie were in Africa.\" The rest of Forks was under the impression that the older Cullens had gone off to college this year, to Dartmouth, but I knew better. \"Emmett wanted to be here.\" \"But\u2026 Rosalie?\" \"I know, Bella. Don't worry, she'll be on her best behavior.\" I didn't answer. Like I could just not worry, that easy. Unlike Alice, Edward's other \"adopted\" sister, the golden blond and exquisite Rosalie, didn't like me much. Actually, the feeling was a little bit stronger than just dislike. As far as Rosalie was concerned, I was an unwelcome intruder into her family's secret life. I felt horribly guilty about the present situation, guessing that Rosalie and Emmett's prolonged absence was my fault, even as I furtively enjoyed not having to see her Emmett, Edward's playful bear of a brother, I did miss. He was in many ways just like the big brother I'd always wanted\u2026 only much, much more terrifying. Edward decided to change the subject. \"So, if you won't let me get you the Audi, isn't there anything that you'd like for your birthday?\" The words came out in a whisper. \"You know what I want.\" A deep frown carved creases into his marble forehead. He obviously wished he'd stuck to the subject of Rosalie. It felt like we'd had this argument a lot today. \"Not tonight, Bella. Please.\" \"Well, maybe Alice will give me what I want.\" Edward growled\u2014a deep, menacing sound. \"This isn't going to be your last birthday, Bella,\" he vowed. \"That's not fair!\" I thought I heard his teeth clench together. We were pulling up to the house now. Bright light shined from every window on the first two floors. A long line of glowing Japanese lanterns hung from the porch eaves, reflecting a soft radiance on the huge cedars that surrounded the house. Big bowls of flowers\u2014pink roses\u2014lined the wide stairs up to the front doors. I moaned. Edward took a few deep breaths to calm himself. \"This is a party,\" he reminded me. \"Try to be a good sport.\" \"Sure,\" I muttered. He came around to get my door, and offered me his hand. \"I have a question.\" He waited warily. \"If I develop this film,\" I said, toying with the camera in my hands, \"will you show up in the picture?\" Edward started laughing. He helped me out of the car, pulled me up the stairs, and was still laughing as he opened the door for me. They were all waiting in the huge white living room; when I walked through the door, they greeted me with a loud chorus of \"Happy birthday, Bella!\" while I blushed and looked down. Alice, I assumed, had covered every flat surface with pink candles and dozens of crystal bowls filled with hundreds of roses. There was a table with a white cloth draped over it next to Edward's grand piano, holding a pink birthday cake, more roses, a stack of glass plates, and a small pile of silver-wrapped presents. It was a hundred times worse than I'd imagined. Edward, sensing my distress, wrapped an encouraging arm around my waist and kissed the top of my head. Edward's parents, Carlisle and Esme\u2014impossibly youthful and lovely as ever\u2014were the closest to the door. Esme hugged me carefully, her soft, caramel-colored hair brushing against my cheek as she kissed my forehead, and then Carlisle put his arm around my shoulders. \"Sorry about this, Bella,\" he stage-whispered. \"We couldn't rein Alice in.\" Rosalie and Emmett stood behind them. Rosalie didn't smile, but at least she didn't glare. Emmett's face was stretched into a huge grin. It had been months since I'd seen them; I'd forgotten how gloriously beautiful Rosalie was\u2014it almost hurt to look at her. And had Emmett always been so\u2026 big? \"You haven't changed at all,\" Emmett said with mock disappointment. \"I expected a perceptible difference, but here you are, red-faced just like always.\" \"Thanks a lot, Emmett,\" I said, blushing deeper. He laughed, \"I have to step out for a second\"\u2014he paused to wink conspicuously at Alice\u2014\"Don't do anything funny while I'm gone.\" \"I'll try.\" Alice let go of Jasper's hand and skipped forward, all her teeth sparkling in the bright light. Jasper smiled, too, but kept his distance. He leaned, long and blond, against the post at the foot of the stairs. During the days we'd had to spend cooped up together in Phoenix, I'd thought he'd gotten over his aversion to me. But he'd gone back to exactly how he'd acted before\u2014avoiding me as much as possible\u2014the moment he was free from that temporary obligation to protect me. I knew it wasn't personal, just a precaution, and I tried not to be overly sensitive about it. Jasper had more trouble sticking to the Cullens' diet than the rest of them; the scent of human blood was much harder for him to resist than the others\u2014he hadn't been trying as long. \"Time to open presents,\" Alice declared. She put her cool hand under my elbow and towed me to the table with the cake and the shiny packages. I put on my best martyr face. \"Alice, I know I told you I didn't want anything\u2014\" \"But I didn't listen,\" she interrupted, smug. \"Open it.\" She took the camera from my hands and replaced it with a big, square silver box. The box was so light that it felt empty. The tag on top said that it was from Emmett, Rosalie, and Jasper. Self-consciously, I tore the paper off and then stared at the box it concealed. It was something electrical, with lots of numbers in the name. I opened the box, hoping for further illumination. But the box was empty. \"Um\u2026 thanks.\" Rosalie actually cracked a smile. Jasper laughed. \"It's a stereo for your truck,\" he explained. \"Emmett's installing it right now so that you can't return it.\" Alice was always one step ahead of me. \"Thanks, Jasper, Rosalie,\" I told them, grinning as I remembered Edward's complaints about my radio this afternoon\u2014all a setup, apparently. \"Thanks, Emmett!\" I called more loudly. I heard his booming laugh from my truck, and I couldn't help laughing, too. \"Open mine and Edward's next,\" Alice said, so excited her voice was a high-pitched trill. She held a small, flat square in her hand. I turned to give Edward a basilisk glare. \"You promised.\" Before he could answer, Emmett bounded through the door. \"Just in time!\" he crowed. He pushed in behind Jasper, who had also drifted closer than usual to get a good look. \"I didn't spend a dime,\" Edward assured me. He brushed a strand of hair from my face, leaving my skin tingling from his touch. I inhaled deeply and turned to Alice. \"Give it to me,\" I sighed. Emmett chuckled with delight. I took the little package, rolling my eyes at Edward while I stuck my finger under the edge of the paper and jerked it under the tape. \"Shoot,\" I muttered when the paper sliced my finger; I pulled it out to examine the damage. A single drop of blood oozed from the tiny cut. It all happened very quickly then. \"No!\" Edward roared. He threw himself at me, flinging me back across the table. It fell, as I did, scattering the cake and the presents, the flowers and the plates. I landed in the mess of shattered crystal. Jasper slammed into Edward, and the sound was like the crash of boulders in a rock slide. There was another noise, a grisly snarling that seemed to be coming from deep in Jasper's chest. Jasper tried to shove past Edward, snapping his teeth just inches from Edward's face. Emmett grabbed Jasper from behind in the next second, locking him into his massive steel grip, but Jasper struggled on, his wild, empty eyes focused only on me. Beyond the shock, there was also pain. I'd tumbled down to the floor by the piano, with my arms thrown out instinctively to catch my fall, into the jagged shards of glass. Only now did I feel the searing, stinging pain that ran from my wrist to the crease inside my elbow. Dazed and disoriented, I looked up from the bright red blood pulsing out of my arm\u2014into the fevered eyes of the six suddenly ravenous vampires.",
