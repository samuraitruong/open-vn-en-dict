            "en": "14         714. MIND OVER MATTER He could drive well, when he kept the speed reasonable, I had to admit.  Like so many things, it seemed to be effortless to him. He barely looked at the road, yet the tires never deviated so much as a centimeter from the center of the lane. He drove one-handed, holding my hand on the seat. Sometimes he gazed into the setting sun, sometimes he glanced at me \u2014 my face, my hair blowing out the open window, our hands twined together. He had turned the radio to an oldies station, and he sang along with a song I'd never heard. He knew every line. \"You like fifties music?\" I asked.  \"Music in the fifties was good. Much better than the sixties, or the seventies, ugh!\" He shuddered. \"The eighties were bearable.\" \"Are you ever going to tell me how old you are?\" I asked, tentative, not wanting to upset his buoyant humor. \"Does it matter much?\" His smile, to my relief, remained unclouded. \"No, but I still wonder\u2026\" I grimaced. \"There's nothing like an unsolved mystery to keep you up at night.\" \"I wonder if it will upset you,\" he reflected to himself. He gazed into the sun; the minutes passed. \"Try me,\" I finally said. He sighed, and then looked into my eyes, seeming to forget the road completely for a time. Whatever he saw there must have encouraged him. He looked into the sun \u2014 the light of the setting orb glittered off his skin in ruby-tinged sparkles \u2014 and spoke.  \"I was born in Chicago in 1901.\" He paused and glanced at me from the corner of his eyes. My face was carefully unsurprised, patient for the rest. He smiled a tiny smile and continued. \"Carlisle found me in a hospital in the summer of 1918. I was seventeen, and dying of the Spanish influenza.\" He heard my intake of breath, though it was barely audible to my own ears. He looked down into my eyes again. \"I don't remember it well \u2014 it was a very long time ago, and human memories fade.\" He was lost in his thoughts for a short time before he went on. \"I do remember how it felt, when Carlisle saved me. It's not an easy thing, not something you could forget.\" \"Your parents?\" \"They had already died from the disease. I was alone. That was why he chose me. In all the chaos of the epidemic, no one would ever realize I was gone.\" \"How did he\u2026 save you?\" A few seconds passed before he answered. He seemed to choose his words carefully. \"It was difficult. Not many of us have the restraint necessary to accomplish it. But Carlisle has always been the most humane, the most compassionate of us\u2026 I don't think you could find his equal throughout all of history.\" He paused. \"For me, it was merely very, very painful.\" I could tell from the set of his lips, he would say no more on this subject. I suppressed my curiosity, though it was far from idle. There were many things I needed to think through on this particular issue, things that were only beginning to occur to me. No doubt his quick mind had already comprehended every aspect that eluded me.  His soft voice interrupted my thoughts. \"He acted from loneliness. That's usually the reason behind the choice. I was the first in Carlisle's family, though he found Esme soon after. She fell from a cliff. They brought her straight to the hospital morgue, though, somehow, her heart was still beating.\" \"So you must be dying, then, to become\u2026\" We never said the word, and I couldn't frame it now. \"No, that's just Carlisle. He would never do that to someone who had another choice.\" The respect in his voice was profound whenever he spoke of his father figure. \"It is easier he says, though,\" he continued, \"if the blood is weak.\" He looked at the now-dark road, and I could feel the subject closing again. \"And Emmett and Rosalie?\" \"Carlisle brought Rosalie to our family next. I didn't realize till much later that he was hoping she would be to me what Esme was to him \u2014 he was careful with his thoughts around me.\" He rolled his eyes. \"But she was never more than a sister. It was only two years later that she found Emmett. She was hunting \u2014 we were in Appalachia at the time \u2014 and found a bear about to finish him off. She carried him back to Carlisle, more than a hundred miles, afraid she wouldn't be able to do it herself. I'm only beginning to guess how difficult that journey was for her.\" He threw a pointed glance in my direction, and raised our hands, still folded together, to brush my cheek with the back of his hand. \"But she made it,\" I encouraged, looking away from the unbearable beauty of his eyes. \"Yes,\" he murmured. \"She saw something in his face that made her strong enough. And they've been together ever since. Sometimes they live separately from us, as a married couple. But the younger we pretend to be, the longer we can stay in any given place. Forks seemed perfect, so we all enrolled in high school.\" He laughed. \"I suppose we'll have to go to their wedding in a few years, again.\" \"Alice and Jasper?\" \"Alice and Jasper are two very rare creatures. They both developed a conscience, as we refer to it, with no outside guidance. Jasper belonged to another\u2026 family, a very different kind of family. He became depressed, and he wandered on his own. Alice found him. Like me, she has certain gifts above and beyond the norm for our kind.\" \"Really?\" I interrupted, fascinated. \"But you said you were the only one who could hear people's thoughts.\" \"That's true. She knows other things. She sees things \u2014 things that might happen, things that are coming. But it's very subjective. The future isn't set in stone. Things change.\" His jaw set when he said that, and his eyes darted to my face and away so quickly that I wasn't sure if I only imagined it. \"What kinds of things does she see?\" \"She saw Jasper and knew that he was looking for her before he knew it himself. She saw Carlisle and our family, and they came together to find us. She's most sensitive to non-humans. She always sees, for example, when another group of our kind is coming near. And any threat they may pose.\" \"Are there a lot of\u2026 your kind?\" I was surprised. How many of them could walk among us undetected? \"No, not many. But most won't settle in any one place. Only those like us, who've given up hunting you people\" \u2014 a sly glance in my direction \u2014 \"can live together with humans for any length of time. We've only found one other family like ours, in a small village in Alaska. We lived together for a time, but there were so many of us that we became too noticeable. Those of us who live\u2026 differently tend to band together.\"  \"And the others?\" \"Nomads, for the most part. We've all lived that way at times. It gets tedious, like anything else. But we run across the others now and then, because most of us prefer the North.\" \"Why is that?\" We were parked in front of my house now, and he'd turned off the truck.  It was very quiet and dark; there was no moon. The porch light was off so I knew my father wasn't home yet.  \"Did you have your eyes open this afternoon?\" he teased. \"Do you think I could walk down the street in the sunlight without causing traffic accidents? There's a reason why we chose the Olympic Peninsula, one of the most sunless places in the world. It's nice to be able to go outside in the day. You wouldn't believe how tired you can get of nighttime in eighty-odd years.\" \"So that's where the legends came from?\" \"Probably.\" \"And Alice came from another family, like Jasper?\" \"No, and that is a mystery. Alice doesn't remember her human life at all.  And she doesn't know who created her. She awoke alone. Whoever made her walked away, and none of us understand why, or how, he could. If she hadn't had that other sense, if she hadn't seen Jasper and Carlisle and known that she would someday become one of us, she probably would have turned into a total savage.\" There was so much to think through, so much I still wanted to ask. But, to my great embarrassment, my stomach growled. I'd been so intrigued, I hadn't even noticed I was hungry. I realized now that I was ravenous.  \"I'm sorry, I'm keeping you from dinner.\" \"I'm fine, really.\" \"I've never spent much time around anyone who eats food. I forget.\" \"I want to stay with you.\" It was easier to say in the darkness, knowing as I spoke how my voice would betray me, my hopeless addiction to him.  \"Can't I come in?\" he asked. \"Would you like to?\" I couldn't picture it, this godlike creature sitting in my father's shabby kitchen chair. \"Yes, if it's all right.\" I heard the door close quietly, and almost simultaneously he was outside my door, opening it for me. \"Very human,\" I complimented him. \"It's definitely resurfacing.\" He walked beside me in the night, so quietly I had to peek at him constantly to be sure he was still there. In the darkness he looked much more normal. Still pale, still dreamlike in his beauty, but no longer the fantastic sparkling creature of our sunlit afternoon. He reached the door ahead of me and opened it for me. I paused halfway through the frame. \"The door was unlocked?\" \"No, I used the key from under the eave.\" I stepped inside, flicked on the porch light, and turned to look at him with my eyebrows raised. I was sure I'd never used that key in front of him. \"I was curious about you.\" \"You spied on me?\" But somehow I couldn't infuse my voice with the proper outrage. I was flattered. He was unrepentant. \"What else is there to do at night?\" I let it go for the moment and went down the hall to the kitchen. He was there before me, needing no guide. He sat in the very chair I'd tried to picture him in. His beauty lit up the kitchen. It was a moment before I could look away. I concentrated on getting my dinner, taking last night's lasagna from the fridge, placing a square on a plate, heating it in the microwave. It revolved, filling the kitchen with the smell of tomatoes and oregano. I didn't take my eyes from the plate of food as I spoke. \"How often?\" I asked casually. \"Hmmm?\" He sounded as if I had pulled him from some other train of thought. I still didn't turn around. \"How often did you come here?\" \"I come here almost every night.\" I whirled, stunned. \"Why?\" \"You're interesting when you sleep.\" He spoke matter-of-factly. \"You talk.\" \"No!\" I gasped, heat flooding my face all the way to my hairline. I gripped the kitchen counter for support. I knew I talked in my sleep, of course; my mother teased me about it. I hadn't thought it was something I needed to worry about here, though. His expression shifted instantly to chagrin. \"Are you very angry with me?\" \"That depends!\" I felt and sounded like I'd had the breath knocked out of me. He waited. \"On?\" he urged. \"What you heard!\" I wailed. Instantly, silently, he was at my side, taking my hands carefully in his.  \"Don't be upset!\" he pleaded. He dropped his face to the level of my eyes, holding my gaze. I was embarrassed. I tried to look away.  \"You miss your mother,\" he whispered. \"You worry about her. And when it rains, the sound makes you restless. You used to talk about home a lot, but it's less often now. Once you said, 'It's too green.'\" He laughed softly, hoping, I could see, not to offend me further. \"Anything else?\" I demanded. He knew what I was getting at. \"You did say my name,\" he admitted. I sighed in defeat. \"A lot?\" \"How much do you mean by 'a lot,' exactly?\" \"Oh no!\" I hung my head. He pulled me against his chest, softly, naturally. \"Don't be self-conscious,\" he whispered in my ear. \"If I could dream at all, it would be about you. And I'm not ashamed of it.\" Then we both heard the sound of tires on the brick driveway, saw the headlights flash through the front windows, down the hall to us. I stiffened in his arms. \"Should your father know I'm here?\" he asked. \"I'm not sure\u2026\" I tried to think it through quickly. \"Another time then\u2026\" And I was alone. \"Edward!\" I hissed. I heard a ghostly chuckle, then nothing else. My father's key turned in the door. \"Bella?\" he called. It had bothered me before; who else would it be? Suddenly he didn't seem so far off base. \"In here.\" I hoped he couldn't hear the hysterical edge to my voice. I grabbed my dinner from the microwave and sat at the table as he walked in. His footsteps sounded so noisy after my day with Edward.  \"Can you get me some of that? I'm bushed.\" He stepped on the heels of his boots to take them off, holding the back of Edward's chair for support. I took my food with me, scarfing it down as I got his dinner. It burned my tongue. I filled two glasses with milk while his lasagna was heating, and gulped mine to put out the fire. As I set the glass down, I noticed the milk trembling and realized my hand was shaking. Charlie sat in the chair, and the contrast between him and its former occupant was comical. \"Thanks,\" he said as I placed his food on the table. \"How was your day?\" I asked. The words were rushed; I was dying to escape to my room. \"Good. The fish were biting\u2026 how about you? Did you get everything done that you wanted to?\" \"Not really \u2014 it was too nice out to stay indoors.\" I took another big bite. \"It was a nice day,\" he agreed. What an understatement, I thought to myself. Finished with the last bite of lasagna, I lifted my glass and chugged the remains of my milk. Charlie surprised me by being observant. \"In a hurry?\" \"Yeah, I'm tired. I'm going to bed early.\" \"You look kinda keyed up,\" he noted. Why, oh why, did this have to be his night to pay attention? \"Do I?\" was all I could manage in response. I quickly scrubbed my dishes clean in the sink, and placed them upside down on a dish towel to dry. \"It's Saturday,\" he mused. I didn't respond. \"No plans tonight?\" he asked suddenly. \"No, Dad, I just want to get some sleep.\" \"None of the boys in town your type, eh?\" He was suspicious, but trying to play it cool. \"No, none of the boys have caught my eye yet.\" I was careful not to over-emphasize the word boys in my quest to be truthful with Charlie. \"I thought maybe that Mike Newton\u2026 you said he was friendly.\" \"He's Just a friend, Dad.\" \"Well, you're too good for them all, anyway. Wait till you get to college to start looking.\" Every father's dream, that his daughter will be out of the house before the hormones kick in. \"Sounds like a good idea to me,\" I agreed as I headed up the stairs. \"'Night, honey,\" he called after me. No doubt he would be listening carefully all evening, waiting for me to try to sneak out. \"See you in the morning, Dad.\" See you creeping into my room tonight at midnight to check on me. I worked to make my tread sound slow and tired as I walked up the stairs to my room. I shut the door loud enough for him to hear, and then sprinted on my tiptoes to the window. I threw it open and leaned out into the night. My eyes scanned the darkness, the impenetrable shadows of the trees. \"Edward?\" I whispered, feeling completely idiotic. The quiet, laughing response came from behind me. \"Yes?\" I whirled, one hand flying to my throat in surprise. He lay, smiling hugely, across my bed, his hands behind his head, his feet dangling off the end, the picture of ease. \"Oh!\" I breathed, sinking unsteadily to the floor.  \"I'm sorry.\" He pressed his lips together, trying to hide his amusement. \"Just give me a minute to restart my heart.\" He sat up slowly, so as not to startle me again. Then he leaned forward and reached out with his long arms to pick me up, gripping the tops of my arms like I was a toddler. He sat me on the bed beside him. \"Why don't you sit with me,\" he suggested, putting a cold hand on mine. \"How's the heart?\" \"You tell me \u2014 I'm sure you hear it better than I do.\" I felt his quiet laughter shake the bed. We sat there for a moment in silence, both listening to my heartbeat slow. I thought about having Edward in my room, with my father in the house. \"Can I have a minute to be human?\" I asked. \"Certainly.\" He gestured with one hand that I should proceed. \"Stay,\" I said, trying to look severe. \"Yes, ma'am.\" And he made a show of becoming a statue on the edge of my bed. I hopped up, grabbing my pajamas from off the floor, my bag of toiletries off the desk. I left the light off and slipped out, closing the door. I could hear the sound from the TV rising up the stairs. I banged the bathroom door loudly, so Charlie wouldn't come up to bother me. I meant to hurry. I brushed my teeth fiercely, trying to be thorough and speedy, removing all traces of lasagna. But the hot water of the shower couldn't be rushed. It unknotted the muscles in my back, calmed my pulse. The familiar smell of my shampoo made me feel like I might be the same person I had been this morning. I tried not to think of Edward, sitting in my room, waiting, because then I had to start all over with the calming process. Finally, I couldn't delay anymore. I shut off the water, toweling hastily, rushing again. I pulled on my holey t-shirt and gray sweatpants. Too late to regret not packing the Victoria's Secret silk pajamas my mother got me two birthdays ago, which still had the tags on them in a drawer somewhere back home. I rubbed the towel through my hair again, and then yanked the brush through it quickly. I threw the towel in the hamper, flung my brush and toothpaste into my bag. Then I dashed down the stairs so Charlie could see that I was in my pajamas, with wet hair. \"'Night, Dad.\" \"'Night, Bella.\" He did look startled by my appearance. Maybe that would keep him from checking on me tonight. I took the stairs two at a time, trying to be quiet, and flew into my room, closing the door tightly behind me. Edward hadn't moved a fraction of an inch, a carving of Adonis perched on my faded quilt. I smiled, and his lips twitched, the statue coming to life. His eyes appraised me, taking in the damp hair, the tattered shirt. He raised one eyebrow. \"Nice.\" I grimaced. \"No, it looks good on you.\" \"Thanks,\" I whispered. I went back to his side, sitting cross-legged beside him. I looked at the lines in the wooden floor. \"What was all that for?\" \"Charlie thinks I'm sneaking out.\" \"Oh.\" He contemplated that. \"Why?\" As if he couldn't know Charlie's mind much more clearly than I could guess. \"Apparently, I look a little overexcited.\" He lifted my chin, examining my face. \"You look very warm, actually.\" He bent his face slowly to mine, laying his cool cheek against my skin. I held perfectly still. \"Mmmmmm\u2026\" he breathed. It was very difficult, while he was touching me, to frame a coherent question. It took me a minute of scattered concentration to begin. \"It seems to be\u2026 much easier for you, now, to be close to me.\" \"Does it seem that way to you?\" he murmured, his nose gliding to the corner of my jaw. I felt his hand, lighter than a moth's wing, brushing my damp hair back, so that his lips could touch the hollow beneath my ear. \"Much, much easier,\" I said, trying to exhale. \"Hmm.\" \"So I was wondering\u2026\" I began again, but his fingers were slowly tracing my collarbone, and I lost my train of thought. \"Yes?\" he breathed. \"Why is that,\" my voice shook, embarrassing me, \"do you think?\" I felt the tremor of his breath on my neck as he laughed. \"Mind over matter.\" I pulled back; as I moved, he froze \u2014 and I could no longer hear the sound of his breathing. We stared cautiously at each other for a moment, and then, as his clenched jaw gradually relaxed, his expression became puzzled. \"Did I do something wrong?\" \"No \u2014 the opposite. You're driving me crazy,\" I explained.  He considered that briefly, and when he spoke, he sounded pleased. \"Really?\" A triumphant smile slowly lit his face. \"Would you like a round of applause?\" I asked sarcastically. He grinned. \"I'm just pleasantly surprised,\" he clarified. \"In the last hundred years or so,\" his voice was teasing, \"I never imagined anything like this. I didn't believe I would ever find someone I wanted to be with\u2026 in another way than my brothers and sisters. And then to find, even though it's all new to me, that I'm good at it\u2026 at being with you\u2026\" \"You're good at everything,\" I pointed out. He shrugged, allowing that, and we both laughed in whispers. \"But how can it be so easy now?\" I pressed. \"This afternoon\u2026\" \"It's not easy,\" he sighed. \"But this afternoon, I was still\u2026 undecided. I am sorry about that, it was unforgivable for me to behave so.\" \"Not unforgivable,\" I disagreed. \"Thank you.\" He smiled. \"You see,\" he continued, looking down now, \"I wasn't sure if I was strong enough\u2026\" He picked up one of my hands and pressed it lightly to his face. \"And while there was still that possibility that I might be\u2026 overcome\" \u2014 he breathed in the scent at my wrist \u2014 \"I was\u2026 susceptible. Until I made up my mind that I was strong enough, that there was no possibility at all that I would\u2026 that I ever could\u2026\" I'd never seen him struggle so hard for words. It was so\u2026 human. \"So there's no possibility now?\" \"Mind over matter,\" he repeated, smiling, his teeth bright even in the darkness. \"Wow, that was easy,\" I said. He threw back his head and laughed, quietly as a whisper, but still exuberantly. \"Easy for you!\" he amended, touching my nose with his fingertip. And then his face was abruptly serious. \"I'm trying,\" he whispered, his voice pained. \"If it gets to be\u2026 too much, I'm fairly sure I'll be able to leave.\" I scowled. I didn't like the talk of leaving. \"And it will be harder tomorrow,\" he continued. \"I've had the scent of you in my head all day, and I've grown amazingly desensitized. If I'm away from you for any length of time, I'll have to start over again. Not quite from scratch, though, I think.\" \"Don't go away, then,\" I responded, unable to hide the longing in my voice. \"That suits me,\" he replied, his face relaxing into a gentle smile. \"Bring on the shackles \u2014 I'm your prisoner.\" But his long hands formed manacles around my wrists as he spoke. He laughed his quiet, musical laugh. He'd laughed more tonight than I'd ever heard in all the time I'd spent with him. \"You seem more\u2026 optimistic than usual,\" I observed. \"I haven't seen you like this before.\" \"Isn't it supposed to be like this?\" He smiled. \"The glory of first love, and all that. It's incredible, isn't it, the difference between reading about something, seeing it in the pictures, and experiencing it?\" \"Very different,\" I agreed. \"More forceful than I'd imagined.\" \"For example\" \u2014 his words flowed swiftly now, I had to concentrate to catch it all \u2014 \"the emotion of jealousy. I've read about it a hundred thousand times, seen actors portray it in a thousand different plays and movies. I believed I understood that one pretty clearly. But it shocked me\u2026\" He grimaced. \"Do you remember the day that Mike asked you to the dance?\" I nodded, though I remembered that day for a different reason. \"The day you started talking to me again.\" \"I was surprised by the flare of resentment, almost fury, that I felt \u2014 I didn't recognize what it was at first. I was even more aggravated than usual that I couldn't know what you were thinking, why you refused him. Was it simply for your friend's sake? Was there someone else? I knew I had no right to care either way. I tried not to care. \"And then the line started forming,\" he chuckled. I scowled in the darkness. \"I waited, unreasonably anxious to hear what you would say to them, to watch your expressions. I couldn't deny the relief I felt, watching the annoyance on your face. But I couldn't be sure. \"That was the first night I came here. I wrestled all night, while watching you sleep, with the chasm between what I knew was right, moral, ethical, and what I wanted. I knew that if I continued to ignore you as I should, or if I left for a few years, till you were gone, that someday you would say yes to Mike, or someone like him. It made me angry. \"And then,\" he whispered, \"as you were sleeping, you said my name. You spoke so clearly, at first I thought you'd woken. But you rolled over restlessly and mumbled my name once more, and sighed. The feeling that coursed through me then was unnerving, staggering. And I knew I couldn't ignore you any longer.\" He was silent for a moment, probably listening to the suddenly uneven pounding of my heart. \"But jealousy\u2026 it's a strange thing. So much more powerful than I would have thought. And irrational! Just now, when Charlie asked you about that vile Mike Newton\u2026\" He shook his head angrily. \"I should have known you'd be listening,\" I groaned. \"Of course.\" \"That made you feel jealous, though, really?\" \"I'm new at this; you're resurrecting the human in me, and everything feels stronger because it's fresh.\" \"But honestly,\" I teased, \"for that to bother you, after I have to hear that Rosalie \u2014 Rosalie, the incarnation of pure beauty, Rosalie \u2014 was meant for you. Emmett or no Emmett, how can I compete with that?\" \"There's no competition.\" His teeth gleamed. He drew my trapped hands around his back, holding me to his chest. I kept as still as I could, even breathing with caution. \"I know there's no competition,\" I mumbled into his cold skin. \"That's the problem.\" \"Of course Rosalie is beautiful in her way, but even if she wasn't like a sister to me, even if Emmett didn't belong with her, she could never have one tenth, no, one hundredth of the attraction you hold for me.\" He was serious now, thoughtful. \"For almost ninety years I've walked among my kind, and yours\u2026 all the time thinking I was complete in myself, not realizing what I was seeking. And not finding anything, because you weren't alive yet.\" \"It hardly seems fair,\" I whispered, my face still resting on his chest, listening to his breath come and go. \"I haven't had to wait at all. Why should I get off so easily?\" \"You're right,\" he agreed with amusement. \"I should make this harder for you, definitely.\" He freed one of his hands, released my wrist, only to gather it carefully into his other hand. He stroked my wet hair softly, from the top of my head to my waist. \"You only have to risk your life every second you spend with me, that's surely not much. You only have to turn your back on nature, on humanity\u2026 what's that worth?\" \"Very little \u2014 I don't feel deprived of anything.\" \"Not yet.\" And his voice was abruptly full of ancient grief. I tried to pull back, to look in his face, but his hand locked my wrists in an unbreakable hold. \"What \u2014\" I started to ask, when his body became alert. I froze, but he suddenly released my hands, and disappeared. I narrowly avoided falling on my face. \"Lie down!\" he hissed. I couldn't tell where he spoke from in the darkness. I rolled under my quilt, balling up on my side, the way I usually slept. I heard the door crack open, as Charlie peeked in to make sure I was where I was supposed to be. I breathed evenly, exaggerating the movement. A long minute passed. I listened, not sure if I'd heard the door close. Then Edward's cool arm was around me, under the covers, his lips at my ear. \"You are a terrible actress \u2014 I'd say that career path is out for you.\" \"Darn it,\" I muttered. My heart was crashing in my chest. He hummed a melody I didn't recognize; it sounded like a lullaby. He paused. \"Should I sing you to sleep?\" \"Right,\" I laughed. \"Like I could sleep with you here!\" \"You do it all the time,\" he reminded me. \"But I didn't know you were here,\" I replied icily. \"So if you don't want to sleep\u2026\" he suggested, ignoring my tone. My breath caught. \"If I don't want to sleep\u2026 ?\" He chuckled. \"What do you want to do then?\" I couldn't answer at first. \"I'm not sure,\" I finally said. \"Tell me when you decide.\" I could feel his cool breath on my neck, feel his nose sliding along my jaw, inhaling. \"I thought you were desensitized.\" \"Just because I'm resisting the wine doesn't mean I can't appreciate the bouquet,\" he whispered. \"You have a very floral smell, like lavender\u2026 or freesia,\" he noted. \"It's mouthwatering.\" \"Yeah, it's an off day when I don't get somebody telling me how edible I smell.\" He chuckled, and then sighed. \"I've decided what I want to do,\" I told him. \"I want to hear more about you.\" \"Ask me anything.\" I sifted through my questions for the most vital. \"Why do you do it?\" I said. \"I still don't understand how you can work so hard to resist what you\u2026 are. Please don't misunderstand, of course I'm glad that you do. I just don't see why you would bother in the first place.\" He hesitated before answering. \"That's a good question, and you are not the first one to ask it. The others \u2014 the majority of our kind who are quite content with our lot \u2014 they, too, wonder at how we live. But you see, just because we've been\u2026 dealt a certain hand\u2026 it doesn't mean that we can't choose to rise above \u2014 to conquer the boundaries of a destiny that none of us wanted. To try to retain whatever essential humanity we can.\" I lay unmoving, locked in awed silence. \"Did you fall asleep?\" he whispered after a few minutes. \"No.\" \"Is that all you were curious about?\" I rolled my eyes. \"Not quite.\" \"What else do you want to know?\" \"Why can you read minds \u2014 why only you? And Alice, seeing the future\u2026 why does that happen?\" I felt him shrug in the darkness. \"We don't really know. Carlisle has a theory\u2026 he believes that we all bring something of our strongest human traits with us into the next life, where they are intensified \u2014 like our minds, and our senses. He thinks that I must have already been very sensitive to the thoughts of those around me. And that Alice had some precognition, wherever she was.\" \"What did he bring into the next life, and the others?\" \"Carlisle brought his compassion. Esme brought her ability to love passionately. Emmett brought his strength, Rosalie her\u2026 tenacity. Or you could call it pigheadedness.\" he chuckled. \"Jasper is very interesting. He was quite charismatic in his first life, able to influence those around him to see things his way. Now he is able to manipulate the emotions of those around him \u2014 calm down a room of angry people, for example, or excite a lethargic crowd, conversely. It's a very subtle gift.\" I considered the impossibilities he described, trying to take it in. He waited patiently while I thought. \"So where did it all start? I mean, Carlisle changed you, and then someone must have changed him, and so on\u2026\" \"Well, where did you come from? Evolution? Creation? Couldn't we have evolved in the same way as other species, predator and prey? Or, if you don't believe that all this world could have just happened on its own, which is hard for me to accept myself, is it so hard to believe that the same force that created the delicate angelfish with the shark, the baby seal and the killer whale, could create both our kinds together?\" \"Let me get this straight \u2014 I'm the baby seal, right?\" \"Right.\" He laughed, and something touched my hair \u2014 his lips? I wanted to turn toward him, to see if it was really his lips against my hair. But I had to be good; I didn't want to make this any harder for him than it already was. \"Are you ready to sleep?\" he asked, interrupting the short silence. \"Or do you have any more questions?\" \"Only a million or two.\" \"We have tomorrow, and the next day, and the next\u2026\" he reminded me. I smiled, euphoric at the thought.  \"Are you sure you won't vanish in the morning?\" I wanted this to be certain. \"You are mythical, after all.\" \"I won't leave you.\" His voice had the seal of a promise in it. \"One more, then, tonight\u2026\" And I blushed. The darkness was no help \u2014 I'm sure he could feel the sudden warmth under my skin. \"What is it?\" \"No, forget it. I changed my mind.\" \"Bella, you can ask me anything.\" I didn't answer, and he groaned. \"I keep thinking it will get less frustrating, not hearing your thoughts. But it just gets worse and worse.\" \"I'm glad you can't read my thoughts. It's bad enough that you eavesdrop on my sleep-talking.\" \"Please?\" His voice was so persuasive, so impossible to resist. I shook my head. \"If you don't tell me, I'll just assume it's something much worse than it is,\" he threatened darkly. \"Please?\" Again, that pleading voice. \"Well,\" I began, glad that he couldn't see my face. \"Yes?\" \"You said that Rosalie and Emmett will get married soon\u2026 Is that\u2026 marriage\u2026 the same as it is for humans?\" He laughed in earnest now, understanding. \"Is that what you're getting at?\" I fidgeted, unable to answer. \"Yes, I suppose it is much the same,\" he said. \"I told you, most of those human desires are there, just hidden behind more powerful desires.\" \"Oh,\" was all I could say. \"Was there a purpose behind your curiosity?\" \"Well, I did wonder\u2026 about you and me\u2026 someday\u2026\" He was instantly serious, I could tell by the sudden stillness of his body. I froze, too, reacting automatically. \"I don't think that\u2026 that\u2026 would be possible for us.\" \"Because it would be too hard for you, if I were that\u2026 close?\" \"That's certainly a problem. But that's not what I was thinking of. It's just that you are so soft, so fragile. I have to mind my actions every moment that we're together so that I don't hurt you. I could kill you quite easily, Bella, simply by accident.\" His voice had become just a soft murmur. He moved his icy palm to rest it against my cheek. \"If I was too hasty\u2026 if for one second I wasn't paying enough attention, I could reach out, meaning to touch your face, and crush your skull by mistake. You don't realize how incredibly <em>breakable</em> you are. I can never, never afford to lose any kind of control when I'm with you.\" He waited for me to respond, growing anxious when I didn't. \"Are you scared?\" he asked. I waited for a minute to answer, so the words would be true. \"No. I'm fine.\" He seemed to deliberate for a moment. \"I'm curious now, though,\" he said, his voice light again. \"Have you ever\u2026 ?\" He trailed off suggestively. \"Of course not.\" I flushed. \"I told you I've never felt like this about anyone before, not even close.\" \"I know. It's just that I know other people's thoughts. I know love and lust don't always keep the same company.\" \"They do for me. Now, anyway, that they exist for me at all,\" I sighed. \"That's nice. We have that one thing in common, at least.\" He sounded satisfied. \"Your human instincts\u2026\" I began. He waited. \"Well, do you find me attractive, in that way, at all?\" He laughed and lightly rumpled my nearly dry hair.  \"I may not be a human, but I am a man,\" he assured me. I yawned involuntarily. \"I've answered your questions, now you should sleep,\" he insisted. \"I'm not sure if I can.\" \"Do you want me to leave?\" \"No!\" I said too loudly. He laughed, and then began to hum that same, unfamiliar lullaby; the voice of an archangel, soft in my ear. More tired than I realized, exhausted from the long day of mental and emotional stress like I'd never felt before, I drifted to sleep in his cold arms.",

            "en": "These violent delights have violent ends And in their triumph die, like fire and powder, Which, as they kiss, consume        These violent delights have violent ends, And in their triumph die, like fire and powder, Which, as they kiss, consume. Romeo and Juliet, Act II, Scene VI PREFACE I FELT LIKE I WAS TRAPPED IN ONE OF THOSE TERRIFYING nightmares, the one where you have to run, run till your lungs burst, but you can't make your body move fast enough. My legs seemed to move slower and slower as I fought my way through the callous crowd, but the hands on the huge clock tower didn't slow. With relentless, uncaring force, they turned inexorably toward the end \u2014the end of everything. But this was no dream, and, unlike the nightmare, I wasn't running for my life; I was racing to save something infinitely more precious. My own life meant little to me today. Alice had said there was a good chance we would both die here. Perhaps the outcome would be different if she weren't trapped by the brilliant sunlight; only I was free to run across this bright, crowded square. And I couldn't run fast enough. So it didn't matter to me that we were surrounded by our extraordinarily dangerous enemies. As the clock began to toll out the hour, vibrating under the soles of my sluggish feet, I knew I was too late\u2014and I was glad something bloodthirsty waited in the wings. For in failing at this, I forfeited any desire to live. The clock tolled again, and the sun beat down from the exact center point of the sky. 1. PARTY I WAS NINETY-NINE POINT NINE PERCENT SURE I WAS dreaming. The reasons I was so certain were that, first, I was standing in a bright shaft of sunlight\u2014the kind of blinding clear sun that never shone on my drizzly new hometown in Forks, Washington\u2014and second, I was looking at my Grandma Marie. Gran had been dead for six years now, so that was solid evidence toward the dream theory. Gran hadn't changed much; her face looked just the same as I remembered it. The skin was soft and withered, bent into a thousand tiny creases that clung gently to the bone underneath. Like a dried apricot, but with a puff of thick white hair standing out in a cloud around it. Our mouths\u2014hers a wizened picker \u2014spread into the same surprised half-smile at just the same time. Apparently, she hadn't been expecting to see me, either. I was about to ask her a question; I had so many\u2014What was she doing here in my dream? What had she been up to in the past six years? Was Pop okay, and had they found each other, wherever they were?\u2014but she opened her mouth when I did, so I stopped to let her go first. She paused, too, and then we both smiled at the little awkwardness. \"Bella!\" It wasn't Gran who called my name, and we both turned to see the addition to our small reunion. I didn't have to look to know who it was; this was a voice I would know anywhere\u2014know, and respond to, whether I was awake or asleep\u2026 or even dead, I'd bet. The voice I'd walk through fire for\u2014or, less dramatically, slosh every day through the cold and endless rain for. Edward. Even though I was always thrilled to see him\u2014 conscious or otherwise\u2014and even though I was almost positive that I was dreaming, I panicked as Edward walked toward us through the glaring sunlight. I panicked because Gran didn't know that I was in love with a vampire\u2014nobody knew that\u2014so how was I supposed to explain the fact that the brilliant sunbeams were shattering off his skin into a thousand rainbow shards like he was made of crystal or diamond? Well, Gran, you might have noticed that my boyfriend glitters. It's just something he does in the sun. Don't worry about it\u2026 What was he doing? The whole reason he lived in Forks, the rainiest place in the world, was so that he could be outside in the daytime without exposing his family's secret. Yet here he was, strolling gracefully toward me\u2014with the most beautiful smile on his angel's face\u2014as if I were the only one here. In that second, I wished that I was not the one exception to his mysterious talent; I usually felt grateful that I was the only person whose thoughts he couldn't hear just as clearly as if they were spoken aloud. But now I wished he could hear me, too, so that he could hear the warning I was screaming in my head. I shot a panicked glance back at Gran, and saw that it was too late. She was just turning to stare back at me, her eyes as alarmed as mine. Edward\u2014still smiling so beautifully that my heart felt like it was going to swell up and burst through my chest\u2014put his arm around my shoulder and turned to face my grandmother. Gran's expression surprised me. Instead of looking horrified, she was staring at me sheepishly, as if waiting for a scolding. And she was standing in such a strange position\u2014one arm held awkwardly away from her body, stretched out and then curled around the air. Like she had her arm around someone I couldn't see, someone invisible\u2026 Only then, as I looked at the bigger picture, did I notice the huge gilt frame that enclosed my grandmother's form. Uncomprehending, I raised the hand that wasn't wrapped around Edward's waist and reached out to touch her. She mimicked the movement exactly, mirrored it. But where our fingers should have met, there was nothing but cold glass\u2026 With a dizzying jolt, my dream abruptly became a nightmare. There was no Gran. That was me. Me in a mirror. Me\u2014ancient, creased, and withered. Edward stood beside me, casting no reflection, excruciatingly lovely and forever\u00a0 seventeen. He pressed his icy, perfect lips against my wasted cheek. \"Happy birthday,\" he whispered. I woke with a start \u2014my eyelids popping open wide\u2014and gasped. Dull gray light, the familiar light of an overcast morning, took the place of the blinding sun in my dream. Just a dream, I told myself. It was only a dream. I took a deep breath, and then jumped again when my alarm went off. The little calendar in the corner of the clock's display informed me that today was September thirteenth. Only a dream, but prophetic enough in one way, at least. Today was my birthday. I was officially eighteen years old. I'd been dreading this day for months. All through the perfect summer\u2014the happiest summer I had ever had, the happiest summer anyone anywhere had ever had, and the rainiest summer in the history of the Olympic Peninsula\u2014this bleak date had lurked in ambush, waiting to spring. And now that it had hit, it was even worse than I'd feared it would be. I could feel it\u2014I was older. Every day I got older, but this was different, worse, quantifiable. I was eighteen.  And Edward never would be. When I went to brush my teeth, I was almost surprised that the face in the mirror hadn't changed. I stared at myself, looking for some sign of impending wrinkles in my ivory skin. The only creases were the ones on my forehead, though, and I knew that if I could manage to relax, they would disappear. I couldn't. My eyebrows stayed lodged in a worried line over my anxious brown eyes. It was just a dream, I reminded myself again. Just a dream\u2026 but also my worst\u00a0 nightmare. I skipped breakfast, in a hurry to get out of the house as quickly as possible. I wasn't entirely able to avoid my dad, and so I had to spend a few minutes acting cheerful. I honestly tried to be excited about the gifts I'd asked him not to get me, but every time I had to smile, it felt like I might start crying. I struggled to get a grip on myself as I drove to school. The vision of Gran\u2014I would not think of it as me\u2014was hard to get out of my head. I couldn't feel anything but despair until I pulled into the familiar parking lot behind Forks High School and spotted Edward leaning motionlessly against his polished silver Volvo, like a marble tribute to some forgotten pagan god of beauty. The dream had not done him justice. And he was waiting there for me, just the same as every other day. Despair momentarily vanished; wonder took its place. Even after half a year with him, I still couldn't believe that I deserved this degree of good fortune. His sister Alice was standing by his side, waiting for me, too. Of course Edward and Alice weren't really related (in Forks the story was that all the Cullen siblings were adopted by Dr. Carlisle Culler and his wife, Esme, both plainly too young to have teenage children), but their skin was precisely the same pale shade, their eyes had the same strange golden tint, with the same deep, bruise-like shadows beneath them. Her face, like his, was also startlingly beautiful. To someone in the know\u2014someone like me\u2014these similarities marked them for what they were. The sight of Alice waiting there\u2014her tawny eyes brilliant with excitement, and a small silver-wrapped square in her hands\u2014made me frown. I'd told Alice I didn't want anything, anything, not gifts or even attention, for my birthday. Obviously, my wishes were being ignored. I slammed the door of my '53 Chevy truck\u2014a shower of rust specks fluttered down to the wet blacktop \u2014and walked slowly toward where they waited. Alice skipped forward to meet me, her pixie face glowing under her spiky black hair. \"Happy birthday, Bella!\" \"Shh!\" I hissed, glancing around the lot to make sure no one had heard her. The last thing I wanted was some kind of celebration of the black event. She ignored me. \"Do you want to open your present now or later?\" she asked eagerly as we made our way to where Edward still waited. \"No presents,\" I protested in a mumble. She finally seemed to process my mood. \"Okay\u2026 later, then. Did you like the scrapbook your mom sent you? And the camera from Charlie?\" I sighed. Of course she would know what my birthday presents were. Edward wasn't the only member of his family with unusual skills. Alice would have \"seen\" what my parents were planning as soon as they'd decided that themselves. \"Yeah. They're great.\" \"I think it's a nice idea. You're only a senior once. Might as well document the\u00a0 experience.\" \"How many times have you been a senior?\" \"That's different.\" We reached Edward then, and he held out his hand for mine. I took it eagerly, forgetting, for a moment, my glum mood. His skin was, as always, smooth, hard, and very cold. He gave my fingers a gentle squeeze. I looked into his liquid topaz eyes, and my heart gave a not-quite-so-gentle squeeze of its own. Hearing the stutter in my heartbeats, he smiled again. He lifted his free hand and traced one cool fingertip around the outside of my lips as he spoke. \"So, as discussed, I am not allowed to wish you a happy birthday, is that correct?\" \"Yes. That is correct.\" I could never quite mimic the flow of his perfect, formal articulation. It was something that could only be picked up in an earlier century. \"Just checking.\" He ran his hand through his tousled bronze hair. \"You might have changed your mind.\u00a0 Most people seem to enjoy things like birthdays and gifts.\" Alice laughed, and the sound was all silver, a wind chime. \"Of course you'll enjoy it. Everyone is supposed to be nice to you today and give you your way, Bella. What's the worst that could happen?\" She meant it as a rhetorical question. \"Getting older,\" I answered anyway, and my voice was not as steady as I wanted it to be. Beside me, Edward's smile tightened into a hard line. \"Eighteen isn't very old,\" Alice said. \"Don't women usually wait till they're twenty-nine to get upset over birthdays?\" \"It's older than Edward,\" I mumbled. He sighed. \"Technically,\" she said, keeping her tone light. \"Just by one little year, though.\" And I supposed\u2026 if I could be sure of the future I wanted, sure that I would get to spend forever with Edward, and Alice and the rest of the Cullens (preferably not as a wrinkled little old lady)\u2026 then a year or two one direction or the other wouldn't matter to me so much. But Edward was dead set against any future that changed me. Any future that made me like him\u2014that made me immortal, too. An impasse, he called it. I couldn't really see Edward's point, to be honest. What was so great about mortality? Being a vampire didn't look like such a terrible thing\u2014not the way the Cullens did it, anyway. \"What time will you be at the house?\" Alice continued, changing the subject. From her expression, she was up to exactly the kind of thing I'd been hoping to avoid. \"I didn't know I had plans to be there.\" \"Oh, be fair, Bella!\" she complained. \"You aren't going to ruin all our fun like that, are you?\" \"I thought my birthday was about what I want.\" \"I'll get her from Charlie's right after school,\" Edward told her, ignoring me altogether. \"I have to work,\" I protested. \"You don't, actually,\" Alice told me smugly. \"I already spoke to Mrs. Newton about it. She's trading your shifts. She said to tell you 'Happy Birthday.'\" \"I\u2014I still can't come over,\" I stammered, scrambling for an excuse. \"I, well, I haven't watched Romeo and Juliet yet for English.\" Alice snorted. \"You have Romeo and Juliet memorized.\" \"But Mr. Berty said we needed to see it performed to fully appreciate it\u2014that's how Shakespeare intended it to be presented.\" Edward rolled his eyes. \"You've already seen the movie,\" Alice accused. \"But not the nineteen-sixties version. Mr. Berty said it was the best.\" Finally, Alice lost the smug smile and glared at me. \"This can be easy, or this can be hard, Bella, but one way or the other\u2014\" Edward interrupted her threat. \"Relax, Alice. If Bella wants to watch a movie, then she can. It's her birthday.\" \"So there,\" I added. \u00a0\"I'll bring her over around seven,\" he continued. \"That will give you more time to set up.\" Alice's laughter chimed again. \"Sounds good. See you tonight, Bella! It'll be fun, you'll see.\" She grinned\u2014the wide smile exposed all her perfect, glistening teeth\u2014then pecked me on the cheek and danced off toward her first class before I could respond. \"Edward, please\u2014\" I started to beg, but he pressed one cool finger to my lips. \"Let's discuss it later. We're going to be late for class.\" No one bothered to stare at us as we took our usual seats in the back of the classroom (we had almost every class together now\u2014it was amazing the favors Edward could get the female administrators to do for him). Edward and I had been together too long now to be an object of gossip anymore. Even Mike Newton didn't bother to give me the glum stare that used to make me feel a little guilty. He smiled now instead, and I was glad he seemed to have accepted that we could only be friends. Mike had changed over the summer\u2014his face had lost some of the roundness, making his cheekbones more prominent, and he was wearing his pale blond hair a new way; instead of bristly, it was longer and gelled into a carefully casual disarray. It was easy to see where his inspiration came from\u2014but Edward's look wasn't something that could be achieved through imitation. As the day progressed, I considered ways to get out of whatever was going down at the Cullen house tonight. It would be bad enough to have to celebrate when I was in the mood to mourn. But, worse than that, this was sure to involve attention and gifts. Attention is never a good thing, as any other accident-prone klutz would agree. No one wants a spotlight when they're likely to fall on their face. And I'd very pointedly asked\u2014well, ordered really\u2014that no one give me any presents this year. It looked like Charlie and Renee weren't the only ones who had decided to overlook that. I'd never had much money, and that had never bothered me. Renee had raised me on a kindergarten teacher's salary. Charlie wasn't getting rich at his job, either\u2014he was the police chief here in the tiny town of Forks. My only personal income came from the three days a week I worked at the local sporting goods store. In a town this small, I was lucky to have a job. Every penny I made went into my microscopic college fund. (College was Plan B. I was still hoping for Plan A, but Edward was just so stubborn about leaving me human\u2026) Edward had a lot of money\u2014I didn't even want to think about how much. Money meant next to nothing to Edward or the rest of the Cullens. It was just something that accumulated when you had unlimited time on your hands and a sister who had an uncanny ability to predict trends in the stock market. Edward didn't seem to understand why I objected to him spending money on me\u2014why it made me uncomfortable if he took me to an expensive restaurant in Seattle, why he wasn't allowed to buy me a car that could reach speeds over fifty-five miles an hour, or why I wouldn't let him pay my college tuition (he was ridiculously enthusiastic about Plan B). Edward thought I was being unnecessarily difficult. But how could I let him give me things when I had nothing to reciprocate with? He, for some unfathomable reason, wanted to be with me. Anything he gave me on top of that just threw us more out of balance. As the day went on, neither Edward nor Alice brought my birthday up again, and I began to relax a little. We sat at our usual table for lunch. A strange kind of truce existed at that table. The three of us\u2014Edward, Alice, and I\u2014sat on the extreme southern end of the table. Now that the \"older\" and somewhat scarier (in Emmett's case, certainly) Cullen siblings had graduated, Alice and Edward did not seem quite so intimidating, and we did not sit here alone. My other friends, Mike and Jessica (who were in the awkward post-breakup friendship phase), Angela and Ben (whose relationship had survived the summer), Eric, Conner, Tyler, and Lauren (though that last one didn't really count in the friend category) all sat at the same table, on the other side of an invisible line. That line dissolved on sunny days when Edward and Alice always skipped school, and then the conversation would swell out effortlessly to include me.  Edward and Alice didn't find this minor ostracism odd or hurtful the way I would have. They barely noticed it. People always felt strangely ill at ease with the Cullens, almost afraid for some reason they couldn't explain to themselves. I was a rare exception to that rule. Sometimes it bothered Edward how very comfortable I was with being close to him. He thought he was hazardous to my health\u2014an opinion I rejected vehemently whenever he voiced it. \u00a0The afternoon passed quickly. School ended, and Edward walked me to my truck as he usually did. But this time, he held the passenger door open for me. Alice must have been taking his car home so that he could keep me from making a run for it. I folded my arms and made no move to get out of the rain. \"It's my birthday, don't I get to drive?\" \"I'm pretending it's not your birthday, just as you wished.\" \"If it's not my birthday, then I don't have to go to your house tonight\u2026\" \"All right.\" He shut the passenger door and walked past me to open the driver's side. \"Happy birthday.\" \"Shh,\" I shushed him halfheartedly. I climbed in the opened door, wishing he'd taken the other offer. Edward played with the radio while I drove, shaking his head in disapproval. \"Your radio has horrible reception.\" I frowned. I didn't like it when he picked on my truck. The truck was great\u2014it had\u00a0 personality. \"You want a nice stereo? Drive your own car.\" I was so nervous about Alice's plans, on top of my already gloomy mood, that the words came out sharper than I'd meant them. I was hardly ever bad-tempered with Edward, and my tone made him press his lips together to keep from smiling. When I parked in front of Charlie's house, he reached over to take my face in his hands. He handled me very carefully, pressing just the tips of his fingers softly against my temples, my cheekbones, my jaw line. Like I was especially <em>breakable</em>. Which was exactly the case\u2014compared with him, at least. \"You should be in a good mood, today of all days,\" he whispered. His sweet breath fanned across my face. \"And if I don't want to be in a good mood?\" I asked, my breathing uneven. His golden eyes smoldered. \"Too bad.\" My head was already spinning by the time he leaned closer and pressed his icy lips against mine. As he intended, no doubt, I forgot all about my worries, and concentrated on remembering how to inhale and exhale. His mouth lingered on mine, cold and smooth and gentle, until I wrapped my arms around his neck and threw myself into the kiss with a little too much enthusiasm. I could feel his lips curve upward as he let go of my face and reached back to unlock my grip on him. Edward had drawn many careful lines for our physical relationship, with the intent being to keep me alive. Though I respected the need for maintaining a safe distance between my skin and his razor-sharp, venom-coated teeth, I tended to forget about trivial things like that when he was kissing me. \"Be good, please,\" he breathed against my cheek. He pressed his lips gently to mine one more time and then pulled away, folding my arms across my stomach. My pulse was thudding in my ears. I put one hand over my heart. It drummed hyperactively under my palm. \u00a0\"Do you think I'll ever get better at this?\" I wondered, mostly to myself. \"That my heart might someday stop trying to jump out of my chest whenever you touch me?\" \"I really hope not,\" he said, a bit smug. I rolled my eyes. \"Let's go watch the Capulets and Montagues hack each other up, all right?\" \"Your wish, my command.\" Edward sprawled across the couch while I started the movie, fast-forwarding through the opening credits. When I perched on the edge of the sofa in front of him, he wrapped his arms around my waist and pulled me against his chest. It wasn't exactly as comfortable as a sofa cushion would be, what with his chest being hard and cold\u2014and perfect\u2014as an ice sculpture, but it was definitely preferable. He pulled the old afghan off the back of the couch and draped it over me so I wouldn't freeze beside his body. \"You know, I've never had much patience with Romeo,\" he commented as the movie started. \"What's wrong with Romeo?\" I asked, a little offended. Romeo was one of my favorite fictional characters. Until I'd met Edward, I'd sort of had a thing for him. \"Well, first of all, he's in love with this Rosaline\u2014don't you think it makes him seem a little fickle? And then, a few minutes after their wedding, he kills Juliet's cousin. That's not very brilliant. Mistake after mistake. Could he have destroyed his own happiness any more thoroughly?\" I sighed. \"Do you want me to watch this alone?\" \"No, I'll mostly be watching you, anyway.\" His fingers traced patterns across the skin of my arm, raising goose bumps. \"Will you cry?\" \"Probably,\" I admitted, \"if I'm paying attention.\" \"I won't distract you then.\" But I felt his lips on my hair, and it was very distracting. The movie eventually captured my interest, thanks in large part to Edward whispering Romeo's lines in my ear\u2014his irresistible, velvet voice made the actor's voice sound weak and coarse by comparison. And I did cry, to his amusement, when Juliet woke and found her new husband dead. \"I'll admit, I do sort of envy him here,\" Edward said, drying the tears with a lock of my hair. \"She's very pretty.\" He made a disgusted sound. \"I don't envy him the girl\u2014just the ease of the suicide,\" he clarified in a teasing tone. \"You humans have it so easy! All you have to do is throw down one tiny vial of plant extracts\u2026\" \"What?\" I gasped. \"It's something I had to think about once, and I knew from Carlisle's experience that it wouldn't be simple. I'm not even sure how many ways Carlisle tried to kill himself in the beginning\u2026 after he realized what he'd become\u2026\" His voice, which had grown serious, turned light again. \"And he's clearly still in excellent health.\" I twisted around so that I could read his face. \"What are you talking about?\" I demanded. \"What do you mean, this something you had to think about once?\" \"Last spring, when you were\u2026 nearly killed\u2026\" He paused to take a deep breath, snuggling to return to his teasing tone. \"Of course I was trying to focus on finding you alive, but part of my mind was making contingency plans. Like I said, it's not as easy for me as it is for a human.\" For one second, the memory of my last trip to Phoenix washed through my head and made me feel dizzy. I could see it all so clearly\u2014the blinding sun, the heat waves coming off the concrete as I ran with desperate haste to find the sadistic vampire who wanted to torture me to death. James, waiting in the mirrored room with my mother as his hostage\u2014or so I'd thought. I hadn't known it was all a ruse. Just as James hadn't known that Edward was racing to save me; Edward made it in time, but it had been a close one. Unthinkingly, my fingers traced the crescent-shaped scar on my hand that was always just a few degrees cooler than the rest of my skin. I shook my head\u2014as if I could shake away the bad memories\u2014and tried to grasp what Edward meant. My stomach plunged uncomfortably. \"Contingency plans?\" I repeated. \"Well, I wasn't going to live without you.\" He rolled his eyes as if that fact were\u00a0\u00a0 childishly obvious. \"But I wasn't sure how to do it\u2014I knew Emmett and Jasper would never help\u2026 so I was thinking maybe I would go to Italy and do something to provoke the Volturi.\" I didn't want to believe he was serious, but his golden eyes were brooding, focused on something far away in the distance as he contemplated ways to end his own life. Abruptly, I was furious. \"What is a Volturi?\" I demanded. \u00a0\"The Volturi are a family,\" he explained, his eyes still remote. \"A very old, very powerful family of our kind. They are the closest thing our world has to a royal family, I suppose. Carlisle lived with them briefly in his early years, in Italy, before he settled in America\u2014do you remember the story?\" \"Of course I remember.\" I would never forget the first time I'd gone to his home, the huge white mansion buried deep in the forest beside the river, or the room where Carlisle\u2014Edward's father in so many real ways\u2014kept a wall of paintings that illustrated his personal history. The most vivid, most wildly colorful canvas there, the largest, was from Carlisle's time in Italy. Of course I remembered the calm quartet of men, each with the exquisite face of a seraph, painted into the highest balcony overlooking the swirling mayhem of color. Though the painting was centuries old, Carlisle\u2014the blond angel\u2014remained unchanged. And I remembered the three others, Carlisle's early acquaintances. Edward had never used the name Volturi for the beautiful trio, two black-haired, one snow white. He'd called them Aro, Caius, and Marcus, nighttime patrons of the arts\u2026 \"Anyway, you don't irritate the Volturi,\" Edward went on, interrupting ray reverie. \"Not unless you want to die\u2014or whatever it is we do.\" His voice was so calm, it made him sound almost bored by the prospect. My anger turned to horror. I took his marble face between my hands and held it very tightly. \"You must never, never, never think of anything like that again!\" I said. \"No matter what might ever happen to me, you are not allowed to hurt yourself!\" \"I'll never put you in danger again, so it's a moot point.\" \"Put me in danger! I thought we'd established that all the bad luck is my fault?\" I was getting angrier.\u00a0 \"How dare you even think like that?\" The idea of Edward ceasing to exist, even if I were dead, was impossibly painful. \"What would you do, if the situation were reversed?\" he asked. \"That's not the same thing.\" He didn't seem to understand the difference. He chuckled. \"What if something did happen to you?\" I blanched at the thought. \"Would you want me to go off myself?\" A trace of pain touched his perfect features. \"I guess I see your point\u2026 a little,\" he admitted. \"But what would I do without you?\" \"Whatever you were doing before I came along and complicated your existence.\" He sighed. \"You make that sound so easy.\" \"It should be. I'm not really that interesting.\" He was about to argue, but then he let it go. \"Moot point,\" he reminded me. Abruptly, he pulled himself up into a more formal posture, shifting me to the side so that we were no longer touching. \"Charlie?\" I guessed. Edward smiled. After a moment, I heard the sound of the police cruiser pulling into the driveway. I reached out and took his hand firmly. My dad could deal with that much. Charlie came in with a pizza box in his hands. \"Hey, kids.\" He grinned at me. \"I thought you'd like a break from cooking and washing dishes for your birthday. Hungry?\" \"Sure. Thanks, Dad.\" Charlie didn't comment on Edward's apparent lack of appetite. He was used to Edward passing on dinner. \"Do you mind if I borrow Bella for the evening?\" Edward asked when Charlie and I were done. I looked at Charlie hopefully. Maybe he had some concept of birthdays as stay-at-home, family affairs\u2014this was my first birthday with him, the first birthday since my mom, Renee, had remarried and gone to live in Florida, so I didn't know what he would expect. \"That's fine\u2014the Mariners are playing the Sox tonight,\" Charlie explained, and my hope disappeared. \"So I won't be any kind of company\u2026 Here.\" He scooped up the camera he'd gotten me on Renee's suggestion (because I would need pictures to fill up my scrap-book), and threw it to me. He ought to know better than that\u2014I'd always been coordination ally challenged. The camera glanced off the tip of my finger, and tumbled toward the floor. Edward snagged it before it could crash onto the linoleum. \"Nice save,\" Charlie noted. \"If they're doing something fun at the Cullens' tonight, Bella, you should take some pictures. You know how your mother gets\u2014she'll be wanting to see the pictures faster than you can take them.\" \"Good idea, Charlie,\" Edward said, handing me the camera. I turned the camera on Edward, and snapped the first picture. \"It works.\" \"That's good. Hey, say hi to Alice for me. She hasn't been over in a while.\" Charlie's mouth pulled down at one corner. \"It's been three days, Dad,\" I reminded him. Charlie was crazy about Alice. He'd become attached last spring when she'd helped me through my awkward convalescence; Charlie would be forever grateful to her for saving him from the horror of an almost-adult daughter who needed help showering. \"I'll tell her.\" \"Okay. You kids have fun tonight.\" It was clearly a dismissal. Charlie was already edging toward the living room and the TV. Edward smiled, triumphant, and took my hand to pull me from the kitchen. When we got to the truck, he opened the passenger door for me again, and this time I didn't argue. I still had a hard time finding the obscure turnoff to his house in the dark. Edward drove north through Forks, visibly chafing at the speed limit enforced by my prehistoric Chevy. The engine groaned even louder than usual as he pushed it over fifty. \"Take it easy,\" I warned him. \"You know what you would love? A nice little Audi coupe. Very quiet, lots of power\u2026\" \"There's nothing wrong with my truck. And speaking of expensive nonessentials, if you know what's good for you, you didn't spend any money on birthday presents.\" \"Not a dime,\" he said virtuously. \"Good.\" \"Can you do me a favor?\" \"That depends on what it is.\" He sighed, his lovely face serious. \"Bella, the last real birthday any of us had was Emmett in 1935. Cut us a little slack, and don't be too difficult tonight. They're all very excited.\" It always startled me a little when he brought up things like that. \"Fine, I'll behave.\" \"I probably should warn you\u2026\" \"Please do.\" \"When I say they're all excited\u2026 I do mean all of them.\" \"Everyone?\" I choked. \"I thought Emmett and Rosalie were in Africa.\" The rest of Forks was under the impression that the older Cullens had gone off to college this year, to Dartmouth, but I knew better. \"Emmett wanted to be here.\" \"But\u2026 Rosalie?\" \"I know, Bella. Don't worry, she'll be on her best behavior.\" I didn't answer. Like I could just not worry, that easy. Unlike Alice, Edward's other \"adopted\" sister, the golden blond and exquisite Rosalie, didn't like me much. Actually, the feeling was a little bit stronger than just dislike. As far as Rosalie was concerned, I was an unwelcome intruder into her family's secret life. I felt horribly guilty about the present situation, guessing that Rosalie and Emmett's prolonged absence was my fault, even as I furtively enjoyed not having to see her Emmett, Edward's playful bear of a brother, I did miss. He was in many ways just like the big brother I'd always wanted\u2026 only much, much more terrifying. Edward decided to change the subject. \"So, if you won't let me get you the Audi, isn't there anything that you'd like for your birthday?\" The words came out in a whisper. \"You know what I want.\" A deep frown carved creases into his marble forehead. He obviously wished he'd stuck to the subject of Rosalie. It felt like we'd had this argument a lot today. \"Not tonight, Bella. Please.\" \"Well, maybe Alice will give me what I want.\" Edward growled\u2014a deep, menacing sound. \"This isn't going to be your last birthday, Bella,\" he vowed. \"That's not fair!\" I thought I heard his teeth clench together. We were pulling up to the house now. Bright light shined from every window on the first two floors. A long line of glowing Japanese lanterns hung from the porch eaves, reflecting a soft radiance on the huge cedars that surrounded the house. Big bowls of flowers\u2014pink roses\u2014lined the wide stairs up to the front doors. I moaned. Edward took a few deep breaths to calm himself. \"This is a party,\" he reminded me. \"Try to be a good sport.\" \"Sure,\" I muttered. He came around to get my door, and offered me his hand. \"I have a question.\" He waited warily. \"If I develop this film,\" I said, toying with the camera in my hands, \"will you show up in the picture?\" Edward started laughing. He helped me out of the car, pulled me up the stairs, and was still laughing as he opened the door for me. They were all waiting in the huge white living room; when I walked through the door, they greeted me with a loud chorus of \"Happy birthday, Bella!\" while I blushed and looked down. Alice, I assumed, had covered every flat surface with pink candles and dozens of crystal bowls filled with hundreds of roses. There was a table with a white cloth draped over it next to Edward's grand piano, holding a pink birthday cake, more roses, a stack of glass plates, and a small pile of silver-wrapped presents. It was a hundred times worse than I'd imagined. Edward, sensing my distress, wrapped an encouraging arm around my waist and kissed the top of my head. Edward's parents, Carlisle and Esme\u2014impossibly youthful and lovely as ever\u2014were the closest to the door. Esme hugged me carefully, her soft, caramel-colored hair brushing against my cheek as she kissed my forehead, and then Carlisle put his arm around my shoulders. \"Sorry about this, Bella,\" he stage-whispered. \"We couldn't rein Alice in.\" Rosalie and Emmett stood behind them. Rosalie didn't smile, but at least she didn't glare. Emmett's face was stretched into a huge grin. It had been months since I'd seen them; I'd forgotten how gloriously beautiful Rosalie was\u2014it almost hurt to look at her. And had Emmett always been so\u2026 big? \"You haven't changed at all,\" Emmett said with mock disappointment. \"I expected a perceptible difference, but here you are, red-faced just like always.\" \"Thanks a lot, Emmett,\" I said, blushing deeper. He laughed, \"I have to step out for a second\"\u2014he paused to wink conspicuously at Alice\u2014\"Don't do anything funny while I'm gone.\" \"I'll try.\" Alice let go of Jasper's hand and skipped forward, all her teeth sparkling in the bright light. Jasper smiled, too, but kept his distance. He leaned, long and blond, against the post at the foot of the stairs. During the days we'd had to spend cooped up together in Phoenix, I'd thought he'd gotten over his aversion to me. But he'd gone back to exactly how he'd acted before\u2014avoiding me as much as possible\u2014the moment he was free from that temporary obligation to protect me. I knew it wasn't personal, just a precaution, and I tried not to be overly sensitive about it. Jasper had more trouble sticking to the Cullens' diet than the rest of them; the scent of human blood was much harder for him to resist than the others\u2014he hadn't been trying as long. \"Time to open presents,\" Alice declared. She put her cool hand under my elbow and towed me to the table with the cake and the shiny packages. I put on my best martyr face. \"Alice, I know I told you I didn't want anything\u2014\" \"But I didn't listen,\" she interrupted, smug. \"Open it.\" She took the camera from my hands and replaced it with a big, square silver box. The box was so light that it felt empty. The tag on top said that it was from Emmett, Rosalie, and Jasper. Self-consciously, I tore the paper off and then stared at the box it concealed. It was something electrical, with lots of numbers in the name. I opened the box, hoping for further illumination. But the box was empty. \"Um\u2026 thanks.\" Rosalie actually cracked a smile. Jasper laughed. \"It's a stereo for your truck,\" he explained. \"Emmett's installing it right now so that you can't return it.\" Alice was always one step ahead of me. \"Thanks, Jasper, Rosalie,\" I told them, grinning as I remembered Edward's complaints about my radio this afternoon\u2014all a setup, apparently. \"Thanks, Emmett!\" I called more loudly. I heard his booming laugh from my truck, and I couldn't help laughing, too. \"Open mine and Edward's next,\" Alice said, so excited her voice was a high-pitched trill. She held a small, flat square in her hand. I turned to give Edward a basilisk glare. \"You promised.\" Before he could answer, Emmett bounded through the door. \"Just in time!\" he crowed. He pushed in behind Jasper, who had also drifted closer than usual to get a good look. \"I didn't spend a dime,\" Edward assured me. He brushed a strand of hair from my face, leaving my skin tingling from his touch. I inhaled deeply and turned to Alice. \"Give it to me,\" I sighed. Emmett chuckled with delight. I took the little package, rolling my eyes at Edward while I stuck my finger under the edge of the paper and jerked it under the tape. \"Shoot,\" I muttered when the paper sliced my finger; I pulled it out to examine the damage. A single drop of blood oozed from the tiny cut. It all happened very quickly then. \"No!\" Edward roared. He threw himself at me, flinging me back across the table. It fell, as I did, scattering the cake and the presents, the flowers and the plates. I landed in the mess of shattered crystal. Jasper slammed into Edward, and the sound was like the crash of boulders in a rock slide. There was another noise, a grisly snarling that seemed to be coming from deep in Jasper's chest. Jasper tried to shove past Edward, snapping his teeth just inches from Edward's face. Emmett grabbed Jasper from behind in the next second, locking him into his massive steel grip, but Jasper struggled on, his wild, empty eyes focused only on me. Beyond the shock, there was also pain. I'd tumbled down to the floor by the piano, with my arms thrown out instinctively to catch my fall, into the jagged shards of glass. Only now did I feel the searing, stinging pain that ran from my wrist to the crease inside my elbow. Dazed and disoriented, I looked up from the bright red blood pulsing out of my arm\u2014into the fevered eyes of the six suddenly ravenous vampires.",
