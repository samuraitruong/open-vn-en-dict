The United Nations Children's Fund says nearly seventy-two million children were not in school in two thousand seven. More than half are girls, and more than two-thirds are in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and West Asia. School attendance has improved in many areas. But the head of UNICEF, Anthony Lake, says: ANTHONY LAKE: \"Unless we all work harder, there may still be fifty-six million children out of school in two thousand fifteen.\" He says progress and economic development depend on educating girls as well as boys. Educated girls are also at lower risk of violence, abuse and diseases like H.I.V./AIDS. The U.N. Girls' Education Initiative organized the meeting of two hundred scholars, aid workers and government officials from twenty-two countries. The initiative was launched in Dakar ten years ago. The aim is to bring primary school education to all girls and boys worldwide by two thousand fifteen. In Senegal, the number of public schools has doubled in the last ten years. But UNICEF's Anthony Lake said schools still lack gender equality. He said girls in one Dakar school told him about a lack of bathrooms and textbooks for them, and bullying from boys. The conference centered on three main problems to getting and keeping girls in school: violence, poverty and poor quality education. Ann-Therese Ndong-Jatta is education director for UNESCO in Africa. She says donors are pumping in a lot of resources and civil society groups are working on access to education. ANN-THERESE NDONG-JATTA: \"But the truth is, seventy-five percent of the children fail.\" The UNESCO official says schools need to modernize and improve what they teach and how they teach it. For example, she says schools should teach African children in their native languages, not simply in English or French. To stay in school, experts say children must consider their education useful -- and so must their parents. May Rihani from the Global Advisory Committee of the U.N. girls' initiative gave an example from a \"life skills\" program in <em>Mali</em>. One lesson is about diarrhea. The idea is for children to go tell their mother what they learned. May Rihani says: \"The mother would recognize that this education is important to her and to her family and would want the child to continue to go to school.\"",

            "en": "Child Mortality Closely Linked To Women's Education Levels      Over half of the reduction in the global mortality of children under 5 years of age is linked to increased education among females of reproductive age, says a reports from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington, published in the medical journal The Lancet. Sixteen million children under the age of five died in 1970, compared to 7.8 million in 2009, the report informs - 4.2 million fewer children died in 2009 thanks in large part to better and more widely accessible schooling for women.  The authors write that education is growing in every part of the world. The report states that:  Average years of schooling for women of reproductive age (ages 15 to 44) in developing countries have grown from 2.2 years to 7.2 years.  In some countries, however, women still receive no more than one year of schooling. Those countries include, Burkina Faso, Yemen, Niger, Chad, <em>Mali</em> and Afghanistan.  Dr. Emmanuela Gakidou, lead author, Associate Professor of Global Health at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), said:  We know that direct health interventions, such as immunizations, preventive care, and hygiene classes, are crucial to improving health worldwide. What this study shows is that by focusing on education as well, we can increase the impact that we are having on health. In 87 countries in 2009, women had greater levels of education than men. In 40 nations, however, the gender gap grew during the period 1970 to 2009. Dr. Emmanuela Gakidou and team collected data from 915 censuses and national surveys globally to create a time series of education levels for 175 nations. They found that:    31 nations had improved average years of schooling of women of reproductive age by over three years between 1990 and 2009. Saudi Arabia, the Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates were among these countries.\n  Out of the ten countries with the highest populations in the world, women of reproductive age had complete at least primary school in seven of them.\n  Most of the countries that are on track to achieving the Millennium Development Goal 4 - reducing the child mortality rate by 66% between 1990 and 2015 - have achieved a faster improvement for average rate of schooling for women of reproductive age than the global 1.9 years over the last two decades.\n  According to their findings, economic growth accounted for just 7.2% of the reduction in child mortality during the 1970-2009 period. \n   Dr. Christopher Murray, IHME Director and one of the paper's co-authors, said:  More education helps mothers make better choices in a range of areas - personal hygiene, nutrition, parenting approaches. It also helps them take better care of their own health when pregnant, and, after the child is born, they are able to navigate the expanding array of health services being offered to their families.  The authors believe that mothers with more education will drive advances in global health, embracing immunization programs, for example. Dr. Rafael Lozano, Professor of Global Health at IHME:  The next phase could include building new secondary schools and hiring teachers. But before that work begins, it would be wise to weigh the potential benefits and costs of this approach against building clinics and hiring health workers.
