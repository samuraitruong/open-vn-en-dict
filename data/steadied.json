            "en": "3          3. PHENOMENON When I opened my eyes in the morning, something was different.  It was the light. It was still the gray-green light of a cloudy day in the forest, but it was clearer somehow. I realized there was no fog veiling my window. I jumped up to look outside, and then groaned in horror. A fine layer of snow covered the yard, dusted the top of my truck, and whitened the road. But that wasn't the worst part. All the rain from yesterday had frozen solid \u2014 coating the needles on the trees in fantastic, gorgeous patterns, and making the driveway a deadly ice slick. I had enough trouble not falling down when the ground was dry; it might be safer for me to go back to bed now. Charlie had left for work before I got downstairs. In a lot of ways, living with Charlie was like having my own place, and I found myself reveling in the aloneness instead of being lonely. I threw down a quick bowl of cereal and some orange juice from the carton. I felt excited to go to school, and that scared me. I knew it wasn't the stimulating learning environment I was anticipating, or seeing my new set of friends. If I was being honest with myself, I knew I was eager to get to school because I would see Edward Cullen. And that was very, very stupid. I should be avoiding him entirely after my brainless and embarrassing babbling yesterday. And I was suspicious of him; why should he lie about his eyes? I was still frightened of the hostility I sometimes felt emanating from him, and I was still tongue-tied whenever I pictured his perfect face. I was well aware that my league and his league were spheres that did not touch. So I \u00a0shouldn't be at all anxious to see him today. It took every ounce of my concentration to make it down the icy brick driveway alive. I almost lost my balance when I finally got to the truck, but I managed to cling to the side mirror and save myself. Clearly, today was going to be nightmarish. Driving to school, I distracted myself from my fear of falling and my unwanted speculations about Edward Cullen by thinking about Mike and Eric, and the obvious difference in how teenage boys responded to me here. I was sure I looked exactly the same as I had in Phoenix. Maybe it was just that the boys back home had watched me pass slowly through all the awkward phases of adolescence and still thought of me that way.  Perhaps it was because I was a novelty here, where novelties were few and far between. Possibly my crippling clumsiness was seen as endearing rather than pathetic, casting me as a damsel in distress. Whatever the reason, Mike's puppy dog behavior and Eric's apparent rivalry with him were disconcerting. I wasn't sure if I didn't prefer being ignored.  My truck seemed to have no problem with the black ice that covered the roads. I drove very slowly, though, not wanting to carve a path of destruction through Main Street. When I got out of my truck at school, I saw why I'd had so little trouble. Something silver caught my eye, and I walked to the back of the truck \u2014 carefully holding the side for support \u2014 to examine my tires.  There were thin chains crisscrossed in diamond shapes around them. Charlie had gotten up who knows how early to put snow chains on my truck.  My throat suddenly felt tight. I wasn't used to being taken care of, and Charlie's unspoken concern caught me by surprise.  I was standing by the back corner of the truck, struggling to fight back the sudden wave of emotion the snow chains had brought on, when I heard an odd sound. It was a high-pitched screech, and it was fast becoming painfully loud. I looked up, startled. I saw several things simultaneously. Nothing was moving in slow motion, the way it does in the movies. Instead, the adrenaline rush seemed to make my brain work much faster, and I was able to absorb in clear detail several things at once. Edward Cullen was standing four cars down from me, staring at me in horror. His face stood out from a sea of faces, all frozen in the same mask of shock. But of more immediate importance was the dark blue van that was skidding, tires locked and squealing against the brakes, spinning wildly across the ice of the parking lot. It was going to hit the back corner of my truck, and I was standing between them. I didn't even have time to close my eyes. Just before I heard the shattering crunch of the van folding around the truck bed, something hit me, hard, but not from the direction I was expecting. My head cracked against the icy blacktop, and I felt something solid and cold pinning me to the ground. I was lying on the pavement behind the tan car I'd parked next to. But I didn't have a chance to notice anything else, because the van was still coming. It had curled gratingly around the end of the truck and, still spinning and sliding, was about to collide with me again. A low oath made me aware that someone was with me, and the voice was impossible not to recognize. Two long, white hands shot out protectively in front of me, and the van shuddered to a stop a foot from my face, the large hands fitting providentially into a deep dent in the side of the van's body. Then his hands moved so fast they blurred. One was suddenly gripping under the body of the van, and something was dragging me, swinging my legs around like a rag doll's, till they hit the tire of the tan car. A groaning metallic thud hurt my ears, and the van settled, glass popping, onto the asphalt \u2014 exactly where, a second ago, my legs had been. It was absolutely silent for one long second before the screaming began.  In the abrupt bedlam, I could hear more than one person shouting my name. But more clearly than all the yelling, I could hear Edward Cullen's low, frantic voice in my ear. \"Bella? Are you all right?\" \"I'm fine.\" My voice sounded strange. I tried to sit up, and realized he was holding me against the side of his body in an iron grasp. \"Be careful,\" he warned as I struggled. \"I think you hit your head pretty hard.\" I became aware of a throbbing ache centered above my left ear. \"Ow,\" I said, surprised. \"That's what I thought.\" His voice, amazingly, sounded like he was suppressing laughter. \"How in the\u2026\" I trailed off, trying to clear my head, get my bearings. \"How did you get over here so fast?\" \"I was standing right next to you, Bella,\" he said, his tone serious again. I turned to sit up, and this time he let me, releasing his hold around my waist and sliding as far from me as he could in the limited space. I looked at his concerned, innocent expression and was disoriented again by the force of his gold-colored eyes. What was I asking him? And then they found us, a crowd of people with tears streaming down their faces, shouting at each other, shouting at us. \"Don't move,\" someone instructed. \"Get Tyler out of the van!\" someone else shouted. There was a flurry of activity around us. I tried to get up, but Edward's cold hand pushed my shoulder down. \"Just stay put for now.\" \"But it's cold,\" I complained. It surprised me when he chuckled under his breath. There was an edge to the sound. \"You were over there,\" I suddenly remembered, and his chuckle stopped short. \"You were by your car.\" His expression turned hard. \"No, I wasn't.\" \"I saw you.\" All around us was chaos. I could hear the gruffer voices of adults arriving on the scene. But I obstinately held on to our argument; I was right, and he was going to admit it. \"Bella, I was standing with you, and I pulled you out of the way.\" He unleashed the full, devastating power of his eyes on me, as if trying to communicate something crucial. \"No.\" I set my jaw. The gold in his eyes blazed. \"Please, Bella.\" \"Why?\" I demanded. \"Trust me,\" he pleaded, his soft voice overwhelming. I could hear the sirens now. \"Will you promise to explain everything to me later?\" \"Fine,\" he snapped, abruptly exasperated. \"Fine,\" I repeated angrily. It took six EMTs and two teachers \u2014 Mr. Varner and Coach Clapp \u2014 to shift the van far enough away from us to bring the stretchers in. Edward vehemently refused his, and I tried to do the same, but the traitor told them I'd hit my head and probably had a concussion. I almost died of humiliation when they put on the neck brace. It looked like the entire school was there, watching soberly as they loaded me in the back of the ambulance. Edward got to ride in the front. It was maddening.  To make matters worse, Chief Swan arrived before they could get me safely away. \"Bella!\" he yelled in panic when he recognized me on the stretcher. \"I'm completely fine, Char \u2014 Dad,\" I sighed. \"There's nothing wrong with me.\" He turned to the closest EMT for a second opinion. I tuned him out to consider the jumble of inexplicable images churning chaotically in my head. When they'd lifted me away from the car, I had seen the deep dent in the tan car's bumper \u2014 a very distinct dent that fit the contours of Edward's shoulders\u2026 as if he had braced himself against the car with enough force to damage the metal frame\u2026 And then there was his family, looking on from the distance, with expressions that ranged from disapproval to fury but held no hint of concern for their brother's safety. I tried to think of a logical solution that could explain what I had just seen \u2014 a solution that excluded the assumption that I was insane. Naturally, the ambulance got a police escort to the county hospital. I felt ridiculous the whole time they were unloading me. What made it worse was that Edward simply glided through the hospital doors under his own power. I ground my teeth together. They put me in the emergency room, a long room with a line of beds separated by pastel-patterned curtains. A nurse put a pressure cuff on my arm and a thermometer under my tongue. Since no one bothered pulling the curtain around to give me some privacy, I decided I wasn't obligated to wear the stupid-looking neck brace anymore. When the nurse walked away, I quickly unfastened the Velcro and threw it under the bed. There was another flurry of hospital personnel, another stretcher brought to the bed next to me. I recognized Tyler Crowley from my Government class beneath the bloodstained bandages wrapped tightly around his head.  Tyler looked a hundred times worse than I felt. But he was staring anxiously at me. \"Bella, I'm so sorry!\" \"I'm fine, Tyler \u2014 you look awful, are you all right?\" As we spoke, nurses began unwinding his soiled bandages, exposing a myriad of shallow slices all over his forehead and left cheek. He ignored me. \"I thought I was going to kill you! I was going too fast, and I hit the ice wrong\u2026\" He winced as one nurse started dabbing at his face. \"Don't worry about it; you missed me.\" \"How did you get out of the way so fast? You were there, and then you were gone\u2026\" \"Umm\u2026 Edward pulled me out of the way.\" He looked confused. \"Who?\" \"Edward Cullen \u2014 he was standing next to me.\" I'd always been a terrible liar; I didn't sound convincing at all. \"Cullen? I didn't see him\u2026 wow, it was all so fast, I guess. Is he okay?\" \"I think so. He's here somewhere, but they didn't make him use a stretcher.\" I knew I wasn't crazy. What had happened? There was no way to explain away what I'd seen. They wheeled me away then, to X-ray my head. I told them there was nothing wrong, and I was right. Not even a concussion. I asked if I could leave, but the nurse said I had to talk to a doctor first. So I was trapped in the ER, waiting, harassed by Tyler's constant apologies and promises to make it up to me. No matter how many times I tried to convince him I was fine, he continued to torment himself. Finally, I closed my eyes and ignored him. He kept up a remorseful mumbling. \"Is she sleeping?\" a musical voice asked. My eyes flew open. Edward was standing at the foot of my bed, smirking. I glared at him. It wasn't easy \u2014 it would have been more natural to ogle. \"Hey, Edward, I'm really sorry \u2014\" Tyler began. Edward lifted a hand to stop him. \"No blood, no foul,\" he said, flashing his brilliant teeth. He moved to sit on the edge of Tyler's bed, facing me. He smirked again. \"So, what's the verdict?\" he asked me. \"There's nothing wrong with me at all, but they won't let me go,\" I complained. \"How come you aren't strapped to a gurney like the rest of us?\" \"It's all about who you know,\" he answered. \"But don't worry, I came to spring you.\" Then a doctor walked around the corner, and my mouth fell open. He was young, he was blond\u2026 and he was handsomer than any movie star I'd ever seen. He was pale, though, and tired-looking, with circles under his eyes. From Charlie's description, this had to be Edward's father. \"So, Miss Swan,\" Dr. Cullen said in a remarkably appealing voice, \"how are you feeling?\" \"I'm fine,\" I said, for the last time, I hoped. He walked to the lightboard on the wall over my head, and turned it on. \"Your X-rays look good,\" he said. \"Does your head hurt? Edward said you hit it pretty hard.\" \"It's fine,\" I repeated with a sigh, throwing a quick scowl toward Edward. The doctor's cool fingers probed lightly along my skull. He noticed when I winced. \"Tender?\" he asked. \"Not really.\" I'd had worse. I heard a chuckle, and looked over to see Edward's patronizing smile. My eyes narrowed. \"Well, your father is in the waiting room \u2014 you can go home with him now. But come back if you feel dizzy or have trouble with your eyesight at all.\" \"Can't I go back to school?\" I asked, imagining Charlie trying to be attentive. \"Maybe you should take it easy today.\" I glanced at Edward. \"Does he get to go to school?\" \"Someone has to spread the good news that we survived,\" Edward said smugly. \"Actually,\" Dr. Cullen corrected, \"most of the school seems to be in the waiting room.\" \"Oh no,\" I moaned, covering my face with my hands. Dr. Cullen raised his eyebrows. \"Do you want to stay?\" \"No, no!\" I insisted, throwing my legs over the side of the bed and hopping down quickly. Too quickly \u2014 I staggered, and Dr. Cullen caught me. He looked concerned. \"I'm fine,\" I assured him again. No need to tell him my balance problems had nothing to do with hitting my head. \"Take some Tylenol for the pain,\" he suggested as he <em>steadied</em> me.  \"It doesn't hurt that bad,\" I insisted. \"It sounds like you were extremely lucky,\" Dr. Cullen said, smiling as he signed my chart with a flourish. \"Lucky Edward happened to be standing next to me,\" I amended with a hard glance at the subject of my statement. \"Oh, well, yes,\" Dr. Cullen agreed, suddenly occupied with the papers in front of him. Then he looked away, at Tyler, and walked to the next bed. My intuition flickered; the doctor was in on it. \"I'm afraid that you'll have to stay with us just a little bit longer,\" he said to Tyler, and began checking his cuts. As soon as the doctor's back was turned, I moved to Edward's side. \"Can I talk to you for a minute?\" I hissed under my breath. He took a step back from me, his jaw suddenly clenched. \"Your father is waiting for you,\" he said through his teeth \u2013  I glanced at Dr. Cullen and Tyler. \"I'd like to speak with you alone, if you don't mind,\" I pressed. He glared, and then turned his back and strode down the long room. I nearly had to run to keep up. As soon as we turned the corner into a short hallway, he spun around to face me. \"What do you want?\" he asked, sounding annoyed. His eyes were cold. His unfriendliness intimidated me. My words came out with less severity than I'd intended. \"You owe me an explanation,\" I reminded him. \"I saved your life \u2014 I don't owe you anything.\" I flinched back from the resentment in his voice. \"You promised.\" \"Bella, you hit your head, you don't know what you're talking about.\" His tone was cutting. My temper flared now, and I glared defiantly at him. \"There's nothing wrong with my head.\" He glared back. \"What do you want from me, Bella?\" \"I want to know the truth,\" I said. \"I want to know why I'm lying for you.\" \"What do you think happened?\" he snapped. It came out in a rush. \"All I know is that you weren't anywhere near me \u2014 Tyler didn't see you, either, so don't tell me I hit my head too hard. That van was going to crush us both \u2014 and it didn't, and your hands left dents in the side of it \u2014 and you left a dent in the other car, and you're not hurt at all \u2014 and the van should have smashed my legs, but you were holding it up\u2026\" I could hear how crazy it sounded, and I couldn't continue. I was so mad I could feel the tears coming; I tried to force them back by grinding my teeth together. He was staring at me incredulously. But his face was tense, defensive. \"You think I lifted a van off you?\" His tone questioned my sanity, but it only made me more suspicious. It was like a perfectly delivered line by a skilled actor. I merely nodded once, jaw tight. \"Nobody will believe that, you know.\" His voice held an edge of derision now. \"I'm not going to tell anybody.\" I said each word slowly, carefully controlling my anger. Surprise flitted across his face. \"Then why does it matter?\" \"It matters to me,\" I insisted. \"I don't like to lie \u2014 so there'd better be a good reason why I'm doing it.\" \"Can't you just thank me and get over it?\" \"Thank you.\" I waited, fuming and expectant. \"You're not going to let it go, are you?\" \"No.\" \"In that case\u2026 I hope you enjoy disappointment.\" We scowled at each other in silence. I was the first to speak, trying to keep myself focused. I was in danger of being distracted by his livid, glorious face. It was like trying to stare down a destroying angel. \"Why did you even bother?\" I asked frigidly. He paused, and for a brief moment his stunning face was unexpectedly vulnerable. \"I don't know,\" he whispered. And then he turned his back on me and walked away. I was so angry, it took me a few minutes until I could move. When I could walk, I made my way slowly to the exit at the end of the hallway. The waiting room was more unpleasant than I'd feared. It seemed like every face I knew in Forks was there, staring at me. Charlie rushed to my side; I put up my hands. \"There's nothing wrong with me,\" I assured him sullenly. I was still aggravated, not in the mood for chitchat. \"What did the doctor say?\" \"Dr. Cullen saw me, and he said I was fine and I could go home.\" I sighed. Mike and Jessica and Eric were all there, beginning to converge on us. \"Let's go,\" I urged. Charlie put one arm behind my back, not quite touching me, and led me to the glass doors of the exit. I waved sheepishly at my friends, hoping to convey that they didn't need to worry anymore. It was a huge relief\u2014 the first time I'd ever felt that way \u2014 to get into the cruiser. We drove in silence. I was so wrapped up in my thoughts that I barely knew Charlie was there. I was positive that Edward's defensive behavior in the hall was a confirmation of the bizarre things I still could hardly believe I'd witnessed. When we got to the house, Charlie finally spoke. \"Um\u2026 you'll need to call Ren\u00e9e.\" He hung his head, guilty. I was appalled. \"You told Mom!\" \"Sorry.\" I slammed the cruiser's door a little harder than necessary on my way out. My mom was in hysterics, of course. I had to tell her I felt fine at least thirty times before she would calm down. She begged me to come home \u2014 forgetting the fact that home was empty at the moment \u2014 but her pleas were easier to resist than I would have thought. I was consumed by the mystery Edward presented. And more than a little obsessed by Edward himself. Stupid, stupid, stupid. I wasn't as eager to escape Forks as I should be, as any normal, sane person would be. I decided I might as well go to bed early that night. Charlie continued to watch me anxiously, and it was getting on my nerves. I stopped on my way to grab three Tylenol from the bathroom. They did help, and, as the pain eased, I drifted to sleep. That was the first night I dreamed of Edward Cullen.",

            "en": "15          15. THE CULLENS The muted light of yet another cloudy day eventually woke me. I lay with my arm across my eyes, groggy and dazed. Something, a dream trying to be remembered, struggled to break into my consciousness. I moaned and rolled on my side, hoping more sleep would come. And then the previous day flooded back into my awareness. \"Oh!\" I sat up so fast it made my head spin. \"Your hair looks like a haystack\u2026 but I like it.\u201dHis unruffled voice came from the rocking chair in the corner. \"Edward! You stayed!\" I rejoiced, and thoughtlessly threw myself across the room and into his lap. In the instant that my thoughts caught up with my actions, I froze, shocked by my own uncontrolled enthusiasm. I stared up at him, afraid that I had crossed the wrong line. But he laughed. \"Of course,\u201dHe answered, startled, but seeming pleased by my reaction. His hands rubbed my back. I laid my head cautiously against his shoulder, breathing in the smell of his skin. \"I was sure it was a dream.\" \"You're not that creative,\u201dHe scoffed. \"Charlie!\" I remembered, thoughtlessly jumping up again and heading to the door. \"He left an hour ago \u2014 after reattaching your battery cables, I might add. I have to admit I was disappointed. Is that really all it would take to stop you, if you were determined to go?\" I deliberated where I stood, wanting to return to him badly, but afraid I might have morning breath. \"You're not usually this confused in the morning,\u201dHe noted. He held his arms open for me to return. A nearly irresistible invitation. \"I need another human minute,\" I admitted. \"I'll wait.\" I skipped to the bathroom, my emotions unrecognizable. I didn't know myself, inside or out. The face in the mirror was practically a stranger \u2014 eyes too bright, hectic spots of red across my cheekbones. After I brushed my teeth, I worked to straighten out the tangled chaos that was my hair. I splashed my face with cold water, and tried to breathe normally, with no noticeable success. I half-ran back to my room.  It seemed like a miracle that he was there, his arms still waiting for me. He reached out to me, and my heart thumped unsteadily. \"Welcome back,\u201dHe murmured, taking me into his arms. He rocked me for a while in silence, until I noticed that his clothes were changed, his hair smooth. \"You left?\" I accused, touching the collar of his fresh shirt. \"I could hardly leave in the clothes I came in \u2014 what would the neighbors think?\"  I pouted. \"You were very deeply asleep; I didn't miss anything.\u201dHis eyes gleamed. \"The talking came earlier.\" I groaned. \"What did you hear?\" His gold eyes grew very soft. \"You said you loved me.\" \"You knew that already,\" I reminded him, ducking my head. \"It was nice to hear, just the same.\" I hid my face against his shoulder. \"I love you,\" I whispered. \"You are my life now,\u201dHe answered simply. There was nothing more to say for the moment. He rocked us back and forth as the room grew lighter. \"Breakfast time,\u201dHe said eventually, casually \u2014 to prove, I'm sure, that he remembered all my human frailties. So I clutched my throat with both hands and stared at him with wide eyes. Shock crossed his face. \"Kidding!\" I snickered. \"And you said I couldn't act!\" He frowned in disgust. \"That wasn't funny.\" \"It was very funny, and you know it.\" But I examined his gold eyes carefully, to make sure that I was forgiven. Apparently, I was. \"Shall I rephrase?\u201dHe asked. \"Breakfast time for the human.\" \"Oh, okay.\" He threw me over his stone shoulder, gently, but with a swiftness that left me breathless. I protested as he carried me easily down the stairs, but he ignored me. He sat me right side up on a chair. The kitchen was bright, happy, seeming to absorb my mood. \"What's for breakfast?\" I asked pleasantly. That threw him for a minute. \"Er, I'm not sure. What would you like?\u201dHis marble brow puckered. I grinned, hopping up. \"That's all right, I fend for myself pretty well. Watch me hunt.\" I found a bowl and a box of cereal. I could feel his eyes on me as I poured the milk and grabbed a spoon. I sat my food on the table, and then paused. \"Can I get you anything?\" I asked, not wanting to be rude. He rolled his eyes. \"Just eat, Bella.\" I sat at the table, watching him as I took a bite. He was gazing at me, studying my every movement. It made me self-conscious. I cleared my mouth to speak, to distract him. \"What's on the agenda for today?\" I asked. \"Hmmm\u2026\" I watched him frame his answer carefully. \"What would you say to meeting my family?\" I gulped. \"Are you afraid now?\u201dHe sounded hopeful. \"Yes,\" I admitted; how could I deny it \u2014 he could see my eyes. \"Don't worry.\u201dHe smirked. \"I'll protect you.\" \"I'm not afraid of them,\" I explained. \"I'm afraid they won't\u2026 like me. Won't they be, well, surprised that you would bring someone\u2026 like me\u2026 home to meet them? Do they know that I know about them?\" \"Oh, they already know everything. They'd taken bets yesterday, you know\" \u2014 he smiled, but his voice was harsh \u2014 \"on whether I'd bring you back, though why anyone would bet against Alice, I can't imagine. At any rate, we don't have secrets in the family. It's not really feasible, what with my mind reading and Alice seeing the future and all that.\" \"And Jasper making you feel all warm and fuzzy about spilling your guts, don't forget that.\" \"You paid attention,\u201dHe smiled approvingly. \"I've been known to do that every now and then.\" I grimaced. \"So did Alice see me coming?\" His reaction was strange. \"Something like that,\u201dHe said uncomfortably, turning away so I couldn't see his eyes. I stared at him curiously. \"Is that any good?\u201dHe asked, turning back to me abruptly and eyeing my breakfast with a teasing look on his face. \"Honestly, it doesn't look very appetizing.\" \"Well, it's no irritable grizzly\u2026\" I murmured, ignoring him when he glowered. I was still wondering why he responded that way when I mentioned Alice. I hurried through my cereal, speculating. He stood in the middle of the kitchen, the statue of Adonis again, staring abstractedly out the back windows. Then his eyes were back on me, and he smiled his heartbreaking smile. \"And you should introduce me to your father, too, I think.\" \"He already knows you,\" I reminded him. \"As your boyfriend, I mean.\" I stared at him with suspicion. \"Why?\" \"Isn't that customary?\u201dHe asked innocently. \"I don't know,\" I admitted. My dating history gave me few reference points to work with. Not that any normal rules of dating applied here. \"That's not necessary, you know. I don't expect you to\u2026 I mean, you don't have to pretend for me.\" His smile was patient. \"I'm not pretending.\" I pushed the remains of my cereal around the edges of the bowl, biting my lip. \"Are you going to tell Charlie I'm your boyfriend or not?\u201dHe demanded. \"Is that what you are?\" I suppressed my internal cringing at the thought of Edward and Charlie and the word boy friend all in the same room at the same time. \"It's a loose interpretation of the word 'boy,' I'll admit.\"  \"I was under the impression that you were something more, actually,\" I confessed, looking at the table. \"Well, I don't know if we need to give him all the gory details.\u201dHe reached across the table to lift my chin with a cold, gentle finger. \"But he will need some explanation for why I'm around here so much. I don't want Chief Swan getting a restraining order put on me.\" \"Will you be?\" I asked, suddenly anxious. \"Will you really be here?\" \"As long as you want me,\u201dHe assured me. \"I'll always want you,\" I warned him. \"Forever.\" He walked slowly around the table, and, pausing a few feet away, he reached out to touch his fingertips to my cheek. His expression was unfathomable. \"Does that make you sad?\" I asked. He didn't answer. He stared into my eyes for an immeasurable period of time. \"Are you finished?\u201dHe finally asked. I jumped up. \"Yes.\" \"Get dressed \u2014 I'll wait here.\" It was hard to decide what to wear. I doubted there were any etiquette books detailing how to dress when your vampire sweetheart takes you home to meet his vampire family. It was a relief to think the word to myself. I knew I shied away from it intentionally. I ended up in my only skirt \u2014 long, khaki-colored, still casual. I put on the dark blue blouse he'd once complimented. A quick glance in the mirror told me my hair was entirely impossible, so I pulled it back into a pony tail. \"Okay.\" I bounced down the stairs. \"I'm decent.\" He was waiting at the foot of the stairs, closer than I'd thought, and I bounded right into him. He <em>steadied</em> me, holding me a careful distance away for a few seconds before suddenly pulling me closer. \"Wrong again,\u201dHe murmured in my ear. \"You are utterly indecent \u2014 no one should look so tempting, it's not fair.\" \"Tempting how?\" I asked. \"I can change\u2026\" He sighed, shaking his head. \"You are so absurd.\u201dHe pressed his cool lips delicately to my forehead, and the room spun. The smell of his breath made it impossible to think.  \"Shall I explain how you are tempting me?\u201dHe said. It was clearly a rhetorical question. His fingers traced slowly down my spine, his breath coming more quickly against my skin. My hands were limp on his chest, and I felt lightheaded again. He tilted his head slowly and touched his cool lips to mine for the second time, very carefully, parting them slightly. And then I collapsed. \"Bella?\u201dHis voice was alarmed as he caught me and held me up. \"You\u2026 made\u2026 me\u2026 faint,\" I accused him dizzily. \"What am I going to do with you?\u201dHe groaned in exasperation. \"Yesterday I kiss you, and you attack me! Today you pass out on me!\" I laughed weakly, letting his arms support me while my head spun. \"So much for being good at everything,\u201dHe sighed. \"That's the problem.\" I was still dizzy. \"You're too good. Far, far too good.\" \"Do you feel sick?\u201dHe asked; he'd seen me like this before. \"No \u2014 that wasn't the same kind of fainting at all. I don't know what happened.\" I shook my head apologetically, \"I think I forgot to breathe.\" \"I can't take you anywhere like this.\" \"I'm fine,\" I insisted. \"Your family is going to think I'm insane anyway, what's the difference?\" He measured my expression for a moment. \"I'm very partial to that color with your skin,\u201dHe offered unexpectedly. I flushed with pleasure, and looked away. \"Look, I'm trying really hard not to think about what I'm about to do, so can we go already?\" I asked. \"And you're worried, not because you're headed to meet a houseful of vampires, but because you think those vampires won't approve of you, correct?\" \"That's right,\" I answered immediately, hiding my surprise at his casual use of the word. He shook his head. \"You're incredible.\" I realized, as he drove my truck out of the main part of town, that I had no idea where he lived. We passed over the bridge at the Calawah River, the road winding northward, the houses flashing past us growing farther apart, getting bigger. And then we were past the other houses altogether, driving through misty forest. I was trying to decide whether to ask or be patient, when he turned abruptly onto an unpaved road. It was unmarked, barely visible among the ferns. The forest encroached on both sides, leaving the road ahead only discernible for a few meters as it twisted, serpentlike, around the ancient trees. And then, after a few miles, there was some thinning of the woods, and we were suddenly in a small meadow, or was it actually a lawn? The gloom of the forest didn't relent, though, for there were six primordial cedars that shaded an entire acre with their vast sweep of branches. The trees held their protecting shadow right up to the walls of the house that rose among them, making obsolete the deep porch that wrapped around the first story. I don't know what I had expected, but it definitely wasn't this. The house was timeless, graceful, and probably a hundred years old. It was painted a soft, faded white, three stories tall, \u00a0\u00a0rectangular and well proportioned. The windows and doors were either part of the original structure or a perfect restoration. My truck was the only car in sight. I could hear the river close by, hidden in the obscurity of the forest. \"Wow.\" \"You like it?\u201dHe smiled. \"It\u2026 has a certain charm.\" He pulled the end of my ponytail and chuckled. \"Ready?\u201dHe asked, opening my door. \"Not even a little bit \u2014 let's go.\" I tried to laugh, but it seemed to get stuck in my throat. I smoothed my hair nervously. \"You look lovely.\u201dHe took my hand easily, without thinking about it. We walked through the deep shade up to the porch. I knew he could feel my tension; his thumb rubbed soothing circles into the back of my hand. He opened the door for me. The inside was even more surprising, less predictable, than the exterior. It was very bright, very open, and very large. This must have originally been several rooms, but the walls had been removed from most of the first floor to create one wide space. The back, south-facing wall had been entirely replaced with glass, and, beyond the shade of the cedars, the lawn stretched bare to the wide river. A massive curving staircase dominated the west side of the room. The walls, the high-beamed ceiling, the wooden floors, and the thick carpets were all varying shades of white. Waiting to greet us, standing just to the left of the door, on a raised portion of the floor by a spectacular grand piano, were Edward's parents. I'd seen Dr. Cullen before, of course, yet I couldn't help but be struck again by his youth, his outrageous perfection. At his side was Esme, I assumed, the only one of the family I'd never seen before. She had the same pale, beautiful features as the rest of them. Something about her heart-shaped face, her billows of soft, caramel-colored hair, reminded me of the ing\u00e9nues of the silent-movie era. She was small, slender, yet less angular, more rounded than the others. They were both dressed casually, in light colors that matched the inside of the house. They smiled in welcome, but made no move to approach us. Trying not to frighten me, I guessed. \"Carlisle, Esme,\u201dEdward's voice broke the short silence, \"this is Bella.\" \"You're very welcome, Bella.\u201dCarlisle's step was measured, careful as he approached me. He raised his hand tentatively, and I stepped forward to shake hands with him. \"It's nice to see you again, Dr. Cullen.\" \"Please, call me Carlisle.\" \"Carlisle.\" I grinned at him, my sudden confidence surprising me. I could feel Edward's relief at my side. Esme smiled and stepped forward as well, reaching for my hand. Her cold, stone grasp was just as I expected. \"It's very nice to know you,\" she said sincerely. \"Thank you. I'm glad to meet you, too.\u201dAnd I was. It was like meeting a fairy tale \u2014 Snow White, in the flesh. \"Where are Alice and Jasper?\u201dEdward asked, but no one answered, as they had just appeared at the top of the wide staircase. \"Hey, Edward!\u201dAlice called enthusiastically. She ran down the stairs, a streak of black hair and white skin, coming to a sudden and graceful stop in front of me. Carlisle and Esme shot warning glances at her, but I liked it. It was natural \u2014 for her, anyway. \"Hi, Bella!\u201dAlice said, and she bounced forward to kiss my cheek. If Carlisle and Esme had looked cautious before, they now looked staggered. There was shock in my eyes, too, but I was also very pleased that she seemed to approve of me so entirely. I was startled to feel Edward stiffen at my side. I glanced at his face, but his expression was unreadable. \"You do smell nice, I never noticed before,\" she commented, to my extreme embarrassment. No one else seemed to know quite what to say, and then Jasper was there \u2014 tall and leonine. A feeling of ease spread through me, and I was suddenly comfortable despite where I was. Edward stared at Jasper, raising one eyebrow, and I remembered what Jasper could do.  \"Hello, Bella,\" Jasper said. He kept his distance, not offering to shake my hand. But it was impossible to feel awkward near him. \"Hello, Jasper.\" I smiled at him shyly, and then at the others. \"It's nice to meet you all \u2014 you have a very beautiful home,\" I added conventionally. \"Thank you,\u201dEsme said. \"We're so glad that you came.\" She spoke with feeling, and I realized that she thought I was brave. I also realized that Rosalie and Emmett were nowhere to be seen, and I remembered Edward's too-innocent denial when I'd asked him if the others didn't like me. Carlisle's expression distracted me from this train of thought; he was gazing meaningfully at Edward with an intense expression. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Edward nod once. I looked away, trying to be polite. My eyes wandered again to the beautiful instrument on the platform by the door. I suddenly remembered my childhood fantasy that, should I ever win a lottery, I would buy a grand piano for my mother. She wasn't really good \u2014 she only played for herself on our secondhand upright \u2014 but I loved to watch her play. She was happy, absorbed \u2014 she seemed like a new, mysterious being to me then, someone outside the \"mom\" persona I took for granted. She'd put me through lessons, of course, but like most kids, I whined until she let me quit. Esme noticed my preoccupation. \"Do you play?\" she asked, inclining her head toward the piano. I shook my head. \"Not at all. But it's so beautiful. Is it yours?\" \"No,\" she laughed. \"Edward didn't tell you he was musical?\" \"No.\" I glared at his suddenly innocent expression with narrowed eyes. \"I should have known, I guess.\" Esme raised her delicate eyebrows in confusion. \"Edward can do everything, right?\" I explained. Jasper snickered and Esme gave Edward a reproving look. \"I hope you haven't been showing off\u2014 it's rude,\" she scolded. \"Just a bit,\u201dHe laughed freely. Her face softened at the sound, and they shared a brief look that I didn't understand, though Esme's face seemed almost smug. \"He's been too modest, actually,\" I corrected. \"Well, play for her,\u201dEsme encouraged. \"You just said showing off was rude,\u201dHe objected. \"There are exceptions to every rule,\" she replied. \"I'd like to hear you play,\" I volunteered. \"It's settled then.\u201dEsme pushed him toward the piano. He pulled me along, sitting me on the bench beside him. He gave me a long, exasperated look before he turned to the keys. And then his fingers flowed swiftly across the ivory, and the room was filled with a composition so complex, so luxuriant, it was impossible to believe only one set of hands played. I felt my chin drop, my mouth open in astonishment, and heard low chuckles behind me at my reaction. Edward looked at me casually, the music still surging around us without a break, and winked. \"Do you like it?\" \"You wrote this?\" I gasped, understanding. He nodded. \"It's Esme's favorite.\" I closed my eyes, shaking my head. \"What's wrong?\" \"I'm feeling extremely insignificant.\" The music slowed, transforming into something softer, and to my surprise I detected the melody of his lullaby weaving through the profusion of notes. \"You inspired this one,\u201dHe said softly. The music grew unbearably sweet. I couldn't speak. \"They like you, you know,\u201dHe said conversationally. \"Esme especially.\" I glanced behind me, but the huge room was empty now. \"Where did they go?\" \"Very subtly giving us some privacy, I suppose.\" I sighed. \"They like me. But Rosalie and Emmett\u2026\" I trailed off, not sure how to express my doubts. He frowned. \"Don't worry about Rosalie,\u201dHe said, his eyes wide and persuasive. \"She'll come around.\" I pursed my lips skeptically. \"Emmett?\" \"Well, he thinks I'm a lunatic, it's true, but he doesn't have a problem with you. He's trying to reason with Rosalie.\" \"What is it that upsets her?\" I wasn't sure if I wanted to know the answer. He sighed deeply. \"Rosalie struggles the most with\u2026 with what we are.\u00a0 It's hard for her to have someone on the outside know the truth. And she's a little jealous.\" \"Rosalie is jealous of me?\" I asked incredulously. I tried to imagine a universe in which someone as breathtaking as Rosalie would have any possible reason to feel jealous of someone like me. \"You're human.\u201dHe shrugged. \"She wishes that she were, too.\" \"Oh,\" I muttered, still stunned. \"Even Jasper, though\u2026\" \"That's really my fault,\u201dHe said. \"I told you he was the most recent to try our way of life. I warned him to keep his distance.\" I thought about the reason for that, and shuddered. \"Esme and Carlisle\u2026 ?\" I continued quickly, to keep him from noticing. \"Are happy to see me happy. Actually, Esme wouldn't care if you had a third eye and webbed feet. All this time she's been worried about me, afraid that there was something missing from my essential makeup, that I was too young when Carlisle changed me\u2026 She's ecstatic. Every time I touch you, she just about chokes with satisfaction.\" \"Alice seems very\u2026 enthusiastic.\" \"Alice has her own way of looking at things,\u201dHe said through tight lips. \"And you're not going to explain that, are you?\" A moment of wordless communication passed between us. He realized that I knew he was keeping something from me. I realized that he wasn't going to give anything away. Not now. \"So what was Carlisle telling you before?\" His eyebrows pulled together. \"You noticed that, did you?\" I shrugged. \"Of course.\" He looked at me thoughtfully for a few seconds before answering. \"He wanted to tell me some news \u2014 he didn't know if it was something I would share with you.\" \"Will you?\" \"I have to, because I'm going to be a little\u2026 overbearingly protective over the next few days \u2014 or weeks \u2014 and I wouldn't want you to think I'm naturally a tyrant.\" \"What's wrong?\" \"Nothing's wrong, exactly. Alice just sees some visitors coming soon. They know we're here, and they're curious.\" \"Visitors?\" \"Yes\u2026 well, they aren't like us, of course \u2014 in their hunting habits, I mean. They probably won't come into town at all, but I'm certainly not going to let you out of my sight till they're gone.\" I shivered. \"Finally, a rational response!\u201dHe murmured. \"I was beginning to think you had no sense of self-preservation at all.\" I let that one pass, looking away, my eyes wandering again around the spacious room. He followed my gaze. \"Not what you expected, is it?\u201dHe asked, his voice smug. \"No,\" I admitted. \"No coffins, no piled skulls in the corners; I don't even think we have cobwebs\u2026 what a disappointment this must be for you,\u201dHe continued slyly. I ignored his teasing. \"It's so light\u2026 so open.\" He was more serious when he answered. \"It's the one place we never have to hide.\" ,  The song he was still playing, my song, drifted to an end, the final chords shifting to a more melancholy key. The last note hovered poignantly in the silence. \"Thank you,\" I murmured. I realized there were tears in my eyes. I dabbed at them, embarrassed. He touched the corner of my eye, trapping one I missed. He lifted his finger, examining the drop of moisture broodingly. Then, so quickly I couldn't be positive that he really did, he put his finger to his mouth to taste it. I looked at him questioningly, and he gazed back for a long moment before he finally smiled. \"Do you want to see the rest of the house?\" \"No coffins?\" I verified, the sarcasm in my voice not entirely masking the slight but genuine anxiety I felt. He laughed, taking my hand, leading me away from the piano. \"No coffins,\u201dHe promised. We walked up the massive staircase, my hand trailing along the satin-smooth rail. The long hall at the top of the stairs was paneled with a honey-colored wood, the same as the floorboards. \"Rosalie and Emmett's room\u2026 Carlisle's office\u2026 Alice's room\u2026\u201dHe gestured as he led me past the doors. He would have continued, but I stopped dead at the end of the hall, staring incredulously at the ornament hanging on the wall above my head. Edward chuckled at my bewildered expression. \"You can laugh,\u201dHe said. \"It is sort of ironic.\" I didn't laugh. My hand raised automatically, one finger extended as if to touch the large wooden cross, its dark patina contrasting with the lighter tone of the wall. I didn't touch it, though I was curious if the aged wood would feel as silky as it looked. \"It must be very old,\" I guessed. He shrugged. \"Early sixteen-thirties, more or less.\" I looked away from the cross to stare at him. \"Why do you keep this here?\" I wondered. \"Nostalgia. It belonged to Carlisle's father.\" \"He collected antiques?\" I suggested doubtfully. \"No. He carved this himself. It hung on the wall above the pulpit in the vicarage where he preached.\" I wasn't sure if my face betrayed my shock, but I returned to gazing at the simple, ancient cross, just in case. I quickly did the mental math; the cross was over three hundred and seventy years old. The silence stretched on as I struggled to wrap my mind around the concept of so many years. \"Are you all right?\u201dHe sounded worried. \"How old is Carlisle?\" I asked quietly, ignoring his question, still staring up. \"He just celebrated his three hundred and sixty-second birthday,\u201dEdward said. I looked back at him, a million questions in my eyes. He watched me carefully as he spoke. \"Carlisle was born in London, in the sixteen-forties, he believes. Time wasn't marked as accurately then, for the common people anyway. It was just before Cromwell's rule, though.\" I kept my face composed, aware of his scrutiny as I listened. It was easier if I didn't try to believe. \"He was the only son of an Anglican pastor. His mother died giving birth to him. His father was an intolerant man. As the Protestants came into power, he was enthusiastic in his persecution of Roman Catholics and other religions. He also believed very strongly in the reality of evil. He led hunts for witches, werewolves\u2026 and vampires.\" I grew very still at the word. I'm sure he noticed, but he went on without pausing. \"They burned a lot of innocent people \u2014 of course the real creatures that he sought were not so easy to catch. \"When the pastor grew old, he placed his obedient son in charge of the raids. At first Carlisle was a disappointment; he was not quick to accuse, to see demons where they did not exist. But he was persistent, and more clever than his father. He actually discovered a coven of true vampires that lived hidden in the sewers of the city, only coming out by night to hunt. In those days, when monsters were not just myths and legends, that was the way many lived. \"The people gathered their pitchforks and torches, of course\" \u2014 his brief laugh was darker now \u2014 \"and waited where Carlisle had seen the monsters exit into the street. Eventually one emerged.\" His voice was very quiet; I strained to catch the words. \"He must have been ancient, and weak with hunger. Carlisle heard him call out in Latin to the others when he caught the scent of the mob. He ran through the streets, and Carlisle \u2014 he was twenty-three and very fast \u2014 was in the lead of the pursuit. The creature could have easily outrun them, but Carlisle thinks he was too hungry, so he turned and attacked. He fell on Carlisle first, but the others were close behind, and he turned to defend himself. He killed two men, and made off with a third, leaving Carlisle bleeding in the street.\" He paused. I could sense he was editing something, keeping something from me. \"Carlisle knew what his father would do. The bodies would be burned \u2014 anything infected by the monster must be destroyed. Carlisle acted instinctively to save his own life. He crawled away from the alley while the mob followed the fiend and his victim. He hid in a cellar, buried himself in rotting potatoes for three days. It's a miracle he was able to keep silent, to stay undiscovered. \"It was over then, and he realized what he had become.\" I'm not sure what my face was revealing, but he suddenly broke off. \"How are you feeling?\u201dHe asked. \"I'm fine,\" I assured him. And, though I bit my lip in hesitation, he must have seen the curiosity burning in my eyes. He smiled. \"I expect you have a few more questions for me.\" \"A few.\" His smile widened over his brilliant teeth. He started back down the hall, pulling me along by the hand. \"Come on, then,\u201dHe encouraged. \"I'll show you.\"",

            "en": "Ch\u1ea1ng V\u1ea1ng - Twilight             I'd never given much thought to how I would die \u2014 though I'd had reason enough in the last few months \u2014 but even if I had, I would not have imagined it like this. I stared without breathing across the long room, into the dark eyes of the hunter, and he looked pleasantly back at me. Surely it was a good way to die, in the place of someone else, someone I loved. Noble, even. That ought to count for something. I knew that if I'd never gone to Forks, I wouldn't be facing death now. But, terrified as I was, I couldn't bring myself to regret the decision. When life offers you a dream so far beyond any of your expectations, it's not reasonable to grieve when it comes to an end. The hunter smiled in a friendly way as he sauntered forward to kill me. 1.\u00a0 FIRST SIGHT My mother drove me to the airport with the windows rolled down. It was seventy-five degrees in Phoenix, the sky a perfect, cloudless blue. I was wearing my favorite shirt \u2014 sleeveless, white eyelet lace; I was wearing it as a farewell gesture. My carry-on item was a parka. In the Olympic Peninsula of northwest Washington State, a small town named Forks exists under a near-constant cover of clouds. It rains on this inconsequential town more than any other place in the United States of America. It was from this town and its gloomy, omnipresent shade that my mother escaped with me when I was only a few months old. It was in this town that I'd been compelled to spend a month every summer until I was fourteen. That was the year I finally put my foot down; these past three summers, my dad, Charlie, vacationed with me in California for two weeks instead.  It was to Forks that I now exiled myself\u2014 an action that I took with great horror. I detested Forks. I loved Phoenix. I loved the sun and the blistering heat. I loved the vigorous, sprawling city. \"Bella,\" my mom said to me \u2014 the last of a thousand times \u2014 before I got on the plane.\u201d You don't have to do this.\" My mom looks like me, except with short hair and laugh lines. I felt a spasm of panic as I stared at her wide, childlike eyes. How could I leave my loving, erratic, harebrained mother to fend for herself? Of course she had Phil now, so the bills would probably get paid, there would be food in the refrigerator, gas in her car, and someone to call when she got lost, but still\u2026 \"I want to go,\" I lied. I'd always been a bad liar, but I'd been saying this lie so frequently lately that it sounded almost convincing now. \"Tell Charlie I said hi.\" \"I will.\" \"I'll see you soon,\" she insisted.\u201d You can come home whenever you want \u2014 I'll come right back as soon as you need me.\" But I could see the sacrifice in her eyes behind the promise.  \"Don't worry about me,\" I urged.\u201d It'll be great. I love you, Mom.\" She hugged me tightly for a minute, and then I got on the plane, and she was gone. It's a four-hour flight from Phoenix to Seattle, another hour in a small plane up to Port Angeles, and then an hour drive back down to Forks. Flying doesn't bother me; the hour in the car with Charlie, though, I was a little worried about. Charlie had really been fairly nice about the whole thing. He seemed genuinely pleased that I was coming to live with him for the first time with any degree of permanence. He'd already gotten me registered for high school and was going to help me get a car. But it was sure to be awkward with Charlie. Neither of us was what anyone would call verbose, and I didn't know what there was to say regardless. I knew he was more than a little confused by my decision \u2014 like my mother before me, I hadn't made a secret of my distaste for Forks. When I landed in Port Angeles, it was raining. I didn't see it as an omen \u2014 just unavoidable. I'd already said my goodbyes to the sun. Charlie was waiting for me with the cruiser. This I was expecting, too.  Charlie is Police Chief Swan to the good people of Forks. My primary motivation behind buying a car, despite the scarcity of my funds, was that I refused to be driven around town in a car with red and blue lights on top. Nothing slows down traffic like a cop. Charlie gave me an awkward, one-armed hug when I stumbled my way off the plane. \"It's good to see you, Bells,\" he said, smiling as he automatically caught and <em>steadied</em> me.\u201d You haven't changed much. How's Ren\u00e9e?\" \"Mom's fine. It's good to see you, too, Dad.\" I wasn't allowed to call him Charlie to his face. I had only a few bags. Most of my Arizona clothes were too permeable for Washington. My mom and I had pooled our resources to supplement my winter wardrobe, but it was still scanty. It all fit easily into the trunk of the cruiser. \"I found a good car for you, really cheap,\" he announced when we were strapped in. \"What kind of car?\" I was suspicious of the way he said \"good car for you\" as opposed to just \"good car.\" \"Well, it's a truck actually, a Chevy.\" \"Where did you find it?\" \"Do you remember Billy Black down at La Push?\" La Push is the tiny Indian reservation on the coast. \"No.\" \"He used to go fishing with us during the summer,\" Charlie prompted.  That would explain why I didn't remember him. I do a good job of blocking painful, unnecessary things from my memory. \"He's in a wheelchair now,\" Charlie continued when I didn't respond, \"so he can't drive anymore, and he offered to sell me his truck cheap.\" \"What year is it?\" I could see from his change of expression that this was the question he was hoping I wouldn't ask. \"Well, Billy's done a lot of work on the engine \u2014 it's only a few years old, really.\" I hoped he didn't think so little of me as to believe I would give up that easily.\u201d When did he buy it?\" \"He bought it in 1984, I think.\" \"Did he buy it new?\" \"Well, no. I think it was new in the early sixties \u2014 or late fifties at the earliest,\" he admitted sheepishly. \"Ch \u2014 Dad, I don't really know anything about cars. I wouldn't be able to fix it if anything went wrong, and I couldn't afford a mechanic\u2026\" \"Really, Bella, the thing runs great. They don't build them like that anymore.\" The thing, I thought to myself\u2026 it had possibilities \u2014 as a nickname, at the very least. \"How cheap is cheap?\" After all, that was the part I couldn't compromise on. \"Well, honey, I kind of already bought it for you. As a homecoming gift.\" Charlie peeked sideways at me with a hopeful expression. Wow. Free. \"You didn't need to do that, Dad. I was going to buy myself a car.\" \"I don't mind. I want you to be happy here.\" He was looking ahead at the road when he said this. Charlie wasn't comfortable with expressing his emotions out loud. I inherited that from him. So I was looking straight ahead as I responded. \"That's really nice, Dad. Thanks. I really appreciate it.\" No need to add that my being happy in Forks is an impossibility. He didn't need to suffer along with me. And I never looked a free truck in the mouth \u2014 or engine. \"Well, now, you're welcome,\" he mumbled, embarrassed by my thanks.  We exchanged a few more comments on the weather, which was wet, and that was pretty much it for Conversation. We stared out the windows in silence. It was beautiful, of course; I couldn't deny that. Everything was green: the trees, their trunks covered with moss, their branches hanging with a canopy of it, the ground covered with ferns. Even the air filtered down greenly through the leaves. Eventually we made it to Charlie's. He still lived in the small, two-bedroom house that he'd bought with my mother in the early days of their marriage. Those were the only kind of days their marriage had \u2014 the early ones. There, parked on the street in front of the house that never changed, was my new \u2014 well, new to me \u2014 truck. It was a faded red color, with big, rounded fenders and a bulbous cab. To my intense surprise, I loved it. I didn't know if it would run, but I could see myself in it. Plus, it was one of those solid iron affairs that never gets damaged \u2014 the kind you see at the scene of an accident, paint unscratched, surrounded by the pieces of the foreign car it had destroyed. \"Wow, Dad, I love it! Thanks!\" Now my horrific day tomorrow would be just that much less dreadful. I wouldn't be faced with the choice of either walking two miles in the rain to school or accepting a ride in the Chief's cruiser. \"I'm glad you like it,\" Charlie said gruffly, embarrassed again. It took only one trip to get all my stuff upstairs. I got the west bedroom that faced out over the front yard. The room was familiar; it had been belonged to me since I was born. The wooden floor, the light blue walls, the peaked ceiling, the yellowed lace curtains around the window \u2014 these were all a part of my childhood. The only changes Charlie had ever made were switching the crib for a bed and adding a desk as I grew. The desk now held a secondhand computer, with the phone line for the modem stapled along the floor to the nearest phone jack. This was a stipulation from my mother, so that we could stay in touch easily. The rocking chair from my baby days was still in the corner. There was only one small bathroom at the top of the stairs, which I would have to share with Charlie. I was trying not to dwell too much on that fact. One of the best things about Charlie is he doesn't hover. He left me alone to unpack and get settled, a feat that would have been altogether impossible for my mother. It was nice to be alone, not to have to smile and look pleased; a relief to stare dejectedly out the window at the sheeting rain and let just a few tears escape. I wasn't in the mood to go on a real crying jag. I would save that for bedtime, when I would have to think about the coming morning. Forks High School had a frightening total of only three hundred and fifty-seven \u2014 now fifty-eight \u2014 students; there were more than seven hundred people in my junior class alone back home. All of the kids here had grown up together \u2014 their grandparents had been toddlers together. I would be the new girl from the big city, a curiosity, a freak. Maybe, if I looked like a girl from Phoenix should, I could work this to my advantage. But physically, I'd never fit in anywhere. I should be tan, sporty, blond \u2014 a volleyball player, or a cheerleader, perhaps \u2014 all the things that go with living in the valley of the sun. Instead, I was ivory-skinned, without even the excuse of blue eyes or red hair, despite the constant sunshine. I had always been slender, but soft somehow, obviously not an athlete; I didn't have the necessary hand-eye coordination to play sports without humiliating myself \u2014 and harming both myself and anyone else who stood too close. When I finished putting my clothes in the old pine dresser, I took my bag of bathroom necessities and went to the communal bathroom to clean myself up after the day of travel. I looked at my face in the mirror as I brushed through my tangled, damp hair. Maybe it was the light, but already I looked sallower, unhealthy. My skin could be pretty \u2014 it was very clear, almost translucent-looking \u2014 but it all depended on color. I had no color here. Facing my pallid reflection in the mirror, I was forced to admit that I was lying to myself. It wasn't just physically that I'd never fit in. And if I couldn't find a niche in a school with three thousand people, what were my chances here? I didn't relate well to people my age. Maybe the truth was that I didn't relate well to people, period. Even my mother, who I was closer to than anyone else on the planet, was never in harmony with me, never on exactly the same page. Sometimes I wondered if I was seeing the same things through my eyes that the rest of the world was seeing through theirs. Maybe there was a glitch in my brain. But the cause didn't matter. All that mattered was the effect. And tomorrow would be just the beginning.  I didn't sleep well that night, even after I was done crying. The constant whooshing of the rain and wind across the roof wouldn't fade into the background. I pulled the faded old quilt over my head, and later added the pillow, too. But I couldn't fall asleep until after midnight, when the rain finally settled into a quieter drizzle. Thick fog was all I could see out my window in the morning, and I could feel the \u00a0claustrophobia creeping up on me. You could never see the sky here; it was like a cage. Breakfast with Charlie was a quiet event. He wished me good luck at school. I thanked him, knowing his hope was wasted. Good luck tended to avoid me. Charlie left first, off to the police station that was his wife and family. After he left, I sat at the old square oak table in one of the three unmatching chairs and examined his small kitchen, with its dark paneled walls, bright yellow cabinets, and white linoleum floor. Nothing was changed. My mother had painted the cabinets eighteen years ago in an attempt to bring some sunshine into the house. Over the small fireplace in the adjoining handkerchief-sized family room was a row of pictures. First a wedding picture of Charlie and my mom in Las Vegas, then one of the three of us in the hospital after I was born, taken by a helpful nurse, followed by the procession of my school pictures up to last year's. Those were embarrassing to look at \u2014 I would have to see what I could do to get Charlie to put them somewhere else, at least while I was living here. It was impossible, being in this house, not to realize that Charlie had never gotten over my mom. It made me uncomfortable. I didn't want to be too early to school, but I couldn't stay in the house anymore. I donned my jacket \u2014 which had the feel of a biohazard suit \u2014 and headed out into the rain. It was just drizzling still, not enough to soak me through immediately as I reached for the house key that was always hidden under the eaves by the door, and locked up. The sloshing of my new waterproof boots was unnerving. I missed the normal crunch of gravel as I walked. I couldn't pause and admire my truck again as I wanted; I was in a hurry to get out of the misty wet that swirled around my head and clung to my hair under my hood. Inside the truck, it was nice and dry. Either Billy or Charlie had obviously cleaned it up, but the tan upholstered seats still smelled faintly of tobacco, gasoline, and peppermint. The engine started quickly, to my relief, but loudly, roaring to life and then idling at top volume. Well, a truck this old was bound to have a flaw. The antique radio worked, a plus that I hadn't expected. Finding the school wasn't difficult, though I'd never been there before. The school was, like most other things, just off the highway. It was not obvious that it was a school; only the sign, which declared it to be the Forks High School, made me stop. It looked like a collection of matching houses, built with maroon-colored bricks. There were so many trees and shrubs I couldn't see its size at first. Where was the feel of the institution? I wondered nostalgically. Where were the chain-link fences, the metal detectors? I parked in front of the first building, which had a small sign over the door reading front office. No one else was parked there, so I was sure it was off limits, but I decided I would get directions inside instead of circling around in the rain like an idiot. I stepped unwillingly out of the toasty truck cab and walked down a little stone path lined with dark hedges. I took a deep breath before opening the door.  Inside, it was brightly lit, and warmer than I'd hoped. The office was small; a little waiting area with padded folding chairs, orange-flecked commercial carpet, notices and awards cluttering the walls, a big clock ticking loudly. Plants grew everywhere in large plastic pots, as if there wasn't enough greenery outside. The room was cut in half by a long counter, cluttered with wire baskets full of papers and brightly colored flyers taped to its front. There were three desks behind the counter, one of which was manned by a large, red-haired woman wearing glasses. She was wearing a purple t-shirt, which immediately made me feel overdressed. The red-haired woman looked up.\u201d Can I help you?\" \"I'm Isabella Swan,\" I informed her, and saw the immediate awareness light her eyes. I was expected, a topic of gossip no doubt. Daughter of the Chief's flighty ex-wife, come home at last. \"Of course,\" she said. She dug through a precariously stacked pile of documents on her desk till she found the ones she was looking for.\u201d I have your schedule right here, and a map of the school.\" She brought several sheets to the counter to show me. She went through my classes for me, highlighting the best route to each on the map, and gave me a slip to have each teacher sign, which I was to bring back at the end of the day. She smiled at me and hoped, like Charlie, that I would like it here in Forks. I smiled back as convincingly as I could. When I went back out to my truck, other students were starting to arrive. I drove around the school, following the line of traffic. I was glad to see that most of the cars were older like mine, nothing flashy. At home I'd lived in one of the few lower-income neighborhoods that were included in the Paradise Valley District. It was a common thing to see a new Mercedes or Porsche in the student lot. The nicest car here was a shiny Volvo, and it stood out. Still, I cut the engine as soon as I was in a spot, so that the thunderous volume wouldn't draw attention to me. I looked at the map in the truck, trying to memorize it now; hopefully I wouldn't have to walk around with it stuck in front of my nose all day. I stuffed everything in my bag, slung the strap over my shoulder, and sucked in a huge breath. I can do this, I lied to myself feebly. No one was going to bite me. I finally exhaled and stepped out of the truck.  I kept my face pulled back into my hood as I walked to the sidewalk, crowded with teenagers. My plain black jacket didn't stand out, I noticed with relief. Once I got around the cafeteria, building three was easy to spot. A large black \"3\" was painted on a white square on the east corner. I felt my breathing gradually creeping toward hyperventilation as I approached the door. I tried holding my breath as I followed two unisex raincoats through the door.  The classroom was small. The people in front of me stopped just inside the door to hang up their coats on a long row of hooks. I copied them.  They were two girls, one a porcelain-colored blonde, the other also pale, with light brown hair. At least my skin wouldn't be a standout here.  I took the slip up to the teacher, a tall, balding man whose desk had a nameplate identifying him as Mr. Mason. He gawked at me when he saw my name \u2014 not an encouraging response \u2014 and of course I flushed tomato red. But at least he sent me to an empty desk at the back without introducing me to the class. It was harder for my new classmates to stare at me in the back, but somehow, they managed. I kept my eyes down on the reading list the teacher had given me. It was fairly basic: Bronte, Shakespeare, Chaucer, Faulkner. I'd already read everything. That was comforting\u2026 and boring. I wondered if my mom would send me my folder of old essays, or if she would think that was cheating. I went through different arguments with her in my head while the teacher droned on. When the bell rang, a nasal buzzing sound, a gangly boy with skin problems and hair black as an oil slick leaned across the aisle to talk to me. \"You're Isabella Swan, aren't you?\" He looked like the overly helpful, chess club type. \"Bella,\" I corrected. Everyone within a three-seat radius turned to look at me. \"Where's your next class?\" he asked.  I had to check in my bag.\u201d Um, Government, with Jefferson, in building six.\" There was nowhere to look without meeting curious eyes.  \"I'm headed toward building four, I could show you the way\u2026\" Definitely over-helpful.\u201d I'm Eric,\" he added. I smiled tentatively.\u201d Thanks.\" We got our jackets and headed out into the rain, which had picked up. I could have sworn several people behind us were walking close enough to eavesdrop. I hoped I wasn't getting paranoid. \"So, this is a lot different than Phoenix, huh?\" he asked. \"Very.\" \"It doesn't rain much there, does it?\" \"Three or four times a year.\" \"Wow, what must that be like?\" he wondered. \"Sunny,\" I told him. \"You don't look very tan.\" \"My mother is part albino.\" He studied my face apprehensively, and I sighed. It looked like clouds and a sense of humor didn't mix. A few months of this and I'd forget how to use sarcasm. We walked back around the cafeteria, to the south buildings by the gym. Eric walked me right to the door, though it was clearly marked. \"Well, good luck,\" he said as I touched the handle.\u201d Maybe we'll have some other classes together.\" He sounded hopeful. I smiled at him vaguely and went inside.  The rest of the morning passed in about the same fashion. My Trigonometry teacher, Mr. Varner, who I would have hated anyway just because of the subject he taught, was the only one who made me stand in front of the class and introduce myself. I stammered, blushed, and tripped over my own boots on the way to my seat. After two classes, I started to recognize several of the faces in each class. There was always someone braver than the others who would introduce themselves and ask me questions about how I was liking Forks. I tried to be diplomatic, but mostly I just lied a lot. At least I never needed the map. One girl sat next to me in both Trig and Spanish, and she walked with me to the cafeteria for lunch. She was tiny, several inches shorter than my five feet four inches, but her wildly curly dark hair made up a lot of the difference between our heights. I couldn't remember her name, so I smiled and nodded as she prattled about teachers and classes. I didn't try to keep up. We sat at the end of a full table with several of her friends, who she introduced to me. I forgot all their names as soon as she spoke them. They seemed impressed by her bravery in speaking to me. The boy from English, Eric, waved at me from across the room. It was there, sitting in the lunchroom, trying to make conversation with seven curious strangers, that I first saw them. They were sitting in the corner of the cafeteria, as far away from where I sat as possible in the long room. There were five of them. They weren't talking, and they weren't eating, though they each had a tray of untouched food in front of them. They weren't gawking at me, unlike most of the other students, so it was safe to stare at them without fear of meeting an excessively interested pair of eyes. But it was none of these things that caught, and held, my attention. They didn't look anything alike. Of the three boys, one was big \u2014 muscled like a serious weight lifter, with dark, curly hair. Another was taller, leaner, but still muscular, and honey blond. The last was lanky, less bulky, with untidy, bronze-colored hair. He was more boyish than the others, who looked like they could be in college, or even teachers here rather than students. The girls were opposites. The tall one was statuesque. She had a beautiful figure, the kind you saw on the cover of the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue, the kind that made every girl around her take a hit on her self-esteem just by being in the same room. Her hair was golden, gently waving to the middle of her back. The short girl was pixielike, thin in the extreme, with small features. Her hair was a deep black, cropped short and pointing in every direction. And yet, they were all exactly alike. Every one of them was chalky pale, the palest of all the students living in this sunless town. Paler than me, the albino. They all had very dark eyes despite the range in hair tones. They also had dark shadows under those eyes \u2014 purplish, bruiselike shadows. As if they were all suffering from a sleepless night, or almost\u00a0 done recovering from a broken nose. Though their noses, all their features, were straight, perfect, angular.  But all this is not why I couldn't look away. I stared because their faces, so different, so similar, were all devastatingly, inhumanly beautiful. They were faces you never expected to see except perhaps on the airbrushed pages of a fashion magazine. Or painted by an old master as the face of an angel. It was hard to decide who was the most beautiful \u2014 maybe the perfect blond girl, or the bronze-haired boy. They were all looking away \u2014 away from each other, away from the other students, away from anything in particular as far as I could tell. As I watched, the small girl rose with her tray \u2014 unopened soda, unbitten apple \u2014 and walked away with a quick, graceful lope that belonged on a runway. I watched, amazed at her lithe dancer's step, till she dumped her tray and glided through the back door, faster than I would have thought possible. My eyes darted back to the others, who sat unchanging. \"Who are they?\" I asked the girl from my Spanish class, whose name I'd forgotten. As she looked up to see who I meant \u2014 though already knowing, probably, from my tone \u2014 suddenly he looked at her, the thinner one, the boyish one, the youngest, perhaps. He looked at my neighbor for just a fraction of a second, and then his dark eyes flickered to mine. He looked away quickly, more quickly than I could, though in a flush of embarrassment I dropped my eyes at once. In that brief flash of a glance, his face held nothing of interest \u2014 it was as if she had called his name, and he'd looked up in involuntary response, already having decided not to answer.  My neighbor giggled in embarrassment, looking at the table like I did.  \"That's Edward and Emmett Cullen, and Rosalie and Jasper Hale. The one who left was Alice Cullen; they all live together with Dr. Cullen and his wife.\" She said this under her breath. I glanced sideways at the beautiful boy, who was looking at his tray now, picking a bagel to pieces with long, pale fingers. His mouth was moving very quickly, his perfect lips barely opening.  The other three still looked away, and yet I felt he was speaking quietly to them. Strange, unpopular names, I thought. The kinds of names grandparents had.  But maybe that was in vogue here \u2014 small town names? I finally remembered that my neighbor was called Jessica, a perfectly common name. There were two girls named Jessica in my History class back home. \"They are\u2026 very nice-looking.\" I struggled with the conspicuous understatement. \"Yes!\" Jessica agreed with another giggle.\u201d They're all together though \u2014 Emmett and Rosalie, and Jasper and Alice, I mean. And they live together.\" Her voice held all the shock and condemnation of the small town, I thought critically. But, if I was being honest, I had to admit that even in Phoenix, it would cause gossip. \"Which ones are the Cullens?\" I asked.\u201d They don't look related\u2026\" \"Oh, they're not. Dr. Cullen is really young, in his twenties or early thirties. They're all adopted. The Hales are brother and sister, twins \u2014 the blondes \u2014 and they're foster children.\" \"They look a little old for foster children.\" \"They are now, Jasper and Rosalie are both eighteen, but they've been with Mrs. Cullen since they were eight. She's their aunt or something like that.\" \"That's really kind of nice \u2014 for them to take care of all those kids like that, when they're so young and everything.\" \"I guess so,\" Jessica admitted reluctantly, and I got the impression that she didn't like the doctor and his wife for some reason. With the glances she was throwing at their adopted children, I would presume the reason was jealousy.\u201d I think that Mrs. Cullen can't have any kids, though,\" she added, as if that lessened their kindness. Throughout all this conversation, my eyes flickered again and again to the table where the strange family sat. They continued to look at the walls and not eat. \"Have they always lived in Forks?\" I asked. Surely I would have noticed them on one of my summers here. \"No,\" she said in a voice that implied it should be obvious, even to a new arrival like me.\u201d They just moved down two years ago from somewhere in Alaska.\" I felt a surge of pity, and relief. Pity because, as beautiful as they were, they were outsiders, clearly not accepted. Relief that I wasn't the only newcomer here, and certainly not the most interesting by any standard. As I examined them, the youngest, one of the Cullens, looked up and met my gaze, this time with evident curiosity in his expression. As I looked swiftly away, it seemed to me that his glance held some kind of unmet expectation. \"Which one is the boy with the reddish brown hair?\" I asked. I peeked at him from the corner of my eye, and he was still staring at me, but not gawking like the other students had today \u2014 he had a slightly frustrated expression. I looked down again. \"That's Edward. He's gorgeous, of course, but don't waste your time. He doesn't date. Apparently none of the girls here are good-looking enough for him.\" She sniffed, a clear case of sour grapes. I wondered when he'd turned her down. I bit my lip to hide my smile. Then I glanced at him again. His face was turned away, but I thought his cheek appeared lifted, as if he were smiling, too. After a few more minutes, the four of them left the table together. They all were noticeably graceful \u2014 even the big, brawny one. It was unsettling to watch. The one named Edward didn't look at me again. I sat at the table with Jessica and her friends longer than I would have if I'd been sitting alone. I was anxious not to be late for class on my first day. One of my new acquaintances, who considerately reminded me that her name was Angela, had Biology II with me the next hour. We walked to class together in silence. She was shy, too. When we entered the classroom, Angela went to sit at a black-topped lab table exactly like the ones I was used to. She already had a neighbor. In fact, all the tables were filled but one. Next to the center aisle, I recognized Edward Cullen by his unusual hair, sitting next to that single open seat.  As I walked down the aisle to introduce myself to the teacher and get my slip signed, I was watching him surreptitiously. Just as I passed, he suddenly went rigid in his seat. He stared at me again, meeting my eyes with the strangest expression on his face \u2014 it was hostile, furious. I looked away quickly, shocked, going red again. I stumbled over a book in the walkway and had to catch myself on the edge of a table. The girl sitting there giggled. I'd noticed that his eyes were black \u2014 coal black. Mr. Banner signed my slip and handed me a book with no nonsense about introductions. I could tell we were going to get along. Of course, he had no choice but to send me to the one open seat in the middle of the room. I kept my eyes down as I went to sit by him, bewildered by the antagonistic stare he'd given me. I didn't look up as I set my book on the table and took my seat, but I saw his posture change from the corner of my eye. He was leaning away from me, sitting on the extreme edge of his chair and averting his face like he smelled something bad. Inconspicuously, I sniffed my hair. It smelled like strawberries, the scent of my favorite shampoo. It seemed an innocent enough odor. I let my hair fall over my right shoulder, making a dark curtain between us, and tried to pay attention to the teacher. Unfortunately the lecture was on cellular anatomy, something I'd already studied. I took notes carefully anyway, always looking down. I couldn't stop myself from peeking occasionally through the screen of my hair at the strange boy next to me. During the whole class, he never relaxed his stiff position on the edge of his chair, sitting as far from me as possible. I could see his hand on his left leg was clenched into a fist, tendons standing out under his pale skin. This, too, he never relaxed. He had the long sleeves of his white shirt pushed up to his elbows, and his forearm was surprisingly hard and muscular beneath his light skin. He wasn't nearly as slight as he'd looked next to his burly brother. The class seemed to drag on longer than the others. Was it because the day was finally coming to a close, or because I was waiting for his tight fist to loosen? It never did; he continued to sit so still it looked like he wasn't breathing. What was wrong with him? Was this his normal behavior? I questioned my judgment on Jessica's bitterness at lunch today. Maybe she was not as resentful as I'd thought.  It couldn't have anything to do with me. He didn't know me from Eve.  I peeked up at him one more time, and regretted it. He was glaring down at me again, his black eyes full of revulsion. As I flinched away from him, shrinking against my chair, the phrase if looks could kill suddenly ran through my mind. At that moment, the bell rang loudly, making me jump, and Edward Cullen was out of his seat. Fluidly he rose \u2014 he was much taller than I'd thought \u2014 his back to me, and he was out the door before anyone else was out of their seat. I sat frozen in my seat, staring blankly after him. He was so mean. It wasn't fair. I began gathering up my things slowly, trying to block the anger that filled me, for fear my eyes would tear up. For some reason, my temper was hardwired to my tear ducts. I usually cried when I was angry, a humiliating tendency. \"Aren't you Isabella Swan?\" a male voice asked. I looked up to see a cute, baby-faced boy, his pale blond hair carefully gelled into orderly spikes, smiling at me in a friendly way. He obviously didn't think I smelled bad. \"Bella,\" I corrected him, with a smile. \"I'm Mike.\" \"Hi, Mike.\" \"Do you need any help finding your next class?\" \"I'm headed to the gym, actually. I think I can find it.\" \"That's my next class, too.\" He seemed thrilled, though it wasn't that big of a coincidence in a school this small. We walked to class together; he was a chatterer \u2014 he supplied most of the conversation, which made it easy for me. He'd lived in California till he was ten, so he knew how I felt about the sun. It turned out he was in my English class also. He was the nicest person I'd met today. But as we were entering the gym, he asked, \"So, did you stab Edward Cullen with a pencil or what? I've never seen him act like that.\" I cringed. So I wasn't the only one who had noticed. And, apparently, that wasn't Edward Cullen's usual behavior. I decided to play dumb. \"Was that the boy I sat next to in Biology?\" I asked artlessly. \"Yes,\" he said.\u201d He looked like he was in pain or something.\" \"I don't know,\" I responded.\u201d I never spoke to him.\" \"He's a weird guy.\" Mike lingered by me instead of heading to the dressing room.\u201d If I were lucky enough to sit by you, I would have talked to you.\" I smiled at him before walking through the girls' locker room door. He was friendly and clearly admiring. But it wasn't enough to ease my irritation. The Gym teacher, Coach Clapp, found me a uniform but didn't make me dress down for today's class. At home, only two years of RE. were required. Here, P.E. was mandatory all four years. Forks was literally my personal hell on Earth. I watched four volleyball games running simultaneously. Remembering how many injuries I had sustained \u2014 and inflicted \u2014 playing volleyball, I felt faintly nauseated. The final bell rang at last. I walked slowly to the office to return my paperwork. The rain had drifted away, but the wind was strong, and colder. I wrapped my arms around myself. When I walked into the warm office, I almost turned around and walked back out. Edward Cullen stood at the desk in front of me. I recognized again that tousled bronze hair. He didn't appear to notice the sound of my entrance. I stood pressed against the back wall, waiting for the receptionist to be free. He was arguing with her in a low, attractive voice. I quickly picked up the gist of the argument. He was trying to trade from sixth-hour Biology to another time \u2014 any other time. I just couldn't believe that this was about me. It had to be something else, something that happened before I entered the Biology room. The look on his face must have been about another aggravation entirely. It was impossible that this stranger could take such a sudden, intense dislike to me. The door opened again, and the cold wind suddenly gusted through the room, rustling the papers on the desk, swirling my hair around my face. The girl who came in merely stepped to the desk, placed a note in the wire basket, and walked out again. But Edward Cullen's back stiffened, and he turned slowly to glare at me \u2014 his face was absurdly handsome \u2014 with piercing, hate-filled eyes. For an instant, I felt a thrill of genuine fear, raising the hair on my arms. The look only lasted a second, but it chilled me more than the freezing wind. He turned back to the receptionist. \"Never mind, then,\" he said hastily in a voice like velvet.\u201d I can see that it's impossible. Thank you so much for your help.\" And he turned on his heel without another look at me, and disappeared out the door. I went meekly to the desk, my face white for once instead of red, and handed her the signed slip. \"How did your first day go, dear?\" the receptionist asked maternally. \"Fine,\" I lied, my voice weak. She didn't look convinced. When I got to the truck, it was almost the last car in the lot. It seemed like a haven, already the closest thing to home I had in this damp green hole. I sat inside for a while, just staring out the windshield blankly. But soon I was cold enough to need the heater, so I turned the key and the engine roared to life. I headed back to Charlie's house, fighting tears the whole way there.",
