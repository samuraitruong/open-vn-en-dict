A BBC correspondent said Saif al-Islam seemed confident and full of adrenalin. On Monday the rebels met strong resistance from pro-Gaddafi forces as they continued their push. Both sides say they control most of <em>Tripoli</em>. Saif al-Islam Gaddafi turned up at Hotel Rixos in the early hours of Tuesday. He told the BBC's Matthew Price: \"We have broken the backbone of the rebels.\" He added that by moving into <em>Tripoli</em>, the rebels had fallen into \"a trap\". \"We gave them a hard time, so we're winning,\" he said. Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, 39, had been widely regarded as a likely successor to his father. On Sunday the rebels claimed they had captured him, along with other members of his family. Asked if Col Gaddafi was safe and in <em>Tripoli</em>, Saif al-Islam replied: \"Of course.\" The Libyan leader's whereabouts are still unclear. His sprawling Bab al-Azizia compound is being defended by loyalist troops A diplomatic source told AFP news agency that Col Gaddafi could still be there. He has not been seen in public for months, although he has broadcast audio messages from undisclosed locations.  In a broadcast late on Sunday, he urged residents to \"save <em>Tripoli</em>\" from the rebels. In other developments: \u009f Pro-Gaddafi forces fire a suspected Scud missile from near their stronghold city of Sirte, US defence officials tell Reuters news agency  \u009f Col Gaddafi's eldest son Muhammad reportedly escaped from rebel custody hours after being detained  \u009f China and Russia issue statements urging Gaddafi forces to stop fighting  \u009f UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon says leaders of regional blocs will meet in New York later this week  \u009f Egypt formally recognises the rebel National Transitional Council as the legitimate representative of the Libyan people Ambush  The rebels swept into <em>Tripoli</em> from several direction following an uprising in the capital at the weekend. They who were greeted by jubilant crowds in central Green Square when they arrived on Sunday. Rebel fighters have set up checkpoints in parts of the city, and say reinforcements are arriving by boat. But they have met stiff resistance in a number of areas. There was sustained gunfire near the Bab al-Azizia compound in western <em>Tripoli</em> throughout Monday. Gaddafi loyalists also remain in control of the area further south around the Rixos Hotel, where many Western journalists are based. A rebel convoy coming in from the west was ambushed by Gaddafi loyalists using anti-aircraft fire on Monday. The convoy forced to pull out of the city. As night fell the fighting appeared to die down in many areas. Both sides insist they have the upper hand. Government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim claimed late pro-Gaddafi had control of at least 75% of the city, while the rebels said they were holding about 80%. Our correspondents says it is impossible to determine who is telling the truth. World leaders have urged Col Gaddafi to step down. US President Barack Obama said elements of the Gaddafi regime continued to pose a threat. \"But this much is clear: the Gaddafi regime is coming to an end and the future of Libya is in the hands of its people,\" he said. He appealed to Col Gaddafi to reduce further bloodshed by \"explicitly relinquishing power to the people of Libya and calling on those forces that continue to fight to lay down their arms\".",

Dutch officials said Ruben van Assouw would return to the Netherlands with his aunt and uncle on Saturday morning.  The Afriqiyah Airways Airbus 330 crashed short of the runway at <em>Tripoli</em> airport on Wednesday.  The head Libyan investigator has said the pilot reported no problems during the plane's approach to land.  Ruben's aunt and uncle said their nine-year-old nephew was doing well under the circumstances.  \"We have explained to Ruben exactly what happened,\" they said in a statement to journalists in <em>Tripoli</em>.  \"He knows his parents and brother are dead. The whole family is going to bear the responsibility for Ruben's future,\" they said. Ruben had been on holiday in South Africa with his parents, Trudy and Patrick van Assouw, and his older brother, Enzo.  \"The time ahead will be a difficult period for us. We hope that the media will respect our privacy,\" they added.  The family had been celebrating the parents' twelve-and-a-half year wedding anniversary, a Dutch custom.  Dutch foreign ministry officials said the boy, accompanied by his aunt and uncle and a doctor, would return to the Netherlands on Saturday morning.  Sedig Benzala, the head of the team caring for him, said Ruben was recovering well after a four-and-a-half hour operation to repair multiple fractures to his legs.  The Airbus 330 - carrying 93 passengers and 11 crew - crashed on Wednesday morning as it arrived from Johannesburg, South Africa.  The plane's flight recorders have been sent to Paris for examination It is not clear what caused the plane to crash just short of the runway as it approached <em>Tripoli</em> airport.  The head of the investigation team said the pilot had not reported any problems.  \"Until the very last moment things were normal between the pilot and the control tower,\" Neji Dhaou told AFP news agency. Dutch, French, South African and US experts are helping Libya with the investigation.  Dutch forensic experts are helping to identify the bodies.  Most of the passengers on the flight were from the Netherlands.",

            "en": "Gaddafi forces beat up BBC team         Libyan leader Col Muammar Gaddafi's security forces detained and beat up a BBC news team who were trying to reach the strife-torn western city of Zawiya. The three were beaten with fists, knees and rifles, hooded and subjected to mock executions by members of Libya's army and secret police. The men were detained on Monday and held for 21 hours, but have now flown out of Libya.  Government forces are in a fierce fight to wrest Zawiya from rebel control. Artillery and tanks have pounded the city - which lies 50km (30 miles) from the capital <em>Tripoli</em> - over the last four days. 'Gun against neck'  The BBC team showed their identification when they were detained at an army roadblock on Monday. They had been seeking, like many journalists, to get around government restrictions by reaching besieged Zawiya. The three of them were taken to a huge military barracks in <em>Tripoli</em>, where they were blindfolded, handcuffed and beaten. One of the three, Chris Cobb-Smith, said: \"We were lined up against the wall. I was the last in line - facing the wall.  \"I looked and I saw a plain-clothes guy with a small sub-machine gun. He put it to everyone's neck. I saw him and he screamed at me. \"Then he walked up to me, put the gun to my neck and pulled the trigger twice. The bullets whisked past my ear. The soldiers just laughed.\" A second member of the team - Feras Killani, a correspondent of Palestinian descent - is said to have been singled out for repeated beatings. Their captors told him they did not like his reporting of the Libyan popular uprising and accused him of being a spy. The third member of the team, cameraman Goktay Koraltan, said they were all convinced they were going to die. During their detention, the BBC team saw evidence of torture against Libyan detainees, many of whom were from Zawiya. 'Abusive treatment' Koraltan said: \"I cannot describe how bad it was. Most of them [other detainees] were hooded and handcuffed really tightly, all with swollen hands and broken ribs. They were in agony. They were screaming.\" Killani said: \"Four of them [detainees] were in a very bad situation. There was evidence of torture on their faces and bodies. One of them said he had at least two broken ribs. I spent at least six hours helping them drink, sleep, urinate and move from one side to another.\" A senior Libyan government official later apologised for the BBC team's ordeal. But the BBC said in a statement that it \"strongly condemns this abusive treatment\". \"The safety of our staff is our primary concern especially when they are working in such difficult circumstances and it is essential that journalists working for the BBC, or any media organisation, are allowed to report on the situation in Libya without fear of attack,\" said the statement from Liliane Landor, languages controller of BBC Global News.  \"Despite these attacks, the BBC will continue to cover the evolving story in Libya for our audiences both inside and outside the country.\" Rebel bounty  Government forces have been mounting a strong fightback against the rebels who rose up in mid-February to end Col Gaddafi's 41 years in power. The main square of Zawiya reportedly changed hands twice on Wednesday in the fighting between pro-Gaddafi forces and the insurgents. State TV reported that the army had retaken Zawiya, and showed pictures of what it said were residents staging a pro-Gaddafi rally. On the eastern front around the Mediterranean oil port of Ras Lanuf, rebels retreated in the face of heavy government shelling and ongoing air strikes, amid reports that oil facilities were blown up. Col Gaddafi also launched a diplomatic offensive, dispatching envoys overseas on the eve of a summit by Nato defence ministers in Brussels. High-ranking members of the Libyan leader's inner circle were sent to Cairo, Brussels, Lisbon and Malta to approach government officials. The Libyan government meanwhile offered a reward for the capture of rebel leader Mustafa Abdel Jalil, the ex-justice minister. The amount was 500,000 Libyan dinars ($400,000; \u00a3250,000).",

The UNHCR says tens of thousands of people are stuck at the borders and in urgent need of help.  The U.N. refugee agency says the situation at the Libya-Tunisia border is chaotic. It says 14,000 people crossed the border Monday, the highest number to date.  The agency says it is crucial to move tens of thousands of people away from the overcrowded border to avoid a humanitarian crisis. But transportation is scarce.  UNHCR spokeswoman Melissa Fleming says the agency has erected 1,500 tents, which can shelter 12,000 people. And she says two airlifts planned for Thursday will deliver tents and supplies for up to 10,000 people. \u201cWe have now visited the border entry point to Tunisia. What is unfortunate is that thousands of people are waiting on the Libyan side of the border to enter. Some for as long as three days. They are obliged to spend the night outside in the bitter cold without shelter. We are very concerned that a large number of sub-Saharan Africans are not being allowed into Tunisia at this point. We are in negotiation with self-appointed volunteers from the local community who are guarding the border,\" she said. Fleming says nearly 70,000 people have crossed from Libya into Egypt since February 19. She says the majority are Egyptians.  She says the UNHCR is particularly worried about thousands of refugees and asylum-seekers stuck inside Libya. She says the refugees come mainly from Iraq, Palestine, Somalia, Sudan and Eritrea. She says they have been living in Libya for a long time but now are desperate to leave. Fleming reads a recent message sent by a refugee to UNHCR staff in Libya describing the fearful conditions under which he and his family are living. She says refugees and migrants from sub-Saharan Africa are particularly vulnerable. \u201cWe are under attack by local people who are saying that we are mercenaries killing people. Let me say that they did not want to see black people. There is racism. We need help. Please, please, please, where is the humanity? Where is the United Nations? I am crying. I need help. Our home was burnt down. Ten Somalis were killed in Libya in the last seven days. Why is nobody concerned about the Somali migrants in Libya? We are victims of racism and ruthless exploitation,\" she said. Fleming says the UNHCR offers assistance to those refugees who are able to reach its office in <em>Tripoli</em>. She says the agency\u2019s 24-hour hotline continues to receive desperate calls from refugees in Libya and their family members outside. She says they say they feel trapped, threatened and hunted.",
