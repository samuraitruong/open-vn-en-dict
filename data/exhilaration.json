            "en": "18         18. THE HUNT They emerged one by one from the forest edge, ranging a dozen meters apart. The first male into the clearing fell back immediately, allowing the other male to take the front, orienting himself around the tall, dark-haired man in a manner that clearly displayed who led the pack. The third was a woman; from this distance, all I could see of her was that her hair was a startling shade of red. They closed ranks before they continued cautiously toward Edward's family, exhibiting the natural respect of a troop of predators as it encounters a larger, unfamiliar group of its own kind. As they approached, I could see how different they were from the Cullens. Their walk was catlike, a gait that seemed constantly on the edge of shifting into a crouch. They dressed in the ordinary gear of backpackers:\u00a0 jeans and casual button-down shirts in heavy, weatherproof fabrics. The clothes were frayed, though, with wear, and they were barefoot. Both men had cropped hair, but the woman's brilliant orange hair was filled with leaves and debris from the woods. Their sharp eyes carefully took in the more polished, urbane stance of Carlisle, who, flanked by Emmett and Jasper, stepped guardedly forward to meet them. Without any seeming communication between them, they each straightened into a more casual, erect bearing. The man in front was easily the most beautiful, his skin olive-toned beneath the typical pallor, his hair a glossy black. He was of a medium build, hard-muscled, of course, but nothing next to Emmett's brawn. He smiled an easy smile, exposing a flash of gleaming white teeth. The woman was wilder, her eyes shifting restlessly between the men facing her, and the loose grouping around me, her chaotic hair quivering in the slight breeze. Her posture was distinctly feline. The second male hovered unobtrusively behind them, slighter than the leader, his light brown hair and regular features both nondescript. His eyes, though completely still, somehow seemed the most vigilant. Their eyes were different, too. Not the gold or black I had come to expect, but a deep burgundy color that was disturbing and sinister. The dark-haired man, still smiling, stepped toward Carlisle.  \"We thought we heard a game,\" he said in a relaxed voice with the slightest of French accents. \"I'm Laurent, these are Victoria and James.\" He gestured to the vampires beside him. \"I'm Carlisle. This is my family, Emmett and Jasper, Rosalie, Esme and Alice, Edward and Bella.\" He pointed us out in groups, deliberately not calling attention to individuals. I felt a shock when he said my name. \"Do you have room for a few more players?\" Laurent asked sociably. Carlisle matched Laurent's friendly tone. \"Actually, we were just finishing up. But we'd certainly be interested another time. Are you planning to stay in the area for long?\" \"We're headed north, in fact, but we were curious to see who was in the neighborhood. We haven't run into any company in a long time.\" \"No, this region is usually empty except for us and the occasional visitor, like yourselves.\" The tense atmosphere had slowly subsided into a casual conversation; I guessed that Jasper was using his peculiar gift to control the situation. \"What's your hunting range?\" Laurent casually inquired. Carlisle ignored the assumption behind the inquiry. \"The Olympic Range here, up and down the Coast Ranges on occasion. We keep a permanent residence nearby. There's another permanent settlement like ours up near Denali.\" Laurent rocked back on his heels slightly. \"Permanent? How do you manage that?\" There was honest curiosity in his voice. \"Why don't you come back to our home with us and we can talk comfortably?\" Carlisle invited. \"It's a rather long story.\" James and Victoria exchanged a surprised look at the mention of the word \"home,\" but Laurent controlled his expression better. \"That sounds very interesting, and welcome.\" His smile was genial. \"We've been on the hunt all the way down from Ontario, and we haven't had the chance to clean up in a while.\" His eyes moved appreciatively over Carlisle's refined appearance. \"Please don't take offense, but we'd appreciate it if you'd refrain from hunting in this immediate area. We have to stay inconspicuous, you understand,\" Carlisle explained. \"Of course.\" Laurent nodded. \"We certainly won't encroach on your territory. We just ate outside of Seattle, anyway,\" he laughed. A shiver ran up my spine. \"We'll show you the way if you'd like to run with us \u2014 Emmett and Alice, you can go with Edward and Bella to get the Jeep,\" he casually added. Three things seemed to happen simultaneously while Carlisle was speaking. My hair ruffled with the light breeze, Edward stiffened, and the second male, James, suddenly whipped his head around, scrutinizing me, his nostrils flaring. A swift rigidity fell on all of them as James lurched one step forward into a crouch. Edward bared his teeth, crouching in defense, a feral snarl ripping from his throat. It was nothing like the playful sounds I'd heard from him this morning; it was the single most menacing thing I had ever heard, and chills ran from the crown of my head to the back of my heels. \"What's this?\" Laurent exclaimed in open surprise. Neither James nor Edward relaxed their aggressive poses. James feinted slightly to the side, and Edward shifted in response. \"She's with us.\" Carlisle's firm rebuff was directed toward James. Laurent seemed to catch my scent less powerfully than James, but awareness now dawned on his face. \"You brought a snack?\" he asked, his expression incredulous as he took an involuntary step forward. Edward snarled even more ferociously, harshly, his lip curling high above his glistening, bared teeth. Laurent stepped back again. \"I said she's with us,\" Carlisle corrected in a hard voice. \"But she's human,\" Laurent protested. The words were not at all aggressive, merely astounded. \"Yes.\" Emmett was very much in evidence at Carlisle's side, his eyes on James. James slowly straightened out of his crouch, but his eyes never left me, his nostrils still wide. Edward stayed tensed like a lion in front of me. When Laurent spoke, his tone was soothing \u2014 trying to defuse the sudden hostility. \"It appears we have a lot to learn about each other.\" \"Indeed.\" Carlisle's voice was still cool. \"But we'd like to accept your invitation.\" His eyes flicked toward me and back to Carlisle. \"And, of course, we will not harm the human girl. We won't hunt in your range, as I said.\" James glanced in disbelief and aggravation at Laurent and exchanged another brief look with Victoria, whose eyes still flickered edgily from face to face. Carlisle measured Laurent's open expression for a moment before he spoke. \"We'll show you the way. Jasper, Rosalie, Esme?\" he called. They gathered together, blocking me from view as they converged. Alice was instantly at my side, and Emmett fell back slowly, his eyes locked on James as he backed toward us. \"Let's go, Bella.\" Edward's voice was low and bleak. This whole time I'd been rooted in place, terrified into absolute immobility. Edward had to grip my elbow and pull sharply to break my trance. Alice and Emmett were close behind us, hiding me. I stumbled alongside Edward, still stunned with fear. I couldn't hear if the main group had left yet. Edward's impatience was almost tangible as we moved at human speed to the forest edge. Once we were into the trees, Edward slung me over his back without breaking stride. I gripped as tightly as possible as he took off, the others close on his heels. I kept my head down, but my eyes, wide with fright, wouldn't close. They plunged through the now-black forest like wraiths. The sense of <em>exhilaration</em> that usually seemed to possess Edward as he ran was completely absent, replaced by a fury that consumed him and drove him still faster. Even with me on his back, the others trailed behind. We reached the Jeep in an impossibly short time, and Edward barely slowed as he flung me in the backseat. \"Strap her in,\" he ordered Emmett, who slid in beside me. Alice was already in the front seat, and Edward was starting the engine. It roared to life and we swerved backward, spinning around to face the winding road. Edward was growling something too fast for me to understand, but it sounded a lot like a string of profanities. The jolting trip was much worse this time, and the darkness only made it more frightening. Emmett and Alice both glared out the side windows. We hit the main road, and though our speed increased, I could see much better where we were going. And we were headed south, away from Forks. \"Where are we going?\" I asked. No one answered. No one even looked at me. \"Dammit, Edward! Where are you taking me?\" \"We have to get you away from here \u2014 far away \u2014 now.\" He didn't look back, his eyes on the road. The speedometer read a hundred and five miles an hour. \"Turn around! You have to take me home!\" I shouted. I struggled with the stupid harness, tearing at the straps. \"Emmett,\" Edward said grimly. And Emmett secured my hands in his steely grasp. \"No! Edward! No, you can't do this.\" \"I have to, Bella, now please be quiet.\" \"I won't! You have to take me back \u2014 Charlie will call the FBI! They'll be all over your family \u2014 Carlisle and Esme! They'll have to leave, to hide forever!\" \"Calm down, Bella.\" His voice was cold. \"We've been there before.\" \"Not over me, you don't! You're not ruining everything over me!\" I struggled violently, with total futility. Alice spoke for the first time. \"Edward, pull over.\" He flashed her a hard look, and then sped up. \"Edward, let's just talk this through.\" \"You don't understand,\" he roared in frustration. I'd never heard his voice so loud; it was deafening in the confines of the Jeep. The speedometer neared one hundred and fifteen. \"He's a tracker, Alice, did you see that? He's a tracker!\" I felt Emmett stiffen next to me, and I wondered at his reaction to the word. It meant something more to the three of them than it did to me; I wanted to understand, but there was no opening for me to ask. \"Pull over, Edward.\" Alice's tone was reasonable, but there was a ring of authority in it I'd never heard before. The speedometer inched passed one-twenty. \"Do it, Edward.\" \"Listen to me, Alice. I saw his mind. Tracking is his passion, his obsession \u2014 and he wants her, Alice \u2014 her, specifically. He begins the hunt tonight.\" \"He doesn't know where \u2014\" He interrupted her. \"How long do you think it will take him to cross her scent in town? His plan was already set before the words were out of Laurent's mouth.\" I gasped, knowing where my scent would lead. \"Charlie! You can't leave him there! You can't leave him!\" I thrashed against the harness. \"She's right,\" Alice said. The car slowed slightly. \"Let's just look at our options for a minute,\" Alice coaxed. The car slowed again, more noticeably, and then suddenly we screeched to a stop on the shoulder of the highway. I flew against the harness, and then slammed back into the seat. \"There are no options,\" Edward hissed. \"I'm not leaving Charlie!\" I yelled. He ignored me completely. \"We have to take her back,\" Emmett finally spoke. \"No.\" Edward was absolute. \"He's no match for us, Edward. He won't be able to touch her.\" \"He'll wait.\" Emmett smiled. \"I can wait, too.\" \"You didn't see \u2014 you don't understand. Once he commits to a hunt, he's unshakable. We'd have to kill him.\" Emmett didn't seem upset by the idea. \"That's an option.\" \"And the female. She's with him. If it turns into a fight, the leader will go with them, too.\" \"There are enough of us.\" \"There's another option,\" Alice said quietly. Edward turned on her in fury, his voice a blistering snarl. \"There \u2014 is \u2014 no \u2014 other \u2014 option!\" Emmett and I both stared at him in shock, but Alice seemed unsurprised. The silence lasted for a long minute as Edward and Alice stared each other down. I broke it. \"Does anyone want to hear my plan?\" \"No,\" Edward growled. Alice glared at him, finally provoked. \"Listen,\" I pleaded. \"You take me back.\" \"No,\" he interrupted. I glared at him and continued. \"You take me back. I tell my dad I want to go home to Phoenix. I pack my bags. We wait till this tracker is watching, and then we run. He'll follow us and leave Charlie alone. Charlie won't call the FBI on your family. Then you can take me any damned place you want.\" They stared at me, stunned. \"It's not a bad idea, really.\" Emmett's surprise was definitely an insult. \"It might work \u2014 and we simply can't leave her father unprotected. You know that,\" Alice said. Everyone looked at Edward. \"It's too dangerous \u2014 I don't want him within a hundred miles of her.\" Emmett was supremely confident. \"Edward, he's not getting through us.\" Alice thought for a minute. \"I don't see him attacking. He'll try to wait for us to leave her alone.\" \"It won't take long for him to realize that's not going to happen.\" \"I demand that you take me home.\" I tried to sound firm. Edward pressed his fingers to his temples and squeezed his eyes shut. \"Please,\" I said in a much smaller voice. He didn't look up. When he spoke, his voice sounded worn. \"You're leaving tonight, whether the tracker sees or not. You tell Charlie that you can't stand another minute in Forks. Tell him whatever story works. Pack the first things your hands touch, and then get in your truck. I don't care what he says to you. You have fifteen minutes. Do you hear me? Fifteen minutes from the time you cross the doorstep.\" The Jeep rumbled to life, and he spun us around, the tires squealing. The needle on the speedometer started to race up the dial.  \"Emmett?\" I asked, looking pointedly at my hands. \"Oh, sorry.\" He let me loose. A few minutes passed in silence, other than the roar of the engine. Then Edward spoke again. \"This is how it's going to happen. When we get to the house, if the tracker is not there, I will walk her to the door. Then she has fifteen minutes.\" He glared at me in the rearview mirror. \"Emmett, you take the outside of the house. Alice, you get the truck. I'll be inside as long as she is. After she's out, you two can take the Jeep home and tell Carlisle.\" \"No way,\" Emmett broke in. \"I'm with you.\" \"Think it through, Emmett. I don't know how long I'll be gone.\" \"Until we know how far this is going to go, I'm with you.\" Edward sighed. \"If the tracker is there,\" he continued grimly, \"we keep driving.\" \"We're going to make it there before him,\" Alice said confidently. Edward seemed to accept that. Whatever his problem with Alice was, he didn't doubt her now. \"What are we going to do with the Jeep?\" she asked. His voice had a hard edge. \"You're driving it home.\" \"No, I'm not,\" she said calmly. The unintelligible stream of profanities started again. \"We can't all fit in my truck,\" I whispered. Edward didn't appear to hear me. \"I think you should let me go alone,\" I said even more quietly. He heard that. \"Bella, please just do this my way, just this once,\" he said between clenched teeth. \"Listen, Charlie's not an imbecile,\" I protested. \"If you're not in town tomorrow, he's going to get suspicious.\" \"That's irrelevant. We'll make sure he's safe, and that's all that matters.\" \"Then what about this tracker? He saw the way you acted tonight. He's going to think you're with me, wherever you are.\" Emmett looked at me, insultingly surprised again. \"Edward, listen to her,\" he urged. \"I think she's right.\" \"Yes, she is,\" Alice agreed. \"I can't do that.\" Edward's voice was icy. \"Emmett should stay, too,\" I continued. \"He definitely got an eyeful of Emmett.\" \"What?\" Emmett turned on me. \"You'll get a better crack at him if you stay,\" Alice agreed. Edward stared at her incredulously. \"You think I should let her go alone?\" \"Of course not,\" Alice said. \"Jasper and I will take her.\" \"I can't do that,\" Edward repeated, but this time there was a trace of defeat in his voice. The logic was working on him. I tried to be persuasive. \"Hang out here for a week \u2014\" I saw his expression in the mirror and amended \"\u2014 a few days. Let Charlie see you haven't kidnapped me, and lead this James on a wild-goose chase. Make\u00a0 sure he's completely off my trail. Then come and meet me. Take a roundabout route, of course, and then Jasper and Alice can go home.\" I could see him beginning to consider it. \"Meet you where?\" \"Phoenix.\" Of course. \"No. He'll hear that's where you're going,\" he said impatiently. \"And you'll make it look like that's a ruse, obviously. He'll know that we'll know that he's listening. He'll never believe I'm actually going where I say I am going.\" \"She's diabolical,\" Emmett chuckled. \"And if that doesn't work?\" \"There are several million people in Phoenix,\" I informed him. \"It's not that hard to find a phone book.\" \"I won't go home.\" \"Oh?\" he inquired, a dangerous note in his voice. \"I'm quite old enough to get my own place.\" \"Edward, we'll be with her,\" Alice reminded him. \"What are you going to do in Phoenix?\" he asked her scathingly. \"Stay indoors.\" \"I kind of like it.\" Emmett was thinking about cornering James, no doubt. \"Shut up, Emmett.\" \"Look, if we try to take him down while she's still around, there's a much better chance that someone will get hurt \u2014 she'll get hurt, or you will, trying to protect her. Now, if we get him alone\u2026\" He trailed off with a slow smile. I was right. The Jeep was crawling slowly along now as we drove into town. Despite my brave talk, I could feel the hairs on my arms standing up. I thought about Charlie, alone in the house, and tried to be courageous. \"Bella.\" Edward's voice was very soft. Alice and Emmett looked out their windows. \"If you let anything happen to yourself\u2014 anything at all \u2014 I'm holding you personally responsible. Do you understand that?\" \"Yes,\" I gulped. He turned to Alice. \"Can Jasper handle this?\" \"Give him some credit, Edward. He's been doing very, very well, all things considered.\" \"Can you handle this?\" he asked. And graceful little Alice pulled back her lips in a horrific grimace and let loose with a guttural snarl that had me cowering against the seat in terror. Edward smiled at her. \"But keep your opinions to yourself,\" he muttered suddenly.",

            "en": "7 REPETITION         15. PRESSURE It was spring break in Forks again. When i woke up on Monday morning, I lay in bed for a few seconds absorbing that. Last spring break, I'd been hunted by a vampire, too. I hoped this wasn't some kind of tradition forming. Already I was falling into the pattern of things in La Push. I'd spent Sunday mostly on the beach, while Charlie hung out with Billy at the Blacks' house. I was supposed to be with Jacob, but Jacob had other things to do, so I wandered alone, keeping the secret from Charlie. When Jacob dropped in to check on me, he apologized for ditching me so much. He told me his schedule wasn't always this crazy, but until Victoria was stopped, the wolves were on red alert. When we walked along the beach now, he always held my hand. This made me brood over what Jared had said, about Jacob involving his \"girlfriend.\" I supposed that that was exactly what it looked like from the outside. As long as Jake and I knew how it really was, I shouldn't let those kinds of assumptions bother me. And maybe they wouldn't, if I hadn't known that Jacob would have loved for things to be what they appeared. But his hand felt nice as it warmed mine, and I didn't protest. I worked Tuesday afternoon\u2014Jacob followed me on his bike to make sure I arrived safely\u2014and Mike noticed. \"Are you dating that kid from La Push? The sophomore?\" He asked, poorly disguising the resentment in his tone. I shrugged. \"Not in the technical sense of the word. I do spent most of my time with Jacob, though. He's my best friend.\" Mike's eyes narrowed shrewdly. \"Don't kid yourself, Bella. The guy's head over heels for you.\" \"I know,\" I sighed. \"Life is complicated.\" \"And girls are cruel,\" Mike said under his breath. I supposed that was an easy assumption to make, too. That night, Sam and Emily joined Charlie and me for dessert at Billy's house. Emily brought a cake that would have won over a harder man than Charlie. I could see, as the conversation flowed naturally through a range of casual subjects, that any worries Charlie might have harbored about gangs in La Push were being dissolved. Jake and I skipped out early, to get some privacy. We went out to his garage and sat in the Rabbit. Jacob leaned his head back, his face drawn with exhaustion. \"You need some sleep, Jake.\" \"I'll get around to it.\" He reached over and took my hand. His skin was blazing on mine. \"Is that one of those wolf things?\" I asked him. \"The heat, I mean.\" \"Yeah. We run a little warmer than the normal people. About one-oh-eight, one-oh-nine. I never get cold anymore. I could stand like this\"\u2014he gestured to his bare torso\u2014\"in a snowstorm and it wouldn't bother me. The flakes would turn to rain where I stood.\" \"And you all heal fast\u2014that's a wolf thing, too?\" \"Yeah, wanna see? It's pretty cool.\" His eyes flipped open and he grinned. He reached around me to the glove compartment and dug around for a minute. His hand came out with a pocketknife. \"No, I do not want to see!\" I shouted as soon as I realized what he was thinking. \"Put that away!\" Jacob chuckled, but shoved the knife back where it belonged. \"Fine. It's a good thing we heal, though.\u00a0 You can't go see just any doctor when you're running a temperature that should mean you're dead.\" \"No, I guess not.\" I thought about that for a minute. \"\u2026 And being so big\u2014that's part of it? Is that why you're all worried about Quil?\" \"That and the fact that Quil's grandfather says the kid could fry an egg on his forehead.\" Jacob's face turned hopeless. \"It won't be long now. There's no exact age\u2026 it just builds and builds and then suddenly\u2014\" He broke off, and it was a moment before he could speak again. \"Sometimes, if you get really upset or something, that can trigger it early. But I wasn't upset about anything\u2014I was happy.\" He laughed bitterly. \"Because of you, mostly. That's why it didn't happen to me sooner. Instead it just kept on building up inside me\u2014I was like a time bomb. You know what set me off? I got back from that movie and Billy said I looked weird. That was all, but I just snapped. And then I\u2014I exploded. I almost ripped his face off\u2014my own father!\" He shuddered, and his face paled. \"Is it really bad, Jake?\" I asked anxiously, wishing I had some way to help him. \"Are you miserable?\" \"No, I'm not miserable,\" he told me. \"Not anymore. Not now that you know. That was hard, before.\" He leaned over so that his cheek was resting on top of my head. He was quiet for a moment, and I wondered what he was thinking about. Maybe I didn't want to know. \"What's the hardest part?\" I whispered, still wishing I could help. \"The hardest part is feeling\u2026 out of control,\" he said slowly. \"Feeling like I can't be sure of myself\u2014like maybe you shouldn't be around me, like maybe nobody should. Like I'm a monster who might hurt somebody. You've seen Emily. Sam lost control of his temper for just one second\u2026 and she was standing too close. And now there's nothing he can ever do to put it right again. I hear his thoughts\u2014I know what that feels like\u2026 \"Who wants to be a nightmare, a monster? \"And then, the way it comes so easily to me, the way I'm better at it than the rest of them\u2014does that make me even less human than Enbry or Sam? Sometimes I'm afraid that I'm losing myself.\" \"Is it hard? To find yourself again?\" \"At first,\" he said. \"It takes some practice to phase back and forth. But it's easier for me.\" \"Why?\" I wondered. \"Because Ephraim Black was my father's grandfather, and Quil Ateara was my mother's grandfather.\" \"Quil?\" I asked in confusion. \"His great-grandfather,\" Jacob clarified. \"The Quil you know is my second cousin.\" \"But why does it matter who your great-grandfathers are?\" \"Because Ephraim and Quil were in the last pack. Levi Uley was the third. It's in my blood on both sides.\u00a0 I never had a chance. Like Quil doesn't have a chance.\" His expression was bleak. \"What's the very best part?\" I asked, hoping to cheer him up. \"The best part,\" he said, suddenly smiling again, \"is the speed.\" \"Better than the motorcycles?\" He nodded, enthusiastic. \"There's no comparison.\" \"How fast can you\u2026 ?\" \"Run?\" he finished my question. \"Fast enough. What can I measure it by? We caught\u2026 what was his name? Laurent? I imagine that means more to you than it would to someone else.\" It did mean something to me. I couldn't imagine that\u2014the wolves running faster than a vampire. When the Cullens ran, they all but turned invisible with speed. \"So, tell me something I don't know,\" he said. \"Something about vampires. How did you stand it, being around them? Didn't it creep you out?\" \"No,\" I said curtly. My tone made him thoughtful for a moment. \"Say, why'd your bloodsucker kill that James, anyway?\" he asked suddenly. \"James was trying to kill me\u2014it was like a game for him. He lost. Do you remember last spring when I was in the hospital down in Phoenix?\" Jacob sucked in a breath. \"He got that close?\" \"He got very, very close.\" I stroked my scar. Jacob noticed, because he held the hand I moved. \"What's that?\" He traded hands, examining my right. \"This is your funny scar, the cold one.\" He looked at it closer, with new eyes, and gasped. \"Yes, it's what you think it is,\" I said. \"James bit me.\" His eyes bulged, and his face turned a strange, sallow color under the russet surface. He looked like he was about to be sick. \"But if he bit you\u2026 ? Shouldn't you be\u2026 ?\" He choked. \"Edward saved me twice,\" I whispered. \"He sucked the venom out\u2014you know, like with a rattlesnake.\" I twitched as the pain lashed around the edges of the hole. But I wasn't the only one twitching. I could feel Jacob's whole body trembling next to mine. Even the car shook. \"Careful, Jake. Easy. Calm down.\" \"Yeah,\" he panted. \"Calm.\" He shook his head back and forth quickly. After a moment, only his hands were shaking. \"You okay?\" \"Yeah, almost. Tell me something else. Give me something else to think about.\" \"What do you want to know?\" \"I don't know.\" He had his eyes closed, concentrating. \"The extra stuff I guess. Did any of the other Cullens have\u2026 extra talents? Like the mind reading?\" I hesitated a second. This felt like a question he would ask of his spy, not his friend. But what was the point of hiding what I knew? It didn't matter now, and it would help him control himself. So I spoke quickly, the image of Emily's ruined face in my mind, and the hair rising on my arms. I couldn't imagine how the russet wolf would fit inside the Rabbit\u2014Jacob would tear the whole garage apart if he changed now. \"Jasper could\u2026 sort of control the emotions of the people around him. Not in a bad way, just to calm someone down, that kind of thing. It would probably help Paul a lot,\" I added, teasing weakly. \"And then Alice could see things that were going to happen. The future, you know, but not absolutely. The things she saw would change when someone changed the path they were on\u2026\" Like how she'd seen me dying\u2026 and she'd seen me becoming one of them. Two things that had not happened. And one that never would. My head started to spin\u2014I couldn't seem to pull in enough oxygen from the air. No lungs. Jacob was entirely in control now, very still beside me. \"Why do you do that?\" he asked. He tugged lightly at one of my arms, which was bound around my chest, and then gave up when it wouldn't come loose easily. I hadn't even realized I'd moved them. \"You do that when you're upset. Why?\" \"It hurts to think about them,\" I whispered. \"It's like I can't breathe\u2026 like I'm breaking into pieces\u2026\"It was bizarre how much I could tell Jacob now. We had no more secrets. He smoothed my hair. \"It's okay, Bella, it's okay. I won't bring it up again. I'm sorry.\" \"I'm fine.\" I gasped. \"Happens all the time. Not your fault.\" \"We're a pretty messed-up pair, aren't we?\" Jacob said. \"Neither one of us can hold our shape together right.\" \"Pathetic,\" I agreed, still breathless. \"At least we have each other,\" he said, clearly comforted by the thought. I was comforted, too. \"At least there's that,\" I agreed. And when we were together, it was fine. But Jacob had a horrible, dangerous job he felt compelled to do, and so I was often alone, stuck in La Push for safety, with nothing to do to keep my mind off any of my worries. I felt awkward, always taking up space at Billy's. I did some studying for another Calculus test that was coming up next week, but I could only look at math for so long. When I didn't have something obvious to do in my hands,\u00a0 I felt like I ought to be making conversation with Billy\u2014the pressure of normal societal rules. But Billy wasn't one for filling up the long silences, and so the awkwardness continued. I tried hanging out at Emily's place Wednesday afternoon, for a change. At first it was kind of nice. Emily was a cheerful person who never sat still. I drifted behind her while she flitted around her little house and yard, scrubbing at the spotless floor, pulling a tiny weed, fixing a broken hinge, tugging a string of wool through an ancient loom, and always cooking, too. She complained lightly about the increase in the boys' appetites from all their extra running, but it was easy to see she didn't mind taking care of them. It wasn't hard to be with her\u2014after all, we were both wolf girls now. But Sam checked in after I'd been there for a few hours. I only stayed long enough to ascertain that Jacob was fine and there was no news, and then I had to escape. The aura of love and contentment that surrounded them was harder to take in concentrated doses, with no one else around to dilute it. So that left me wandering the beach, pacing the length of the rocky crescent back and forth, again and again. Alone time wasn't good for me. Thanks to the new honesty with Jacob, I'd been talking and thinking about the Cullens way too much. No matter how I tried to distract myself\u2014and I had plenty to think of: I was honestly and desperately worried about Jacob and his wolf-brothers, I was terrified for Charlie and the others who thought they were hunting animals, I was getting in deeper and deeper with Jacob without ever having consciously decided to progress in that direction and I didn't know what to do about it\u2014none of these very real, very deserving of thought, very pressing concerns could take my mind off the pain in my chest for long. Eventually, I couldn't even walk anymore, because I couldn't breathe. I sat down on a patch of semidry rocks and curled up in a ball. Jacob found me like that, and I could tell from his expression that he understood. \"Sorry,\" he said right away. He pulled me up from the ground and wrapped both arms around my shoulders. I hadn't realized that I was cold until then. His warmth made me shudder, but at least I could breathe with him there. \"I'm ruining your spring break,\" Jacob accused himself as we walked back up the beach. \"No, you're not. I didn't have any plans. I don't think I like spring breaks, anyway.\" \"I'll take tomorrow morning off. The others can run without me. We'll do something fun.\" The word seemed out of place in my life right now, barely comprehensible, bizarre. \"Fun?\" \"Fun is exactly what you need. Hmm\u2026\" he gazed out across the heaving gray waves, deliberating. As his eyes scanned the horizon, he had a flash of inspiration. \"Got it!\" he crowed. \"Another promise to keep.\" \"What are you talking about?\" He let go of my hand and pointed toward the southern edge of the beach, where the flat, rocky half-moon dead-ended against the sheer sea cliffs. I stared, uncomprehending. \"Didn't I promise to take you cliff diving?\" I shivered. \"Yeah, it'll be pretty cold\u2014not as cold as it is today. Can you feel the weather changing? The pressure?\u00a0 It will be warmer tomorrow. You up for it?\" The dark water did not look inviting, and, from this angle, the cliffs looked even higher than before. But it had been days since I'd heard Edward's voice. That was probably part of the problem. I was addicted to the sound of my delusions. It made things worse if I went too long without them. Jumping off a cliff was certain to remedy that situation. \"Sure, I'm up for it. Fun.\" \"It's a date,\" he said, and draped his arm around my shoulders. \"Okay\u2014now let's go get you some sleep.\" I didn't like the way the circles under his eyes were beginning to look permanently etched onto his skin. I woke early the next morning and snuck a change of clothes out to the truck. I had a feeling that Charlie would approve of today's plan just about as much as he would approve of the motorcycle. The idea of a distraction from all my worries had me almost excited. Maybe it would be fun. A date with Jacob, a date with Edward\u2026 I laughed darkly to myself. Jake could say what he wanted about us being a messed-up pair\u2014I was the one who was truly messed up. I made the werewolf seem downright normal. I expected Jacob to meet me out front, the way he usually did when my noisy truck announced my arrival. When he didn't, I guessed that he might still be sleeping. I would wait\u2014let him get as much rest as he could. He needed his sleep, and that would give the day time to warm a bit more. Jake had been right about the weather, though; it had changed in the night. A thick layer of clouds pressed heavily on the atmosphere now, making it almost sultry; it was warm and close under the gray blanket. I left my sweater in the truck. I knocked quietly on the door. \"C'mon in, Bella,\" Billy said. He was at the kitchen table, eating cold cereal. \"Jake sleeping?\" \"Er, no.\" He set his spoon down, and his eyebrows pulled together. \"What happened?\" I demanded. I could tell from his expression that something had. \"Embry, Jared, and Paul crossed a fresh trail early this morning. Sam and Jake took off to help. Sam was hopeful\u2014she's hedged herself in beside the mountains. He thinks they have a good chance to finish this.\" \"Oh, no, Billy,\" I whispered. \"Oh, no.\" He chuckled, deep and low. \"Do you really like La Push so well that you want to extend your sentence here?\" \"Don't make jokes, Billy. This is too scary for that.\" \"You're right,\" he agreed, still complacent. His ancient eyes were impossible to read. \"This one's tricky.\" I bit my lip. \"It's not as dangerous for them as you think it is. Sam knows what he's doing. You're the one that you should worry about. The vampire doesn't want to fight them. She's just trying to find a way around them\u2026 to you.\" \"How does Sam know what he's doing?\" I demanded, brushing aside his concern for me. \"They've only killed just the one vampire\u2014that could have been luck.\" \"We take what we do very seriously, Bella. Nothing's been forgotten. Everything they need to know has been passed down from father to son for generations.\" That didn't comfort me the way he probably intended it to. The memory of Victoria, wild, catlike, lethal, was too strong in my head. If she couldn't get around the wolves, she would eventually try to go through them. Billy went back to his breakfast; I sat down on the sofa and flipped aimlessly though the TV channels. That didn't last long. I started to feel closed in by the small room, claustrophobic, upset by the fact that I couldn't see out the curtained windows. \"I'll be at the beach,\" I told Billy abruptly, and hurried out the door. Being outside didn't help as much as I'd hoped. The clouds pushed down with an invisible weight that kept the claustrophobia from easing. The forest seemed strangely vacant as I walked toward the beach. I didn't see any animals\u2014no birds, no squirrels. I couldn't hear any birds, either. The silence was eerie; there wasn't even the sound of wind in the trees.  I knew it was all just a product of the weather, but it still made me edgy. The heavy, warm pressure of the atmosphere was perceptible even to my weak human senses, and it hinted at something major in the storm department. A glance at the sky backed this up; the clouds were churning sluggishly despite the lack of breeze on the ground. The closest clouds were a smoky gray, but between the cracks I could see another layer that was a gruesome purple color. The skies had a ferocious plan in store for today. The animals must be bunkering down. As soon as I reached the beach, I wished I hadn't come\u2014I'd already had enough of this place. I'd been here almost every day, wandering alone. Was it so much different from my nightmares? But where else to go? I trudged down to the driftwood tree, and sat at the end so that I could lean against the tangled roots. I stared up at the angry sky broodingly, waiting for the first drops to break the stillness. I tried not to think about the danger Jacob and his friends were in. Because nothing could happen to Jacob. The thought was unendurable. I'd lost too much already\u2014would fate take the last few shreds of peace left behind? That seemed unfair, out of balance. But maybe I'd violated some unknown rule, crossed some line that had condemned me. Maybe it was wrong to be so involved with myths and legends, to turn my back on the human world. Maybe\u2026 No. Nothing would happen to Jacob. I had to believe that or I wouldn't be able to function. \"Argh!\" I groaned, and jumped off the log. I couldn't sit still; it was worse than pacing.  I'd really been counting on hearing Edward this morning. It seemed like that was the one thing that might make it bearable to live through this day. The hole had been festering lately, like it was getting revenge for the times that Jacob's presence had tamed it. The edges burned. The waves picked up as I paced, beginning to crash against the rocks, but there was still no wind. I felt pinned down by the pressure of the storm. Everything swirled around me, but it was perfectly still where I stood. The air had a faint electric charge\u2014I could feel the static in my hair. Farther out, the waves were angrier than they were along the shore. I could see them battering against the line of the cliffs, spraying big white clouds of sea foam into the sky. There was still no movement in the air, though the clouds roiled more quickly now. It was eerie looking\u2014like the clouds were moving by their own will. I shivered, though I knew it was just a trick of the pressure. The cliffs were a black knife edge against the livid sky. Staring at them, I remembered the day Jacob had told me about Sam and his \"gang.\" I thought of the boys\u2014the werewolves\u2014throwing themselves into the empty air. The image of the falling, spiraling figures was still vivid in my mind. I imagined the utter freedom of the fall\u2026 I imagined the way Edward's voice would have sounded in my head\u2014furious, velvet, perfect\u2026 The burning in my chest flared agonizingly. There had to be some way to quench it. The pain was growing more and more intolerable by the second. I glared at the cliffs and the crashing waves. Well, why not? Why not quench it right now? Jacob had promised me cliff diving, hadn't he? Just because he was unavailable, should I have to give up the distraction I needed so badly\u2014needed even worse because Jacob was out risking his life? Risking it, in essence, for me. If it weren't for me, Victoria would not be killing people here\u2026 just somewhere else, far away. If anything happened to Jacob, it would be my fault. That realization stabbed deep and had me jogging back up to the road toward Billy's house, where my truck waited. I knew my way to the lane that passed closest to the cliffs, but I had to hunt for the little path that would take me out to the ledge. As I followed it, I looked for turns or forks, knowing that Jake had planned to take me off the lower outcropping rather than the top, but the path wound in a thin single line toward the brink with no options. I didn't have time to find another way down\u2014the storm was moving in quickly now. The wind was finally beginning to touch me, the clouds pressing closer to the ground. Just as I reached the place where the dirt path fanned out into the stone precipice, the first drops broke through and splattered on my face. It was not hard to convince myself that I didn't have time to search for another way\u2014I wanted to jump from the top. This was the image that had lingered in my head. I wanted the long fall that would feel like flying. I knew that this was the stupidest, most reckless thing I had done yet. The thought made me smile. The pain was already easing, as if my body knew that Edward's voice was just seconds away\u2026 The ocean sounded very far away, somehow farther than before, when I was on the path in the trees. I grimaced when I thought of the probable temperature of the water. But I wasn't going to let that stop me. The wind blew stronger now, whipping the rain into eddies around me. I stepped out to the edge, keeping my eyes on the empty space in front of me. My toes felt ahead blindly, caressing the edge of the rock when they encountered it. I drew in a deep breath and held it . . waiting. \"Bella.\" I smiled and exhaled. Yes? I didn't answer out loud, for fear that the sound of my voice would shatter the beautiful illusion. He sounded so real, so close. It was only when he was disapproving like this that I could hear the true memory of his voice\u2014the velvet texture and the musical intonation that made up the most perfect of all voices. \"Don't do this,\" he pleaded. You wanted me to be human, I reminded him. Well, watch me. \"Please. For me.\" But you won't stay with me any other way. \"Please.\" It was just a whisper in the blowing rain that tossed my hair and drenched my clothes\u2014making me as wet as if this were my second jump of the day. I rolled up onto the balls of my feet. \"No, Bella!\" He was angry now, and the anger was so lovely. I smiled and raised my arms straight out, as if I were going to dive, lifting my face into the rain. But it was too ingrained from years of swimming at the public pool\u2014feet first, first time. I leaned forward, crouching to get more spring\u2026 And I flung myself off the cliff. I screamed as I dropped through the open air like a meteor, but it was a scream of <em>exhilaration</em> and not fear. The wind resisted, trying vainly to fight the\u00a0 unconquerable gravity, pushing against me and twirling me in spirals like a rocket crashing to the earth. Yes! The word echoed through my head as I sliced through the surface of the water. It was icy, colder than I'd feared, and yet the chill only added to the high. I was proud of myself as I plunged deeper into the freezing black water. I hadn't had one moment of terror\u2014just pure adrenaline. Really, the fall wasn't scary at all. Where was the challenge? That was when the current caught me. I'd been so preoccupied by the size of the cliffs, by the obvious danger of their high, sheer faces, that I hadn't worried at all about the dark water waiting. I never dreamed that the true menace was lurking far below me, under the heaving surf. It felt like the waves were fighting over me, jerking me back and forth between them as if determined to share by pulling me into halves. I knew the right way to avoid a riptide: swim parallel to the beach rather than struggling for the shore. But the knowledge did me little good when I didn't know which way the shore was. I couldn't even tell which way the surface was. The angry water was black in every direction; there was no brightness to direct me upward. Gravity was all-powerful when it competed with the air, but it had nothing on the waves\u2014I couldn't feel a downward pull, a sinking in any direction. Just the battering of the current that flung me round and round like a rag doll. I fought to keep my breath in, to keep my lips locked around my last store of oxygen. It didn't surprise me that my delusion of Edward was there. He owed me that much, considering that I was dying. I was surprised by how sure that knowledge was. I was going to drown. I was drowning. \"Keep swimming!\" Edward begged urgently in my head. Where? There was nothing but the darkness. There was no place to swim to. \"Stop that!\" he ordered. \"Don't you dare give up!\" The cold of the water was numbing my arms and legs. I didn't feel the buffeting so much as before. It was more of just a dizziness now, a helpless spinning in the water. But I listened to him. I forced my arms to continue reaching, my legs to kick harder, though every second I was facing a new direction. It couldn't be doing any good. What was the point? \"Fight!\" he yelled. \"Damn it, Bella, keep fighting.\" Why? I didn't want to fight anymore. And it wasn't the light-headedness, or the cold, or the failure of my arms as the muscles gave out in exhaustion, that made me content to stay where I was. I was almost happy that it was over. This was an easier death than others I'd faced. Oddly peaceful. I thought briefly of the clich\u00e9s, about how you were suppose to see your life flash before your eyes. I was so much luckier. Who wanted to see a rerun, anyway? I saw him, and I had no will to fight. It was so clear, so much more defined than any memory. My subconscious had stored Edward away in flawless detail, saving him for this final moment. I could see his perfect face as if he were really there; the exact shade of his icy skin, the shape of his lips, the line of his jaw, the gold glinting in his furious eyes. He was angry, naturally, that I was giving up. His teeth were clenched and his nostrils flared with rage. \"No! Bella, no!\" My ears were flooded with the freezing water, but his voice was clearer than ever. I ignored his words and concentrated on the sound of his voice. Why would I fight when I was so happy where I was? Even as my lungs burned for more air and my legs cramped in the icy cold, I was content. I'd forgotten what real happiness felt like. Happiness. It made the whole dying thing pretty bearable. The current won at that moment, shoving me abruptly against something hard, a rock invisible in the gloom. It hit me solidly across the chest, slamming into me like an iron bar, and the breath whooshed out of my lungs, escaping in a thick cloud of silver bubbles. Water flooded down my throat, choking and burning. The iron bar seemed to be dragging me, pulling me away from Edward, deeper into the dark, to the ocean floor. Goodbye, I love you, was my last thought.",
