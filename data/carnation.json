Originally it was started by a group of red-cross youth team members who visited their sick ex-teachers at hospitals. The national celebration ceremony had been stopped between 1973 and 1982 and it resumed after that. On the celebration day, teachers are usually presented with carnations by their students, and both enjoy a shorter school day. Ex-students pay their respects to the former teachers by visiting them Chunju and handing a <em>carnation</em>. Many schools nationwide are now being closed on this day to prevent a bribe from student's parents. Currently, many schools are temporarily closed.",

            "en": "Top 7 Romantic Valentines Day Flowers     Valentine's Day is one of the most romantic days of the year and the most popular gift to give, among new couples and married ones, is flowers. Flowers are possibly the most romantic token of your love and affection! Choosing the perfect flowers for your loved one can be difficult ... do you go with traditional roses or something different? Here are the top seven most romantic flowers in our book.  1. Roses. Cliched perhaps, but still very romantic. The color of rose you select means different things. Red is for passion, perfect for the hot young couple who is just getting into their affair, pink is romance, ideal for chaste pairs and married couples, or anyone who is just in love. Stay away from yellow, these ones mean friendship and aren't very romantic at all!  2. Tulips. Tulips traditionally mean \"perfect love\" and are really a great alternative to the rose. Tulips come in a variety of hues, so it is pretty easy to find one that comes in your lover's favorite color, even if that's black. This simple flower really symbolizes the perfection of your love, with its sculpted petals and beautiful cup. A simple bouquet of three or five tulips is ideal to give to your darling this Valentine's Day.  3. Lilies. These elegant flowers are stunning when presented alone or in a cluster. They are come in several colors, including red, white and yellow and symbolize beauty . . . just right for letting your girl know how lovely you consider her to be. While expensive, lilies really do embody beauty and create a very romantic environment.  4. Lilacs. These amazing flowers are most revered for their delightful aroma and tiny delicate flowers that grow in cone-like clusters. They can be picked directly from the bush and given to your sweetheart as a beautiful Valentine's Day gift. Traditionally available in hues ranging from soft lavender to dark purple, lilacs have now been bred to come in white and pink as well, all beautiful romantic shades.  5. Carnations. Another fairly traditional flower is the <em>carnation</em>. They are frilly and feminine and come in hues like pink, white, and red, as well as more stunning shades of purple, green and even blue. Some carnations even have dual colors, with the outer edge of the petals in red or pink while the main flower is white. They can be quite stunning, but tend to be the cheaper of the flowers available. These flowers last longer than most, up to 3 weeks after they've been cut.  6. Orchids. The meanings of this delicate flower are many, including seduction, love, beauty and refinement. Though often quite pricey, a single orchid can be a lovely way to tell someone that you care about them and is considered to be quite romantic. Plus, it's about as far from the traditional rose as you can get!  7. Wildflowers. This is more a variety of flower than a specific kind. There are literally thousands of different wildflowers growing in fields and yards across the country. What makes this so romantic is that you have to actually go out and take the time to select and pick the flowers for your sweetheart. Giving wildflowers for Valentine's Day is sure to impress your girl as it is a very romantic gesture.  In general Valentines Day Flowers are a romantic gift, but these flowers hold more romantic connotations than others. Whether you choose to go with the traditional rose or something a little more unique, you can guarantee that your gesture won't be misinterpreted if you give flowers.",

Some of them are holidays while others are celebrated during working days. A day that is dedicated to the hard work that is input by the teacher all year long, a day that is a complete tribute to the teachers all around India. In India teacher\u2019s day is celebrated on 5th of September. Teacher\u2019s Day is a dedication to Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, who was a staunch believer of education and was one of the most well known diplomat, scholar, president of India and above all a teacher. As a tribute to this great teacher, his birthday has been observed as teachers' day and this led to its origin.  This day is just a mere reflection of Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan's love for and attachment to the teaching profession. As a matter of fact Dr. Radhakrishnan himself asked his admirers to celebrate his birthday not as his birthday but as the teacher's day. His work varied on philosophical, theological, ethical, educational, social and cultural subjects. He contributed numerous articles to different well-known journals, which, are of immense value and seems to surprise various readers because of the depth in the meaning of the articles. Teacher's day is now one of the occasion that is looked forward by the teachers and students alike as on this occasion its not only when teachers are praised but also around various schools students dress up as a representation of their teachers and take various lectures that are assigned to the teachers they represent. On this day students realize what it means to be a teacher and what it means to control the future of several students in their classes and also teachers are reminded what it felt like when they were the students. Apart from the fun aspect everybody should pay their respects to the great Dr. Radhakrishnan. Since that day this event have become a regular event. Apart from the fun aspect of the day it is also a day when one can look back and admire and get inspired by Dr. Radhakrishnan, a small town cunning boy, who grew up to become one of the most respected politicians in the history of democracy of India. Teachers' Days Celebrated in Working Days India September 5 is Teacher's Day in India. It is the birthday of second President of India and teacher Dr. Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan. When Dr. Radhakrishnan became the president of India in 1962, some of his students and friends approached him and requested him to allow them to celebrate 5 September, his birthday. In reply, Dr. Radhakrishnan said, \"Instead of celebrating my birthday separately, it would be my proud privilege if September 5 is observed as \"Teachers Day\". This is not a holiday in India. It is considered a \"celebration\" day, where teachers and students report to school as usual but the usual activities and classes are replaced by activities of celebration, thanking and remembrance. At some schools on this day, the responsibility of teaching is taken up by the senior students as an appreciation for their teachers. Traditionally, people in India have given tremendous respect and honor to teachers. An old Indian saying (usually taught to children), ranks teacher in the third place, even before God: \"'Maata, Pitha, Guru, Daivam'\", meaning Mother, Father and Teacher is God.
