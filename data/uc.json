The likelihood of heart disease persists, even with long-term progress in addressing traditional risk factors, such as smoking, high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol. Peter Franks, a <em>UC</em> Davis professor of family and community medicine and lead author of the study said: \"Being poor or having less than a high school education can be regarded as an extra risk when assessing a patient's chances of developing cardiovascular disease.\" He continued saying that, \"People with low socioeconomic status need to have their heart-disease indicators managed more aggressively.\"The authors used data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, including more than 12,000 people between the ages of 45 to 64 years living in North Carolina, Mississippi, Minnesota and Maryland, in which participants reported their education and income levels in 1987. The participants were periodically evaluated for heart-disease diagnoses and changes in their risk factors, including cholesterol, blood pressure and smoking over the course of 10 years.   According to the results, people with lower socioeconomic status had a 50% increased risk of developing heart disease compared to other study participants.\u00a0 \nAlthough it is common knowledge for people with low socioeconomic status to have a greater risk for developing heart disease and other health problems, the reason is often attributed to reduced health-care access or poor adherence to treatments, such as smoking cessation or medication.  \nLow socio-economic status is therefore a heart-disease risk factor on its own\n  For the first time this study revealed that the increased risk continued even though long-term improvements in other risk factors have been made, showing that access and adherence could not account for the differences. According to Franks, low socio-economic status is therefore a heart-disease risk factor on its own and needs to be regarded as such by the medical community.\nHe said that previous studies could help explain the association between low socioeconomic status and increased heart-disease risk. Social disadvantages and adversity in childhood could mean lasting adaptations to stress which result in more stress on the heart. Cumulative effects of social disadvantage throughout a person's life could also cause more \"wear and tear\" on the cardiovascular system.\nFranks recommends including socio-economic status in the Framingham risk assessment, a tool based on outcomes from the Framingham Heart Study, commonly used to determine treatments for heart-disease prevention. He commented that UK health-care providers are already considering socio-economic status for the determination of care plans. Franks, who's research focuses on addressing health-care disparities said: \"Doctors could, for instance, moderately increase the dosage of cholesterol-lowering drugs to reflect the higher risk imposed by socioeconomic status. Changes like this would be easy to implement, and the benefits could be significant.\"\nWritten by Petra Rattue  Copyright: Medical News Today",

            "en": "A common gene mutation that causes sperm to lose its protective protein coat so it falls prey to the female immune system on its journey to the egg, may be the main reason for infertility in men worldwide, writes an international team of researchers in a paper published in the journal Science Translational Medicine this week. The researchers hope their discovery will help to find new ways to treat infertile couples. Infertility affects between 10 and 15% of the US population, and in about half of these cases, the problem is male fertility. Co-senior author of the paper, Dr Gary Cherr, a professor at the University of California Davis' Bodega Marine Laboratory and Center for Health and Environment, told the press that:  \"In 70 percent of men, you can't predict their fertility on the basis of sperm count and routine assessment of sperm quality.\"  He and his colleagues, including co-senior author Dr Charles Bevins, professor in the Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology at <em>UC</em> Davis, hope their findings will help to explain why. The researchers were investigating defensins, natural germ-killer proteins found on mucosal surfaces, in a search for ways to make contraceptive vaccines, when they came across one called beta-defensin 126 and started looking more closely at its properties. Beta-defensin 126, a \"glycosylated polypeptide\" protein coded by the gene known as DEFB126, behaves like a cloaking device that allows the sperm to swim efficiently through the mucus in the female's reproductive tract and reach the egg without being detected by her immune system. The protein is synthesized in the male's epididymis, the coiled ducts that store, mature and transport sperm cells on their way from the testis where they are made, to the vas deferens, from whence they are delivered to the urethra prior to ejaculation. It is while they are in the epididymis, \"readying\" themselves for the ejaculatory \"launch\", that the sperm cells receive their thick protective coating of beta-defensin 126. The researchers came upon their discovery almost by chance, as often happens in science. They were trying to obtain purified beta-defensin 126 to make some antibodies to the protein. To do this they had to make a recombinant copy of the DEFB126 gene, but in their first attempt they found the gene had a mutation that prevented it from making the protein. But when they used sperm from a different donor, they were able to make the protein. Bevins said: \"If we hadn't seen this in the first clone, we would be confused to this day.\" And what Cherr, Bevins and colleagues found was that many men carry a defective DEFB126 gene. They describe their finding as a \"sequence variant in DEFB126 that has a two-nucleotide deletion in the open reading frame, which generates an abnormal mRNA\". By surveying sperm samples from men in the US, UK and China, they found that as many as a quarter of men worldwide carry two copies of the defective DEFB126 variant and concluded this could significantly affect their fertility. When you look at sperm from men with the defective variants under the microscope they look like normal sperm and swim around like normal sperm, the researchers said in a statement.  But, when they tested the sperms' ability to swim through hyaluronic acid gel, an artificial gel made to resemble human cervical mucus, they found that sperm from carriers of two defective variants \"exhibited an 84% reduction in the rate of penetration ...compared to the other genotypes\". And when they added normal beta-defensin 126 protein to the defective sperm, they recovered their normal abilities. The researchers hope their discovery leads to the development of a test that could be used to send couples directly for treatment with \"intracytoplasmic sperm injection\" or ICSI, a procedure that removes the woman's eggs and injects them directly with sperm outside of her body. This could save a lot of time, money and anguish with trying to find the cause of infertility via other procedures. In another phase of the study that took place at Anhui Medical University in Anhui, China, the researchers carried out a prospective cohort study of newly married couples who were trying to conceive by natural means, and found that they were less likely to become pregnant and took longer to achieve a live birth if the male partner carried two copies of the defective DEFB126 gene. The researchers concluded that: \"This common sequence variation in DEFB126, and its apparent effect of impaired reproductive function, will allow a better understanding, clinical evaluation, and possibly treatment of human infertility.\" But why should a mutation that affects fertility be so common? Lead author of the study, Dr Ted Tollner, is an adjunct assistant professor in the <em>UC</em> Davis Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. He worked on the study as a postdoctoral scholar with Cherr.  \"It may be that heterozygotes -- men with one normal and one defective gene, but normal fertility -- are advantaged in some way,\" said Tollner. He explained that the quality of human sperm is typically quite poor compared to sperm from monkey and other mammals. It swims slowly and has a high rate of defective cells. Cherr said perhaps because humans tend to have long-term, monogamous relationships, sperm quality is just not that important.  But some researchers say that human male fertility has been falling worldwide in recent decades, and we don't know why.  Cherr said the next step is to do some research within a major infertility project in the US and find out more about the role of the defective DEFB126 gene. Funds from the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health helped pay for the study.\n\"A Common Mutation in the Defensin DEFB126 Causes Impaired Sperm Function and Subfertility.\" Theodore L.

            "en": "Dogs Helped Kids Improve Reading Fluency       Researchers in the US found that reading to dogs helped children improve their fluency by up to 30 per cent. Many animal organizations and libraries in the US already have reading improvement schemes where they pair up children and dogs, but until now the evidence has been more anecdotal than research-based. The findings are the result of a collaboration between the University of California Davis School of Veterinary Medicine and Tony La Russa's Animal Rescue Foundation of Walnut Creek, California. Together they studied participants of the Foundation's already established animal assisted therapy scheme called the All Ears Reading Program, according to a statement released by <em>UC</em> Davis earlier this month. Lead researcher Martin Smith, a veterinary school science educator with <em>UC</em> Davis, told the press that: \"The dogs, in contrast to a human, don't judge the individual, aren't grading the individual, and hopefully that allows the children to build some confidence in their reading skills.\" Smith and colleagues explored changes in reading skills among third graders at school and among home-schooled students. They found reading fluency went up 12 per cent in the school-based students and 30 per cent in the home-schooled students. Reading speeds also increased by up to 30 words per minute. The children regularly read out loud to three shelter-rescued dogs called Molly, Digory and Lollipop (a Chihuahua-terrier mix) from Tony La Russa's Animal Rescue Foundation. The home-schooled children visited the veterinary school campus every week for 10 weeks during which time each child read out loud to one of the dogs for 15 to 20 minutes. One child told the researchers that: \"I feel relaxed when I am reading to a dog because I am having fun.\" Another added that: \"The dogs don't care if you read really, really bad so you just keep going.\" After the study, 75 per cent of parents reported that their child was now reading aloud more frequently and with more confidence. Smith and colleagues proposed that because the children perceived the dogs as patient and non-judgemental, this changed their attitude to reading. Research into animal assisted therapy (AAT) shows that pets can also improve people's health.  In 2004, Dr Daniel Joffe, a Canadian veterinarian reviewed the medical literature and found pet therapy increased social interaction among long stay psychiatric patients, opened up social and recreational opportunities in nursing homes, gave valuable companionship to low-mobility orthopedic patients, helped dementia patients be less agitated and reduced loneliness in patients with HIV/AIDS. There is also evidence to suggest that babies who have greater exposure to dirt and allergens, such as when they share a home with a dog or a cat, have a stronger immune system, according to Dr James E. Gern, a pediatrician at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who co-authored a paper about it in the 2004 issue of the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.

            "en": "If you are a person who is easily embarassed, you may find comfort in what researchers from the University of California, Berkeley report in a paper published online this month in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology: they suggest moderate embarassment is a good thing, because it means you are also likely to be more trustworthy and generous. Lead author Matthew Feinberg, a <em>UC</em> Berkeley doctoral student in psychology, told the media that \"moderate levels of embarassment are signs of virtue\".  \"Our data suggests embarrassment is a good thing, not something you should fight,\" he added.\nFellow co-author Robb Willer, a social psychologist at <em>UC</em> Berkeley, said embarassment was \"part of the social glue that fosters trust and cooperation in everyday life,\" and described it as an \"emotional signature of a person to whom you can entrust valuable resources\".\nThe researchers were keen to point out that the moderate type of embarassment they studied is very different from \"shame\", the emotion people typically express when caught cheating or performing some other moral transgression.\nModerate embarassment is a \"pro-social emotion\" whereas shame is a \"debilitating social anxiety\" maintain the researchers, and they also have different typical gestures and expressions.  People typically express embarassment by gazing downwards to one side while partially covering the face. This is also accompanied by a smirk or grimace. When people express shame as opposed to embarassment, they typically cover the whole face, said Feinberg.\nPro-social emotions are thought to operate at a direct fundamental level to sustain cooperative relations, bypassing cognition or thinking. This model is in contrast to the behavioral model used by economists which assumes that cognitive optimizing processes are at the heart of what guides socially directed behavior.The third author is <em>UC</em> Berkeley psychologist Dacher Keltner, an expert on pro-social emotions.To arrive at their findings, Feinberg, Willer and Keltner carried out a series of experiments to look at links between embarassment and pro-sociality.In the first experiment they filmed 60 college students talking about embarassing moments such as making inaccurate assumptions about people based on their appearance (for example assuming a woman who was overweight was expecting a baby), and doing embarassing things like breaking wind in public. When they watched the films, the researchers coded each participant's story based on how much embarassment they showed.  In a second experiment, the college students played a game called the \"Dictator's Game\". This is used by economists to measure altruism. In this game, each player receives 10 raffle tickets and is invited to keep some and give the rest to a partner. Correlating these results with those of the first experiment, the researchers found that the participants who gave away more raffle tickets were also more likely to have been the ones showing the most embarassment in the video accounts.  In a third experiment the researchers asked another group of 38 American participants they recruited via Craigslist, an online community featuring free classified ads and other information services, how often they felt embarassed. They also took part in exercises like the \"Dictator's Game\" to measure their generosity and readiness to cooperate.\nIn a fourth experiment, the participants observed while a trained actor played a role where he is told he has received top marks in a test. The actor responds showing either embarassment or pride. The participants then played games with the actor, while the researchers measured the level to which they trusted him or not. They then correlated these measures with whether the participants had observed the actor showing pride or embarassment in the earlier part of the experiment.   Each time, the results were the same: participants trusted the actor more if they had observed him showing embarassment, and they trusted him less if they had seen him showing pride.\nThe researchers concluded that these tests:\n\"... revealed that observers rated embarrassed targets as being more prosocial and less antisocial relative to targets who displayed either a different emotion or no emotion.\"\n Embarrassment signals people's tendency to be pro-social, said Feinberg:\n\"You want to affiliate with them more, you feel comfortable trusting them,\" he explained.\nHowever, one should be careful in constructing a corollary out of these findings: do they mean that overly confident people aren't to be trusted?
