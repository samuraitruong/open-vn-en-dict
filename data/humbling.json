Yet, there's a downside that isn't spoken of much: exposure raises the bar on what it takes to be awestricken. And that's a shame, because few things are as uplifting as experiencing true awe. True awe is <em>humbling</em>. It reminds us that we're not the center of the universe. Awe is also inspiring and full of wonder, underscoring the richness of life and our ability to both contribute to it and be captivated by it. It's hard to be happy when you just shrug your shoulders every time you see something new.",
