            "en": "4         4. INVITATIONS In my dream it was very dark, and what dim light there was seemed to be radiating from Edward's skin. I couldn't see his face, just his back as he walked away from me, leaving me in the blackness. No matter how fast I ran, I couldn't catch up to him; no matter how loud I called, he never turned. Troubled, I woke in the middle of the night and couldn't sleep again for what seemed like a very long time. After that, he was in my dreams nearly every night, but always on the periphery, never within reach. The month that followed the accident was uneasy, tense, and, at first, embarrassing. To my dismay, I found myself the center of attention for the rest of that week. Tyler Crowley was impossible, following me around, obsessed with making amends to me somehow. I tried to convince him what I wanted more than anything else was for him to forget all about it \u2014 especially since nothing had actually happened to me \u2014 but he remained insistent. He followed me between classes and sat at our now-crowded lunch table. Mike and Eric were even less friendly toward him than they were to each other, which made me worry that I'd gained another unwelcome fan. No one seemed concerned about Edward, though I explained over and over that he was the hero \u2014 how he had pulled me out of the way and had nearly been crushed, too. I tried to be convincing. Jessica, Mike, Eric, and everyone else always commented that they hadn't even seen him there till the van was pulled away. I wondered to myself why no one else had seen him standing so far away, before he was suddenly, impossibly saving my life. With chagrin, I realized the probable cause \u2014 no one else was as aware of Edward as I always was. No one else watched him the way I did. How pitiful. Edward was never surrounded by crowds of curious bystanders eager for his firsthand account. People avoided him as usual. The Cullens and the Hales sat at the same table as always, not eating, talking only among themselves. None of them, especially Edward, glanced my way anymore.  When he sat next to me in class, as far from me as the table would allow, he seemed totally unaware of my presence. Only now and then, when his fists would suddenly ball up \u2014 skin stretched even whiter over the bones \u2014 did I wonder if he wasn't quite as oblivious as he appeared.  He wished he hadn't pulled me from the path of Tyler's van \u2014 there was no other conclusion I could come to. I wanted very much to talk to him, and the day after the accident I tried. The last time I'd seen him, outside the ER, we'd both been so furious. I still was angry that he wouldn't trust me with the truth, even though I was keeping my part of the bargain flawlessly. But he had in fact saved my life, no matter how he'd done it. And, overnight, the heat of my anger faded into awed gratitude. He was already seated when I got to Biology, looking straight ahead. I sat down, expecting him to turn toward me. He showed no sign that he realized I was there. \"Hello, Edward,\" I said pleasantly, to show him I was going to behave myself. He turned his head a fraction toward me without meeting my gaze, nodded once, and then looked the other way. And that was the last contact I'd had with him, though he was there, a foot away from me, every day. I watched him sometimes, unable to stop myself\u2014 from a distance, though, in the cafeteria or parking lot. I\u00a0 watched as his golden eyes grew perceptibly darker day by day. But in class I gave no more notice that he existed than he showed toward me. I was miserable. And the dreams continued. Despite my outright lies, the tenor of my e-mails alerted Ren\u00e9e to my depression, and she called a few times, worried. I tried to convince her it was just the weather that had me down. Mike, at least, was pleased by the obvious coolness between me and my lab partner. I could see he'd been worried that Edward's daring rescue might have impressed me, and he was relieved that it seemed to have the opposite effect. He grew more confident, sitting on the edge of my table to talk before Biology class started, ignoring Edward as completely as he ignored us. The snow washed away for good after that one dangerously icy day. Mike was disappointed he'd never gotten to stage his snowball fight, but pleased that the beach trip would soon be possible. The rain continued heavily, though, and the weeks passed. Jessica made me aware of another event looming on the horizon \u2014 she called the first Tuesday of March to ask my permission to invite Mike to the girls' choice spring dance in two weeks. \"Are you sure you don't mind\u2026 you weren't planning to ask him?\" she persisted when I told her I didn't mind in the least. \"No, Jess, I'm not going,\" I assured her. Dancing was glaringly outside my range of abilities. \"It will be really fun.\" Her attempt to convince me was halfhearted. I suspected that Jessica enjoyed my inexplicable popularity more than my actual company. \"You have fun with Mike,\" I encouraged. The next day, I was surprised that Jessica wasn't her usual gushing self in Trig and Spanish. She was silent as she walked by my side between classes, and I was afraid to ask her why. If Mike had turned her down, I was the last person she would want to tell. My fears were strengthened during lunch when Jessica sat as far from Mike as possible, chatting animatedly with Eric. Mike was unusually quiet.  Mike was still quiet as he walked me to class, the uncomfortable look on his face a bad sign. But he didn't broach the subject until I was in my seat and he was perched on my desk. As always, I was electrically aware of Edward sitting close enough to touch, as distant as if he were merely an invention of my imagination. \"So,\" Mike said, looking at the floor, \"Jessica asked me to the spring dance.\" \"That's great.\" I made my voice bright and enthusiastic. \"You'll have a lot of fun with Jessica.\" \"Well\u2026\" He floundered as he examined my smile, clearly not happy with my response. \"I told her I had to think about it.\" \"Why would you do that?\" I let disapproval color my tone, though I was relieved he hadn't given her an absolute no. His face was bright red as he looked down again. Pity shook my resolve. \"I was wondering if\u2026 well, if you might be planning to ask me.\" I paused for a moment, hating the wave of guilt that swept through me. But I saw, from the corner of my eye, Edward's head tilt reflexively in my direction. \"Mike, I think you should tell her yes,\" I said.  \"Did you already ask someone?\" Did Edward notice how Mike's eyes flickered in his direction? \"No,\" I assured him. \"I'm not going to the dance at all.\" \"Why not?\" Mike demanded. I didn't want to get into the safety hazards that dancing presented, so I quickly made new plans. \"I'm going to Seattle that Saturday,\" I explained. I needed to get out of town anyway \u2014 it was suddenly the perfect time to go. \"Can't you go some other weekend?\" \"Sorry, no,\" I said. \"So you shouldn't make Jess wait any longer \u2014 it's rude.\" \"Yeah, you're right,\" he mumbled, and turned, dejected, to walk back to his seat. I closed my eyes and pressed my fingers to my temples, trying to push the guilt and sympathy out of my head. Mr. Banner began talking.  I sighed and opened my eyes. And Edward was staring at me curiously, that same, familiar edge of frustration even more distinct now in his black eyes. I stared back, surprised, expecting him to look quickly away. But instead he continued to gaze with probing intensity into my eyes. There was no question of me looking away. My hands started to shake. \"Mr. Cullen?\" the teacher called, seeking the answer to a question that I hadn't heard. \"The Krebs Cycle,\" Edward answered, seeming reluctant as he turned to look at Mr. Banner. I looked down at my book as soon as his eyes released me, trying to find my place. Cowardly as ever, I shifted my hair over my right shoulder to hide my face. I couldn't believe the rush of emotion pulsing through me \u2014 just because he'd happened to look at me for the first time in a half-dozen weeks. I couldn't allow him to have this level of influence over me. It was pathetic. More than pathetic, it was unhealthy. I tried very hard not to be aware of him for the rest of the hour, and, since that was impossible, at least not to let him know that I was aware of him. When the bell rang at last, I turned my back to him to gather my things, expecting him to leave immediately as usual. \"Bella?\" His voice shouldn't have been so familiar to me, as if I'd known the sound of it all my life rather than for just a few short weeks. I turned slowly, unwillingly. I didn't want to feel what I knew I would feel when I looked at his too-perfect face. My expression was wary when I finally turned to him; his expression was unreadable. He didn't say anything. \"What? Are you speaking to me again?\" I finally asked, an unintentional note of petulance in my voice. His lips twitched, fighting a smile. \"No, not really,\" he admitted. I closed my eyes and inhaled slowly through my nose, aware that I was gritting my teeth. He waited. \"Then what do you want, Edward?\" I asked, keeping my eyes closed; it was easier to talk to him coherently that way. \"I'm sorry.\" He sounded sincere. \"I'm being very rude, I know. But it's better this way, really.\" I opened my eyes. His face was very serious. \"I don't know what you mean,\" I said, my voice guarded. \"It's better if we're not friends,\" he explained. \"Trust me.\" My eyes narrowed. I'd heard that before. \"It's too bad you didn't figure that out earlier,\" I hissed through my teeth. \"You could have saved yourself all this regret.\" \"Regret?\" The word, and my tone, obviously caught him off guard. \"Regret for what?\" \"For not just letting that stupid van <em>squish</em> me.\" He was astonished. He stared at me in disbelief. When he finally spoke, he almost sounded mad. \"You think I regret saving your life?\" \"I know you do,\" I snapped. \"You don't know anything.\" He was definitely mad. I turned my head sharply away from him, clenching my jaw against all the wild accusations I wanted to hurl at him. I gathered my books together, then stood and walked to the door. I meant to sweep dramatically out of the room, but of course I caught the toe of my boot on the door jamb and dropped my books. I stood there for a moment, thinking about leaving them. Then I sighed and bent to pick them up. He was there; he'd already stacked them into a pile. He handed them to me, his face hard. \"Thank you,\" I said icily. His eyes narrowed. \"You're welcome,\" he retorted. I straightened up swiftly, turned away from him again, and stalked off to Gym without looking back. Gym was brutal. We'd moved on to basketball. My team never passed me the ball, so that was good, but I fell down a lot. Sometimes I took people with me. Today I was worse than usual because my head was so filled with Edward. I tried to concentrate on my feet, but he kept creeping back into my thoughts just when I really needed my balance. It was a relief, as always, to leave. I almost ran to the truck; there were just so many people I wanted to avoid. The truck had suffered only minimal damage in the accident. I'd had to replace the taillights, and if I'd had a real paint job, I would have touched that up. Tyler's parents had to sell their van for parts. I almost had a stroke when I rounded the corner and saw a tall, dark figure leaning against the side of my truck. Then I realized it was just Eric. I started walking again. \"Hey, Eric,\" I called. \"Hi, Bella.\" \"What's up?\" I said as I was unlocking the door. I wasn't paying attention to the uncomfortable edge in his voice, so his next words took me by surprise. \"Uh, I was just wondering\u2026 if you would go to the spring dance with me?\" His voice broke on the last word. \"I thought it was girls' choice,\" I said, too startled to be diplomatic. \"Well, yeah,\" he admitted, shamefaced. I recovered my composure and tried to make my smile warm. \"Thank you for asking me, but I'm going to be in Seattle that day.\" \"Oh,\" he said. \"Well, maybe next time.\" \"Sure,\" I agreed, and then bit my lip. I wouldn't want him to take that too literally. He slouched off, back toward the school. I heard a low chuckle. Edward was walking past the front of my truck, looking straight forward, his lips pressed together. I yanked the door open and jumped inside, slamming it loudly behind me. I revved the engine deafeningly and reversed out into the aisle. Edward was in his car already, two spaces down, sliding out smoothly in front of me, cutting me off. He stopped there \u2014 to wait for his family; I could see the four of them walking this way, but still by the cafeteria. I considered taking out the rear of his shiny Volvo, but there were too many witnesses. I looked in my rearview mirror. A line was beginning to form. Directly behind me, Tyler Crowley was in his recently acquired used Sentra, waving.  I was too aggravated to acknowledge him. While I was sitting there, looking everywhere but at the car in front of me, I heard a knock on my passenger side window. I looked over; it was Tyler. I glanced back in my rearview mirror, confused. His car was still running, the door left open. I leaned across the cab to crank the window down. It was stiff. I got it halfway down, then gave up. \"I'm sorry, Tyler, I'm stuck behind Cullen.\" I was annoyed \u2014 obviously the holdup wasn't my fault. \"Oh, I know \u2014 I just wanted to ask you something while we're trapped here.\" He grinned. This could not be happening. \"Will you ask me to the spring dance?\" he continued. \"I'm not going to be in town, Tyler.\" My voice sounded a little sharp. I had to remember it wasn't his fault that Mike and Eric had already used up my quota of patience for the day. \"Yeah, Mike said that,\" he admitted. \"Then why \u2014\" He shrugged. \"I was hoping you were just letting him down easy.\" Okay, it was completely his fault. \"Sorry, Tyler,\" I said, working to hide my irritation. \"I really am going out of town.\" \"That's cool. We still have prom.\" And before I could respond, he was walking back to his car. I could feel the shock on my face. I looked forward to see Alice, Rosalie, Emmett, and Jasper all sliding into the Volvo. In his rearview mirror, Edward's eyes were on me. He was unquestionably shaking with laughter, as if he'd heard every word Tyler had said. My foot itched toward the gas pedal\u2026 one little bump wouldn't hurt any of them, just that glossy silver paint job. I revved the engine. But they were all in, and Edward was speeding away. I drove home slowly, carefully, muttering to myself the whole way. When I got home, I decided to make chicken enchiladas for dinner. It was a long process, and it would keep me busy. While I was simmering the onions and chilies, the phone rang. I was almost afraid to answer it, but it might be Charlie or my mom. It was Jessica, and she was jubilant; Mike had caught her after school to accept her invitation. I celebrated with her briefly while I stirred. She had to go, she wanted to call Angela and Lauren to tell them. I suggested \u2014 with casual innocence \u2014 that maybe Angela, the shy girl who had Biology with me, could ask Eric. And Lauren, a \u00a0standoffish girl who had always ignored me at the lunch table, could ask Tyler; I'd heard he was still available. Jess thought that was a great idea. Now that she was sure of Mike, she actually sounded sincere when she said she wished I would go to the dance. I gave her my Seattle excuse. After I hung up, I tried to concentrate on dinner \u2014 dicing the chicken especially; I didn't want to take another trip to the emergency room. But my head was spinning, trying to analyze every word Edward had spoken today. What did he mean, it was better if we weren't friends?  My stomach twisted as I realized what he must have meant. He must see how absorbed I was by him; he must not want to lead me on\u2026 so we couldn't even be friends\u2026 because he wasn't interested in me at all. Of course he wasn't interested in me, I thought angrily, my eyes stinging \u2014 a delayed reaction to the onions. I wasn't interesting. And he was. Interesting\u2026 and brilliant\u2026 and mysterious\u2026 and perfect\u2026 and beautiful\u2026 and possibly able to lift full-sized vans with one hand. Well, that was fine. I could leave him alone. I would leave him alone. I would get through my self-imposed sentence here in purgatory, and then hopefully some school in the Southwest, or possibly Hawaii, would offer me a scholarship. I focused my thoughts on sunny beaches and palm trees as I finished the enchiladas and put them in the oven. Charlie seemed suspicious when he came home and smelled the green peppers. I couldn't blame him \u2014 the closest edible Mexican food was probably in southern California. But he was a cop, even if just a small-town cop, so he was brave enough to take the first bite. He seemed to like it. It was fun to watch as he slowly began trusting me in the kitchen. \"Dad?\" I asked when he was almost done. \"Yeah, Bella?\" \"Um, I just wanted to let you know that I'm going to Seattle for the day a week from Saturday\u2026 if that's okay?\" I didn't want to ask permission \u2014 it set a bad precedent \u2014 but I felt rude, so I tacked it on at the end. \"Why?\" He sounded surprised, as if he were unable to imagine something that Forks couldn't offer. \"Well, I wanted to get few books \u2014 the library here is pretty limited \u2014 and maybe look at some clothes.\" I had more money than I was used to having, since, thanks to Charlie, I hadn't had to pay for a car. Not that the truck didn't cost me quite a bit in the gas department. \"That truck probably doesn't get very good gas mileage,\" he said, echoing my thoughts. \"I know, I'll stop in Montesano and Olympia \u2014 and Tacoma if I have to.\" \"Are you going all by yourself?\" he asked, and I couldn't tell if he was suspicious I had a secret boyfriend or just worried about car trouble. \"Yes.\" \"Seattle is a big city \u2014 you could get lost,\" he fretted. \"Dad, Phoenix is five times the size of Seattle \u2014 and I can read a map, don't worry about it.\" \"Do you want me to come with you?\" I tried to be crafty as I hid my horror. \"That's all right, Dad, I'll probably just be in dressing rooms all day \u2014 very boring.\" \"Oh, okay.\" The thought of sitting in women's clothing stores for any period of time immediately put him off. \"Thanks.\" I smiled at him. \"Will you be back in time for the dance?\" Grrr. Only in a town this small would a father know when the high school dances were. \"No \u2014 I don't dance, Dad.\" He, of all people, should understand that \u2014 I didn't get my balance problems from my mother. He did understand. \"Oh, that's right,\" he realized. The next morning, when I pulled into the parking lot, I deliberately parked as far as possible from the silver Volvo. I didn't want to put myself in the path of too much temptation and end up owing him a new car. Getting out of the cab, I fumbled with my key and it fell into a puddle at my feet. As I bent to get it, a white hand flashed out and grabbed it before I could. I jerked upright. Edward Cullen was right next to me, leaning casually against my truck. \"How do you do that?\" I asked in amazed irritation. \"Do what?\" He held my key out as he spoke. As I reached for it, he dropped it into my palm. \"Appear out of thin air.\" \"Bella, it's not my fault if you are exceptionally unobservant.\" His voice was quiet as usual \u2014 velvet, muted. I scowled at his perfect face. His eyes were light again today, a deep, golden honey color. Then I had to look down, to reassemble my now-tangled thoughts. \"Why the traffic jam last night?\" I demanded, still looking away. \"I thought you were supposed to be pretending I don't exist, not irritating me to death.\" \"That was for Tyler's sake, not mine. I had to give him his chance.\" He snickered. \"You\u2026\" I gasped. I couldn't think of a bad enough word. It felt like the heat of my anger should physically burn him, but he only seemed more amused. \"And I'm not pretending you don't exist,\" he continued. \"So you are trying to irritate me to death? Since Tyler's van didn't do the job?\" Anger flashed in his tawny eyes. His lips pressed into a hard line, all signs of humor gone. \"Bella, you are utterly absurd,\" he said, his low voice cold. My palms tingled \u2014 I wanted so badly to hit something. I was surprised at myself. I was usually a nonviolent person. I turned my back and started to walk away. \"Wait,\" he called. I kept walking, sloshing angrily through the rain. But he was next to me, easily keeping pace. \"I'm sorry, that was rude,\" he said as we walked. I ignored him. \"I'm not saying it isn't true,\" he continued, \"but it was rude to say it, anyway.\" \"Why won't you leave me alone?\" I grumbled. \"I wanted to ask you something, but you sidetracked me,\" he chuckled. He seemed to have recovered his good humor. \"Do you have a multiple personality disorder?\" I asked severely. \"You're doing it again.\" I sighed. \"Fine then. What do you want to ask?\" \"I was wondering if, a week from Saturday \u2014 you know, the day of the spring dance \u2014\" \"Are you trying to be funny?\" I interrupted him, wheeling toward him. My face got drenched as I looked up at his expression. His eyes were wickedly amused. \"Will you please allow me to finish?\" I bit my lip and clasped my hands together, interlocking my fingers, so I couldn't do anything rash. \"I heard you say you were going to Seattle that day, and I was wondering if you wanted a ride.\" That was unexpected. \"What?\" I wasn't sure what he was getting at. \"Do you want a ride to Seattle?\" \"With who?\" I asked, mystified. \"Myself, obviously.\" He enunciated every syllable, as if he were talking to someone mentally handicapped. I was still stunned. \"Why?\" \"Well, I was planning to go to Seattle in the next few weeks, and, to be honest, I'm not sure if your truck can make it.\" \"My truck works just fine, thank you very much for your concern.\" I started to walk again, but I was too surprised to maintain the same level of anger. \"But can your truck make it there on one tank of gas?\" He matched my pace again. \"I don't see how that is any of your business.\" Stupid, shiny Volvo owner. \"The wasting of finite resources is everyone's business.\" \"Honestly, Edward.\" I felt a thrill go through me as I said his name, and I hated it. \"I can't keep up with you. I thought you didn't want to be my friend.\" \"I said it would be better if we weren't friends, not that I didn't want to be.\" \"Oh, thanks, now that's all cleared up.\" Heavy sarcasm. I realized I had stopped walking again. We were under the shelter of the cafeteria roof now, so I could more easily look at his face. Which certainly didn't help my clarity of thought. \"It would be more\u2026 prudent for you not to be my friend,\" he explained.  \"But I'm tired of trying to stay away from you, Bella.\" His eyes were gloriously intense as he uttered that last sentence, his voice smoldering. I couldn't remember how to breathe. \"Will you go with me to Seattle?\" he asked, still intense. I couldn't speak yet, so I just nodded. He smiled briefly, and then his face became serious. \"You really should stay away from me,\" he warned. \"I'll see you in class.\" He turned abruptly and walked back the way we'd come.",

            "en": "7          7. NIGHTMARE I told Charlie I had a lot of homework to do, and that I didn't want anything to eat. There was a basketball game on that he was excited about, though of course I had no idea what was special about it, so he wasn't aware of anything unusual in my face or tone. Once in my room, I locked the door. I dug through my desk until I found my old headphones, and I plugged them into my little CD player. I picked up a CD that Phil had given to me for Christmas. It was one of his favorite bands, but they used a little too much bass and shrieking for my tastes. I popped it into place and lay down on my bed. I put on the headphones, hit Play, and turned up the volume until it hurt my ears. I closed my eyes, but the light still intruded, so I added a pillow over the top half of my face. I concentrated very carefully on the music, trying to understand the lyrics, to unravel the complicated drum patterns. By the third time I'd listened through the CD, I knew all the words to the choruses, at least.  I was surprised to find that I really did like the band after all, once I got past the blaring noise. I'd have to thank Phil again.  And it worked. The shattering beats made it impossible for me to think \u2014 which was the whole purpose of the exercise. I listened to the CD again and again, until I was singing along with all the songs, until, finally, I fell asleep. I opened my eyes to a familiar place. Aware in some corner of my consciousness that I was dreaming, I recognized the green light of the forest. I could hear the waves crashing against the rocks somewhere nearby. And I knew that if I found the ocean, I'd be able to see the sun.  I was trying to follow the sound, but then Jacob Black was there, tugging on my hand, pulling me back toward the blackest part of the forest. \"Jacob? What's wrong?\" I asked. His face was frightened as he yanked with all his strength against my resistance; I didn't want to go into the dark. \"Run, Bella, you have to run!\" he whispered, terrified. \"This way, Bella!\" I recognized Mike's voice calling out of the gloomy heart of the trees, but I couldn't see him. \"Why?\" I asked, still pulling against Jacob's grasp, desperate now to find the sun. But Jacob let go of my hand and yelped, suddenly shaking, falling to the dim forest floor. He twitched on the ground as I watched in horror.  \"Jacob!\" I screamed. But he was gone. In his place was a large red-brown wolf with black eyes. The wolf faced away from me, pointing toward the shore, the hair on the back of his shoulders bristling, low growls issuing from between his exposed fangs. \"Bella, run!\" Mike cried out again from behind me. But I didn't turn. I was watching a light coming toward me from the beach. And then Edward stepped out from the trees, his skin faintly glowing, his eyes black and dangerous. He held up one hand and beckoned me to come to him. The wolf growled at my feet. I took a step forward, toward Edward. He smiled then, and his teeth were sharp, pointed. \"Trust me,\" he purred. I took another step. The wolf launched himself across the space between me and the vampire, fangs aiming for the jugular. \"No!\" I screamed, wrenching upright out of my bed. My sudden movement caused the headphones to pull the CD player off the bedside table, and it clattered to the wooden floor. My light was still on, and I was sitting fully dressed on the bed, with my shoes on. I glanced, disoriented, at the clock on my dresser. It was five-thirty in the morning. I groaned, fell back, and rolled over onto my face, kicking off my boots. I was too uncomfortable to get anywhere near sleep, though. I rolled back over and unbuttoned my jeans, yanking them off awkwardly as I tried to stay horizontal. I could feel the braid in my hair, an uncomfortable ridge along the back of my skull. I turned onto my side and ripped the rubber band out, quickly combing through the plaits with my fingers. I pulled the pillow back over my eyes.  It was all no use, of course. My subconscious had dredged up exactly the images I'd been trying so desperately to avoid. I was going to have to face them now. I sat up, and my head spun for a minute as the blood flowed downward. First things first, I thought to myself, happy to put it off as long as possible. I grabbed my bathroom bag. The shower didn't last nearly as long as I hoped it would, though. Even taking the time to blow-dry my hair, I was soon out of things to do in the bathroom. Wrapped in a towel, I crossed back to my room. I couldn't tell if Charlie was still asleep, or if he had already left. I went to look out my window, and the cruiser was gone. Fishing again. I dressed slowly in my most comfy sweats and then made my bed \u2014 something I never did. I couldn't put it off any longer. I went to my desk and switched on my old computer. I hated using the Internet here. My modem was sadly outdated, my free service substandard; just dialing up took so long that I decided to go get myself a bowl of cereal while I waited. I ate slowly, chewing each bite with care. When I was done, I washed the bowl and spoon, dried them, and put them away. My feet dragged as I climbed the stairs. I went to my CD player first, picking it up off the floor and placing it precisely in the center of the table. I pulled out the headphones, and put them away in the desk drawer. Then I turned the same CD on, turning it down to the point where it was background noise.  With another sigh, I turned to my computer. Naturally, the screen was covered in pop-up ads. I sat in my hard folding chair and began closing all the little windows. Eventually I made it to my favorite search engine. I shot down a few more pop-ups and then typed in one word. Vampire. It took an infuriatingly long time, of course. When the results came up, there was a lot to sift through \u2014 everything from movies and TV shows to role-playing games, underground metal, and gothic cosmetic companies. Then I found a promising site \u2014 Vampires A\u2014Z. I waited impatiently for it to load, quickly clicking closed each ad that flashed across the screen. Finally the screen was finished \u2014 simple white background with black text, academic-looking. Two quotes greeted me on the home page: Throughout the vast shadowy world of ghosts and demons there is no figure so terrible, no figure so dreaded and abhorred, yet dight with such fearful fascination, as the vampire, who is himself neither ghost nor demon, but yet who partakes the dark natures and possesses the mysterious and terrible qualities of both. \u2014 Rev. Montague Summers If there is in this world a well-attested account, it is that of the vampires. Nothing is lacking: official reports, affidavits of well-known people, of surgeons, of priests, of magistrates; the judicial proof is most complete. And with all that, who is there who believes in vampires? \u2014 Rousseau The rest of the site was an alphabetized listing of all the different myths of vampires held throughout the world. The first I clicked on, the Danag, was a Filipino vampire supposedly responsible for planting taro on the islands long ago. The myth continued that the Danag worked with humans for many years, but the partnership ended one day when a woman cut her finger and a Danag sucked her wound, enjoying the taste so much that it drained her body completely of blood. I read carefully through the descriptions, looking for anything that sounded familiar, let alone plausible. It seemed that most vampire myths centered around beautiful women as demons and children as victims; they also seemed like constructs created to explain away the high mortality rates for young children, and to give men an excuse for infidelity. Many of the stories involved bodiless spirits and warnings against improper burials. There wasn't much that sounded like the movies I'd seen, and only a very few, like the Hebrew Estrie and the Polish Upier, who were even preoccupied with drinking blood. Only three entries really caught my attention: the Romanian Varacolaci, a powerful undead being who could appear as a beautiful, pale-skinned human, the Slovak Nelapsi, a creature so strong and fast it could massacre an entire village in the single hour after midnight, and one other, the Stregoni benefici. About this last there was only one brief sentence.  Stregoni benefici: An Italian vampire, said to be on the side of goodness, and a mortal enemy of all evil vampires. It was a relief, that one small entry, the one myth among hundreds that claimed the existence of good vampires. Overall, though, there was little that coincided with Jacob's stories or my own observations. I'd made a little catalogue in my mind as I'd read and carefully compared it with each myth. Speed, strength, beauty, pale skin, eyes that shift color; and then Jacob's criteria: blood drinkers, enemies of the werewolf, cold-skinned, and immortal. There were very few myths that matched even one factor. And then another problem, one that I'd remembered from the small number of scary movies that I'd seen and was backed up by today's reading \u2014 vampires couldn't come out in the daytime, the sun would burn them to a cinder. They slept in coffins all day and came out only at night. Aggravated, I snapped off the computer's main power switch, not waiting to shut things down properly. Through my irritation, I felt overwhelming embarrassment. It was all so stupid. I was sitting in my room, researching vampires. What was wrong with me? I decided that most of the blame belonged on the doorstep of the town of Forks \u2014 and the entire sodden Olympic Peninsula, for that matter. I had to get out of the house, but there was nowhere I wanted to go that didn't involve a three-day drive. I pulled on my boots anyway, unclear where I was headed, and went downstairs. I shrugged into my raincoat without checking the weather and stomped out the door.  It was overcast, but not raining yet. I ignored my truck and started east on foot, angling across Charlie's yard toward the ever-encroaching forest. It didn't take long till I was deep enough for the house and the road to be invisible, for the only sound to be the <em>squish</em> of the damp earth under my feet and the sudden cries of the jays. There was a thin ribbon of a trail that led through the forest here, or I wouldn't risk wandering on my own like this. My sense of direction was hopeless; I could get lost in much less helpful surroundings. The trail wound deeper and deeper into the forest, mostly east as far as I could tell. It snaked around the Sitka spruces and the hemlocks, the yews and the maples. I only vaguely knew the names of the trees around me, and all I knew was due to Charlie pointing them out to me from the cruiser window in earlier days. There were many I didn't know, and others I couldn't be sure about because they were so covered in green parasites. I followed the trail as long as my anger at myself pushed me forward. As that started to ebb, I slowed. A few drops of moisture trickled down from the canopy above me, but I couldn't be certain if it was beginning to rain or if it was simply pools left over from yesterday, held high in the leaves above me, slowly dripping their way back to the earth. A recently fallen tree \u2014 I knew it was recent because it wasn't entirely carpeted in moss \u2014 rested against the trunk of one of her sisters, creating a sheltered little bench just a few safe feet off the trail. I stepped over the ferns and sat carefully, making sure my jacket was between the damp seat and my clothes wherever they\u00a0 touched, and leaned my hooded head back against the living tree. This was the wrong place to have come. I should have known, but where else was there to go? The forest was deep green and far too much like the scene in last night's dream to allow for peace of mind. Now that there was no longer the sound of my soggy footsteps, the silence was piercing.  The birds were quiet, too, the drops increasing in frequency, so it must be raining above. The ferns stood higher than my head, now that I was seated, and I knew someone could walk by on the path, three feet away, and not see me. Here in the trees it was much easier to believe the absurdities that embarrassed me indoors. Nothing had changed in this forest for thousands of years, and all the myths and legends of a hundred different lands seemed much more likely in this green haze than they had in my clear-cut bedroom. I forced myself to focus on the two most vital questions I had to answer, but I did so unwillingly.  First, I had to decide if it was possible that what Jacob had said about the Cullens could be true. Immediately my mind responded with a resounding negative. It was silly and morbid to entertain such ridiculous notions. But what, then? I asked myself. There was no rational explanation for how I was alive at this moment. I listed again in my head the things I'd observed myself: the impossible speed and strength, the eye color shifting from black to gold and back again, the inhuman beauty, the pale, frigid skin. And more \u2014 small things that registered slowly \u2014 how they never seemed to eat, the disturbing grace with which they moved. And the way be sometimes spoke, with unfamiliar cadences and phrases that better fit the style of a turn-of-the-century novel than that of a twenty-first-century classroom. He had skipped class the day we'd done blood typing. He hadn't said no to the beach trip till he heard where we were going. He seemed to know what everyone around him was thinking\u2026 except me. He had told me he was the villain, dangerous\u2026 Could the Cullens be vampires? Well, they were something. Something outside the possibility of rational justification was taking place in front of my incredulous eyes. Whether it be Jacob's cold ones or my own superhero theory, Edward Cullen was not\u2026 human. He was something more.  So then \u2014 maybe. That would have to be my answer for now.  And then the most important question of all. What was I going to do if it was true? If Edward was a vampire \u2014 I could hardly make myself think the words \u2014 then what should I do? Involving someone else was definitely out. I couldn't even believe myself; anyone I told would have me committed.  Only two options seemed practical. The first was to take his advice: to be smart, to avoid him as much as possible. To cancel our plans, to go back to ignoring him as far as I was able. To pretend there was an impenetrably thick glass wall between us in the one class where we were forced together. To tell him to leave me alone \u2014 and mean it this time.  I was gripped in a sudden agony of despair as I considered that alternative. My mind rejected the pain, quickly skipping on to the next option. I could do nothing different. After all, if he was something\u2026 sinister, he'd done nothing to hurt me so far. In fact, I would be a dent in Tyler's fender if he hadn't acted so quickly. So quickly, I argued with myself, that it might have been sheer reflexes. But if it was a reflex to save lives, how bad could he be? I retorted. My head spun around in answerless circles. There was one thing I was sure of, if I was sure of anything. The dark Edward in my dream last night was a reflection only of my fear of the word Jacob had spoken, and not Edward himself. Even so, when I'd screamed out in terror at the werewolf's lunge, it wasn't fear for the wolf that brought the cry of \"no\" to my lips. It was fear that he would be harmed \u2014 even as he called to me with sharp-edged fangs, I feared for him. And I knew in that I had my answer. I didn't know if there ever was a choice, really. I was already in too deep. Now that I knew \u2014 if I knew \u2014 I could do nothing about my frightening secret. Because when I thought of him, of his voice, his hypnotic eyes, the magnetic force of his personality, I wanted nothing more than to be with him right now. Even if\u2026 but I couldn't think it. Not here, alone in the darkening forest. Not while the rain made it dim as twilight under the canopy and pattered like footsteps across the matted earthen floor. I shivered and rose quickly from my place of concealment, worried that somehow the path would have disappeared with the rain. But it was there, safe and clear, winding its way out of the dripping green maze. I followed it hastily, my hood pulled close around my face, becoming surprised, as I nearly ran through the trees, at how far I had come. I started to wonder if I was heading out at all, or following the path farther into the confines of the forest. Before I could get too panicky, though, I began to glimpse some open spaces through the webbed branches. And then I could hear a car passing on the street, and I was free, Charlie's lawn stretched out in front of me, the house beckoning me, promising warmth and dry socks. It was just noon when I got back inside. I went upstairs and got dressed for the day, jeans and a t-shirt, since I was staying indoors. It didn't take too much effort to concentrate on my task for the day, a paper on Macbeth that was due Wednesday. I settled into outlining a rough draft contentedly, more serene than I'd felt since\u2026 well, since Thursday afternoon, if I was being honest.  That had always been my way, though. Making decisions was the painful part for me, the part I agonized over. But once the decision was made, I simply followed through \u2014 usually with relief that the choice was made. Sometimes the relief was tainted by despair, like my decision to come to Forks. But it was still better than wrestling with the alternatives.  This decision was ridiculously easy to live with. Dangerously easy.  And so the day was quiet, productive \u2014 I finished my paper before eight. Charlie came home with a large catch, and I made a mental note to pick up a book of recipes for fish while I was in Seattle next week. The chills that flashed up my spine whenever I thought of that trip were no different than the ones I'd felt before I'd taken my walk with Jacob Black. They should be different, I thought. I should be afraid \u2014 I knew I should be, but I couldn't feel the right kind of fear. I slept dreamlessly that night, exhausted from beginning my day so early, and sleeping so poorly the night before. I woke, for the second time since arriving in Forks, to the bright yellow light of a sunny day. I skipped to the window, stunned to see that there was hardly a cloud in the sky, and those there were just fleecy little white puffs that couldn't possibly be carrying any rain. I opened the window \u2014 surprised when it opened silently, without sticking, not having opened it in who knows how many years \u2014 and sucked in the relatively dry air. It was nearly warm and hardly windy at all. My blood was electric in my veins.  Charlie was finishing breakfast when I came downstairs, and he picked up on my mood immediately. \"Nice day out,\" he commented. \"Yes,\" I agreed with a grin. He smiled back, his brown eyes crinkling around the edges. When Charlie smiled, it was easier to see why he and my mother had jumped too quickly into an early marriage. Most of the young romantic he'd been in those days had faded before I'd known him, as the curly brown hair \u2014 the same color, if not the same texture, as mine \u2014 had dwindled, slowly revealing more and more of the shiny skin of his forehead. But when he smiled I could see a little of the man who had run away with Ren\u00e9e when she was just two years older than I was now. I ate breakfast cheerily, watching the dust moats stirring in the sunlight that streamed in the back window. Charlie called out a goodbye, and I heard the cruiser pull away from the house. I hesitated on my way out the door, hand on my rain jacket. It would be tempting fate to leave it home. With a sigh, I folded it over my arm and stepped out into the brightest light I'd seen in months. By dint of much elbow grease, I was able to get both windows in the truck almost completely rolled down. I was one of the first ones to school; I hadn't even checked the clock in my hurry to get outside. I parked and headed toward the seldom-used picnic benches on the south side of the cafeteria. The benches were still a little damp, so I sat on my jacket, glad to have a use for it. My homework was done \u2014 the product of a slow social life \u2014 but there were a few Trig problems I wasn't sure I had right. I took out my book industriously, but halfway through rechecking the first problem I was daydreaming, watching the sunlight play on the red-barked trees. I sketched inattentively along the margins of my homework. After a few minutes, I suddenly realized I'd drawn five pairs of dark eyes staring out of the page at me. I scrubbed them out with the eraser. \"Bella!\" I heard someone call, and it sounded like Mike. I looked around to realize that the school had become populated while I'd been sitting there, absentminded. Everyone was in t-shirts, some even in shorts though the temperature couldn't be over sixty. Mike was coming toward me in khaki shorts and a striped Rugby shirt, waving.  \"Hey, Mike,\" I called, waving back, unable to be halfhearted on a morning like this. He came to sit by me, the tidy spikes of his hair shining golden in the light, his grin stretching across his face. He was so delighted to see me, I couldn't help but feel gratified. \"I never noticed before \u2014 your hair has red in it,\" he commented, catching between his fingers a strand that was fluttering in the light breeze. \"Only in the sun.\" I became just a little uncomfortable as he tucked the lock behind my ear. \"Great day, isn't it?\" \"My kind of day,\" I agreed.  \"What did you do yesterday?\" His tone was just a bit too proprietary. \"I mostly worked on my essay.\" I didn't add that I was finished with it \u2014 no need to sound smug. He hit his forehead with the heel of his hand. \"Oh yeah \u2014 that's due Thursday, right?\" \"Um, Wednesday, I think.\" \"Wednesday?\" He frowned. \"That's not good\u2026 What are you writing yours on?\" \"Whether Shakespeare's treatment of the female characters is misogynistic.\" He stared at me like I'd just spoken in pig Latin. \"I guess I'll have to get to work on that tonight,\" he said, deflated. \"I was going to ask if you wanted to go out.\" \"Oh.\" I was taken off guard. Why couldn't I ever have a pleasant\u00a0 conversation with Mike anymore without it getting awkward? \"Well, we could go to dinner or something\u2026 and I could work on it later.\" He smiled at me hopefully. \"Mike\u2026\" I hated being put on the spot. \"I don't think that would be the best idea.\" His face fell. \"Why?\" he asked, his eyes guarded. My thoughts flickered to Edward, wondering if that's where his thoughts were as well. \"I think\u2026 and if you ever repeat what I'm saying right now I will cheerfully beat you to death,\" I threatened, \"but I think that would hurt Jessica's feelings.\" He was bewildered, obviously not thinking in that direction at all.  \"Jessica?\" \"Really, Mike, are you blind?\" \"Oh,\" he exhaled \u2014 clearly dazed. I took advantage of that to make my escape. \"It's time for class, and I can't be late again.\" I gathered my books up and stuffed them in my bag. We walked in silence to building three, and his expression was distracted. I hoped whatever thoughts he was immersed in were leading him in the right direction. When I saw Jessica in Trig, she was bubbling with enthusiasm. She, Angela, and Lauren were going to Port Angeles tonight to go dress shopping for the dance, and she wanted me to come, too, even though I didn't need one. I was indecisive. It would be nice to get out of town with some girlfriends, but Lauren would be there. And who knew what I could be doing tonight\u2026 But that was definitely the wrong path to let my mind wander down. Of course I was happy about the sunlight. But that wasn't completely responsible for the euphoric mood I was in, not even close. So I gave her a maybe, telling her I'd have to talk with Charlie first. She talked of nothing but the dance on the way to Spanish, continuing as if without an interruption when class finally ended, five minutes late, and we were on our way to lunch. I was far too lost in my own frenzy of anticipation to notice much of what she said. I was painfully eager to see not just him but all the Cullens \u2014 to compare them with the new suspicions that plagued my mind. As I crossed the threshold of the cafeteria, I felt the first true tingle of fear slither down my spine and settle in my stomach. Would they be able to know what I was thinking? And then a different feeling jolted through me \u2014 would Edward be waiting to sit with me again? As was my routine, I glanced first toward the Cullens' table. A shiver of panic trembled in my stomach as I realized it was empty. With dwindling hope, my eyes scoured the rest of the cafeteria, hoping to find him alone, waiting for me. The place was nearly filled \u2014 Spanish had made us late \u2014 but there was no sign of Edward or any of his family. Desolation hit me with crippling strength. I shambled along behind Jessica, not bothering to pretend to listen anymore. We were late enough that everyone was already at our table. I avoided the empty chair next to Mike in favor of one by Angela. I vaguely noticed that Mike held the chair out politely for Jessica, and that her face lit up in response. Angela asked a few quiet questions about the Macbeth paper, which I answered as naturally as I could while spiraling downward in misery. She, too, invited me to go with them tonight, and I agreed now, grasping at anything to distract myself. I realized I'd been holding on to a last shred of hope when I entered Biology, saw his empty seat, and felt a new wave of disappointment. The rest of the day passed slowly, dismally. In Gym, we had a lecture on the rules of badminton, the next torture they had lined up for me. But at least it meant I got to sit and listen instead of stumbling around on the court. The best part was the coach didn't finish, so I got another day off tomorrow. Never mind that the day after they would arm me with a racket before unleashing me on the rest of the class. I was glad to leave campus, so I would be free to pout and mope before I went out tonight with Jessica and company. But right after I walked in the door of Charlie's house, Jessica called to cancel our plans. I tried to be happy that Mike had asked her out to dinner \u2014 I really was relieved that he finally seemed to be catching on \u2014 but my enthusiasm sounded false in my own ears. She rescheduled our shopping trip for tomorrow night. Which left me with little in the way of distractions. I had fish marinating for dinner, with a salad and bread left over from the night before, so there was nothing to do there. I spent a focused half hour on homework, but then I was through with that, too. I checked my e-mail, reading the backlog of letters from my mother, getting snippier as they progressed to the present. I sighed and typed a quick response.  Mom, Sorry. I've been out. I went to the beach with some friends. And I had to write a paper. My excuses were fairly pathetic, so I gave up on that. It's sunny outside today - I know, I'm shocked, too - so I'm going to go outside and soak up as much vitamin D as I can. I love you, Bella. I decided to kill an hour with non-school-related reading. I had a small collection of books that came with me to Forks, the shabbiest volume being a compilation of the works of Jane Austen. I selected that one and headed to the backyard, grabbing a ragged old quilt from the linen cupboard at the top of the stairs on my way down. Outside in Charlie's small, square yard, I folded the quilt in half and laid it out of the reach of the trees' shadows on the thick lawn that would always be slightly wet, no matter how long the sun shone. I lay on my stomach, crossing my ankles in the air, flipping through the different novels in the book, trying to decide which would occupy my mind the most thoroughly. My favorites were Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility. I'd read the first most recently, so I started into Sense and Sensibility, only to remember after I began three that the hero of the story happened to be named Edward. Angrily, I turned to Mansfield Park, but the hero of that piece was named Edmund, and that was just too close. Weren't there any other names available in the late eighteenth century? I snapped the book shut, annoyed, and rolled over onto my back.  I pushed my sleeves up as high as they would go, and closed my eyes. I would think of nothing but the warmth on my skin, I told myself severely. The breeze was still light, but it blew tendrils of my hair around my face, and that tickled a bit. I pulled all my hair over my head, letting it fan out on the quilt above me, and focused again on the heat that touched my eyelids, my cheekbones, my nose, my lips, my forearms, my neck, soaked through my light shirt\u2026 The next thing I was conscious of was the sound of Charlie's cruiser turning onto the bricks of the driveway. I sat up in surprise, realizing the light was gone, behind the trees, and I had fallen asleep. I looked around, muddled, with the sudden feeling that I wasn't alone.  \"Charlie?\" I asked. But I could hear his door slamming in front of the house. I jumped up, foolishly edgy, gathering the now-damp quilt and my book. I ran inside to get some oil heating on the stove, realizing that dinner would be late. Charlie was hanging up his gun belt and stepping out of his boots when I came in. \"Sorry, Dad, dinner's not ready yet \u2014 I fell asleep outside.\" I stifled a yawn. \"Don't worry about it,\" he said. \"I wanted to catch the score on the game, anyway.\" I watched TV with Charlie after dinner, for something to do. There wasn't anything on I wanted to watch, but he knew I didn't like baseball, so he turned it to some mindless sitcom that neither of us enjoyed. He seemed happy, though, to be doing something together. And it felt good, despite my depression, to make him happy. \"Dad,\" I said during a commercial, \"Jessica and Angela are going to look at dresses for the dance tomorrow night in Port Angeles, and they wanted me to help them choose\u2026 do you mind if I go with them?\" \"Jessica Stanley?\" he asked. \"And Angela Weber.\" I sighed as I gave him the details. He was confused. \"But you're not going to the dance, right?\" \"No, Dad, but I'm helping them find dresses \u2014 you know, giving them constructive criticism.\" I wouldn't have to explain this to a woman. \"Well, okay.\" He seemed to realize that he was out of his depth with the girlie stuff. \"It's a school night, though.\" \"We'll leave right after school, so we can get back early. You'll be okay for dinner, right?\" \"Bells, I fed myself for seventeen years before you got here,\" he reminded me. \"I don't know how you survived,\" I muttered, then added more clearly, \"I'll leave some things for cold-cut sandwiches in the fridge, okay? Right on top.\" It was sunny again in the morning. I awakened with renewed hope that I grimly tried to suppress. I dressed for the warmer weather in a deep blue V-neck blouse \u2014 something I'd worn in the dead of winter in Phoenix.  I had planned my arrival at school so that I barely had time to make it to class. With a sinking heart, I circled the full lot looking for a space, while also searching for the silver Volvo that was clearly not there. I parked in the last row and hurried to English, arriving breathless, but subdued, before the final bell.  It was the same as yesterday \u2014 I just couldn't keep little sprouts of hope from budding in my mind, only to have them squashed painfully as I searched the lunchroom in vain and sat at my empty Biology table. The Port Angeles scheme was back on again for tonight and made all the more attractive by the fact that Lauren had other obligations. I was anxious to get out of town so I could stop glancing over my shoulder, hoping to see him appearing out of the blue the way he always did. I vowed to myself that I would be in a good mood tonight and not ruin Angela's or Jessica's enjoyment in the dress hunting. Maybe I could do a little clothes shopping as well. I refused to think that I might be shopping alone in Seattle this weekend, no longer interested in the earlier arrangement. Surely he wouldn't cancel without at least telling me. After school, Jessica followed me home in her old white Mercury so that I could ditch my books and truck. I brushed through my hair quickly when I was inside, feeling a slight lift of excitement as I contemplated getting out of Forks. I left a note for Charlie on the table, explaining again where to find dinner, switched my scruffy wallet from my school bag to a purse I rarely used, and ran out to join Jessica. We went to Angela's house next, and she was waiting for us. My excitement increased exponentially as we actually drove out of the town limits.",
