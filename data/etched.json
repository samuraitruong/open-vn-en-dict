I sometimes despair over my body - the wrinkles, the baggy eyes, and the sagging butt. And often I am taken aback by that old person that lives in my mirror, but I don't agonize over those things for long. I would never trade my amazing friends, my wonderful life, my loving family for less gray hair or a flatter belly. As I've aged, I've become more kind to myself, and less critical of myself. I've become my own friend. I don't chide myself for eating that extra cookie, or for not making my bed, or for buying that silly cement gecko that I didn't need, but looks so avant-garde on my patio. I am entitled to overeat, to be messy, to be extravagant. I have seen too many dear friends leave this world too soon; before they understood the great freedom that comes with aging.\u00a0  Whose business is it if I choose to read or play on the computer until 4 am, and sleep until noon?\u00a0 I will dance with myself to those wonderful tunes of the 60's, and if I, at the same time, wish to weep over a lost love.. I will I will walk to the beach in a swim suit that is stretched over a bulging body, and will dive into the waves with abandon if I choose to, despite the pitying glances from the bikini set. They, too, will get old! I know I am sometimes forgetful. But there again, some of life is just as well forgotten, and I eventually remember the important things.\u00a0\u00a0  Sure, over the years my heart has been broken. How can your heart not break when you lose a loved one, or when a child suffers, or even when a beloved pet gets hit by a car? But broken hearts are what give us strength and understanding and compassion. A heart never broken is pristine and sterile and will never know the joy of being imperfect. Old Age is a Gift. I am so blessed to have lived long enough to have my hair turn gray, and to have my youthful laughs be forever <em>etched</em> into deep grooves on my face. So many have never laughed, and so many have died before their hair could turn silver. I can say 'no', and mean it. I can say 'yes', and mean it. As you get older, it is easier to be positive. You care less about what other people think. I don't question myself anymore. I've even been taught how to know right from wrong.  So, to answer your question, I like being old. It has set me free. I like the person I have become. I am not going to live forever, but while I am still here, I will not waste time lamenting what could have been, or worrying about what will be. And I shall eat dessert every single day.",

            "en": "7 REPETITION         15. PRESSURE It was spring break in Forks again. When i woke up on Monday morning, I lay in bed for a few seconds absorbing that. Last spring break, I'd been hunted by a vampire, too. I hoped this wasn't some kind of tradition forming. Already I was falling into the pattern of things in La Push. I'd spent Sunday mostly on the beach, while Charlie hung out with Billy at the Blacks' house. I was supposed to be with Jacob, but Jacob had other things to do, so I wandered alone, keeping the secret from Charlie. When Jacob dropped in to check on me, he apologized for ditching me so much. He told me his schedule wasn't always this crazy, but until Victoria was stopped, the wolves were on red alert. When we walked along the beach now, he always held my hand. This made me brood over what Jared had said, about Jacob involving his \"girlfriend.\" I supposed that that was exactly what it looked like from the outside. As long as Jake and I knew how it really was, I shouldn't let those kinds of assumptions bother me. And maybe they wouldn't, if I hadn't known that Jacob would have loved for things to be what they appeared. But his hand felt nice as it warmed mine, and I didn't protest. I worked Tuesday afternoon\u2014Jacob followed me on his bike to make sure I arrived safely\u2014and Mike noticed. \"Are you dating that kid from La Push? The sophomore?\" He asked, poorly disguising the resentment in his tone. I shrugged. \"Not in the technical sense of the word. I do spent most of my time with Jacob, though. He's my best friend.\" Mike's eyes narrowed shrewdly. \"Don't kid yourself, Bella. The guy's head over heels for you.\" \"I know,\" I sighed. \"Life is complicated.\" \"And girls are cruel,\" Mike said under his breath. I supposed that was an easy assumption to make, too. That night, Sam and Emily joined Charlie and me for dessert at Billy's house. Emily brought a cake that would have won over a harder man than Charlie. I could see, as the conversation flowed naturally through a range of casual subjects, that any worries Charlie might have harbored about gangs in La Push were being dissolved. Jake and I skipped out early, to get some privacy. We went out to his garage and sat in the Rabbit. Jacob leaned his head back, his face drawn with exhaustion. \"You need some sleep, Jake.\" \"I'll get around to it.\" He reached over and took my hand. His skin was blazing on mine. \"Is that one of those wolf things?\" I asked him. \"The heat, I mean.\" \"Yeah. We run a little warmer than the normal people. About one-oh-eight, one-oh-nine. I never get cold anymore. I could stand like this\"\u2014he gestured to his bare torso\u2014\"in a snowstorm and it wouldn't bother me. The flakes would turn to rain where I stood.\" \"And you all heal fast\u2014that's a wolf thing, too?\" \"Yeah, wanna see? It's pretty cool.\" His eyes flipped open and he grinned. He reached around me to the glove compartment and dug around for a minute. His hand came out with a pocketknife. \"No, I do not want to see!\" I shouted as soon as I realized what he was thinking. \"Put that away!\" Jacob chuckled, but shoved the knife back where it belonged. \"Fine. It's a good thing we heal, though.\u00a0 You can't go see just any doctor when you're running a temperature that should mean you're dead.\" \"No, I guess not.\" I thought about that for a minute. \"\u2026 And being so big\u2014that's part of it? Is that why you're all worried about Quil?\" \"That and the fact that Quil's grandfather says the kid could fry an egg on his forehead.\" Jacob's face turned hopeless. \"It won't be long now. There's no exact age\u2026 it just builds and builds and then suddenly\u2014\" He broke off, and it was a moment before he could speak again. \"Sometimes, if you get really upset or something, that can trigger it early. But I wasn't upset about anything\u2014I was happy.\" He laughed bitterly. \"Because of you, mostly. That's why it didn't happen to me sooner. Instead it just kept on building up inside me\u2014I was like a time bomb. You know what set me off? I got back from that movie and Billy said I looked weird. That was all, but I just snapped. And then I\u2014I exploded. I almost ripped his face off\u2014my own father!\" He shuddered, and his face paled. \"Is it really bad, Jake?\" I asked anxiously, wishing I had some way to help him. \"Are you miserable?\" \"No, I'm not miserable,\" he told me. \"Not anymore. Not now that you know. That was hard, before.\" He leaned over so that his cheek was resting on top of my head. He was quiet for a moment, and I wondered what he was thinking about. Maybe I didn't want to know. \"What's the hardest part?\" I whispered, still wishing I could help. \"The hardest part is feeling\u2026 out of control,\" he said slowly. \"Feeling like I can't be sure of myself\u2014like maybe you shouldn't be around me, like maybe nobody should. Like I'm a monster who might hurt somebody. You've seen Emily. Sam lost control of his temper for just one second\u2026 and she was standing too close. And now there's nothing he can ever do to put it right again. I hear his thoughts\u2014I know what that feels like\u2026 \"Who wants to be a nightmare, a monster? \"And then, the way it comes so easily to me, the way I'm better at it than the rest of them\u2014does that make me even less human than Enbry or Sam? Sometimes I'm afraid that I'm losing myself.\" \"Is it hard? To find yourself again?\" \"At first,\" he said. \"It takes some practice to phase back and forth. But it's easier for me.\" \"Why?\" I wondered. \"Because Ephraim Black was my father's grandfather, and Quil Ateara was my mother's grandfather.\" \"Quil?\" I asked in confusion. \"His great-grandfather,\" Jacob clarified. \"The Quil you know is my second cousin.\" \"But why does it matter who your great-grandfathers are?\" \"Because Ephraim and Quil were in the last pack. Levi Uley was the third. It's in my blood on both sides.\u00a0 I never had a chance. Like Quil doesn't have a chance.\" His expression was bleak. \"What's the very best part?\" I asked, hoping to cheer him up. \"The best part,\" he said, suddenly smiling again, \"is the speed.\" \"Better than the motorcycles?\" He nodded, enthusiastic. \"There's no comparison.\" \"How fast can you\u2026 ?\" \"Run?\" he finished my question. \"Fast enough. What can I measure it by? We caught\u2026 what was his name? Laurent? I imagine that means more to you than it would to someone else.\" It did mean something to me. I couldn't imagine that\u2014the wolves running faster than a vampire. When the Cullens ran, they all but turned invisible with speed. \"So, tell me something I don't know,\" he said. \"Something about vampires. How did you stand it, being around them? Didn't it creep you out?\" \"No,\" I said curtly. My tone made him thoughtful for a moment. \"Say, why'd your bloodsucker kill that James, anyway?\" he asked suddenly. \"James was trying to kill me\u2014it was like a game for him. He lost. Do you remember last spring when I was in the hospital down in Phoenix?\" Jacob sucked in a breath. \"He got that close?\" \"He got very, very close.\" I stroked my scar. Jacob noticed, because he held the hand I moved. \"What's that?\" He traded hands, examining my right. \"This is your funny scar, the cold one.\" He looked at it closer, with new eyes, and gasped. \"Yes, it's what you think it is,\" I said. \"James bit me.\" His eyes bulged, and his face turned a strange, sallow color under the russet surface. He looked like he was about to be sick. \"But if he bit you\u2026 ? Shouldn't you be\u2026 ?\" He choked. \"Edward saved me twice,\" I whispered. \"He sucked the venom out\u2014you know, like with a rattlesnake.\" I twitched as the pain lashed around the edges of the hole. But I wasn't the only one twitching. I could feel Jacob's whole body trembling next to mine. Even the car shook. \"Careful, Jake. Easy. Calm down.\" \"Yeah,\" he panted. \"Calm.\" He shook his head back and forth quickly. After a moment, only his hands were shaking. \"You okay?\" \"Yeah, almost. Tell me something else. Give me something else to think about.\" \"What do you want to know?\" \"I don't know.\" He had his eyes closed, concentrating. \"The extra stuff I guess. Did any of the other Cullens have\u2026 extra talents? Like the mind reading?\" I hesitated a second. This felt like a question he would ask of his spy, not his friend. But what was the point of hiding what I knew? It didn't matter now, and it would help him control himself. So I spoke quickly, the image of Emily's ruined face in my mind, and the hair rising on my arms. I couldn't imagine how the russet wolf would fit inside the Rabbit\u2014Jacob would tear the whole garage apart if he changed now. \"Jasper could\u2026 sort of control the emotions of the people around him. Not in a bad way, just to calm someone down, that kind of thing. It would probably help Paul a lot,\" I added, teasing weakly. \"And then Alice could see things that were going to happen. The future, you know, but not absolutely. The things she saw would change when someone changed the path they were on\u2026\" Like how she'd seen me dying\u2026 and she'd seen me becoming one of them. Two things that had not happened. And one that never would. My head started to spin\u2014I couldn't seem to pull in enough oxygen from the air. No lungs. Jacob was entirely in control now, very still beside me. \"Why do you do that?\" he asked. He tugged lightly at one of my arms, which was bound around my chest, and then gave up when it wouldn't come loose easily. I hadn't even realized I'd moved them. \"You do that when you're upset. Why?\" \"It hurts to think about them,\" I whispered. \"It's like I can't breathe\u2026 like I'm breaking into pieces\u2026\"It was bizarre how much I could tell Jacob now. We had no more secrets. He smoothed my hair. \"It's okay, Bella, it's okay. I won't bring it up again. I'm sorry.\" \"I'm fine.\" I gasped. \"Happens all the time. Not your fault.\" \"We're a pretty messed-up pair, aren't we?\" Jacob said. \"Neither one of us can hold our shape together right.\" \"Pathetic,\" I agreed, still breathless. \"At least we have each other,\" he said, clearly comforted by the thought. I was comforted, too. \"At least there's that,\" I agreed. And when we were together, it was fine. But Jacob had a horrible, dangerous job he felt compelled to do, and so I was often alone, stuck in La Push for safety, with nothing to do to keep my mind off any of my worries. I felt awkward, always taking up space at Billy's. I did some studying for another Calculus test that was coming up next week, but I could only look at math for so long. When I didn't have something obvious to do in my hands,\u00a0 I felt like I ought to be making conversation with Billy\u2014the pressure of normal societal rules. But Billy wasn't one for filling up the long silences, and so the awkwardness continued. I tried hanging out at Emily's place Wednesday afternoon, for a change. At first it was kind of nice. Emily was a cheerful person who never sat still. I drifted behind her while she flitted around her little house and yard, scrubbing at the spotless floor, pulling a tiny weed, fixing a broken hinge, tugging a string of wool through an ancient loom, and always cooking, too. She complained lightly about the increase in the boys' appetites from all their extra running, but it was easy to see she didn't mind taking care of them. It wasn't hard to be with her\u2014after all, we were both wolf girls now. But Sam checked in after I'd been there for a few hours. I only stayed long enough to ascertain that Jacob was fine and there was no news, and then I had to escape. The aura of love and contentment that surrounded them was harder to take in concentrated doses, with no one else around to dilute it. So that left me wandering the beach, pacing the length of the rocky crescent back and forth, again and again. Alone time wasn't good for me. Thanks to the new honesty with Jacob, I'd been talking and thinking about the Cullens way too much. No matter how I tried to distract myself\u2014and I had plenty to think of: I was honestly and desperately worried about Jacob and his wolf-brothers, I was terrified for Charlie and the others who thought they were hunting animals, I was getting in deeper and deeper with Jacob without ever having consciously decided to progress in that direction and I didn't know what to do about it\u2014none of these very real, very deserving of thought, very pressing concerns could take my mind off the pain in my chest for long. Eventually, I couldn't even walk anymore, because I couldn't breathe. I sat down on a patch of semidry rocks and curled up in a ball. Jacob found me like that, and I could tell from his expression that he understood. \"Sorry,\" he said right away. He pulled me up from the ground and wrapped both arms around my shoulders. I hadn't realized that I was cold until then. His warmth made me shudder, but at least I could breathe with him there. \"I'm ruining your spring break,\" Jacob accused himself as we walked back up the beach. \"No, you're not. I didn't have any plans. I don't think I like spring breaks, anyway.\" \"I'll take tomorrow morning off. The others can run without me. We'll do something fun.\" The word seemed out of place in my life right now, barely comprehensible, bizarre. \"Fun?\" \"Fun is exactly what you need. Hmm\u2026\" he gazed out across the heaving gray waves, deliberating. As his eyes scanned the horizon, he had a flash of inspiration. \"Got it!\" he crowed. \"Another promise to keep.\" \"What are you talking about?\" He let go of my hand and pointed toward the southern edge of the beach, where the flat, rocky half-moon dead-ended against the sheer sea cliffs. I stared, uncomprehending. \"Didn't I promise to take you cliff diving?\" I shivered. \"Yeah, it'll be pretty cold\u2014not as cold as it is today. Can you feel the weather changing? The pressure?\u00a0 It will be warmer tomorrow. You up for it?\" The dark water did not look inviting, and, from this angle, the cliffs looked even higher than before. But it had been days since I'd heard Edward's voice. That was probably part of the problem. I was addicted to the sound of my delusions. It made things worse if I went too long without them. Jumping off a cliff was certain to remedy that situation. \"Sure, I'm up for it. Fun.\" \"It's a date,\" he said, and draped his arm around my shoulders. \"Okay\u2014now let's go get you some sleep.\" I didn't like the way the circles under his eyes were beginning to look permanently <em>etched</em> onto his skin. I woke early the next morning and snuck a change of clothes out to the truck. I had a feeling that Charlie would approve of today's plan just about as much as he would approve of the motorcycle. The idea of a distraction from all my worries had me almost excited. Maybe it would be fun. A date with Jacob, a date with Edward\u2026 I laughed darkly to myself. Jake could say what he wanted about us being a messed-up pair\u2014I was the one who was truly messed up. I made the werewolf seem downright normal. I expected Jacob to meet me out front, the way he usually did when my noisy truck announced my arrival. When he didn't, I guessed that he might still be sleeping. I would wait\u2014let him get as much rest as he could. He needed his sleep, and that would give the day time to warm a bit more. Jake had been right about the weather, though; it had changed in the night. A thick layer of clouds pressed heavily on the atmosphere now, making it almost sultry; it was warm and close under the gray blanket. I left my sweater in the truck. I knocked quietly on the door. \"C'mon in, Bella,\" Billy said. He was at the kitchen table, eating cold cereal. \"Jake sleeping?\" \"Er, no.\" He set his spoon down, and his eyebrows pulled together. \"What happened?\" I demanded. I could tell from his expression that something had. \"Embry, Jared, and Paul crossed a fresh trail early this morning. Sam and Jake took off to help. Sam was hopeful\u2014she's hedged herself in beside the mountains. He thinks they have a good chance to finish this.\" \"Oh, no, Billy,\" I whispered. \"Oh, no.\" He chuckled, deep and low. \"Do you really like La Push so well that you want to extend your sentence here?\" \"Don't make jokes, Billy. This is too scary for that.\" \"You're right,\" he agreed, still complacent. His ancient eyes were impossible to read. \"This one's tricky.\" I bit my lip. \"It's not as dangerous for them as you think it is. Sam knows what he's doing. You're the one that you should worry about. The vampire doesn't want to fight them. She's just trying to find a way around them\u2026 to you.\" \"How does Sam know what he's doing?\" I demanded, brushing aside his concern for me. \"They've only killed just the one vampire\u2014that could have been luck.\" \"We take what we do very seriously, Bella. Nothing's been forgotten. Everything they need to know has been passed down from father to son for generations.\" That didn't comfort me the way he probably intended it to. The memory of Victoria, wild, catlike, lethal, was too strong in my head. If she couldn't get around the wolves, she would eventually try to go through them. Billy went back to his breakfast; I sat down on the sofa and flipped aimlessly though the TV channels. That didn't last long. I started to feel closed in by the small room, claustrophobic, upset by the fact that I couldn't see out the curtained windows. \"I'll be at the beach,\" I told Billy abruptly, and hurried out the door. Being outside didn't help as much as I'd hoped. The clouds pushed down with an invisible weight that kept the claustrophobia from easing. The forest seemed strangely vacant as I walked toward the beach. I didn't see any animals\u2014no birds, no squirrels. I couldn't hear any birds, either. The silence was eerie; there wasn't even the sound of wind in the trees.  I knew it was all just a product of the weather, but it still made me edgy. The heavy, warm pressure of the atmosphere was perceptible even to my weak human senses, and it hinted at something major in the storm department. A glance at the sky backed this up; the clouds were churning sluggishly despite the lack of breeze on the ground. The closest clouds were a smoky gray, but between the cracks I could see another layer that was a gruesome purple color. The skies had a ferocious plan in store for today. The animals must be bunkering down. As soon as I reached the beach, I wished I hadn't come\u2014I'd already had enough of this place. I'd been here almost every day, wandering alone. Was it so much different from my nightmares? But where else to go? I trudged down to the driftwood tree, and sat at the end so that I could lean against the tangled roots. I stared up at the angry sky broodingly, waiting for the first drops to break the stillness. I tried not to think about the danger Jacob and his friends were in. Because nothing could happen to Jacob. The thought was unendurable. I'd lost too much already\u2014would fate take the last few shreds of peace left behind? That seemed unfair, out of balance. But maybe I'd violated some unknown rule, crossed some line that had condemned me. Maybe it was wrong to be so involved with myths and legends, to turn my back on the human world. Maybe\u2026 No. Nothing would happen to Jacob. I had to believe that or I wouldn't be able to function. \"Argh!\" I groaned, and jumped off the log. I couldn't sit still; it was worse than pacing.  I'd really been counting on hearing Edward this morning. It seemed like that was the one thing that might make it bearable to live through this day. The hole had been festering lately, like it was getting revenge for the times that Jacob's presence had tamed it. The edges burned. The waves picked up as I paced, beginning to crash against the rocks, but there was still no wind. I felt pinned down by the pressure of the storm. Everything swirled around me, but it was perfectly still where I stood. The air had a faint electric charge\u2014I could feel the static in my hair. Farther out, the waves were angrier than they were along the shore. I could see them battering against the line of the cliffs, spraying big white clouds of sea foam into the sky. There was still no movement in the air, though the clouds roiled more quickly now. It was eerie looking\u2014like the clouds were moving by their own will. I shivered, though I knew it was just a trick of the pressure. The cliffs were a black knife edge against the livid sky. Staring at them, I remembered the day Jacob had told me about Sam and his \"gang.\" I thought of the boys\u2014the werewolves\u2014throwing themselves into the empty air. The image of the falling, spiraling figures was still vivid in my mind. I imagined the utter freedom of the fall\u2026 I imagined the way Edward's voice would have sounded in my head\u2014furious, velvet, perfect\u2026 The burning in my chest flared agonizingly. There had to be some way to quench it. The pain was growing more and more intolerable by the second. I glared at the cliffs and the crashing waves. Well, why not? Why not quench it right now? Jacob had promised me cliff diving, hadn't he? Just because he was unavailable, should I have to give up the distraction I needed so badly\u2014needed even worse because Jacob was out risking his life? Risking it, in essence, for me. If it weren't for me, Victoria would not be killing people here\u2026 just somewhere else, far away. If anything happened to Jacob, it would be my fault. That realization stabbed deep and had me jogging back up to the road toward Billy's house, where my truck waited. I knew my way to the lane that passed closest to the cliffs, but I had to hunt for the little path that would take me out to the ledge. As I followed it, I looked for turns or forks, knowing that Jake had planned to take me off the lower outcropping rather than the top, but the path wound in a thin single line toward the brink with no options. I didn't have time to find another way down\u2014the storm was moving in quickly now. The wind was finally beginning to touch me, the clouds pressing closer to the ground. Just as I reached the place where the dirt path fanned out into the stone precipice, the first drops broke through and splattered on my face. It was not hard to convince myself that I didn't have time to search for another way\u2014I wanted to jump from the top. This was the image that had lingered in my head. I wanted the long fall that would feel like flying. I knew that this was the stupidest, most reckless thing I had done yet. The thought made me smile. The pain was already easing, as if my body knew that Edward's voice was just seconds away\u2026 The ocean sounded very far away, somehow farther than before, when I was on the path in the trees. I grimaced when I thought of the probable temperature of the water. But I wasn't going to let that stop me. The wind blew stronger now, whipping the rain into eddies around me. I stepped out to the edge, keeping my eyes on the empty space in front of me. My toes felt ahead blindly, caressing the edge of the rock when they encountered it. I drew in a deep breath and held it . . waiting. \"Bella.\" I smiled and exhaled. Yes? I didn't answer out loud, for fear that the sound of my voice would shatter the beautiful illusion. He sounded so real, so close. It was only when he was disapproving like this that I could hear the true memory of his voice\u2014the velvet texture and the musical intonation that made up the most perfect of all voices. \"Don't do this,\" he pleaded. You wanted me to be human, I reminded him. Well, watch me. \"Please. For me.\" But you won't stay with me any other way. \"Please.\" It was just a whisper in the blowing rain that tossed my hair and drenched my clothes\u2014making me as wet as if this were my second jump of the day. I rolled up onto the balls of my feet. \"No, Bella!\" He was angry now, and the anger was so lovely. I smiled and raised my arms straight out, as if I were going to dive, lifting my face into the rain. But it was too ingrained from years of swimming at the public pool\u2014feet first, first time. I leaned forward, crouching to get more spring\u2026 And I flung myself off the cliff. I screamed as I dropped through the open air like a meteor, but it was a scream of exhilaration and not fear. The wind resisted, trying vainly to fight the\u00a0 unconquerable gravity, pushing against me and twirling me in spirals like a rocket crashing to the earth. Yes! The word echoed through my head as I sliced through the surface of the water. It was icy, colder than I'd feared, and yet the chill only added to the high. I was proud of myself as I plunged deeper into the freezing black water. I hadn't had one moment of terror\u2014just pure adrenaline. Really, the fall wasn't scary at all. Where was the challenge? That was when the current caught me. I'd been so preoccupied by the size of the cliffs, by the obvious danger of their high, sheer faces, that I hadn't worried at all about the dark water waiting. I never dreamed that the true menace was lurking far below me, under the heaving surf. It felt like the waves were fighting over me, jerking me back and forth between them as if determined to share by pulling me into halves. I knew the right way to avoid a riptide: swim parallel to the beach rather than struggling for the shore. But the knowledge did me little good when I didn't know which way the shore was. I couldn't even tell which way the surface was. The angry water was black in every direction; there was no brightness to direct me upward. Gravity was all-powerful when it competed with the air, but it had nothing on the waves\u2014I couldn't feel a downward pull, a sinking in any direction. Just the battering of the current that flung me round and round like a rag doll. I fought to keep my breath in, to keep my lips locked around my last store of oxygen. It didn't surprise me that my delusion of Edward was there. He owed me that much, considering that I was dying. I was surprised by how sure that knowledge was. I was going to drown. I was drowning. \"Keep swimming!\" Edward begged urgently in my head. Where? There was nothing but the darkness. There was no place to swim to. \"Stop that!\" he ordered. \"Don't you dare give up!\" The cold of the water was numbing my arms and legs. I didn't feel the buffeting so much as before. It was more of just a dizziness now, a helpless spinning in the water. But I listened to him. I forced my arms to continue reaching, my legs to kick harder, though every second I was facing a new direction. It couldn't be doing any good. What was the point? \"Fight!\" he yelled. \"Damn it, Bella, keep fighting.\" Why? I didn't want to fight anymore. And it wasn't the light-headedness, or the cold, or the failure of my arms as the muscles gave out in exhaustion, that made me content to stay where I was. I was almost happy that it was over. This was an easier death than others I'd faced. Oddly peaceful. I thought briefly of the clich\u00e9s, about how you were suppose to see your life flash before your eyes. I was so much luckier. Who wanted to see a rerun, anyway? I saw him, and I had no will to fight. It was so clear, so much more defined than any memory. My subconscious had stored Edward away in flawless detail, saving him for this final moment. I could see his perfect face as if he were really there; the exact shade of his icy skin, the shape of his lips, the line of his jaw, the gold glinting in his furious eyes. He was angry, naturally, that I was giving up. His teeth were clenched and his nostrils flared with rage. \"No! Bella, no!\" My ears were flooded with the freezing water, but his voice was clearer than ever. I ignored his words and concentrated on the sound of his voice. Why would I fight when I was so happy where I was? Even as my lungs burned for more air and my legs cramped in the icy cold, I was content. I'd forgotten what real happiness felt like. Happiness. It made the whole dying thing pretty bearable. The current won at that moment, shoving me abruptly against something hard, a rock invisible in the gloom. It hit me solidly across the chest, slamming into me like an iron bar, and the breath whooshed out of my lungs, escaping in a thick cloud of silver bubbles. Water flooded down my throat, choking and burning. The iron bar seemed to be dragging me, pulling me away from Edward, deeper into the dark, to the ocean floor. Goodbye, I love you, was my last thought.",

            "en": "6           6. SCARY STORIES  As I sat in my room, trying to concentrate on the third act of Macbeth, I was really listening for my truck. I would have thought, even over the pounding rain, I could have heard the engine's roar. But when I went to peek out the curtain \u2014 again \u2014 it was suddenly there. I wasn't looking forward to Friday, and it more than lived up to my non-expectations. Of course there were the fainting comments. Jessica especially seemed to get a kick out of that story. Luckily Mike had kept his mouth shut, and no one seemed to know about Edward's involvement. She did have a lot of questions about lunch, though. \"So what did Edward Cullen want yesterday?\" Jessica asked in Trig. \"I don't know,\" I answered truthfully. \"He never really got to the point.\" \"You looked kind of mad,\" she fished. \"Did I?\" I kept my expression blank. \"You know, I've never seen him sit with anyone but his family before. That was weird.\" \"Weird,\" I agreed. She seemed annoyed; she flipped her dark curls impatiently \u2014 I guessed she'd been hoping to hear something that would make a good story for her to pass on. The worst part about Friday was that, even though I knew he wasn't going to be there, I still hoped. When I walked into the cafeteria with Jessica and Mike, I couldn't keep from looking at his table, where Rosalie, Alice, and Jasper sat talking, heads close together. And I couldn't stop the gloom that engulfed me as I realized I didn't know how long I would have to wait before I saw him again. At my usual table, everyone was full of our plans for the next day. Mike was animated again, putting a great deal of trust in the local weatherman who promised sun tomorrow. I'd have to see that before I believed it. But it was warmer today \u2014 almost sixty. Maybe the outing wouldn't be completely miserable. I intercepted a few unfriendly glances from Lauren during lunch, which I didn't understand until we were all walking out of the room together. I was right behind her, just a foot from her slick, silver blond hair, and she was evidently unaware of that. \"\u2026don't know why Bella\" \u2014 she sneered my name \u2014 \"doesn't just sit with the Cullens from now on.\" I heard her muttering to Mike. I'd never noticed what an unpleasant, nasal voice she had, and I was surprised by the malice in it. I really didn't know her well at all, certainly not well enough for her to dislike me \u2014 or so I'd thought. \"She's my friend; she sits with us,\" Mike whispered back loyally, but also a bit territorially. I paused to let Jess and Angela pass me. I didn't want to hear any more. That night at dinner, Charlie seemed enthusiastic about my trip to La Push in the morning. I think he felt guilty for leaving me home alone on the weekends, but he'd spent too many years building his habits to break them now. Of course he knew the names of all the kids going, and their parents, and their great-grandparents, too, probably. He seemed to approve. I wondered if he would approve of my plan to ride to Seattle with Edward Cullen. Not that I was going to tell him. \"Dad, do you know a place called Goat Rocks or something like that? I think it's south of Mount Rainier,\" I asked casually. \"Yeah \u2014 why?\" I shrugged. \"Some kids were talking about camping there.\" \"It's not a very good place for camping.\" He sounded surprised. \"Too many bears. Most people go there during the hunting season.\" \"Oh,\" I murmured. \"Maybe I got the name wrong.\" I meant to sleep in, but an unusual brightness woke me. I opened my eyes to see a clear yellow light streaming through my window. I couldn't believe it. I hurried to the window to check, and sure enough, there was the sun. It was in the wrong place in the sky, too low, and it didn't seem to be as close as it should be, but it was definitely the sun. Clouds ringed the horizon, but a large patch of blue was visible in the middle. I lingered by the window as long as I could, afraid that if I left the blue would disappear again. The Newtons' Olympic Outfitters store was just north of town. I'd seen the store, but I'd never stopped there \u2014 not having much need for any supplies required for being outdoors over an extended period of time. In the parking lot I recognized Mike's Suburban and Tyler's Sentra. As I pulled up next to their vehicles, I could see the group standing around in front of the Suburban. Eric was there, along with two other boys I had class with; I was fairly sure their names were Ben and Conner. Jess was there, flanked by Angela and Lauren. Three other girls stood with them, including one I remembered falling over in Gym on Friday. That one gave me a dirty look as I got out of the truck, and whispered something to Lauren. Lauren shook out her cornsilk hair and eyed me scornfully.  So it was going to be one of those days. At least Mike was happy to see me. \"You came!\" he called, delighted. \"And I said it would be sunny today, didn't I?\" \"I told you I was coming,\" I reminded him. \"We're just waiting for Lee and Samantha\u2026 unless you invited someone,\" Mike added. \"Nope,\" I lied lightly, hoping I wouldn't get caught in the lie. But also wishing that a miracle would occur, and Edward would appear. Mike looked satisfied. \"Will you ride in my car? It's that or Lee's mom's minivan.\" \"Sure.\" He smiled blissfully. It was so easy to make Mike happy. \"You can have shotgun,\" he promised. I hid my chagrin. It wasn't as simple to make Mike and Jessica happy at the same time. I could see Jessica glowering at us now. The numbers worked out in my favor, though. Lee brought two extra people, and suddenly every seat was necessary. I managed to wedge Jess in between Mike and me in the front seat of the Suburban. Mike could have been more graceful about it, but at least Jess seemed appeased. It was only fifteen miles to La Push from Forks, with gorgeous, dense green forests edging the road most of the way and the wide Quillayute River snaking beneath it twice. I was glad I had the window seat. We'd rolled the windows down \u2014 the Suburban was a bit claustrophobic with nine people in it \u2014 and I tried to absorb as much sunlight as possible.  I'd been to the beaches around La Push many times during my Forks summers with Charlie, so the mile-long crescent of First Beach was familiar to me. It was still breathtaking. The water was dark gray, even in the sunlight, white-capped and heaving to the gray, rocky shore. Islands rose out of the steel harbor waters with sheer cliff sides, reaching to uneven summits, and crowned with austere, soaring firs. The beach had only a thin border of actual sand at the water's edge, after which it grew into millions of large, smooth stones that looked uniformly gray from a distance, but close up were every shade a stone could be: terra-cotta, sea green, lavender, blue gray, dull gold. The tide line was strewn with huge driftwood trees, bleached bone white in the salt waves, some piled together against the edge of the forest fringe, some lying solitary, just out of reach of the waves. There was a brisk wind coming off the waves, cool and briny. Pelicans floated on the swells while seagulls and a lone eagle wheeled above them. The clouds still circled the sky, threatening to invade at any moment, but for now the sun shone bravely in its halo of blue sky. We picked our way down to the beach, Mike leading the way to a ring of driftwood logs that had obviously been used for parties like ours before. There was a fire circle already in place, filled with black ashes. Eric and the boy I thought was named Ben gathered broken branches of driftwood from the drier piles against the forest edge, and soon had a teepee-shaped construction built atop the old cinders. \"Have you ever seen a driftwood fire?\" Mike asked me. I was sitting on one of the bone-colored benches; the other girls clustered, gossiping excitedly, on either side of me. Mike kneeled by the fire, lighting one of the smaller sticks with a cigarette lighter. \"No,\" I said as he placed the blazing twig carefully against the teepee.  \"You'll like this then \u2014 watch the colors.\" He lit another small branch and laid it alongside the first. The flames started to lick quickly up the dry wood. \"It's blue,\" I said in surprise. \"The salt does it. Pretty, isn't it?\" He lit one more piece, placed it where the fire hadn't yet caught, and then came to sit by me. Thankfully, Jess was on his other side. She turned to him and claimed his attention.  I watched the strange blue and green flames crackle toward the sky. After a half hour of chatter, some of the boys wanted to hike to the nearby tidal pools. It was a dilemma. On the one hand, I loved the tide pools. They had fascinated me since I was a child; they were one of the only things I ever looked forward to when I had to come to Forks. On the other hand, I'd also fallen into them a lot. Not a big deal when you're seven and with your dad. It reminded me of Edward's request \u2014 that I not fall into the ocean. Lauren was the one who made my decision for me. She didn't want to hike, and she was definitely wearing the wrong shoes for it. Most of the other girls besides Angela and Jessica decided to stay on the beach as well. I waited until Tyler and Eric had committed to remaining with them before I got up quietly to join the pro-hiking group. Mike gave me a huge smile when he saw that I was coming. The hike wasn't too long, though I hated to lose the sky in the woods.  The green light of the forest was strangely at odds with the adolescent laughter, too murky and ominous to be in harmony with the light banter around me. I had to watch each step I took very carefully, avoiding roots below and branches above, and I soon fell behind. Eventually I broke through the emerald confines of the forest and found the rocky shore again. It was low tide, and a tidal river flowed past us on its way to the sea. Along its pebbled banks, shallow pools that never completely drained were teeming with life. I was very cautious not to lean too far over the little ocean ponds. The others were fearless, leaping over the rocks, perching precariously on the edges. I found a very stable-looking rock on the fringe of one of the largest pools and sat there cautiously, spellbound by the natural aquarium below me. The bouquets of brilliant anemones undulated ceaselessly in the invisible current, twisted shells scurried about the edges, obscuring the crabs within them, starfish stuck motionless to the rocks and each other, while one small black eel with white racing stripes wove through the bright green weeds, waiting for the sea to return. I was completely absorbed, except for one small part of my mind that wondered what Edward was doing now, and trying to imagine what he would be saying if he were here with me. Finally the boys were hungry, and I got up stiffly to follow them back. I tried to keep up better this time through the woods, so naturally I fell a few times. I got some shallow scrapes on my palms, and the knees of my jeans were stained green, but it could have been worse.  When we got back to First Beach, the group we'd left behind had multiplied. As we got closer we could see the shining, straight black hair and copper skin of the newcomers, teenagers from the reservation come to socialize. The food was already being passed around, and the boys hurried to claim a share while Eric introduced us as we each entered the driftwood circle.  Angela and I were the last to arrive, and, as Eric said our names, I noticed a younger boy sitting on the stones near the fire glance up at me in interest. I sat down next to Angela, and Mike brought us sandwiches and an array of sodas to choose from, while a boy who looked to be the oldest of the visitors rattled off the names of the seven others with him. All I caught was that one of the girls was also named Jessica, and the boy who noticed me was named Jacob. It was relaxing to sit with Angela; she was a restful kind of person to be around \u2014 she didn't feel the need to fill every silence with chatter.  She left me free to think undisturbed while we ate. And I was thinking about how disjointedly time seemed to flow in Forks, passing in a blur at times, with single images standing out more clearly than others. And then, at other times, every second was significant, <em>etched</em> in my mind. I knew exactly what caused the difference, and it disturbed me. During lunch the clouds started to advance, slinking across the blue sky, darting in front of the sun momentarily, casting long shadows across the beach, and blackening the waves. As they finished eating, people started to drift away in twos and threes. Some walked down to the edge of the waves, trying to skip rocks across the choppy surface. Others were gathering a second expedition to the tide pools. Mike \u2014 with Jessica shadowing him \u2014 headed up to the one shop in the village. Some of the local kids went with them; others went along on the hike. By the time they all had scattered, I was sitting alone on my driftwood log, with Lauren and Tyler occupying themselves by the CD player someone had thought to bring, and three teenagers from the reservation perched around the circle, including the boy named Jacob and the oldest boy who had acted as spokesperson. A few minutes after Angela left with the hikers, Jacob sauntered over to take her place by my side. He looked fourteen, maybe fifteen, and had long, glossy black hair pulled back with a rubber band at the nape of his neck. His skin was beautiful, silky and russet-colored; his eyes were dark, set deep above the high planes of his cheekbones. He still had just a hint of childish roundness left around his chin. Altogether, a very pretty face. However, my positive opinion of his looks was damaged by the first words out of his mouth. \"You're Isabella Swan, aren't you?\" It was like the first day of school all over again. \"Bella,\" I sighed. \"I'm Jacob Black.\" He held his hand out in a friendly gesture. \"You bought my dad's truck.\" \"Oh,\" I said, relieved, shaking his sleek hand. \"You're Billy's son. I probably should remember you.\" \"No, I'm the youngest of the family \u2014 you would remember my older sisters.\" \"Rachel and Rebecca,\" I suddenly recalled. Charlie and Billy had thrown us together a lot during my visits, to keep us busy while they fished. We were all too shy to make much progress as friends. Of course, I'd kicked up enough tantrums to end the fishing trips by the time I was eleven. \"Are they here?\" I examined the girls at the ocean's edge, wondering if I would recognize them now. \"No.\" Jacob shook his head. \"Rachel got a scholarship to Washington State, and Rebecca married a Samoan surfer \u2014 she lives in Hawaii now.\" \"Married. Wow.\" I was stunned. The twins were only a little over a year older than I was. \"So how do you like the truck?\" he asked. \"I love it. It runs great.\" \"Yeah, but it's really slow,\" he laughed. \"I was so relived when Charlie bought it. My dad wouldn't let me work on building another car when we had a perfectly good vehicle right there.\" \"It's not that slow,\" I objected. \"Have you tried to go over sixty?\" \"No,\" I admitted. \"Good. Don't.\" He grinned. I couldn't help grinning back. \"It does great in a collision,\" I offered in my truck's defense. \"I don't think a tank could take out that old monster,\" he agreed with another laugh. \"So you build cars?\" I asked, impressed. \"When I have free time, and parts. You wouldn't happen to know where I could get my hands on a master cylinder for a 1986 Volkswagen Rabbit?\" he added jokingly. He had a pleasant, husky voice. \"Sorry,\" I laughed, \"I haven't seen any lately, but I'll keep my eyes open for you.\" As if I knew what that was. He was very easy to talk with. He flashed a brilliant smile, looking at me appreciatively in a way I was learning to recognize. I wasn't the only one who noticed. \"You know Bella, Jacob?\" Lauren asked \u2014 in what I imagined was an insolent tone \u2014 from across the fire. \"We've sort of known each other since I was born,\" he laughed, smiling at me again. \"How nice.\" She didn't sound like she thought it was nice at all, and her pale, fishy eyes narrowed. \"Bella,\" she called again, watching my face carefully, \"I was just saying to Tyler that it was too bad none of the Cullens could come out today. Didn't anyone think to invite them?\" Her expression of concern was unconvincing. \"You mean Dr. Carlisle Cullen's family?\" the tall, older boy asked before I could respond, much to Lauren's irritation. He was really closer to a man than a boy, and his voice was very deep. \"Yes, do you know them?\" she asked condescendingly, turning halfway toward him. \"The Cullens don't come here,\" he said in a tone that closed the subject, ignoring her question. Tyler, trying to win back her attention, asked Lauren's opinion on a CD he held. She was distracted. I stared at the deep-voiced boy, taken aback, but he was looking away toward the dark forest behind us. He'd said that the Cullens didn't come here, but his tone had implied something more \u2014 that they weren't allowed; they were prohibited. His manner left a strange impression on me, and I tried to ignore it without success. Jacob interrupted my meditation. \"So is Forks driving you insane yet?\" \"Oh, I'd say that's an understatement.\" I grimaced. He grinned understandingly. I was still turning over the brief comment on the Cullens, and I had a sudden inspiration. It was a stupid plan, but I didn't have any better ideas. I hoped that young Jacob was as yet inexperienced around girls, so that he wouldn't see through my sure-to-be-pitiful attempts at flirting. \"Do you want to walk down the beach with me?\" I asked, trying to imitate that way Edward had of looking up from underneath his eyelashes. It couldn't have nearly the same effect, I was sure, but Jacob jumped up willingly enough. As we walked north across the multihued stones toward the driftwood seawall, the clouds finally closed ranks across the sky, causing the sea to darken and the temperature to drop. I shoved my hands deep into the pockets of my jacket. \"So you're, what, sixteen?\" I asked, trying not to look like an idiot as I fluttered my eyelids the way I'd seen girls do on TV. \"I just turned fifteen,\" he confessed, flattered. \"Really?\" My face was full of false surprise. \"I would have thought you were older.\" \"I'm tall for my age,\" he explained. \"Do you come up to Forks much?\" I asked archly, as if I was hoping for a yes. I sounded idiotic to myself. I was afraid he would turn on me with disgust and accuse me of my fraud, but he still seemed flattered. \"Not too much,\" he admitted with a frown. \"But when I get my car finished I can go up as much as I want \u2014 after I get my license,\" he amended.  \"Who was that other boy Lauren was talking to? He seemed a little old to be hanging out with us.\" I purposefully lumped myself in with the youngsters, trying to make it clear that I preferred Jacob. \"That's Sam \u2014 he's nineteen,\" he informed me. \"What was that he was saying about the doctor's family?\" I asked innocently. \"The Cullens? Oh, they're not supposed to come onto the reservation.\" He looked away, out toward James Island, as he confirmed what I'd thought I'd heard in Sam's voice. \"Why not?\" He glanced back at me, biting his lip. \"Oops. I'm not supposed to say anything about that.\" \"Oh, I won't tell anyone, I'm just curious.\" I tried to make my smile alluring, wondering if I was laying it on too thick. He smiled back, though, looking allured. Then he lifted one eyebrow and his voice was even huskier than before. \"Do you like scary stories?\" he asked ominously. \"I love them,\" I enthused, making an effort to smolder at him. Jacob strolled to a nearby driftwood tree that had its roots sticking out like the attenuated legs of a huge, pale spider. He perched lightly on one of the twisted roots while I sat beneath him on the body of the tree. He stared down at the rocks, a smile hovering around the edges of his broad lips. I could see he was going to try to make this good. I focused on keeping the vital interest I felt out of my eyes.  \"Do you know any of our old stories, about where we came from \u2014 the Quileutes, I mean?\" he began. \"Not really,\" I admitted. \"Well, there are lots of legends, some of them claiming to date back to the Flood \u2014 supposedly, the ancient Quileutes tied their canoes to the tops of the tallest trees on the mountain to survive like Noah and the ark.\" He smiled, to show me how little stock he put in the histories. \"Another legend claims that we descended from wolves \u2014 and that the wolves are our brothers still. It's against tribal law to kill them.  \"Then there are the stories about the cold ones.\" His voice dropped a little lower. \"The cold ones?\" I asked, not faking my intrigue now. \"Yes. There are stories of the cold ones as old as the wolf legends, and some much more recent. According to legend, my own great-grandfather knew some of them. He was the one who made the treaty that kept them off our land.\" He rolled his eyes. \"Your great-grandfather?\" I encouraged. \"He was a tribal elder, like my father. You see, the cold ones are the natural enemies of the wolf\u2014well, not the wolf, really, but the wolves that turn into men, like our ancestors. You would call them werewolves.\" \"Werewolves have enemies?\" \"Only one.\" I stared at him earnestly, hoping to disguise my impatience as admiration. \"So you see,\" Jacob continued, \"the cold ones are traditionally our enemies. But this pack that came to our territory during my great-grandfather's time was different. They didn't hunt the way others of their kind did \u2014 they weren't supposed to be dangerous to the tribe. So my great-grandfather made a truce with them. If they would promise to stay off our lands, we wouldn't expose them to the pale-faces.\" He winked at me. \"If they weren't dangerous, then why\u2026 ?\" I tried to understand, struggling not to let him see how seriously I was considering his ghost story. \"There's always a risk for humans to be around the cold ones, even if they're civilized like this clan was. You never know when they might get too hungry to resist.\" He deliberately worked a thick edge of menace into his tone. \"What do you mean, 'civilized'?\" \"They claimed that they didn't hunt humans. They supposedly were somehow able to prey on animals instead.\" I tried to keep my voice casual. \"So how does it fit in with the Cullens? Are they like the cold ones your greatgrandfather met?\" \"No.\" He paused dramatically. \"They are the same ones.\" He must have thought the expression on my face was fear inspired by his story. He smiled, pleased, and continued. \"There are more of them now, a new female and a new male, but the rest are the same. In my great-grandfather's time they already knew of the leader, Carlisle. He'd been here and gone before your people had even arrived.\" He was fighting a smile. \"And what are they?\" I finally asked. \"What are the cold ones?\" He smiled darkly. \"Blood drinkers,\" he replied in a chilling voice. \"Your people call them vampires.\" I stared out at the rough surf after he answered, not sure what my face was exposing. \"You have goose bumps,\" he laughed delightedly. \"You're a good storyteller,\" I complimented him, still staring into the waves. \"Pretty crazy stuff, though, isn't it? No wonder my dad doesn't want us to talk about it to anyone.\" I couldn't control my expression enough to look at him yet. \"Don't worry, I won't give you away.\" \"I guess I just violated the treaty,\" he laughed. \"I'll take it to the grave,\" I promised, and then I shivered. \"Seriously, though, don't say anything to Charlie. He was pretty mad at my dad when he heard that some of us weren't going to the hospital since Dr. Cullen started working there.\" \"I won't, of course not.\" \"So do you think we're a bunch of superstitious natives or what?\" he asked in a playful tone, but with a hint of worry. I still hadn't looked away from the ocean. I turned and smiled at him as normally as I could.  \"No. I think you're very good at telling scary stories, though. I still have goose bumps, see?\" I held up my arm. \"Cool.\" He smiled. And then the sound of the beach rocks clattering against each other warned us that someone was approaching. Our heads snapped up at the same time to see Mike and Jessica about fifty yards away, walking toward us.  \"There you are, Bella,\" Mike called in relief, waving his arm over his head. \"Is that your boyfriend?\" Jacob asked, alerted by the jealous edge in Mike's voice. I was surprised it was so obvious. \"No, definitely not,\" I whispered. I was tremendously grateful to Jacob, and eager to make him as happy as possible. I winked at him, carefully turning away from Mike to do so. He smiled, elated by my inept flirting. \"So when I get my license\u2026\" he began. \"You should come see me in Forks. We could hang out sometime.\" I felt guilty as I said this, knowing that I'd used him. But I really did like Jacob. He was someone I could easily be friends with. Mike had reached us now, with Jessica still a few paces back. I could see his eyes appraising Jacob, and looking satisfied at his obvious youth. \"Where have you been?\" he asked, though the answer was right in front of him. \"Jacob was just telling me some local stories,\" I volunteered. \"It was really interesting.\" I smiled at Jacob warmly, and he grinned back. \"Well,\" Mike paused, carefully reassessing the situation as he watched our camaraderie. \"We're packing up \u2014 it looks like it's going to rain soon.\" We all looked up at the glowering sky. It certainly did look like rain. \"Okay.\" I jumped up. \"I'm coming.\" \"It was nice to see you again,\" Jacob said, and I could tell he was taunting Mike just a bit. \"It really was. Next time Charlie comes down to see Billy, I'll come, too,\" I promised. His grin stretched across his face. \"That would be cool.\" \"And thanks,\" I added earnestly. I pulled up my hood as we tramped across the rocks toward the parking lot. A few drops were beginning to fall, making black spots on the stones where they landed. When we got to the Suburban the others were already loading everything back in. I crawled into the backseat by Angela and Tyler, announcing that I'd already had my turn in the shotgun position. Angela just stared out the window at the escalating storm, and Lauren twisted around in the middle seat to occupy Tyler's attention, so I could simply lay my head back on the seat and close my eyes and try very hard not to think.",
