            "en": "When a pet dies    For most kids, pets are more than just animals their families own \u2014 they're members of the family and the best of friends. Unfortunately, the joy of owning a pet goes hand-in-hand with the heartbreak of losing one, whether because of old age, illness, or an accident. And that can be very difficult. After all, family pets often are the first to greet kids in the morning and after school. Your pet may be the one your child looks to for comfort and companionship when ill or feeling unpopular or upset. While it's impossible to shelter kids from the loss of a pet, you can help them cope with it. And because a pet's death might be their first time losing a loved one, the grieving process can help kids learn how to cope with other losses throughout life. \n \n\n   \nSharing the News and the Grief\n\n One of the most difficult parts about losing a pet may be breaking the bad news to kids. Try to do so one-on-one in a place where they feel safe and comfortable and not easily distracted. As you would with any tough issue, try to gauge how much information kids need to hear based on their age, maturity level, and life experience. If your pet is very old or has a lingering illness, consider talking to kids before the death occurs. If you have to euthanize your pet, you may want to explain that:  the veterinarians have done everything that they can\n\n your pet would never get better\n\n this is the kindest way to take the pet's pain away\n\n the pet will die peacefully, without feeling hurt or scared\n\n  Again, a child's age, maturity level, and questions will help determine whether to offer a clear and simple explanation for what's going to happen. If so, it's OK to use words like \"death\" and \"dying\" or to say something like \"The veterinarian will give our pet a shot that first puts it to sleep and then stops the heart from beating.\" Many kids want a chance to say goodbye beforehand, and some may be old enough or emotionally mature enough to be there to comfort the pet during the process. If you do have to euthanize your pet, be careful about saying the animal went \"to sleep\" or \"got put to sleep.\" Young kids tend to interpret events literally, so this can conjure up scary misconceptions about sleep or surgery and anesthesia. If the pet's death is more sudden, calmly explain what has happened. Be brief, and let your child's questions guide how much information you provide. \n \n\n   \nSticking to the Truth\n\n Avoid trying to gloss over the event with a lie. Telling a child that \"Buster ran away\" or \"Max went on a trip\" is not a good idea. It probably won't alleviate the sadness about losing the pet, and if the truth does come out, your child will probably be angry that you lied. If asked what happens to the pet after it dies, draw on your own understanding of death, including, if relevant, the viewpoint of your faith. And since none of us knows fully, an honest \"I don't know\" certainly can be an appropriate answer \u2014 it's OK to tell kids that death is a mystery. \n \n\n \nHelping Your Child Cope\n\n Like anyone dealing with a loss, kids usually feel a variety of emotions besides sadness after the death of a pet. They might experience loneliness, anger if the pet was euthanized, frustration that the pet couldn't get better, or guilt about times that they were mean to or didn't care for the pet as promised. Help kids understand that it's natural to feel all of those emotions, that it's OK to not want to talk about them at first, and that you're there when they are ready to talk. Don't feel compelled to hide your own sadness about losing a pet. Showing how you feel and talking about it openly sets an example for kids. You show that it's OK to feel sad when you lose a loved one, to talk about your feelings, and to cry when you feel sad. And it's comforting to kids to know that they're not alone in feeling sad. Share stories about the pets you had \u2014 and lost \u2014 when you were young and how difficult it was to say goodbye. \nMoving On\n\n After the shock of the news has faded, it's important to help your child heal and move on. It can help kids to find special ways to remember a pet. You might have a ceremony to bury your pet or just share memories of fun times you had together. Write a prayer together or offer thoughts on what the pet meant to each family member. Share stories of your pet's funny moments or escapades. Offer lots of loving hugs. You could do a project, too, like making a <em>scrapbook</em>. Keep in mind that grieving over the loss of a pet, particularly for a child, is similar to grieving over a person. For kids, losing a pet who offered love and companionship can be much more difficult than losing a distant relative. You might have to explain that to friends, family members, or others who don't own pets or don't understand that. Perhaps most important, talk about your pet, often and with love. Let your child know that while the pain will eventually go away, the happy memories of the pet will always remain. When the time is right, you might consider adopting a new pet \u2014 not as a replacement, but as a way to welcome another animal friend into your family.

            "en": "3          3. THE END I FELT ABSOLUTELY HIDEOUS IN THE MORNING. I HADN'T slept well; my arm burned and my head ached. It didn't help my outlook that Edward's face was smooth and remote as he kissed my forehead quickly and ducked out my window. I was afraid of the time I'd spent unconscious, afraid that he might have been thinking about right and wrong again while he watched me sleep. The anxiety seemed to ratchet up the intensity of the pounding in my head. Edward was waiting for me at school, as usual, but his face was still wrong. There was something buried in his eyes that I couldn't be sure of\u2014and it scared me. I didn't want to bring up last night, but I wasn't sure if avoiding the subject would be worse. He opened my door for me. \"How do you feel?\u00a0 \" \"Perfect,\" I lied, cringing as the sound of the slamming door echoed in my head. We walked in silence, he shortening his stride to match mine. There were so many questions I wanted to ask, but most of those questions would have to wait, because they were for Alice: How was Jasper this morning?\u00a0 \u00a0What had they said when I was gone?\u00a0 \u00a0What had Rosalie said?\u00a0 \u00a0And most importantly, what could she see happening now in her strange, imperfect visions of the future?\u00a0 \u00a0Could she guess what Edward was thinking, why he was so gloomy?\u00a0 \u00a0Was there a foundation for the tenuous, instinctive fears that I couldn't seem to shake?\u00a0  The morning passed slowly. I was impatient to see Alice, though I wouldn't be able to really talk to her with Edward there. Edward remained aloof. Occasionally he would ask about my arm, and I would lie. Alice usually beat us to lunch; she didn't have to keep pace with a sloth like me. But she wasn't at the table, waiting with a tray of food she wouldn't eat. Edward didn't say anything about her absence. I wondered to myself if her class was running late\u2014until I saw Conner and Ben, who were in her fourth hour French class. \"Where's Alice?\u00a0 \" I asked Edward anxiously. He looked at the granola bar he was slowly pulverizing between his fingertips while he answered. \"She's with Jasper.\" \"Is he okay?\u00a0 \" \"He's gone away for a while.\" \"What?\u00a0 \u00a0Where?\u00a0 \" Edward shrugged. \"Nowhere in particular.\" \"And Alice, too,\" I said with quiet desperation. Of course, if Jasper needed her, she would go.  \"Yes. She'll be gone for a while. She was trying to convince him to go to Denali.\" Denali was where the one other band of unique vampires\u2014good ones like the Cullens\u2014lived. Tanya and her family. I'd heard of them now and again. Edward had run to them last winter when my arrival had made Forks difficult for him. Laurent, the most civilized member of James's little coven, had gone there rather than siding with James against the Cullens. It made sense for Alice to encourage Jasper to go there. I swallowed, trying to dislodge the sudden lump in my throat. The guilt made my head bow and my shoulders slump. I'd run them out of their home, just like Rosalie and Emmett. I was a plague. \"Is your arm bothering you?\u00a0 \" he asked solicitously. \"Who cares about my stupid arm?\u00a0 \" I muttered in disgust. He didn't answer, and I put my head down on the table. By the end of the day, the silence was becoming ridiculous. I didn't want to be the one to break it, but apparently that was my only choice if I ever wanted him to talk to me again. \"You'll come over later tonight?\u00a0 \" I asked as he walked me\u2014silently\u2014to my truck. He always came over. \"Later?\u00a0 \" It pleased me that he seemed surprised. \"I have to work. I had to trade with Mrs. Newton to get yesterday off.\" \"Oh,\" he murmured. \"So you'll come over when I'm home, though, right?\u00a0 \" I hated that I felt suddenly unsure about this. \"If you want me to.\" \"I always want you,\" I reminded him, with perhaps a little more intensity than the conversation required. I expected he would laugh, or smile, or react somehow to my words. \"All right, then,\" he said indifferently. He kissed my forehead again before he shut the door on me. Then he turned his back and loped gracefully toward his car. I was able to drive out of the parking lot before the panic really hit, but I was hyperventilating by the time I got to Newton's. He just needed time, I told myself. He would get over this. Maybe he was sad because his family was disappearing. But Alice and Jasper would come back soon, and Rosalie and Emmett, too. If it would help, I would stay away from the big white house on the river\u2014I'd never set foot there again. That didn't matter. I'd still see Alice at school. She would have to come back for school, right?\u00a0 \u00a0And she was at my place all the time anyway. She wouldn't want to hurt Charlie's feelings by staying away. No doubt I would also run into Carlisle with regularity\u2014in the emergency room. After all, what had happened last night was nothing. Nothing had happened. So I fell down\u2014that was the story of my life. Compared to last spring, it seemed especially unimportant. James had left me broken and nearly dead from loss of blood\u2014and yet Edward had handled the interminable weeks in the hospital much better than this. Was it because, this time, it wasn't an enemy he'd had to protect me from?\u00a0  Because it was his brother?\u00a0  Maybe it would be better if he took me away, rather than his family being scattered. I grew slightly less depressed as I considered all the uninterrupted alone time. If he could just last through the school year, Charlie wouldn't be able to object. We could go away to college, or pretend that's what we were doing, like Rosalie and Emmett this year. Surely Edward could wait a year. What was a year to an immortal?\u00a0 \u00a0It didn't even seem like that much to me. I was able to talk myself into enough composure to handle getting out of the truck and walking to the store. Mike Newton had beaten me here today, and he smiled and waved when I came in. I grabbed my vest, nodding vaguely in his direction. I was still imagining pleasant scenarios that consisted of me running away with Edward to various exotic locales. Mike interrupted my fantasy. \"How was your birthday?\u00a0 \" \"Ugh,\" I mumbled. \"I'm glad it's over.\" Mike looked at me from the corners of his eyes like I was crazy. Work dragged. I wanted to see Edward again, praying that he would be past the worst of this, whatever it was exactly, by the time I saw him again. It's nothing, I told myself over and over again. Everything will go back to normal. The relief I felt when I turned onto my street and saw Edward's silver car parked in front of my house was an overwhelming, heady thing. And it bothered me deeply that it should be that way. I hurried through the front door, calling out before I was completely inside. \"Dad?\u00a0 \u00a0Edward?\u00a0 \" As I spoke, I could hear the distinctive theme music from ESPN's Sports Center coming from the living room. \"In here,\" Charlie called. I hung my raincoat on its peg and hurried around the corner. Edward was in the armchair, my father on the sofa. Both had their eyes trained on the TV. The focus was normal for my father. Not so much for Edward. \"Hi,\" I said weakly. \"Hey, Bella,\" my father answered, eyes never moving. \"We just had cold pizza. I think it's still on the table.\" \"Okay.\" I waited in the doorway. Finally, Edward looked over at me with a polite smile. \"I'll be right behind you,\" he promised. His eyes strayed back to the TV. I stared for another minute, shocked. Neither one seemed to notice. I could feel something, panic maybe, building up in my chest. I escaped to the kitchen. The pizza held no interest for me. I sat in my chair, pulled my knees up, and wrapped my arms around them. Something was very wrong, maybe more wrong than I'd realized. The sounds of male bonding and banter continued from the TV set. I tried to get control of myself, to reason with myself. What's the worst that can happen?\u00a0 \u00a0I flinched. That was definitely the wrong question to ask. I was having a hard time breathing right. Okay, I thought again, what's the worst I can live through?\u00a0 \u00a0I didn't like that question so much, either. But I thought through the possibilities I'd considered today. Staying away from Edward's family. Of course, he wouldn't expect Alice to be part of that. But if Jasper was off limits, that would lessen the time I could have with her. I nodded to myself\u2014I could live with that. Or going away. Maybe he wouldn't want to wait till the end of the school year, maybe it would have to be now. In front of me, on the table, my presents from Charlie and Renee were where I had left them, the camera I hadn't had the chance to use at the Cullens' sitting beside the album. I touched the pretty cover of the <em>scrapbook</em> my mother had given me, and sighed, thinking of Renee. Somehow, living without her for as long as I had did not make the idea of a more permanent separation easier. And Charlie would be left all alone here, abandoned. They would both be so hurt\u2026 But we'd come back, right?\u00a0 \u00a0We'd visit, of course, wouldn't we?\u00a0  I couldn't be certain about the answer to that. I leaned my cheek against my knee, staring at the physical tokens of my parents' love. I'd known this path I'd chosen was going to be hard. And, after all, I was thinking about the worst-case scenario\u2014the very worst I could live through. I touched the <em>scrapbook</em> again, flipping the front cover over. Little metal corners were already in place to hold the first picture. It wasn't a half-bad idea, to make some record of my life here. I felt a strange urge to get started. Maybe I didn't have that long left in Forks. I toyed with the wrist strap on the camera, wondering about the first picture on the roll. Could it possibly turn out anything close to the original?\u00a0 \u00a0I doubted it. But he didn't seem worried that it would be blank. I chuckled to myself, thinking of his carefree laughter last night. The chuckle died away. So much had changed, and so abruptly. It made me feel a little bit dizzy, like I was standing on an edge, a precipice somewhere much too high. I didn't want to think about that anymore. I grabbed the camera and headed up the stairs. My room hadn't really changed all that much in the seventeen years since my mother had been here. The walls were still light blue, the same yellowed lace curtains hung in front of the window. There was a bed, rather than a crib, but she would recognize the quilt draped untidily over the top\u2014it had been a gift from Gran. Regardless, I snapped a picture of my room. There wasn't much else I could do tonight\u2014it was too dark outside\u2014and the feeling was growing stronger, it was almost a\u00a0 compulsion now. I would record everything about Forks before I had to leave it. Change was coming. I could feel it. It wasn't a pleasant prospect, not when life was perfect the way it was. I took my time coming back down the stairs, camera in hand, trying to ignore the butterflies in my stomach as I thought of the strange distance I didn't want to see in Edward's eyes. He would get over this. Probably he was worried that I would be upset when he asked me to leave. I would let him work through it without meddling. And I would be prepared when he asked. I had the camera ready as I leaned around the corner, being sneaky. I was sure there was no chance that I had caught Edward by surprise, but he didn't look up. I felt a brief shiver as something icy twisted in my stomach; I ignored that and took the picture. They both looked at me then. Charlie frowned. Edward's face was empty, expressionless. \"What are you doing, Bella?\u00a0 \" Charlie complained. \"Oh, come on.\" I pretended to smile as I went to sit on the floor in front of the sofa where Charlie lounged. \"You know Mom will be calling soon to ask if I'm using my presents. I have to get to work before she can get her feelings hurt.\" \"Why are you taking pictures of me, though?\u00a0 \" he grumbled. \"Because you're so handsome,\" I replied, keeping it light. \"And because, since you\u00a0 bought the camera, you're obligated to be one of my subjects.\" He mumbled something unintelligible. \"Hey, Edward,\" I said with admirable indifference. \"Take one of me and my dad together.\"  I threw the camera toward him, carefully avoiding his eyes, and knelt beside the arm of the sofa where Charlie's face was. Charlie sighed. \"You need to smile, Bella,\" Edward murmured. I did my best, and the camera flashed. \"Let me take one of you kids,\" Charlie suggested. I knew he was just trying to shift the camera's focus from himself. Edward stood and lightly tossed him the camera. I went to stand beside Edward, and the arrangement felt formal and strange to me. He put one hand lightly on my shoulder, and I wrapped my arm more securely around his waist. I wanted to look at his face, but I was afraid to. \"Smile, Bella,\" Charlie reminded me again. I took a deep breath and smiled. The flash blinded me. \"Enough pictures for tonight,\" Charlie said then, shoving the camera into a crevice of the sofa cushions and rolling over it. \"You don't have to use the whole roll now.\" Edward dropped his hand from my shoulder and twisted casually out of my arm. He sat back down in the armchair. I hesitated, and then went to sit against the sofa again. I was suddenly so frightened that my hands were shaking. I pressed them into my stomach to hide them, put my chin on my knees and stared at the TV screen in front of me, seeing nothing. When the show ended, I hadn't moved an inch. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Edward stand. \"I'd better get home,\" he said. Charlie didn't look up from the commercial. \"See ya.\" I got awkwardly to my feet\u2014I was stiff from sitting so still\u2014and followed Edward out the front door. He went straight to his car. \"Will you stay?\u00a0 \" I asked, no hope in my voice. I expected his answer, so it didn't hurt as much. \"Not tonight.\" I didn't ask for a reason. He got in his car and drove away while I stood there, unmoving. I barely noticed that it was raining. I waited, without knowing what I waited for, until the door opened behind me. \"Bella, what are you doing?\u00a0 \" Charlie asked, surprised to see me standing there alone and dripping. \"Nothing.\" I turned and trudged back to the house. It was a long night, with little in the way of rest. I got up as soon as there was a faint light outside my window. I dressed for school mechanically, waiting for the clouds to brighten. When I had eaten a bowl of cereal, I decided that it was light enough for pictures. I took one of my truck, and then the front of the house. I turned and snapped a few of the forest by Charlie's house. Funny how it didn't seem sinister like it used to. I realized I would miss this\u2014the green, the timelessness, the mystery of the woods. All of it. I put the camera in my school bag before I left. I tried to concentrate on my new project rather than the fact that Edward apparently hadn't gotten over things during the night. Along with the fear, I was beginning to feel impatience. How long could this last?\u00a0  It lasted through the morning. He walked silently beside me, never seeming to actually look at me. I tried to concentrate on my classes, but not even English could hold my attention. Mr. Berty had to repeat his question about Lady Capulet twice before I realized he was talking to me. Edward whispered the correct answer under his breath and then went back to ignoring me. At lunch, the silence continued. I felt like I was going to start screaming at any moment, so, to distract myself, I leaned across the table's invisible line and spoke to Jessica. \"Hey, Jess?\u00a0 \" \"What's up, Bella?\u00a0 \" \"Could you do me a favor?\u00a0 \" I asked, reaching into my bag. \"My mom wants me to get some pictures of my friends for a <em>scrapbook</em>. So, take some pictures of everybody, okay?\u00a0 \" I handed her the camera. \"Sure,\" she said, grinning, and turned to snap a candid shot of Mike with his mouth full. A predictable picture war ensued. I watched them hand the camera around the table, giggling and flirting and complaining about being on film. It seemed strangely childish. Maybe I just wasn't in the mood for normal human behavior today. \"Uh-oh,\" Jessica said apologetically as she returned the camera. \"I think we used all your film.\" \"That's okay. I think I already got pictures of everything else I needed.\" After school, Edward walked me back to the parking lot in silence. I had to work again, and for once, I was glad. Time with me obviously wasn't helping things. Maybe time alone would be better. I dropped my film off at the Thriftway on my way to Newton's, and then picked up the developed pictures after work. At home, I said a brief hi to Charlie, grabbed a granola bar from the kitchen, and hurried up to my room with the envelope of photographs tucked under my arm. I sat in the middle of my bed and opened the envelope with wary curiosity. Ridiculously, I still half expected the first print to be a blank. When I pulled it out, I gasped aloud. Edward looked just as beautiful as he did in real life, staring at me out of the picture with the warm eyes I'd missed for the past few days. It was almost uncanny that anyone could look so\u2026 so\u2026 beyond description. No thousand words could equal this picture. I flipped through the rest of the stack quickly once, and then laid three of them out on the bed side by side. The first was the picture of Edward in the kitchen, his warm eyes touched with tolerant amusement. The second was Edward and Charlie, watching ESPN. The difference in Edward's expression was severe. His eyes were careful here, reserved. Still breathtakingly beautiful, but his face was colder, more like a sculpture, less alive. The last was the picture of Edward and me standing awkwardly side by side. Edward's face was the same as the last, cold and statue-like. But that wasn't the most troubling part of this photograph. The contrast between the two of us was painful. He looked like a god. I looked very average, even for a human, almost shamefully plain. I flipped the picture over with a feeling of disgust. Instead of doing my homework, I stayed up to put my pictures into the album. With a ballpoint pen I scrawled captions under all the pictures, the names and the dates. I got to the picture of Edward and me, and, without looking at it too long, I folded it in half and stuck it under the metal tab, Edward-side up. When I was done, I stuffed the second set of prints in a fresh envelope and penned a long thank-you letter to Renee. Edward still hadn't come over. I didn't want to admit that he was the reason I'd stayed up so late, but of course he was. I tried to remember the last time he'd stayed away like this, without an excuse, a phone call\u2026 He never had. Again, I didn't sleep well. School followed the silent, frustrating, terrifying pattern of the last two days. I felt relief when I saw Edward waiting for me in the parking lot, but it faded quickly. He was no different, unless maybe more remote. It was hard to even remember the reason for all this mess. My birthday already felt like the distant past. If only Alice would come back. Soon. Before this got any more out of hand.  But I couldn't count on that. I decided that, if I couldn't talk to him today, really talk, then I was going to see Carlisle tomorrow. I had to do something. After school, Edward and I were going to talk it out, I promised myself. I wasn't accepting any excuses. He walked me to my truck, and I steeled myself to make my demands. \"Do you mind if I come over today?\u00a0 \" he asked before we got to the truck, beating me to the punch. \"Of course not.\" \"Now?\u00a0 \" he asked again, opening my door for me. \"Sure,\" I kept my voice even, though I didn't like the urgency in his tone. \"I was just going to drop a letter for Renee in the mailbox on the way. I'll meet you there.\" He looked at the fat envelope on the passenger seat. Suddenly, he reached over me and snagged it. \"I'll do it,\" he said quietly. \"And I'll still beat you there.\" He smiled my favorite crooked smile, but it was wrong. It didn't reach his eyes. \"Okay,\" I agreed, unable to smile back. He shut the door, and headed toward his car. He did beat me home. He was parked in Charlie's spot when I pulled up in front of the house. That was a bad sign. He didn't plan to stay, then. I shook my head and took a deep breath, trying to locate some courage. He got out of his car when I stepped out of the truck, and came to meet me. He reached to take my book bag from me. That was normal. But he shoved it back onto the seat. That was not normal. \"Come for a walk with me,\" he suggested in an unemotional voice, taking my hand. I didn't answer. I couldn't think of a way to protest, but I instantly knew that I wanted to. I didn't like this. This is bad, this is very bad, the voice in my head repeated again and again. But he didn't wait for an answer. He pulled me along toward the east side of the yard, where the forest encroached. I followed unwillingly, trying to think through the panic. It was what I wanted, I reminded myself. The chance to talk it all through. So why was the panic choking me?\u00a0  We'd gone only a few steps into the trees when he stopped. We were barely on the trail\u2014I could still see the house. Some walk. Edward leaned against a tree and stared at me, his expression unreadable. \"Okay, let's talk,\" I said. It sounded braver than it felt. He took a deep breath. \"Bella, we're leaving.\" I took a deep breath, too. This was an acceptable option. I thought I was prepared. But I still had to ask. \"Why now?\u00a0 \u00a0Another year\u2014\" \"Bella, it's time. How much longer could we stay in Forks, after all?\u00a0 \u00a0Carlisle can barely pass for thirty, and he's claiming thirty-three now. We'd have to start over soon regardless.\" His answer confused me. I thought the point of leaving was to let his family live in peace. Why did we have to leave if they were going?\u00a0 \u00a0I stared at him, trying to understand what he meant. He stared back coldly. With a roll of nausea, I realized I'd misunderstood. \"When you say we\u2014,\" I whispered. \"I mean my family and myself.\" Each word separate and distinct. I shook my head back and forth mechanically, trying to clear it. He waited without any sign of impatience. It took a few minutes before I could speak. \"Okay,\" I said. \"I'll come with you.\" \"You can't, Bella. Where we're going\u2026 It's not the right place for you.\" \"Where you are is the right place for me.\" \"I'm no good for you, Bella.\" \"Don't be ridiculous.\" I wanted to sound angry, but it just sounded like I was begging. \"You're the very best part of my life.\" \"My world is not for you,\" he said grimly. \"What happened with Jasper\u2014that was nothing, Edward! Nothing!\" \"You're right,\" he agreed. \"It was exactly what was to be expected.\" \"You promised! In Phoenix, you promised that you would stay\u2014\" \"As long as that was best for you,\" he interrupted to correct me. \"No! This is about my soul, isn't it?\u00a0 \" I shouted, furious, the words exploding out of me\u2014somehow it still sounded like a plea. \"Carlisle told me about that, and I don't care,\u00a0 Edward. I don't care! You can have my soul. I don't want it without you\u2014it's yours already!\" He took a deep breath and stared, unseeingly, at the ground for a long moment. His mouth twisted the tiniest bit. When he finally looked up, his eyes were different, harder\u2014like the liquid gold had frozen solid. \"Bella, I don't want you to come with me.\" He spoke the words slowly and precisely, his cold eyes on my face, watching as I absorbed what he was really saying. There was a pause as I repeated the words in my head a few times, sifting through them for their real intent. \"You\u2026 don't\u2026 want me?\u00a0 \" I tried out the words, confused by the way they sounded, placed in that order. \"No.\" I stared, uncomprehending, into his eyes. He stared back without apology. His eyes were like topaz\u2014hard and clear and very deep. I felt like I could see into them for miles and miles, yet nowhere in their bottomless depths could I see a contradiction to the word he'd spoken. \"Well, that changes things.\" I was surprised by how calm and reasonable my voice sounded. It must be because I was so numb. I couldn't realize what he was telling me. It still didn't make any sense. He looked away into the trees as he spoke again. \"Of course, I'll always love you\u2026 in a way. But what happened the other night made me realize that it's time for a change. Because I'm\u2026 tired of pretending to be something I'm not, Bella. I am not human.\" He looked back, and the icy planes of his perfect face were not human. \"I've let this go on much too long, and I'm sorry for that.\" \"Don't.\" My voice was just a whisper now; awareness was beginning to seep through me, trickling like acid through my veins. \"Don't do this.\" He just stared at me, and I could see from his eyes that my words were far too late. He already had.  \"You're not good for me, Bella.\" He turned his earlier words around, and so I had no argument. How well I knew that I wasn't good enough for him. I opened my mouth to say something, and then closed it again. He waited patiently, his face wiped clean of all emotion. I tried again. \"If\u2026 that's what you want.\" He nodded once. My whole body went numb. I couldn't feel anything below the neck. \"I would like to ask one favor, though, if that's not too much,\" he said. I wonder what he saw on my face, because something flickered across his own face in response. But, before I could identify it, he'd composed his features into the same serene mask. \"Anything,\" I vowed, my voice faintly stronger. As I watched, his frozen eyes melted. The gold became liquid again, molten, burning down into mine with an intensity that was overwhelming. \"Don't do anything reckless or stupid,\" he ordered, no longer detached. \"Do you understand what I'm saying?\u00a0 \" I nodded helplessly. His eyes cooled, the distance returned. \"I'm thinking of Charlie, of course. He needs you. Take care of yourself\u2014for him.\" I nodded again. \"I will,\" I whispered. He seemed to relax just a little. \"And I'll make you a promise in return,\" he said. \"I promise that this will be the last time you'll see me. I won't come back. I won't put you through anything like this again. You can go on with your life without any more interference from me. It will be as if I'd never existed.\" My knees must have started to shake, because the trees were suddenly wobbling. I could hear the blood pounding faster than normal behind my ears. His voice sounded farther away. He smiled gently. \"Don't worry. You're human\u2014your memory is no more than a sieve. Time heals all wounds for your kind.\" \"And your memories?\u00a0 \" I asked. It sounded like there was something stuck in my throat, like I was choking. \"Well\"\u2014he hesitated for a short second\u2014\"I won't forget. But my kind\u2026 we're very easily distracted.\" He smiled; the smile was tranquil and it did not touch his eyes. He took a step away from me. \"That's everything, I suppose. We won't bother you again.\" The plural caught my attention. That surprised me; I would have thought I was beyond noticing anything. \"Alice isn't coming back,\" I realized. I don't know how he heard me\u2014the words made no sound\u2014but he seemed to understand. He shook his head slowly, always watching my face. \"No. They're all gone. I stayed behind to tell you goodbye.\" \"Alice is gone?\u00a0 \" My voice was blank with disbelief. \"She wanted to say goodbye, but I convinced her that a clean break would be better for you.\" I was dizzy; it was hard to concentrate. His words swirled around in my head, and I heard the doctor at the hospital in Phoenix, last spring, as he showed me the X-rays. You can see it's a clean break, his finger traced along the picture of my severed bone. That's good. It will heal more easily, more quickly. I tried to breathe normally. I needed to concentrate, to find a way out of this nightmare. \"Goodbye, Bella,\" he said in the same quiet, peaceful voice. \"Wait!\" I choked out the word, reaching for him, willing my deadened legs to carry me forward. I thought he was reaching for me, too. But his cold hands locked around my wrists and pinned them to my sides. He leaned down, and pressed his lips very lightly to my forehead for the briefest instant. My eyes closed. \"Take care of yourself,\" he breathed, cool against my skin. There was a light, unnatural breeze. My eyes flashed open. The leaves on a small vine maple shuddered with the gentle wind of his passage. He was gone. With shaky legs, ignoring the fact that my action was useless, I followed him into the forest. The evidence of his path had disappeared instantly. There were no footprints, the leaves were still again, but I walked forward without thinking. I could not do anything else. I had to keep moving. If I stopped looking for him, it was over. Love, life, meaning\u2026 over. I walked and walked. Time made no sense as I pushed slowly through the thick undergrowth. It was hours passing, but also only seconds. Maybe it felt like time had frozen because the forest looked the same no matter how far I went. I started to worry that I was traveling in a circle, a very small circle at that, but I kept going. I stumbled often, and, as it grew darker and darker, I fell often, too. Finally, I tripped over something\u2014it was black now, I had no idea what caught my foot\u2014and I stayed down. I rolled onto my side, so that I could breathe, and curled up on the wet bracken. As I lay there, I had a feeling that more time was passing than I realized. I couldn't remember how long it had been since nightfall. Was it always so dark here at night?\u00a0 \u00a0Surely, as a rule, some little bit of moonlight would filter down through the clouds, through the chinks in the canopy of trees, and find the ground. Not tonight. Tonight the sky was utterly black. Perhaps there was no moon tonight\u2014a lunar eclipse, a new moon. A new moon. I shivered, though I wasn't cold. It was black for a long time before I heard them calling. Someone was shouting my name. It was muted, muffled by the wet growth that surrounded me, but it was definitely my name. I didn't recognize the voice. I thought about answering, but I was dazed, and it took a long time to come to the conclusion that I should answer. By then, the calling had stopped. Sometime later, the rain woke me up. I don't think I'd really fallen asleep; I was just lost in an unthinking stupor, holding with all my strength to the numbness that kept me from realizing what I didn't want to know. The rain bothered me a little. It was cold. I unwrapped my arms from around my legs to cover my face.  It was then that I heard the calling again. It was farther away this time, and sometimes it sounded like several voices were calling at once. I tried to breathe deeply. I remembered that I should answer, but I didn't think they would be able to hear me. Would I be able to shout loud enough?\u00a0  Suddenly, there was another sound, startlingly close. A kind of snuffling, an animal sound. It sounded big. I wondered if I should feel afraid. I didn't\u2014just numb. It didn't matter. The snuffling went away. The rain continued, and I could feel the water pooling up against my cheek. I was trying to gather the strength to turn my head when I saw the light. At first it was just a dim glow reflecting off the bushes in the distance. It grew brighter and brighter, illuminating a large space unlike the focused beam of a flashlight. The light broke through the closest brush, and I could see that it was a propane lantern, but that was all I could see\u2014the brightness blinded me for a moment. \"Bella.\" The voice was deep and unfamiliar, but full of recognition. He wasn't calling my name to search, he was acknowledging that I was found. I stared up\u2014impossibly high it seemed\u2014at the dark face that I could now see above me. I was vaguely aware that the stranger probably only looked so tall because my head was still on the ground. \"Have you been hurt?\u00a0 \" I knew the words meant something, but I could only stare, bewildered. How could the meaning matter at this point?\u00a0  \"Bella, my name is Sam Uley.\" There was nothing familiar about his name. \"Charlie sent me to look for you.\" Charlie?\u00a0 \u00a0That struck a chord, and I tried to pay more attention to what he was saying. Charlie mattered, if nothing else did. The tall man held out a hand. I gazed at it, not sure what I was supposed to do. His black eyes appraised me for a second, and then he shrugged. In a quick and supple notion, he pulled me up from the ground and into his arms. I hung there, limp, as he loped swiftly through the wet forest. Some part of me knew this should upset me\u2014being carried away by a stranger. But there was nothing left in me to upset. It didn't seem like too much time passed before there were lights and the deep babble of many male voices. Sam Uley slowed as he approached the commotion. \"I've got her!\" he called in a booming voice. The babble ceased, and then picked up again with more intensity. A confusing swirl of faces moved over me. Sam's voice was the only one that made sense in the chaos, perhaps because my ear was against his chest. \"No, I don't think she's hurt,\" he told someone. \"She just keeps saying 'He's gone.' \" \u00a0Was I saying that out loud?\u00a0 \u00a0I bit down on my lip. \"Bella, honey, are you all right?\u00a0 \" That was one voice I would know anywhere\u2014even distorted, as it was now, with worry. \"Charlie?\u00a0 \" My voice sounded strange and small. \"I'm right here, baby.\" There was a shifting under me, followed by the leathery smell of my dad's sheriff jacket. Charlie staggered under my weight. \"Maybe I should hold on to her,\" Sam Uley suggested. \"I've got her,\" Charlie said, a little breathless. He walked slowly, struggling. I wished I could tell him to put me down and let me walk, but I couldn't find my voice. There were lights everywhere, held by the crowd walking with him. It felt like a parade. Or a funeral procession. I closed my eyes. \"We're almost home now, honey,\" Charlie mumbled now and then. I opened my eyes again when I heard the door unlock. We were on the porch of our house, and the tall dark man named Sam was holding the door for Charlie, one arm extended toward us, as if he was preparing to catch me when Charlie's arms failed. But Charlie managed to get me through the door and to the couch in the living room. \"Dad, I'm all wet,\" I objected feebly. \"That doesn't matter.\" His voice was gruff. And then he was talking to someone else. \"Blankets are in the cupboard at the top of the stairs.\" \"Bella?\u00a0 \" a new voice asked. I looked at the gray-haired man leaning over me, and recognition came after a few slow seconds. \"Dr. Gerandy?\u00a0 \" I mumbled. \"That's right, dear,\" he said. \"Are you hurt, Bella?\u00a0 \" It took me a minute to think that through. I was confused by the memory of Sam Uley's similar question in the woods. Only Sam had asked something else: Have you been hurt?\u00a0 \u00a0he'd said. The difference seemed significant somehow. Dr. Gerandy was waiting. One grizzled eyebrow rose, and the wrinkles on his forehead deepened.  \"I'm not hurt,\" I lied. The words, were true enough for what he'd asked. His warm hand touched my forehead, and his fingers pressed against the inside of my wrist. I watched his lips as he counted to himself, his eyes on his watch. \"What happened to you?\u00a0 \" he asked casually. I froze under his hand, tasting panic in the back of my throat. \"Did you get lost in the woods?\u00a0 \" he prodded. I was aware of several other people listening. Three tall men with dark faces\u2014from La Push, the Quileute Indian reservation down on the coastline, I guessed\u2014Sam Uley among them, were standing very close together and staring at me. Mr. Newton was there with Mike and Mr. Weber, Angela's father; they all were watching me more surreptitiously than the strangers. Other deep voices rumbled from the kitchen and outside the front door. Half the town must have been looking for me. Charlie was the closest. He leaned in to hear my answer. \"Yes,\" I whispered. \"I got lost.\" The doctor nodded, thoughtful, his fingers probing gently against the glands under my jaw. Charlie's face hardened. \"Do you feel tired?\u00a0 \" Dr. Gerandy asked. I nodded and closed my eyes obediently. \"I don't think there's anything wrong with her,\" I heard the doctor mutter to Charlie after a moment. \"Just exhaustion. Let her sleep it off, and I'll come check on her tomorrow,\" he paused. He must have looked at his watch, because he added, \"Well, later today actually.\" There was a creaking sound as they both pushed off from the couch to get to their feet. \"Is it true?\u00a0 \" Charlie whispered. Their voices were farther away now. I strained to hear. \"Did they leave?\u00a0 \" \"Dr. Cullen asked us not to say anything,\" Dr. Gerandy answered. \"The offer was very sudden; they had to choose immediately. Carlisle didn't want to make a big production out of leaving.\" \"A little warning might have been nice,\" Charlie grumbled. Dr. Gerandy sounded uncomfortable when he replied. \"Yes, well, in this situation, some warning might have been called for.\" I didn't want to listen anymore. I felt around for the edge of the quilt someone had laid on top of me, and pulled it over my ear. I drifted in and out of alertness. I heard Charlie whisper thanks to the volunteers as, one by one, they left. I felt his fingers on my forehead, and then the weight of another blanket. The phone rang a few times, and he hurried to catch it before it could wake me. He muttered reassurances in a low voice to the callers. \"Yeah, we found her. She's okay. She got lost. She's fine now,\" he said again and again. I heard the springs in the armchair groan when he settled himself in for the night. A few minutes later, the phone rang again. Charlie moaned as he struggled to his feet, and then he rushed, stumbling, to the kitchen I pulled my head deeper under the blankets, not wanting to listen to the same conversation again. \"Yeah,\" Charlie said, and yawned. His voice changed, it was much more alert when he spoke again. \"Where?\u00a0 '\" There was a pause. \"You're sure it's outside the reservation?\u00a0 \" Another short pause. \"But what could be burning out there?\u00a0 \" He sounded both worried and mystified. \"Look, I'll call down there and check it out.\" I listened with more interest as he punched in a number. \"Hey, Billy, it's Charlie\u2014sorry I'm calling so early\u2026 no, she's fine. She's sleeping\u2026 Thanks, but that's not why I called. I just got a call from Mrs. Stanley, and she says that from her second-story window she can see fires out on the sea cliffs, but I didn't really\u2026 Oh!\" Suddenly there was an edge in his voice\u2014irritation\u2026 or anger. \"And why are they doing that?\u00a0 \u00a0Uh huh. Really?\u00a0 \" He said it sarcastically. \"Well, don't apologize to me. Yeah, yeah. Just make sure the flames don't spread\u2026 I know, I know, I'm surprised they got them lit at all in this weather.\" Charlie hesitated, and then added grudgingly. \"Thanks for sending Sam and the other boys up. You were right\u2014they do know the forest better than we do. It was Sam who found her, so I owe you one\u2026 Yeah, I'll talk to you later,\" he agreed, still sour, before hanging up. Charlie muttered something incoherent as he shuffled back to the living room. \"What's wrong?\u00a0 \" I asked. He hurried to my side. \"I'm sorry I woke you, honey.\" \"Is something burning?\u00a0 \" \"It's nothing,\" he assured me. \"Just some bonfires out on the cliffs.\" \"Bonfires?\u00a0 \" I asked. My voice didn't sound curious. It sounded dead. Charlie frowned. \"Some of the kids from the reservation being rowdy,\" he explained. \"Why?\u00a0 \" I wondered dully. I could tell he didn't want to answer. He looked at the floor under his knees. \"They're celebrating the news.\" His tone was bitter. There was only one piece of news I could think of, try as I might not to. And then the pieces snapped together. \"Because the Cullens left,\" I whispered. \"They don't like the Cullens in La Push\u2014I'd forgotten about that.\" The Quileutes had their superstitions about the \"cold ones,\" the blood-drinkers that were enemies to their tribe, just like they had their legends of the great flood and wolf-men ancestors. Just stories, folklore, to most of them. Then there were the few that believed. Charlie's good friend Billy Black believed, though even Jacob, his own son, thought he was full of stupid superstitions. Billy had warned me to stay away from the Cullens\u2026 The name stirred something inside me, something that began to claw its way toward the surface, something I knew I didn't want to face. \"It's ridiculous,\" Charlie spluttered. We sat in silence for a moment. The sky was no longer black outside the window. Somewhere behind the rain, the sun was beginning to rise. \"Bella?\u00a0 \" Charlie asked. I looked at him uneasily. \"He left you alone in the woods?\u00a0 \" Charlie guessed. I deflected his question. \"How did you know where to find me?\u00a0 \" My mind shied away from the inevitable awareness that was coming, coming quickly now. \"Your note,\" Charlie answered, surprised. He reached into the back pocket of his jeans and pulled out a much-abused piece of paper. It was dirty and damp, with multiple creases from being opened and refolded many times. He unfolded it again, and held it up as evidence. The messy handwriting was remarkably close to my own. Going for a walk with Edward, up the path, it said. Back soon, B. \"When you didn't come back, I called the Cullens, and no one answered,\" Charlie said in a low voice. \"Then I called the hospital, and Dr. Gerandy told me that Carlisle was gone.\" \"Where did they go?\u00a0 \" I mumbled. He stared at me. \"Didn't Edward tell you?\u00a0 \" I shook my head, recoiling. The sound of his name unleashed the thing that was clawing inside of me\u2014a pain that knocked me breathless, astonished me with its force. Charlie eyed me doubtfully as he answered. \"Carlisle took a job with a big hospital in Los Angeles. I guess they threw a lot of money at him.\" Sunny L.A. The last place they would really go. I remembered my nightmare with the mirror\u2026 the bright sunlight shimmering off of his skin\u2014 Agony ripped through me with the memory of his face. \"I want to know if Edward left you alone out there in the middle of the woods,\" Charlie insisted. His name sent another wave of torture through me. I shook my head, frantic, desperate to escape the pain. \"It was my fault. He left me right here on the trail, in sight of the house\u2026 but I tried to follow him.\" Charlie started to say something; childishly, I covered my ears. \"I can't talk about this anymore, Dad. I want to go to my room.\" Before he could answer, I scrambled up from the couch and lurched my way up the stairs. Someone had been in the house to leave a note for Charlie, a note that would lead him to find me. From the minute that I'd realized this, a horrible suspicion began to grow in my head. I rushed to my room, shutting and locking the door behind me before I ran to the CD player by my bed. Everything looked exactly the same as I'd left it. I pressed down on the top of the CD player. The latch unhooked, and the lid slowly swung open. It was empty. The album Renee had given me sat on the floor beside the bed, just where I'd put it last. I lifted the cover with a shaking hand. I didn't have to flip any farther than the first page. The little metal corners no longer held a picture in place. The page was blank except for my own handwriting scrawled across the bottom: Edward Cullen, Charlie's kitchen, Sept. 13th. I stopped there. I was sure that he would have been very thorough. It will be as if I'd never existed, he'd promised me. I felt the smooth wooden floor beneath my knees, and then the palms of my hands, and then it was pressed against the skin of my cheek. I hoped that I was fainting, but, to my disappointment, I didn't lose consciousness. The waves of pain that had only lapped at me before now reared high up and washed over my head, pulling me under. I did not resurface.  OCTOBER NOVEMBER DECEMBER JANUARY",

Romeo and Juliet, Act II, Scene VI PREFACE I FELT LIKE I WAS TRAPPED IN ONE OF THOSE TERRIFYING nightmares, the one where you have to run, run till your lungs burst, but you can't make your body move fast enough. My legs seemed to move slower and slower as I fought my way through the callous crowd, but the hands on the huge clock tower didn't slow. With relentless, uncaring force, they turned inexorably toward the end \u2014the end of everything. But this was no dream, and, unlike the nightmare, I wasn't running for my life; I was racing to save something infinitely more precious. My own life meant little to me today. Alice had said there was a good chance we would both die here. Perhaps the outcome would be different if she weren't trapped by the brilliant sunlight; only I was free to run across this bright, crowded square. And I couldn't run fast enough. So it didn't matter to me that we were surrounded by our extraordinarily dangerous enemies. As the clock began to toll out the hour, vibrating under the soles of my sluggish feet, I knew I was too late\u2014and I was glad something bloodthirsty waited in the wings. For in failing at this, I forfeited any desire to live. The clock tolled again, and the sun beat down from the exact center point of the sky. 1. PARTY I WAS NINETY-NINE POINT NINE PERCENT SURE I WAS dreaming. The reasons I was so certain were that, first, I was standing in a bright shaft of sunlight\u2014the kind of blinding clear sun that never shone on my drizzly new hometown in Forks, Washington\u2014and second, I was looking at my Grandma Marie. Gran had been dead for six years now, so that was solid evidence toward the dream theory. Gran hadn't changed much; her face looked just the same as I remembered it. The skin was soft and withered, bent into a thousand tiny creases that clung gently to the bone underneath. Like a dried apricot, but with a puff of thick white hair standing out in a cloud around it. Our mouths\u2014hers a wizened picker \u2014spread into the same surprised half-smile at just the same time. Apparently, she hadn't been expecting to see me, either. I was about to ask her a question; I had so many\u2014What was she doing here in my dream? What had she been up to in the past six years? Was Pop okay, and had they found each other, wherever they were?\u2014but she opened her mouth when I did, so I stopped to let her go first. She paused, too, and then we both smiled at the little awkwardness. \"Bella!\" It wasn't Gran who called my name, and we both turned to see the addition to our small reunion. I didn't have to look to know who it was; this was a voice I would know anywhere\u2014know, and respond to, whether I was awake or asleep\u2026 or even dead, I'd bet. The voice I'd walk through fire for\u2014or, less dramatically, slosh every day through the cold and endless rain for. Edward. Even though I was always thrilled to see him\u2014 conscious or otherwise\u2014and even though I was almost positive that I was dreaming, I panicked as Edward walked toward us through the glaring sunlight. I panicked because Gran didn't know that I was in love with a vampire\u2014nobody knew that\u2014so how was I supposed to explain the fact that the brilliant sunbeams were shattering off his skin into a thousand rainbow shards like he was made of crystal or diamond? Well, Gran, you might have noticed that my boyfriend glitters. It's just something he does in the sun. Don't worry about it\u2026 What was he doing? The whole reason he lived in Forks, the rainiest place in the world, was so that he could be outside in the daytime without exposing his family's secret. Yet here he was, strolling gracefully toward me\u2014with the most beautiful smile on his angel's face\u2014as if I were the only one here. In that second, I wished that I was not the one exception to his mysterious talent; I usually felt grateful that I was the only person whose thoughts he couldn't hear just as clearly as if they were spoken aloud. But now I wished he could hear me, too, so that he could hear the warning I was screaming in my head. I shot a panicked glance back at Gran, and saw that it was too late. She was just turning to stare back at me, her eyes as alarmed as mine. Edward\u2014still smiling so beautifully that my heart felt like it was going to swell up and burst through my chest\u2014put his arm around my shoulder and turned to face my grandmother. Gran's expression surprised me. Instead of looking horrified, she was staring at me sheepishly, as if waiting for a scolding. And she was standing in such a strange position\u2014one arm held awkwardly away from her body, stretched out and then curled around the air. Like she had her arm around someone I couldn't see, someone invisible\u2026 Only then, as I looked at the bigger picture, did I notice the huge gilt frame that enclosed my grandmother's form. Uncomprehending, I raised the hand that wasn't wrapped around Edward's waist and reached out to touch her. She mimicked the movement exactly, mirrored it. But where our fingers should have met, there was nothing but cold glass\u2026 With a dizzying jolt, my dream abruptly became a nightmare. There was no Gran. That was me. Me in a mirror. Me\u2014ancient, creased, and withered. Edward stood beside me, casting no reflection, excruciatingly lovely and forever\u00a0 seventeen. He pressed his icy, perfect lips against my wasted cheek. \"Happy birthday,\" he whispered. I woke with a start \u2014my eyelids popping open wide\u2014and gasped. Dull gray light, the familiar light of an overcast morning, took the place of the blinding sun in my dream. Just a dream, I told myself. It was only a dream. I took a deep breath, and then jumped again when my alarm went off. The little calendar in the corner of the clock's display informed me that today was September thirteenth. Only a dream, but prophetic enough in one way, at least. Today was my birthday. I was officially eighteen years old. I'd been dreading this day for months. All through the perfect summer\u2014the happiest summer I had ever had, the happiest summer anyone anywhere had ever had, and the rainiest summer in the history of the Olympic Peninsula\u2014this bleak date had lurked in ambush, waiting to spring. And now that it had hit, it was even worse than I'd feared it would be. I could feel it\u2014I was older. Every day I got older, but this was different, worse, quantifiable. I was eighteen.  And Edward never would be. When I went to brush my teeth, I was almost surprised that the face in the mirror hadn't changed. I stared at myself, looking for some sign of impending wrinkles in my ivory skin. The only creases were the ones on my forehead, though, and I knew that if I could manage to relax, they would disappear. I couldn't. My eyebrows stayed lodged in a worried line over my anxious brown eyes. It was just a dream, I reminded myself again. Just a dream\u2026 but also my worst\u00a0 nightmare. I skipped breakfast, in a hurry to get out of the house as quickly as possible. I wasn't entirely able to avoid my dad, and so I had to spend a few minutes acting cheerful. I honestly tried to be excited about the gifts I'd asked him not to get me, but every time I had to smile, it felt like I might start crying. I struggled to get a grip on myself as I drove to school. The vision of Gran\u2014I would not think of it as me\u2014was hard to get out of my head. I couldn't feel anything but despair until I pulled into the familiar parking lot behind Forks High School and spotted Edward leaning motionlessly against his polished silver Volvo, like a marble tribute to some forgotten pagan god of beauty. The dream had not done him justice. And he was waiting there for me, just the same as every other day. Despair momentarily vanished; wonder took its place. Even after half a year with him, I still couldn't believe that I deserved this degree of good fortune. His sister Alice was standing by his side, waiting for me, too. Of course Edward and Alice weren't really related (in Forks the story was that all the Cullen siblings were adopted by Dr. Carlisle Culler and his wife, Esme, both plainly too young to have teenage children), but their skin was precisely the same pale shade, their eyes had the same strange golden tint, with the same deep, bruise-like shadows beneath them. Her face, like his, was also startlingly beautiful. To someone in the know\u2014someone like me\u2014these similarities marked them for what they were. The sight of Alice waiting there\u2014her tawny eyes brilliant with excitement, and a small silver-wrapped square in her hands\u2014made me frown. I'd told Alice I didn't want anything, anything, not gifts or even attention, for my birthday. Obviously, my wishes were being ignored. I slammed the door of my '53 Chevy truck\u2014a shower of rust specks fluttered down to the wet blacktop \u2014and walked slowly toward where they waited. Alice skipped forward to meet me, her pixie face glowing under her spiky black hair. \"Happy birthday, Bella!\" \"Shh!\" I hissed, glancing around the lot to make sure no one had heard her. The last thing I wanted was some kind of celebration of the black event. She ignored me. \"Do you want to open your present now or later?\" she asked eagerly as we made our way to where Edward still waited. \"No presents,\" I protested in a mumble. She finally seemed to process my mood. \"Okay\u2026 later, then. Did you like the <em>scrapbook</em> your mom sent you? And the camera from Charlie?\" I sighed. Of course she would know what my birthday presents were. Edward wasn't the only member of his family with unusual skills. Alice would have \"seen\" what my parents were planning as soon as they'd decided that themselves. \"Yeah. They're great.\" \"I think it's a nice idea. You're only a senior once. Might as well document the\u00a0 experience.\" \"How many times have you been a senior?\" \"That's different.\" We reached Edward then, and he held out his hand for mine. I took it eagerly, forgetting, for a moment, my glum mood. His skin was, as always, smooth, hard, and very cold. He gave my fingers a gentle squeeze. I looked into his liquid topaz eyes, and my heart gave a not-quite-so-gentle squeeze of its own. Hearing the stutter in my heartbeats, he smiled again. He lifted his free hand and traced one cool fingertip around the outside of my lips as he spoke. \"So, as discussed, I am not allowed to wish you a happy birthday, is that correct?\" \"Yes. That is correct.\" I could never quite mimic the flow of his perfect, formal articulation. It was something that could only be picked up in an earlier century. \"Just checking.\" He ran his hand through his tousled bronze hair. \"You might have changed your mind.\u00a0 Most people seem to enjoy things like birthdays and gifts.\" Alice laughed, and the sound was all silver, a wind chime. \"Of course you'll enjoy it. Everyone is supposed to be nice to you today and give you your way, Bella. What's the worst that could happen?\" She meant it as a rhetorical question. \"Getting older,\" I answered anyway, and my voice was not as steady as I wanted it to be. Beside me, Edward's smile tightened into a hard line. \"Eighteen isn't very old,\" Alice said. \"Don't women usually wait till they're twenty-nine to get upset over birthdays?\" \"It's older than Edward,\" I mumbled. He sighed. \"Technically,\" she said, keeping her tone light. \"Just by one little year, though.\" And I supposed\u2026 if I could be sure of the future I wanted, sure that I would get to spend forever with Edward, and Alice and the rest of the Cullens (preferably not as a wrinkled little old lady)\u2026 then a year or two one direction or the other wouldn't matter to me so much. But Edward was dead set against any future that changed me. Any future that made me like him\u2014that made me immortal, too. An impasse, he called it. I couldn't really see Edward's point, to be honest. What was so great about mortality? Being a vampire didn't look like such a terrible thing\u2014not the way the Cullens did it, anyway. \"What time will you be at the house?\" Alice continued, changing the subject. From her expression, she was up to exactly the kind of thing I'd been hoping to avoid. \"I didn't know I had plans to be there.\" \"Oh, be fair, Bella!\" she complained. \"You aren't going to ruin all our fun like that, are you?\" \"I thought my birthday was about what I want.\" \"I'll get her from Charlie's right after school,\" Edward told her, ignoring me altogether. \"I have to work,\" I protested. \"You don't, actually,\" Alice told me smugly. \"I already spoke to Mrs. Newton about it. She's trading your shifts. She said to tell you 'Happy Birthday.'\" \"I\u2014I still can't come over,\" I stammered, scrambling for an excuse. \"I, well, I haven't watched Romeo and Juliet yet for English.\" Alice snorted. \"You have Romeo and Juliet memorized.\" \"But Mr. Berty said we needed to see it performed to fully appreciate it\u2014that's how Shakespeare intended it to be presented.\" Edward rolled his eyes. \"You've already seen the movie,\" Alice accused. \"But not the nineteen-sixties version. Mr. Berty said it was the best.\" Finally, Alice lost the smug smile and glared at me. \"This can be easy, or this can be hard, Bella, but one way or the other\u2014\" Edward interrupted her threat. \"Relax, Alice. If Bella wants to watch a movie, then she can. It's her birthday.\" \"So there,\" I added. \u00a0\"I'll bring her over around seven,\" he continued. \"That will give you more time to set up.\" Alice's laughter chimed again. \"Sounds good. See you tonight, Bella! It'll be fun, you'll see.\" She grinned\u2014the wide smile exposed all her perfect, glistening teeth\u2014then pecked me on the cheek and danced off toward her first class before I could respond. \"Edward, please\u2014\" I started to beg, but he pressed one cool finger to my lips. \"Let's discuss it later. We're going to be late for class.\" No one bothered to stare at us as we took our usual seats in the back of the classroom (we had almost every class together now\u2014it was amazing the favors Edward could get the female administrators to do for him). Edward and I had been together too long now to be an object of gossip anymore. Even Mike Newton didn't bother to give me the glum stare that used to make me feel a little guilty. He smiled now instead, and I was glad he seemed to have accepted that we could only be friends. Mike had changed over the summer\u2014his face had lost some of the roundness, making his cheekbones more prominent, and he was wearing his pale blond hair a new way; instead of bristly, it was longer and gelled into a carefully casual disarray. It was easy to see where his inspiration came from\u2014but Edward's look wasn't something that could be achieved through imitation. As the day progressed, I considered ways to get out of whatever was going down at the Cullen house tonight. It would be bad enough to have to celebrate when I was in the mood to mourn. But, worse than that, this was sure to involve attention and gifts. Attention is never a good thing, as any other accident-prone klutz would agree. No one wants a spotlight when they're likely to fall on their face. And I'd very pointedly asked\u2014well, ordered really\u2014that no one give me any presents this year. It looked like Charlie and Renee weren't the only ones who had decided to overlook that. I'd never had much money, and that had never bothered me. Renee had raised me on a kindergarten teacher's salary. Charlie wasn't getting rich at his job, either\u2014he was the police chief here in the tiny town of Forks. My only personal income came from the three days a week I worked at the local sporting goods store. In a town this small, I was lucky to have a job. Every penny I made went into my microscopic college fund. (College was Plan B. I was still hoping for Plan A, but Edward was just so stubborn about leaving me human\u2026) Edward had a lot of money\u2014I didn't even want to think about how much. Money meant next to nothing to Edward or the rest of the Cullens. It was just something that accumulated when you had unlimited time on your hands and a sister who had an uncanny ability to predict trends in the stock market. Edward didn't seem to understand why I objected to him spending money on me\u2014why it made me uncomfortable if he took me to an expensive restaurant in Seattle, why he wasn't allowed to buy me a car that could reach speeds over fifty-five miles an hour, or why I wouldn't let him pay my college tuition (he was ridiculously enthusiastic about Plan B). Edward thought I was being unnecessarily difficult. But how could I let him give me things when I had nothing to reciprocate with? He, for some unfathomable reason, wanted to be with me. Anything he gave me on top of that just threw us more out of balance. As the day went on, neither Edward nor Alice brought my birthday up again, and I began to relax a little. We sat at our usual table for lunch. A strange kind of truce existed at that table. The three of us\u2014Edward, Alice, and I\u2014sat on the extreme southern end of the table. Now that the \"older\" and somewhat scarier (in Emmett's case, certainly) Cullen siblings had graduated, Alice and Edward did not seem quite so intimidating, and we did not sit here alone. My other friends, Mike and Jessica (who were in the awkward post-breakup friendship phase), Angela and Ben (whose relationship had survived the summer), Eric, Conner, Tyler, and Lauren (though that last one didn't really count in the friend category) all sat at the same table, on the other side of an invisible line. That line dissolved on sunny days when Edward and Alice always skipped school, and then the conversation would swell out effortlessly to include me.  Edward and Alice didn't find this minor ostracism odd or hurtful the way I would have. They barely noticed it. People always felt strangely ill at ease with the Cullens, almost afraid for some reason they couldn't explain to themselves. I was a rare exception to that rule. Sometimes it bothered Edward how very comfortable I was with being close to him. He thought he was hazardous to my health\u2014an opinion I rejected vehemently whenever he voiced it. \u00a0The afternoon passed quickly. School ended, and Edward walked me to my truck as he usually did. But this time, he held the passenger door open for me. Alice must have been taking his car home so that he could keep me from making a run for it. I folded my arms and made no move to get out of the rain. \"It's my birthday, don't I get to drive?\" \"I'm pretending it's not your birthday, just as you wished.\" \"If it's not my birthday, then I don't have to go to your house tonight\u2026\" \"All right.\" He shut the passenger door and walked past me to open the driver's side. \"Happy birthday.\" \"Shh,\" I shushed him halfheartedly. I climbed in the opened door, wishing he'd taken the other offer. Edward played with the radio while I drove, shaking his head in disapproval. \"Your radio has horrible reception.\" I frowned. I didn't like it when he picked on my truck. The truck was great\u2014it had\u00a0 personality. \"You want a nice stereo? Drive your own car.\" I was so nervous about Alice's plans, on top of my already gloomy mood, that the words came out sharper than I'd meant them. I was hardly ever bad-tempered with Edward, and my tone made him press his lips together to keep from smiling. When I parked in front of Charlie's house, he reached over to take my face in his hands. He handled me very carefully, pressing just the tips of his fingers softly against my temples, my cheekbones, my jaw line. Like I was especially breakable. Which was exactly the case\u2014compared with him, at least. \"You should be in a good mood, today of all days,\" he whispered. His sweet breath fanned across my face. \"And if I don't want to be in a good mood?\" I asked, my breathing uneven. His golden eyes smoldered. \"Too bad.\" My head was already spinning by the time he leaned closer and pressed his icy lips against mine. As he intended, no doubt, I forgot all about my worries, and concentrated on remembering how to inhale and exhale. His mouth lingered on mine, cold and smooth and gentle, until I wrapped my arms around his neck and threw myself into the kiss with a little too much enthusiasm. I could feel his lips curve upward as he let go of my face and reached back to unlock my grip on him. Edward had drawn many careful lines for our physical relationship, with the intent being to keep me alive. Though I respected the need for maintaining a safe distance between my skin and his razor-sharp, venom-coated teeth, I tended to forget about trivial things like that when he was kissing me. \"Be good, please,\" he breathed against my cheek. He pressed his lips gently to mine one more time and then pulled away, folding my arms across my stomach. My pulse was thudding in my ears. I put one hand over my heart. It drummed hyperactively under my palm. \u00a0\"Do you think I'll ever get better at this?\" I wondered, mostly to myself. \"That my heart might someday stop trying to jump out of my chest whenever you touch me?\" \"I really hope not,\" he said, a bit smug. I rolled my eyes. \"Let's go watch the Capulets and Montagues hack each other up, all right?\" \"Your wish, my command.\" Edward sprawled across the couch while I started the movie, fast-forwarding through the opening credits. When I perched on the edge of the sofa in front of him, he wrapped his arms around my waist and pulled me against his chest. It wasn't exactly as comfortable as a sofa cushion would be, what with his chest being hard and cold\u2014and perfect\u2014as an ice sculpture, but it was definitely preferable. He pulled the old afghan off the back of the couch and draped it over me so I wouldn't freeze beside his body. \"You know, I've never had much patience with Romeo,\" he commented as the movie started. \"What's wrong with Romeo?\" I asked, a little offended. Romeo was one of my favorite fictional characters. Until I'd met Edward, I'd sort of had a thing for him. \"Well, first of all, he's in love with this Rosaline\u2014don't you think it makes him seem a little fickle? And then, a few minutes after their wedding, he kills Juliet's cousin. That's not very brilliant. Mistake after mistake. Could he have destroyed his own happiness any more thoroughly?\" I sighed. \"Do you want me to watch this alone?\" \"No, I'll mostly be watching you, anyway.\" His fingers traced patterns across the skin of my arm, raising goose bumps. \"Will you cry?\" \"Probably,\" I admitted, \"if I'm paying attention.\" \"I won't distract you then.\" But I felt his lips on my hair, and it was very distracting. The movie eventually captured my interest, thanks in large part to Edward whispering Romeo's lines in my ear\u2014his irresistible, velvet voice made the actor's voice sound weak and coarse by comparison. And I did cry, to his amusement, when Juliet woke and found her new husband dead. \"I'll admit, I do sort of envy him here,\" Edward said, drying the tears with a lock of my hair. \"She's very pretty.\" He made a disgusted sound. \"I don't envy him the girl\u2014just the ease of the suicide,\" he clarified in a teasing tone. \"You humans have it so easy! All you have to do is throw down one tiny vial of plant extracts\u2026\" \"What?\" I gasped. \"It's something I had to think about once, and I knew from Carlisle's experience that it wouldn't be simple. I'm not even sure how many ways Carlisle tried to kill himself in the beginning\u2026 after he realized what he'd become\u2026\" His voice, which had grown serious, turned light again. \"And he's clearly still in excellent health.\" I twisted around so that I could read his face. \"What are you talking about?\" I demanded. \"What do you mean, this something you had to think about once?\" \"Last spring, when you were\u2026 nearly killed\u2026\" He paused to take a deep breath, snuggling to return to his teasing tone. \"Of course I was trying to focus on finding you alive, but part of my mind was making contingency plans. Like I said, it's not as easy for me as it is for a human.\" For one second, the memory of my last trip to Phoenix washed through my head and made me feel dizzy. I could see it all so clearly\u2014the blinding sun, the heat waves coming off the concrete as I ran with desperate haste to find the sadistic vampire who wanted to torture me to death. James, waiting in the mirrored room with my mother as his hostage\u2014or so I'd thought. I hadn't known it was all a ruse. Just as James hadn't known that Edward was racing to save me; Edward made it in time, but it had been a close one. Unthinkingly, my fingers traced the crescent-shaped scar on my hand that was always just a few degrees cooler than the rest of my skin. I shook my head\u2014as if I could shake away the bad memories\u2014and tried to grasp what Edward meant. My stomach plunged uncomfortably. \"Contingency plans?\" I repeated. \"Well, I wasn't going to live without you.\" He rolled his eyes as if that fact were\u00a0\u00a0 childishly obvious. \"But I wasn't sure how to do it\u2014I knew Emmett and Jasper would never help\u2026 so I was thinking maybe I would go to Italy and do something to provoke the Volturi.\" I didn't want to believe he was serious, but his golden eyes were brooding, focused on something far away in the distance as he contemplated ways to end his own life. Abruptly, I was furious. \"What is a Volturi?\" I demanded. \u00a0\"The Volturi are a family,\" he explained, his eyes still remote. \"A very old, very powerful family of our kind. They are the closest thing our world has to a royal family, I suppose. Carlisle lived with them briefly in his early years, in Italy, before he settled in America\u2014do you remember the story?\" \"Of course I remember.\" I would never forget the first time I'd gone to his home, the huge white mansion buried deep in the forest beside the river, or the room where Carlisle\u2014Edward's father in so many real ways\u2014kept a wall of paintings that illustrated his personal history. The most vivid, most wildly colorful canvas there, the largest, was from Carlisle's time in Italy. Of course I remembered the calm quartet of men, each with the exquisite face of a seraph, painted into the highest balcony overlooking the swirling mayhem of color. Though the painting was centuries old, Carlisle\u2014the blond angel\u2014remained unchanged. And I remembered the three others, Carlisle's early acquaintances. Edward had never used the name Volturi for the beautiful trio, two black-haired, one snow white. He'd called them Aro, Caius, and Marcus, nighttime patrons of the arts\u2026 \"Anyway, you don't irritate the Volturi,\" Edward went on, interrupting ray reverie. \"Not unless you want to die\u2014or whatever it is we do.\" His voice was so calm, it made him sound almost bored by the prospect. My anger turned to horror. I took his marble face between my hands and held it very tightly. \"You must never, never, never think of anything like that again!\" I said. \"No matter what might ever happen to me, you are not allowed to hurt yourself!\" \"I'll never put you in danger again, so it's a moot point.\" \"Put me in danger! I thought we'd established that all the bad luck is my fault?\" I was getting angrier.\u00a0 \"How dare you even think like that?\" The idea of Edward ceasing to exist, even if I were dead, was impossibly painful. \"What would you do, if the situation were reversed?\" he asked. \"That's not the same thing.\" He didn't seem to understand the difference. He chuckled. \"What if something did happen to you?\" I blanched at the thought. \"Would you want me to go off myself?\" A trace of pain touched his perfect features. \"I guess I see your point\u2026 a little,\" he admitted. \"But what would I do without you?\" \"Whatever you were doing before I came along and complicated your existence.\" He sighed. \"You make that sound so easy.\" \"It should be. I'm not really that interesting.\" He was about to argue, but then he let it go. \"Moot point,\" he reminded me. Abruptly, he pulled himself up into a more formal posture, shifting me to the side so that we were no longer touching. \"Charlie?\" I guessed. Edward smiled. After a moment, I heard the sound of the police cruiser pulling into the driveway. I reached out and took his hand firmly. My dad could deal with that much. Charlie came in with a pizza box in his hands. \"Hey, kids.\" He grinned at me. \"I thought you'd like a break from cooking and washing dishes for your birthday. Hungry?\" \"Sure. Thanks, Dad.\" Charlie didn't comment on Edward's apparent lack of appetite. He was used to Edward passing on dinner. \"Do you mind if I borrow Bella for the evening?\" Edward asked when Charlie and I were done. I looked at Charlie hopefully. Maybe he had some concept of birthdays as stay-at-home, family affairs\u2014this was my first birthday with him, the first birthday since my mom, Renee, had remarried and gone to live in Florida, so I didn't know what he would expect. \"That's fine\u2014the Mariners are playing the Sox tonight,\" Charlie explained, and my hope disappeared. \"So I won't be any kind of company\u2026 Here.\" He scooped up the camera he'd gotten me on Renee's suggestion (because I would need pictures to fill up my scrap-book), and threw it to me. He ought to know better than that\u2014I'd always been coordination ally challenged. The camera glanced off the tip of my finger, and tumbled toward the floor. Edward snagged it before it could crash onto the linoleum. \"Nice save,\" Charlie noted. \"If they're doing something fun at the Cullens' tonight, Bella, you should take some pictures. You know how your mother gets\u2014she'll be wanting to see the pictures faster than you can take them.\" \"Good idea, Charlie,\" Edward said, handing me the camera. I turned the camera on Edward, and snapped the first picture. \"It works.\" \"That's good. Hey, say hi to Alice for me. She hasn't been over in a while.\" Charlie's mouth pulled down at one corner. \"It's been three days, Dad,\" I reminded him. Charlie was crazy about Alice. He'd become attached last spring when she'd helped me through my awkward convalescence; Charlie would be forever grateful to her for saving him from the horror of an almost-adult daughter who needed help showering. \"I'll tell her.\" \"Okay. You kids have fun tonight.\" It was clearly a dismissal. Charlie was already edging toward the living room and the TV. Edward smiled, triumphant, and took my hand to pull me from the kitchen. When we got to the truck, he opened the passenger door for me again, and this time I didn't argue. I still had a hard time finding the obscure turnoff to his house in the dark. Edward drove north through Forks, visibly chafing at the speed limit enforced by my prehistoric Chevy. The engine groaned even louder than usual as he pushed it over fifty. \"Take it easy,\" I warned him. \"You know what you would love? A nice little Audi coupe. Very quiet, lots of power\u2026\" \"There's nothing wrong with my truck. And speaking of expensive nonessentials, if you know what's good for you, you didn't spend any money on birthday presents.\" \"Not a dime,\" he said virtuously. \"Good.\" \"Can you do me a favor?\" \"That depends on what it is.\" He sighed, his lovely face serious. \"Bella, the last real birthday any of us had was Emmett in 1935. Cut us a little slack, and don't be too difficult tonight. They're all very excited.\" It always startled me a little when he brought up things like that. \"Fine, I'll behave.\" \"I probably should warn you\u2026\" \"Please do.\" \"When I say they're all excited\u2026 I do mean all of them.\" \"Everyone?\" I choked. \"I thought Emmett and Rosalie were in Africa.\" The rest of Forks was under the impression that the older Cullens had gone off to college this year, to Dartmouth, but I knew better. \"Emmett wanted to be here.\" \"But\u2026 Rosalie?\" \"I know, Bella. Don't worry, she'll be on her best behavior.\" I didn't answer. Like I could just not worry, that easy. Unlike Alice, Edward's other \"adopted\" sister, the golden blond and exquisite Rosalie, didn't like me much. Actually, the feeling was a little bit stronger than just dislike. As far as Rosalie was concerned, I was an unwelcome intruder into her family's secret life. I felt horribly guilty about the present situation, guessing that Rosalie and Emmett's prolonged absence was my fault, even as I furtively enjoyed not having to see her Emmett, Edward's playful bear of a brother, I did miss. He was in many ways just like the big brother I'd always wanted\u2026 only much, much more terrifying. Edward decided to change the subject. \"So, if you won't let me get you the Audi, isn't there anything that you'd like for your birthday?\" The words came out in a whisper. \"You know what I want.\" A deep frown carved creases into his marble forehead. He obviously wished he'd stuck to the subject of Rosalie. It felt like we'd had this argument a lot today. \"Not tonight, Bella. Please.\" \"Well, maybe Alice will give me what I want.\" Edward growled\u2014a deep, menacing sound. \"This isn't going to be your last birthday, Bella,\" he vowed. \"That's not fair!\" I thought I heard his teeth clench together. We were pulling up to the house now. Bright light shined from every window on the first two floors. A long line of glowing Japanese lanterns hung from the porch eaves, reflecting a soft radiance on the huge cedars that surrounded the house. Big bowls of flowers\u2014pink roses\u2014lined the wide stairs up to the front doors. I moaned. Edward took a few deep breaths to calm himself. \"This is a party,\" he reminded me. \"Try to be a good sport.\" \"Sure,\" I muttered. He came around to get my door, and offered me his hand. \"I have a question.\" He waited warily. \"If I develop this film,\" I said, toying with the camera in my hands, \"will you show up in the picture?\" Edward started laughing. He helped me out of the car, pulled me up the stairs, and was still laughing as he opened the door for me. They were all waiting in the huge white living room; when I walked through the door, they greeted me with a loud chorus of \"Happy birthday, Bella!\" while I blushed and looked down. Alice, I assumed, had covered every flat surface with pink candles and dozens of crystal bowls filled with hundreds of roses. There was a table with a white cloth draped over it next to Edward's grand piano, holding a pink birthday cake, more roses, a stack of glass plates, and a small pile of silver-wrapped presents. It was a hundred times worse than I'd imagined. Edward, sensing my distress, wrapped an encouraging arm around my waist and kissed the top of my head. Edward's parents, Carlisle and Esme\u2014impossibly youthful and lovely as ever\u2014were the closest to the door. Esme hugged me carefully, her soft, caramel-colored hair brushing against my cheek as she kissed my forehead, and then Carlisle put his arm around my shoulders. \"Sorry about this, Bella,\" he stage-whispered. \"We couldn't rein Alice in.\" Rosalie and Emmett stood behind them. Rosalie didn't smile, but at least she didn't glare. Emmett's face was stretched into a huge grin. It had been months since I'd seen them; I'd forgotten how gloriously beautiful Rosalie was\u2014it almost hurt to look at her. And had Emmett always been so\u2026 big? \"You haven't changed at all,\" Emmett said with mock disappointment. \"I expected a perceptible difference, but here you are, red-faced just like always.\" \"Thanks a lot, Emmett,\" I said, blushing deeper. He laughed, \"I have to step out for a second\"\u2014he paused to wink conspicuously at Alice\u2014\"Don't do anything funny while I'm gone.\" \"I'll try.\" Alice let go of Jasper's hand and skipped forward, all her teeth sparkling in the bright light. Jasper smiled, too, but kept his distance. He leaned, long and blond, against the post at the foot of the stairs. During the days we'd had to spend cooped up together in Phoenix, I'd thought he'd gotten over his aversion to me. But he'd gone back to exactly how he'd acted before\u2014avoiding me as much as possible\u2014the moment he was free from that temporary obligation to protect me. I knew it wasn't personal, just a precaution, and I tried not to be overly sensitive about it. Jasper had more trouble sticking to the Cullens' diet than the rest of them; the scent of human blood was much harder for him to resist than the others\u2014he hadn't been trying as long. \"Time to open presents,\" Alice declared. She put her cool hand under my elbow and towed me to the table with the cake and the shiny packages. I put on my best martyr face. \"Alice, I know I told you I didn't want anything\u2014\" \"But I didn't listen,\" she interrupted, smug. \"Open it.\" She took the camera from my hands and replaced it with a big, square silver box. The box was so light that it felt empty. The tag on top said that it was from Emmett, Rosalie, and Jasper. Self-consciously, I tore the paper off and then stared at the box it concealed. It was something electrical, with lots of numbers in the name. I opened the box, hoping for further illumination. But the box was empty. \"Um\u2026 thanks.\" Rosalie actually cracked a smile. Jasper laughed. \"It's a stereo for your truck,\" he explained. \"Emmett's installing it right now so that you can't return it.\" Alice was always one step ahead of me. \"Thanks, Jasper, Rosalie,\" I told them, grinning as I remembered Edward's complaints about my radio this afternoon\u2014all a setup, apparently. \"Thanks, Emmett!\" I called more loudly. I heard his booming laugh from my truck, and I couldn't help laughing, too. \"Open mine and Edward's next,\" Alice said, so excited her voice was a high-pitched trill. She held a small, flat square in her hand. I turned to give Edward a basilisk glare. \"You promised.\" Before he could answer, Emmett bounded through the door. \"Just in time!\" he crowed. He pushed in behind Jasper, who had also drifted closer than usual to get a good look. \"I didn't spend a dime,\" Edward assured me. He brushed a strand of hair from my face, leaving my skin tingling from his touch. I inhaled deeply and turned to Alice. \"Give it to me,\" I sighed. Emmett chuckled with delight. I took the little package, rolling my eyes at Edward while I stuck my finger under the edge of the paper and jerked it under the tape. \"Shoot,\" I muttered when the paper sliced my finger; I pulled it out to examine the damage. A single drop of blood oozed from the tiny cut. It all happened very quickly then. \"No!\" Edward roared. He threw himself at me, flinging me back across the table. It fell, as I did, scattering the cake and the presents, the flowers and the plates. I landed in the mess of shattered crystal. Jasper slammed into Edward, and the sound was like the crash of boulders in a rock slide. There was another noise, a grisly snarling that seemed to be coming from deep in Jasper's chest. Jasper tried to shove past Edward, snapping his teeth just inches from Edward's face. Emmett grabbed Jasper from behind in the next second, locking him into his massive steel grip, but Jasper struggled on, his wild, empty eyes focused only on me. Beyond the shock, there was also pain. I'd tumbled down to the floor by the piano, with my arms thrown out instinctively to catch my fall, into the jagged shards of glass. Only now did I feel the searing, stinging pain that ran from my wrist to the crease inside my elbow.
