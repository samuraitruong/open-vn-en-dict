            "en": "3          3. PHENOMENON When I opened my eyes in the morning, something was different.  It was the light. It was still the gray-green light of a cloudy day in the forest, but it was clearer somehow. I realized there was no fog veiling my window. I jumped up to look outside, and then groaned in horror. A fine layer of snow covered the yard, dusted the top of my truck, and whitened the road. But that wasn't the worst part. All the rain from yesterday had frozen solid \u2014 coating the needles on the trees in fantastic, gorgeous patterns, and making the driveway a deadly ice slick. I had enough trouble not falling down when the ground was dry; it might be safer for me to go back to bed now. Charlie had left for work before I got downstairs. In a lot of ways, living with Charlie was like having my own place, and I found myself reveling in the aloneness instead of being lonely. I threw down a quick bowl of cereal and some orange juice from the carton. I felt excited to go to school, and that scared me. I knew it wasn't the stimulating learning environment I was anticipating, or seeing my new set of friends. If I was being honest with myself, I knew I was eager to get to school because I would see Edward Cullen. And that was very, very stupid. I should be avoiding him entirely after my brainless and embarrassing babbling yesterday. And I was suspicious of him; why should he lie about his eyes? I was still frightened of the hostility I sometimes felt emanating from him, and I was still tongue-tied whenever I pictured his perfect face. I was well aware that my league and his league were spheres that did not touch. So I \u00a0shouldn't be at all anxious to see him today. It took every ounce of my concentration to make it down the icy brick driveway alive. I almost lost my balance when I finally got to the truck, but I managed to cling to the side mirror and save myself. Clearly, today was going to be nightmarish. Driving to school, I distracted myself from my fear of falling and my unwanted speculations about Edward Cullen by thinking about Mike and Eric, and the obvious difference in how teenage boys responded to me here. I was sure I looked exactly the same as I had in Phoenix. Maybe it was just that the boys back home had watched me pass slowly through all the awkward phases of adolescence and still thought of me that way.  Perhaps it was because I was a novelty here, where novelties were few and far between. Possibly my crippling clumsiness was seen as endearing rather than pathetic, casting me as a damsel in distress. Whatever the reason, Mike's puppy dog behavior and Eric's apparent rivalry with him were disconcerting. I wasn't sure if I didn't prefer being ignored.  My truck seemed to have no problem with the black ice that covered the roads. I drove very slowly, though, not wanting to carve a path of destruction through Main Street. When I got out of my truck at school, I saw why I'd had so little trouble. Something silver caught my eye, and I walked to the back of the truck \u2014 carefully holding the side for support \u2014 to examine my tires.  There were thin chains crisscrossed in diamond shapes around them. Charlie had gotten up who knows how early to put snow chains on my truck.  My throat suddenly felt tight. I wasn't used to being taken care of, and Charlie's unspoken concern caught me by surprise.  I was standing by the back corner of the truck, struggling to fight back the sudden wave of emotion the snow chains had brought on, when I heard an odd sound. It was a high-pitched <em>screech</em>, and it was fast becoming painfully loud. I looked up, startled. I saw several things simultaneously. Nothing was moving in slow motion, the way it does in the movies. Instead, the adrenaline rush seemed to make my brain work much faster, and I was able to absorb in clear detail several things at once. Edward Cullen was standing four cars down from me, staring at me in horror. His face stood out from a sea of faces, all frozen in the same mask of shock. But of more immediate importance was the dark blue van that was skidding, tires locked and squealing against the brakes, spinning wildly across the ice of the parking lot. It was going to hit the back corner of my truck, and I was standing between them. I didn't even have time to close my eyes. Just before I heard the shattering crunch of the van folding around the truck bed, something hit me, hard, but not from the direction I was expecting. My head cracked against the icy blacktop, and I felt something solid and cold pinning me to the ground. I was lying on the pavement behind the tan car I'd parked next to. But I didn't have a chance to notice anything else, because the van was still coming. It had curled gratingly around the end of the truck and, still spinning and sliding, was about to collide with me again. A low oath made me aware that someone was with me, and the voice was impossible not to recognize. Two long, white hands shot out protectively in front of me, and the van shuddered to a stop a foot from my face, the large hands fitting providentially into a deep dent in the side of the van's body. Then his hands moved so fast they blurred. One was suddenly gripping under the body of the van, and something was dragging me, swinging my legs around like a rag doll's, till they hit the tire of the tan car. A groaning metallic thud hurt my ears, and the van settled, glass popping, onto the asphalt \u2014 exactly where, a second ago, my legs had been. It was absolutely silent for one long second before the screaming began.  In the abrupt bedlam, I could hear more than one person shouting my name. But more clearly than all the yelling, I could hear Edward Cullen's low, frantic voice in my ear. \"Bella? Are you all right?\" \"I'm fine.\" My voice sounded strange. I tried to sit up, and realized he was holding me against the side of his body in an iron grasp. \"Be careful,\" he warned as I struggled. \"I think you hit your head pretty hard.\" I became aware of a throbbing ache centered above my left ear. \"Ow,\" I said, surprised. \"That's what I thought.\" His voice, amazingly, sounded like he was suppressing laughter. \"How in the\u2026\" I trailed off, trying to clear my head, get my bearings. \"How did you get over here so fast?\" \"I was standing right next to you, Bella,\" he said, his tone serious again. I turned to sit up, and this time he let me, releasing his hold around my waist and sliding as far from me as he could in the limited space. I looked at his concerned, innocent expression and was disoriented again by the force of his gold-colored eyes. What was I asking him? And then they found us, a crowd of people with tears streaming down their faces, shouting at each other, shouting at us. \"Don't move,\" someone instructed. \"Get Tyler out of the van!\" someone else shouted. There was a flurry of activity around us. I tried to get up, but Edward's cold hand pushed my shoulder down. \"Just stay put for now.\" \"But it's cold,\" I complained. It surprised me when he chuckled under his breath. There was an edge to the sound. \"You were over there,\" I suddenly remembered, and his chuckle stopped short. \"You were by your car.\" His expression turned hard. \"No, I wasn't.\" \"I saw you.\" All around us was chaos. I could hear the gruffer voices of adults arriving on the scene. But I obstinately held on to our argument; I was right, and he was going to admit it. \"Bella, I was standing with you, and I pulled you out of the way.\" He unleashed the full, devastating power of his eyes on me, as if trying to communicate something crucial. \"No.\" I set my jaw. The gold in his eyes blazed. \"Please, Bella.\" \"Why?\" I demanded. \"Trust me,\" he pleaded, his soft voice overwhelming. I could hear the sirens now. \"Will you promise to explain everything to me later?\" \"Fine,\" he snapped, abruptly exasperated. \"Fine,\" I repeated angrily. It took six EMTs and two teachers \u2014 Mr. Varner and Coach Clapp \u2014 to shift the van far enough away from us to bring the stretchers in. Edward vehemently refused his, and I tried to do the same, but the traitor told them I'd hit my head and probably had a concussion. I almost died of humiliation when they put on the neck brace. It looked like the entire school was there, watching soberly as they loaded me in the back of the ambulance. Edward got to ride in the front. It was maddening.  To make matters worse, Chief Swan arrived before they could get me safely away. \"Bella!\" he yelled in panic when he recognized me on the stretcher. \"I'm completely fine, Char \u2014 Dad,\" I sighed. \"There's nothing wrong with me.\" He turned to the closest EMT for a second opinion. I tuned him out to consider the jumble of inexplicable images churning chaotically in my head. When they'd lifted me away from the car, I had seen the deep dent in the tan car's bumper \u2014 a very distinct dent that fit the contours of Edward's shoulders\u2026 as if he had braced himself against the car with enough force to damage the metal frame\u2026 And then there was his family, looking on from the distance, with expressions that ranged from disapproval to fury but held no hint of concern for their brother's safety. I tried to think of a logical solution that could explain what I had just seen \u2014 a solution that excluded the assumption that I was insane. Naturally, the ambulance got a police escort to the county hospital. I felt ridiculous the whole time they were unloading me. What made it worse was that Edward simply glided through the hospital doors under his own power. I ground my teeth together. They put me in the emergency room, a long room with a line of beds separated by pastel-patterned curtains. A nurse put a pressure cuff on my arm and a thermometer under my tongue. Since no one bothered pulling the curtain around to give me some privacy, I decided I wasn't obligated to wear the stupid-looking neck brace anymore. When the nurse walked away, I quickly unfastened the Velcro and threw it under the bed. There was another flurry of hospital personnel, another stretcher brought to the bed next to me. I recognized Tyler Crowley from my Government class beneath the bloodstained bandages wrapped tightly around his head.  Tyler looked a hundred times worse than I felt. But he was staring anxiously at me. \"Bella, I'm so sorry!\" \"I'm fine, Tyler \u2014 you look awful, are you all right?\" As we spoke, nurses began unwinding his soiled bandages, exposing a myriad of shallow slices all over his forehead and left cheek. He ignored me. \"I thought I was going to kill you! I was going too fast, and I hit the ice wrong\u2026\" He winced as one nurse started dabbing at his face. \"Don't worry about it; you missed me.\" \"How did you get out of the way so fast? You were there, and then you were gone\u2026\" \"Umm\u2026 Edward pulled me out of the way.\" He looked confused. \"Who?\" \"Edward Cullen \u2014 he was standing next to me.\" I'd always been a terrible liar; I didn't sound convincing at all. \"Cullen? I didn't see him\u2026 wow, it was all so fast, I guess. Is he okay?\" \"I think so. He's here somewhere, but they didn't make him use a stretcher.\" I knew I wasn't crazy. What had happened? There was no way to explain away what I'd seen. They wheeled me away then, to X-ray my head. I told them there was nothing wrong, and I was right. Not even a concussion. I asked if I could leave, but the nurse said I had to talk to a doctor first. So I was trapped in the ER, waiting, harassed by Tyler's constant apologies and promises to make it up to me. No matter how many times I tried to convince him I was fine, he continued to torment himself. Finally, I closed my eyes and ignored him. He kept up a remorseful mumbling. \"Is she sleeping?\" a musical voice asked. My eyes flew open. Edward was standing at the foot of my bed, smirking. I glared at him. It wasn't easy \u2014 it would have been more natural to ogle. \"Hey, Edward, I'm really sorry \u2014\" Tyler began. Edward lifted a hand to stop him. \"No blood, no foul,\" he said, flashing his brilliant teeth. He moved to sit on the edge of Tyler's bed, facing me. He smirked again. \"So, what's the verdict?\" he asked me. \"There's nothing wrong with me at all, but they won't let me go,\" I complained. \"How come you aren't strapped to a gurney like the rest of us?\" \"It's all about who you know,\" he answered. \"But don't worry, I came to spring you.\" Then a doctor walked around the corner, and my mouth fell open. He was young, he was blond\u2026 and he was handsomer than any movie star I'd ever seen. He was pale, though, and tired-looking, with circles under his eyes. From Charlie's description, this had to be Edward's father. \"So, Miss Swan,\" Dr. Cullen said in a remarkably appealing voice, \"how are you feeling?\" \"I'm fine,\" I said, for the last time, I hoped. He walked to the lightboard on the wall over my head, and turned it on. \"Your X-rays look good,\" he said. \"Does your head hurt? Edward said you hit it pretty hard.\" \"It's fine,\" I repeated with a sigh, throwing a quick scowl toward Edward. The doctor's cool fingers probed lightly along my skull. He noticed when I winced. \"Tender?\" he asked. \"Not really.\" I'd had worse. I heard a chuckle, and looked over to see Edward's patronizing smile. My eyes narrowed. \"Well, your father is in the waiting room \u2014 you can go home with him now. But come back if you feel dizzy or have trouble with your eyesight at all.\" \"Can't I go back to school?\" I asked, imagining Charlie trying to be attentive. \"Maybe you should take it easy today.\" I glanced at Edward. \"Does he get to go to school?\" \"Someone has to spread the good news that we survived,\" Edward said smugly. \"Actually,\" Dr. Cullen corrected, \"most of the school seems to be in the waiting room.\" \"Oh no,\" I moaned, covering my face with my hands. Dr. Cullen raised his eyebrows. \"Do you want to stay?\" \"No, no!\" I insisted, throwing my legs over the side of the bed and hopping down quickly. Too quickly \u2014 I staggered, and Dr. Cullen caught me. He looked concerned. \"I'm fine,\" I assured him again. No need to tell him my balance problems had nothing to do with hitting my head. \"Take some Tylenol for the pain,\" he suggested as he steadied me.  \"It doesn't hurt that bad,\" I insisted. \"It sounds like you were extremely lucky,\" Dr. Cullen said, smiling as he signed my chart with a flourish. \"Lucky Edward happened to be standing next to me,\" I amended with a hard glance at the subject of my statement. \"Oh, well, yes,\" Dr. Cullen agreed, suddenly occupied with the papers in front of him. Then he looked away, at Tyler, and walked to the next bed. My intuition flickered; the doctor was in on it. \"I'm afraid that you'll have to stay with us just a little bit longer,\" he said to Tyler, and began checking his cuts. As soon as the doctor's back was turned, I moved to Edward's side. \"Can I talk to you for a minute?\" I hissed under my breath. He took a step back from me, his jaw suddenly clenched. \"Your father is waiting for you,\" he said through his teeth \u2013  I glanced at Dr. Cullen and Tyler. \"I'd like to speak with you alone, if you don't mind,\" I pressed. He glared, and then turned his back and strode down the long room. I nearly had to run to keep up. As soon as we turned the corner into a short hallway, he spun around to face me. \"What do you want?\" he asked, sounding annoyed. His eyes were cold. His unfriendliness intimidated me. My words came out with less severity than I'd intended. \"You owe me an explanation,\" I reminded him. \"I saved your life \u2014 I don't owe you anything.\" I flinched back from the resentment in his voice. \"You promised.\" \"Bella, you hit your head, you don't know what you're talking about.\" His tone was cutting. My temper flared now, and I glared defiantly at him. \"There's nothing wrong with my head.\" He glared back. \"What do you want from me, Bella?\" \"I want to know the truth,\" I said. \"I want to know why I'm lying for you.\" \"What do you think happened?\" he snapped. It came out in a rush. \"All I know is that you weren't anywhere near me \u2014 Tyler didn't see you, either, so don't tell me I hit my head too hard. That van was going to crush us both \u2014 and it didn't, and your hands left dents in the side of it \u2014 and you left a dent in the other car, and you're not hurt at all \u2014 and the van should have smashed my legs, but you were holding it up\u2026\" I could hear how crazy it sounded, and I couldn't continue. I was so mad I could feel the tears coming; I tried to force them back by grinding my teeth together. He was staring at me incredulously. But his face was tense, defensive. \"You think I lifted a van off you?\" His tone questioned my sanity, but it only made me more suspicious. It was like a perfectly delivered line by a skilled actor. I merely nodded once, jaw tight. \"Nobody will believe that, you know.\" His voice held an edge of derision now. \"I'm not going to tell anybody.\" I said each word slowly, carefully controlling my anger. Surprise flitted across his face. \"Then why does it matter?\" \"It matters to me,\" I insisted. \"I don't like to lie \u2014 so there'd better be a good reason why I'm doing it.\" \"Can't you just thank me and get over it?\" \"Thank you.\" I waited, fuming and expectant. \"You're not going to let it go, are you?\" \"No.\" \"In that case\u2026 I hope you enjoy disappointment.\" We scowled at each other in silence. I was the first to speak, trying to keep myself focused. I was in danger of being distracted by his livid, glorious face. It was like trying to stare down a destroying angel. \"Why did you even bother?\" I asked frigidly. He paused, and for a brief moment his stunning face was unexpectedly vulnerable. \"I don't know,\" he whispered. And then he turned his back on me and walked away. I was so angry, it took me a few minutes until I could move. When I could walk, I made my way slowly to the exit at the end of the hallway. The waiting room was more unpleasant than I'd feared. It seemed like every face I knew in Forks was there, staring at me. Charlie rushed to my side; I put up my hands. \"There's nothing wrong with me,\" I assured him sullenly. I was still aggravated, not in the mood for chitchat. \"What did the doctor say?\" \"Dr. Cullen saw me, and he said I was fine and I could go home.\" I sighed. Mike and Jessica and Eric were all there, beginning to converge on us. \"Let's go,\" I urged. Charlie put one arm behind my back, not quite touching me, and led me to the glass doors of the exit. I waved sheepishly at my friends, hoping to convey that they didn't need to worry anymore. It was a huge relief\u2014 the first time I'd ever felt that way \u2014 to get into the cruiser. We drove in silence. I was so wrapped up in my thoughts that I barely knew Charlie was there. I was positive that Edward's defensive behavior in the hall was a confirmation of the bizarre things I still could hardly believe I'd witnessed. When we got to the house, Charlie finally spoke. \"Um\u2026 you'll need to call Ren\u00e9e.\" He hung his head, guilty. I was appalled. \"You told Mom!\" \"Sorry.\" I slammed the cruiser's door a little harder than necessary on my way out. My mom was in hysterics, of course. I had to tell her I felt fine at least thirty times before she would calm down. She begged me to come home \u2014 forgetting the fact that home was empty at the moment \u2014 but her pleas were easier to resist than I would have thought. I was consumed by the mystery Edward presented. And more than a little obsessed by Edward himself. Stupid, stupid, stupid. I wasn't as eager to escape Forks as I should be, as any normal, sane person would be. I decided I might as well go to bed early that night. Charlie continued to watch me anxiously, and it was getting on my nerves. I stopped on my way to grab three Tylenol from the bathroom. They did help, and, as the pain eased, I drifted to sleep. That was the first night I dreamed of Edward Cullen.",

            "en": "Father was in the army all through the war\u2014the first war, I mean-so, up to the age of five, I never saw much of him, and what I saw did not worry me. Sometimes I woke and there was a big figure in khaki peering down at me in the candlelight. Sometimes in the early morning I heard the slamming of the front door and the clatter of nailed boots down the cobbles of the lane. These were Father\u2019s exits and entrances. Like Santa Claus he came and went mysteriously. In fact, I rather liked his visits, though it was an uncomfortable squeeze between Mother and him when I got into the big bed in the early morning. He smoked, which gave him a pleasant musty smell, and shaved, an operation of astounding interest. Each time he left a trail of souvenirs\u2014model tanks and Gurkha knives with handles made of bullet cases, and German helmets and cap badges and buttonsticks, and all sorts of military equipment\u2014carefully stored away in a long box on top of the wardrobe, in case they ever came in handy. There was a bit of the magpie about Father; he expected everything to come in handy. When his back was turned, Mother let me get a chair and rummage through his treasures. She didn\u2019t seem to think so highly of them as he did. The war was the most peaceful period of my life. The window of my attic faced southeast. My mother had curtained it, but that had small effect. I always woke with the first light and, with all the responsibilities of the previous day melted, feeling myself rather like the sun, ready to illuminate and rejoice. Life never seemed so simple and clear and full of possibilities as then. I put my feet out from under the clothes\u2014I called them Mrs. Left and Mrs. Right\u2014and invented dramatic situations for them in which they discussed the problems of the day. At least Mrs. Right did; she was very demonstrative, but I had not the same control of Mrs. Left, so she mostly contented herself with nodding agreement. They discussed what Mother and I should do during the day, what Santa Claus should give a fellow for Christmas, and what steps should be taken to brighten the home. There was that little matter of the baby, for instance. Mother and I could never agree about that. Ours was the only house in the terrace without a new baby, and Mother said we couldn\u2019t afford one till Father came back from the war because they cost seventeen and six. That showed how simple she was. The Geneys up the road had a baby, and everyone knew they couldn\u2019t afford seventeen and six. It was probably a cheap baby, and Mother wanted something really good, but I felt she was too exclusive. The Geneys\u2019 baby would have done us fine. Having settled my plans for the day, I got up, put a chair under the attic window, and lifted the frame high enough to stick out my head. The window overlooked the front gardens of the terrace behind ours, and beyond these it looked over a deep valley to the tall, red-brick houses terraced up the opposite hillside, which were all still in shadow, while those at our side of the valley were all lit up, though with long strange shadows that made them seem unfamiliar; rigid and painted. After that I went into Mother\u2019s room and climbed into the big bed. She woke and I began to tell her of my schemes. By this time, though I never seem to have noticed it, I was petrified in my nightshirt, and I thawed as I talked until, the last frost melted, I fell asleep beside her and woke again only when I heard her below in the kitchen, making the breakfast. After breakfast we went into town; heard Mass at St. Augustine\u2019s and said a prayer for Father, and did the shopping. If the afternoon is fine we either went for a walk in the country or a visit to Mother\u2019s great friend in the convent, Mother St. Dominic. Mother had them all praying for father, and every night, going to bed, I asked God to send him back safe from the war to us. Little, indeed, did I know what I was praying for! One morning, I got into the big bed, and there, sure enough, was Father in his usual Santa Claus manner, but later, instead of uniform, he put on his best blue suit, and Mother was as pleased as anything. I saw nothing to be pleased about, because, out of uniform, Father was altogether less interesting, but she only beamed, and explained that our prayers had been answered, and off we went to Mass to thank God for having brought Father safely home. The irony of it! That very day when he came in to dinner he took off his boots and put on his slippers, donned the dirty old cap he wore about the house to save him from colds, crossed his legs, and began to talk gravely to Mother, who looked anxious. Naturally, I disliked her looking anxious, because it destroyed her good looks, so I interrupted him. \u00a0\u201cJust a moment, Larry!\u201d she said gently. This was only what she said when we had boring visitors, so I attached no importance to it and went on talking. \u00a0\u201cDo be quiet, Larry!\u201d she said impatiently. \u201cDon\u2019t you hear me talking to Daddy?\u201d This was the first time I had heard those ominous words, \u201ctalking to Daddy,\u201d and I couldn\u2019t help feeling that if this was how God answers prayers, he couldn\u2019t listen to them very attentively. \u00a0\u201cWhy are you talking to Daddy?\u201d I asked with as great show of indifference as I could muster. \u00a0\u201cBecause Daddy and I have business to discuss. Now, don\u2019t interrupt again!\u201d In the afternoon, at Mother\u2019s request, Father took me for a walk. This time we went into town instead of out the country, and I thought at first, in my usual optimistic way, that it might be an improvement. It was nothing of the sort. Father and I had quite different notions of a walk in town. He had no proper interest in trams, ships, and horses, and the only thing that seemed to divert him was talking to fellows as old as himself. When I wanted to stop he simply went on, dragging me behind him by the hand; when he wanted to stop I had no alternative but to do the same. I noticed that it seemed to be a sign that he wanted to stop for a long time whenever he leaned against a wall. The second time I saw him do it I got wild. He seemed to be settling himself forever. I pulled him by the coat and trousers, but, unlike Mother who, if you were too persistent, got into a wax and said: \u201cLarry if you don\u2019t behave yourself, I\u2019ll give you a good slap,\u201d Father had an extraordinary capacity for amiable inattention. I sized him up and wondered would I cry, but he seemed to be too remote to be annoyed even by that. Really, it was like going for a walk with a mountain! He either ignored the wrenching and pummeling entirely, or else glanced down with a grin of amusement from his peak. I had never met anyone so absorbed in himself as he seemed. At teatime, \u201ctalking to Daddy\u201d began again, complicated this time by the fact that he had an evening paper, and every few minutes he put it down and told Mother something new out of it. I felt this was foul play. Man for man, I was prepared to compete with him any time for Mother\u2019s attention, but when he had it all made up for him by other people it left me no chance. Several times I tried to change the subject without success. \u00a0\u201cYou must be quiet while Daddy is reading, Larry,\u201d Mother said impatiently. It was clear that she either genuinely liked talking to Father better than talking to me, or else he had some terrible hold on her which made her afraid to admit the truth. \u201cMummy,\u201d I said that night when she was tucking me up, \u201cdo you think that if I prayed hard God would send Daddy back to war?\u201d She seemed to think about that for a moment. \u201cNo, dear,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cI don\u2019t think he would. \u201c \u00a0\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t he, Mummy?\u201d \u201cBecause there isn\u2019t a war any longer, dear. \u201c \u00a0\u201cBut, Mummy, couldn\u2019t God make another war, if He liked?\u201d \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t like to, dear. It\u2019s not God who makes wars, but bad people. \u201c \u00a0\u201cOh!\u201d I said. I was disappointed about that. I began to think that God wasn\u2019t quite what he was cracked up to be. Next morning I woke at my usual hour, feeling like a bottle of champagne. I put out my feet and invented a long conversation in which Mrs. Right talked of the trouble she had with her own father till she put him in the Home. I didn\u2019t quite know what the Home was but it sounded the right place for Father. Then I got my chair and stuck my head out of the attic window. Dawn was just breaking, with a guilty air that made me feel I had caught it in the act. My head bursting with stories and schemes, I stumbled in next door, and in the half-darkness scrambled into the big bed. There was no room at Mother\u2019s side so I had to get between her and Father. For the time being I had forgotten about him, and for several minutes I sat bolt upright, racking my brains to know what I could do with him. He was taking up more than his fair share of the bed, and I couldn\u2019t get comfortable, so I gave him several kicks that made him grunt and stretch. He made room all right, though. Mother waked and felt for me. I settled back comfortably in the warmth of the bed with my thumb in my mouth. \u201cMummy!\u201d I hummed, loudly and contentedly. \u201cSssh! dear,\u201d she whispered. \u201cDon\u2019t wake Daddy!\u201d This was a new development, which threatened to be more serious than \u201ctalking to Daddy. \u201d Life without my early-morning conferences was unthinkable. \u201cWhy?\u201d I asked severely. \u00a0\u201cBecause poor Daddy is tired. \u201c This seemed to me a quite inadequate reason, and I was sickened by the sentimentality of her \u201cpoor Daddy. \u201d I never liked that sort of gush; it always struck me as insincere. \u201cOh!\u201d I said lightly. Then in my most winning tone: \u201cDo you know where I want to go with you today, Mummy?\u201d \u00a0\u201cNo, dear,\u201d she sighed. \u201cI want to go down the Glen and fish for thornybacks with my new net, and then I want to go out to the Fox and Hounds, and\u2014\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t-wake-Daddy!\u201d she hissed angrily, clapping her hand across my mouth. But it was too late. He was awake, or nearly so. He grunted and reached for the matches. Then he stared incredulously at his watch. \u201cLike a cup of tea, dear?\u201d asked Mother in a meek, hushed voice I had never heard her use before. It sounded almost as though she were afraid. \u201cTea?\u201d he exclaimed indignantly. \u201cDo you know what the time is?\u201d \u00a0\u201cAnd after that I want to go up the Rathcooney Road,\u201d I said loudly, afraid I\u2019d forget something in all those interruptions. \u201cGo to sleep at once, Larry!\u201d she said sharply. I began to snivel. I couldn\u2019t concentrate, the way that pair went on, and smothering my early-morning schemes was like burying a family from the cradle. Father said nothing, but lit his pipe and sucked it, looking out into the shadows without minding Mother or me. I knew he was mad. Every time I made a remark Mother hushed me irritably. I was mortified. I felt it wasn\u2019t fair; there was even something sinister in it. Every time I had pointed out to her the waste of making up two beds when we could both sleep in one, she had told me it was healthier like that, and now here was this man, this stranger, sleeping with her without the least regard for her health! He got up early and made tea, but though he brought Mother a cup he brought none for me. \u00a0\u201cMummy,\u201d I shouted, \u201cI want a cup of tea, too. \u201c \u201cYes, dear,\u201d she said patiently. \u201cYou can drink from Mummy\u2019s saucer. \u201c That settled it. Either Father or I would have to leave the house. I didn\u2019t want to drink from Mother\u2019s saucer; I wanted to be treated as an equal in my own home, so, just to spite her, I drank it all and left none for her. She took that quietly, too. But that night while she was putting me to bed she said gently: \u00a0\u201cLarry, I want you to promise me something. \u201c \u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked. \u201cNot to come in and disturb poor Daddy in the morning. Promise?\u201d \u00a0\u201cPoor Daddy\u201d again! I was becoming suspicious of everything involving that quite impossible man. \u201cWhy?\u201d I asked. \u201cBecause poor Daddy is worried and tired and he doesn\u2019t sleep well. \u201c \u00a0\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he, Mummy?\u201d \u201cWell, you know, don\u2019t you, that while he was at the war Mummy got the pennies from the Post Office?\u201d \u201cFrom Miss MacCarthy?\u201d \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s right. But now, you see, Miss MacCarthy hasn\u2019t anymore pennies, so Daddy must go out and find us some. You know what would happen if he couldn\u2019t?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I said, \u201ctell us. \u201c \u201cWell, I think we might have to go out and beg for them like the poor old woman on Fridays. We wouldn\u2019t like that, would we?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I agreed. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t. \u201c \u00a0\u201cSo you\u2019ll promise not to come in and wake him?\u201d \u201cPromise. \u201c Mind you, I meant that. I knew pennies were a serious matter, and I was all against having to go out and beg like the old woman on Fridays. Mother laid out all my toys in a complete ring round the bed so that, whatever way I got out, I was bound to fall over one of them. When I woke I remembered my promise all right. I got up and sat on the floor and played\u2014for hours, it seemed to me. Then I got my chair and looked out the attic window for more hours. I wished it was time for Father to wake; I wished someone would make me a cup of tea. I didn\u2019t feel in the least like the sun; instead, I was bored and so very, very cold! I simply longed for the warmth and depth of the big featherbed. At last I could stand it no longer. I went into the next room. As there was still no room at Mother\u2019s side I climbed over her and she woke with a start. \u201cLarry,\u201d she whispered, gripping my arms very tightly, \u201cwhat did you promise?\u201d \u201cBut I did, Mummy,\u201d I wailed, caught in the very act. \u201cI was quiet for ever so long. \u201c \u00a0\u201cOh, dear, and you\u2019re perished!\u201d she said sadly, feeling me all over. \u201cNow if I let you stay will you promise not to talk?\u201d \u201cBut I want to talk, Mummy,\u201d I wailed. \u201cThat has nothing to do with it,\u201d she said with a firmness that was new to me. \u201cDaddy wants to sleep. Now, do you understand that?\u201d I understood it only too well. I wanted to talk, he wanted to sleep\u2014whose house was it, anyway? \u201cMummy,\u201d I said with equal firmness, \u201cI think it would be healthier for Daddy to sleep in his own bed. \u201c That seemed to stagger her, because she said nothing for a while. \u00a0\u201cNow, once for all,\u201d she went on, \u201cyou\u2019re to be perfectly quiet or go back to your own bed. Which is it to be?\u201d The injustice of it got me down. I had convicted her out of her own mouth of inconsistency and unreasonableness, and she hadn\u2019t even attempted to reply. Full of spite, I gave Father a kick, which she didn\u2019t notice but which made him grunt and open his eyes in alarm. \u00a0\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d he asked in a panic-stricken voice, not looking at Mother but at the door, as if he saw someone there. \u201cIt\u2019s early yet,\u201d she replied soothingly. \u201cIt\u2019s only the child. Go to sleep again. Now, Larry,\u201d she added, getting out of bed, \u201cyou\u2019ve wakened Daddy and you must go back. \u201c This time, for all her quiet air, I knew she meant it, and knew that my principal rights and privileges were as good as lost unless I asserted them at once. As she lifted me, I gave a <em>screech</em>, enough to wake the dead, not to mind Father. He groaned. \u201cThat damn child! Doesn\u2019t he ever sleep?\u201d \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s only a habit, dear,\u201d she said quietly, though I could see she was vexed. \u201cWell, it\u2019s time he got out of it,\u201d shouted Father, beginning to heave in the bed. He suddenly gathered all the bedclothes about him, turned to the wall, and then looked back over his shoulder with nothing showing only two small, spiteful, dark eyes. The man looked very wicked. To open the bedroom door, Mother had to let me down, and I broke free and dashed for the farthest corner, screeching. Father sat bolt upright in bed. \u201cShut up, you little puppy!\u201d he said in a choking voice. I was so astonished that I stopped screeching. Never, never had anyone spoken to me in that tone before. I looked at him incredulously and saw his face convulsed with rage. It was only then that I fully realized how God had codded me, listening to my prayers for the safe return of this monster. \u00a0\u201cShut up, you!\u201d I bawled, beside myself. \u201cWhat\u2019s that you said?\u201d shouted Father, making a wild leap out of the bed. \u201cMick, Mick!\u201d cried Mother. \u201cDon\u2019t you see the child isn\u2019t used to you?\u201d \u00a0\u201cI see he\u2019s better fed than taught,\u201d snarled Father, waving his arms wildly. \u201cHe wants his bottom smacked. \u201c All his previous shouting was as nothing to these obscene words referring to my person. They really made my blood boil. \u201cSmack your own!\u201d I screamed hysterically. \u201cSmack your own! Shut up! Shut up!\u201d At this he lost his patience and let fly at me. He did it with the lack of conviction you\u2019d expect of a man under Mother\u2019s horrified eyes, and it ended up as a mere tap, but the sheer indignity of being struck at all by a stranger, a total stranger who had cajoled his way back from the war into our big bed as a result of my innocent intercession, made me completely dotty. I shrieked and shrieked, and danced in my bare feet, and Father, looking awkward and hairy in nothing but a short gray army shirt, glared down at me like a mountain out for murder. I think it must have been then that I realized he was jealous too. And there stood Mother in her nightdress, looking as if her heart was broken between us. I hoped she felt as she looked. It seemed to me that she deserved it all. From that morning out my life was a hell. Father and I were enemies, open and avowed. We conducted a series of skirmishes against one another, he trying to steal my time with Mother and I his. When she was sitting on my bed, telling me a story, he took to looking for some pair of old boots which he alleged he had left behind him at the beginning of the war. While he talked to Mother I played loudly with my toys to show my total lack of concern. He created a terrible scene one evening when he came in from work and found me at his box, playing with his regimental badges, Gurkha knives and button-sticks. Mother got up and took the box from me. \u00a0\u201cYou mustn\u2019t play with Daddy\u2019s toys unless he lets you, Larry,\u201d she said severely. \u201cDaddy doesn\u2019t play with yours. \u201c For some reason Father looked at her as if she had struck him and then turned away with a scowl. \u201cThose are not toys,\u201d he growled, taking down the box again to see had I lifted anything. \u201cSome of those curios are very rare and valuable. \u201c But as time went on I saw more and more how he managed to alienate Mother and me. What made it worse was that I couldn\u2019t grasp his method or see what attraction he had for Mother. In every possible way he was less winning than I. He had a common accent and made noises at his tea. I thought for a while that it might be the newspapers she was interested in, so I made up bits of news of my own to read to her. Then I thought it might be the smoking, which I personally thought attractive, and took his pipes and went round the house dribbling into them till he caught me. I even made noises at my tea, but Mother only told me I was disgusting. It all seemed to hinge round that unhealthy habit of sleeping together, so I made a point of dropping into their bedroom and nosing around, talking to myself, so that they wouldn\u2019t know I was watching them, but they were never up to anything that I could see. In the end it beat me. It seemed to depend on being grown-up and giving people rings, and I realized I\u2019d have to wait. But at the same time I wanted him to see that I was only waiting, not giving up the fight. One evening when he was being particularly obnoxious, chattering away well above my head, I let him have it. \u201cMummy,\u201d I said, \u201cdo you know what I\u2019m going to do when I grow up?\u201d \u201cNo, dear,\u201d she replied. \u201cWhat?\u201d \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m going to marry you,\u201d I said quietly. Father gave a great guffaw out of him, but he didn\u2019t take me in. I knew it must be only pretense. And Mother, in spite of everything, was pleased. I felt she was probably relieved to know that one day Father\u2019s hold on her would be broken. \u00a0\u201cWon\u2019t that be nice?\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cIt\u2019ll be very nice,\u201d I said confidently. \u201cBecause we\u2019re going to have lots and lots of babies. \u201c \u201cThat\u2019s right, dear,\u201d she said placidly. \u201cI think we\u2019ll have one soon, and then you\u2019ll have plenty of company. \u201c I was no end pleased about that because it showed that in spite of the way she gave in to Father she still considered my wishes. Besides, it would put the Geneys in their place. It didn\u2019t turn out like that, though. To begin with, she was very preoccupied\u2014I supposed about where she would get the seventeen and six\u2014and though Father took to staying out late in the evenings it did me no particular good. She stopped taking me for walks, became as touchy as blazes, and smacked me for nothing at all. Sometimes I wished I\u2019d never mentioned the confounded baby\u2014I seemed to have a genius for bringing calamity on myself. And calamity it was! Sonny arrived in the most appalling hullabaloo\u2014even that much he couldn\u2019t do without a fuss\u2014and from the first moment I disliked him. He was a difficult child\u2014so far as I was concerned he was always difficult\u2014and demanded far too much attention. Mother was simply silly about him, and couldn\u2019t see when he was only showing off. As company he was worse than useless. He slept all day, and I had to go round the house on tiptoe to avoid waking him. It wasn\u2019t any longer a question of not waking Father. The slogan now was \u201cDon\u2019t-wake-Sonny! I couldn\u2019t understand why the child wouldn\u2019t sleep at the proper time, so whenever Mother\u2019s back was turned I woke him. Sometimes to keep him awake I pinched him as well. Mother caught me at it one day and gave me a most unmerciful flaking. One evening, when Father was coming in from work, I was playing trains in the front garden. I let on not to notice him; instead I pretended to be talking to myself, and said in a loud voice: \u201cIf another bloody baby comes into this house, I\u2019m going out. \u201c Father stopped dead and looked at me over his shoulder. \u201cWhat\u2019s that you said?\u201d he asked sternly. I was only talking to myself,\u201d I replied, trying to conceal my panic. \u201cIt\u2019s private. \u201c He turned and went in without a word. Mind you, I intended it as a solemn warning, but its effect was quite different. Father started being quite nice to me. I could understand that, of course. Mother was quite sickening about Sonny. Even at mealtimes she\u2019d get up and gawk at him in the cradle with an idiotic smile, and tell Father to do the same. He was always polite about it, but he looked so puzzled you could see he didn\u2019t know what she was talking about. He complained of the way Sonny cried at night, but she only got cross and said that Sonny never cried except when there was something up with him\u2014which was a flaming lie, because Sonny never had anything up with him, and only cried for attention. It was really painful to see how simple-minded she was. Father wasn\u2019t attractive, but he had a fine intelligence. He saw through Sonny, and now he knew that I saw through him as well. One night I woke with a start. There was someone beside me in bed. For one wild moment I felt sure it must be Mother, having come to her senses and left Father for good, but then I heard Sonny in convulsions in the next room, and Mother saying: \u201cThere! There! There!\u201d and I knew it wasn\u2019t she. It was Father. He was lying beside me, wide awake, breathing hard and apparently as mad as hell. After a while it came to me what he was mad about. It was his turn now. After turning me out of the big bed, he had been turned out himself. Mother had no consideration now for anyone but that poisonous pup, Sonny. I couldn\u2019t help feeling sorry for Father. I had been through it all myself, and even at that age I was magnanimous. I began to stroke him down and say: \u201cThere! There!\u201d He wasn\u2019t exactly responsive. \u00a0\u201cAren\u2019t you asleep either?\u201d he snarled. \u201cAh, come on and put your arm around us, can\u2019t you?\u201d I said, and he did, in a sort of way. Gingerly, I suppose, is how you\u2019d describe it. He was very bony but better than nothing. At Christmas he went out of his way to buy me a really nice model railway.",
