I threw her a hateful look and ran out.  The next day at school\u2026 \u201cyour mom only has one eye?!?!\u201d\u2026And they taunted me. I wished that my mom would just disappear from this world so I said to my mom, \u201cmom\u2026 Why don\u2019t you have the other eye?! If you\u2019re only going to make me a <em>laughingstock</em>, why don\u2019t you just die?!!!\u201d my mom did not respond\u2026  I guess I felt a little bad, but at the same time, it felt good to think that I had said what I\u2019d wanted to say all this time\u2026 maybe it was because my mom hadn\u2019t punished me, but I didn\u2019t think that I had hurt her feelings very badly. That night\u2026 I woke up, and went to the kitchen to get a glass of water. My mom was crying there, so quietly, as if she was afraid that she might wake me.",
