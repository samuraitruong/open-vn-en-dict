            "en": "Libya's Foreign Minister Resigns, Arrives in Britain        <em>Libyan</em> Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa has arrived in Britain and has declared he is leaving Moammar Gadhafi's government. The British foreign office said Wednesday that Koussa traveled from Tunisia to London under his own free will, telling officials he is resigning his post. British officials urged Mr. Gadhafi's other supporters to desert him as well. A <em>Libyan</em> government spokesman, Moussa Ibrahim, denied the foreign minister has defected, saying he is in Britain on a \"diplomatic mission.\" Libya's justice and interior ministers resigned early in the conflict and joined the rebels fighting in the east. U.S. officials called Koussa's resignation \"very significant,\" and an example of growing splits inside the <em>Libyan</em> government. The foreign minister has been a close confidant of Mr. Gadhafi and served as his intelligence chief for more than a decade. In Washington, the White House repeated that no decision has been made to provide arms to rebel forces in Libya. Wednesday's statement was issued amid reports that President Barack Obama has approved a secret authorization for covert efforts to support anti-government rebels. The New York Times reported that the CIA has put an unknown number of operatives into Libya to gather intelligence and make contact with anti-Gadhafi forces. The newspaper said the CIA declined comment on the report, which quoted what it called current and former British officials as saying British special forces and intelligence officers also are in the North African nation. Earlier Wednesday, troops loyal to Mr. Gadhafi drove anti-government rebels from key coastal cities they had seized days before, reversing opposition gains made since international airstrikes began. <em>Libyan</em> rebels retreated amid intense fighting around the strategic oil towns of Ras Lanuf and Brega. Many opposition fighters fell back to the city of Ajdabiya, from where residents were seen fleeing along the road toward the opposition stronghold of Benghazi. Pro-Gadhafi forces were shelling Brega and a rebel military spokesman said he expected the loyalists to enter the city by Wednesday night. The spokesman ((Colonel Ahmad Bani)) also said as many as 3,600 heavily armed members of the Chadian Republican Guard are now fighting alongside Gadhafi loyalists. He dismissed concerns that members of al-Qaida are fighting with the <em>Libyan</em> rebels. On Tuesday, U.S. Admiral James Stavridis told a congressional hearing that groups such as al-Qaida and the Lebanese Hezbollah militia have a small presence among the <em>Libyan</em> opposition. He also said the opposition leadership appeared to be \"responsible men and women\" fighting the <em>Libyan</em> government. A prominent U.S.-based rights group said Wednesday that Mr. Gadhafi's forces have laid land mines around Ajdabiya when the coastal city was under their control earlier this month. In a statement from the rebel stronghold of Benghazi, Human Rights Watch said a civil defense team found more than 50 anti-vehicle and anti-personnel mines in a heavily traveled area. A U.S. military spokesman said coalition airplanes resumed bombing pro-Gadhafi troops Wednesday, although the timing and location of those strikes was not specified. Western nations began enforcing a United Nations-authorized no-fly zone over Libya on March 19 to protect civilians from harm.",

            "en": "Gaddafi forces beat up BBC team         <em>Libyan</em> leader Col Muammar Gaddafi's security forces detained and beat up a BBC news team who were trying to reach the strife-torn western city of Zawiya. The three were beaten with fists, knees and rifles, hooded and subjected to mock executions by members of Libya's army and secret police. The men were detained on Monday and held for 21 hours, but have now flown out of Libya.  Government forces are in a fierce fight to wrest Zawiya from rebel control. Artillery and tanks have pounded the city - which lies 50km (30 miles) from the capital Tripoli - over the last four days. 'Gun against neck'  The BBC team showed their identification when they were detained at an army roadblock on Monday. They had been seeking, like many journalists, to get around government restrictions by reaching besieged Zawiya. The three of them were taken to a huge military barracks in Tripoli, where they were blindfolded, handcuffed and beaten. One of the three, Chris Cobb-Smith, said: \"We were lined up against the wall. I was the last in line - facing the wall.  \"I looked and I saw a plain-clothes guy with a small sub-machine gun. He put it to everyone's neck. I saw him and he screamed at me. \"Then he walked up to me, put the gun to my neck and pulled the trigger twice. The bullets whisked past my ear. The soldiers just laughed.\" A second member of the team - Feras Killani, a correspondent of Palestinian descent - is said to have been singled out for repeated beatings. Their captors told him they did not like his reporting of the <em>Libyan</em> popular uprising and accused him of being a spy. The third member of the team, cameraman Goktay Koraltan, said they were all convinced they were going to die. During their detention, the BBC team saw evidence of torture against <em>Libyan</em> detainees, many of whom were from Zawiya. 'Abusive treatment' Koraltan said: \"I cannot describe how bad it was. Most of them [other detainees] were hooded and handcuffed really tightly, all with swollen hands and broken ribs. They were in agony. They were screaming.\" Killani said: \"Four of them [detainees] were in a very bad situation. There was evidence of torture on their faces and bodies. One of them said he had at least two broken ribs. I spent at least six hours helping them drink, sleep, urinate and move from one side to another.\" A senior <em>Libyan</em> government official later apologised for the BBC team's ordeal. But the BBC said in a statement that it \"strongly condemns this abusive treatment\". \"The safety of our staff is our primary concern especially when they are working in such difficult circumstances and it is essential that journalists working for the BBC, or any media organisation, are allowed to report on the situation in Libya without fear of attack,\" said the statement from Liliane Landor, languages controller of BBC Global News.  \"Despite these attacks, the BBC will continue to cover the evolving story in Libya for our audiences both inside and outside the country.\" Rebel bounty  Government forces have been mounting a strong fightback against the rebels who rose up in mid-February to end Col Gaddafi's 41 years in power. The main square of Zawiya reportedly changed hands twice on Wednesday in the fighting between pro-Gaddafi forces and the insurgents. State TV reported that the army had retaken Zawiya, and showed pictures of what it said were residents staging a pro-Gaddafi rally. On the eastern front around the Mediterranean oil port of Ras Lanuf, rebels retreated in the face of heavy government shelling and ongoing air strikes, amid reports that oil facilities were blown up. Col Gaddafi also launched a diplomatic offensive, dispatching envoys overseas on the eve of a summit by Nato defence ministers in Brussels. High-ranking members of the <em>Libyan</em> leader's inner circle were sent to Cairo, Brussels, Lisbon and Malta to approach government officials. The <em>Libyan</em> government meanwhile offered a reward for the capture of rebel leader Mustafa Abdel Jalil, the ex-justice minister. The amount was 500,000 <em>Libyan</em> dinars ($400,000; \u00a3250,000).",

            "en": "U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates has repeated his strong opposition to putting any American forces in Libya. Gates insisted Thursday there will be no U.S. troops on the ground as long as he has his job. He spoke after U.S. media reported that the CIA has small teams working with anti-government rebels in the North African country. Reports say the CIA has sent operatives into Libya to gather intelligence and make contact with the opposition. Gates said he could not speak for the CIA about its role, but he acknowledged the U.S. still does not have adequate information about Libya's disparate rebel forces. The Pentagon chief appeared before a pair of congressional panels with Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the U.S. military's Joint Chiefs of Staff. The two men said if the rebels are to get arms and training, countries other than the U.S. should provide that assistance. Gates said political and economic pressures eventually will drive <em>Libyan</em> leader Moammar Gadhafi from power. He said the NATO-led operation now under way can degrade the <em>Libyan</em> leader's military capacity, but that Mr. Gadhafi's removal will happen only over time and by his own people. The military leaders said that with NATO now enforcing the no-fly zone over Libya, the U.S. military will \u201csignificantly ramp down\u201d its operations. Gates said Washington will seek to avoid \u201cmission creep\u201d that could mire the U.S. in a protracted conflict in Libya. He described the U.S. military involvement against Mr. Gadhafi as a \u201climited one,\u201d saying it does not include regime change. Many lawmakers were angered by what they said was U.S. President Barack Obama's lack of candor with Congress ahead of the Libya mission. Both Democrats and Republicans accused the two men of overseeing \u201cmission creep\u201d in Libya, or, conversely, with not doing enough. Republican Senator John McCain told the two officials he is \u201cdisappointed\u201d in the decision to pull back American forces before a regime change. McCain said he is working with a bipartisan group of senators on a measure endorsing Mr. Obama's decision to use force in Libya. The move came as some lawmakers charged the U.S. president had overstepped his constitutional bounds by acting before securing approval from Congress for the operation. Mullen told the panel that U.S. military involvement in Libya would be \u201csignificantly reduced starting today.\u201d But he warned Mr. Gadhafi \u201cstill possesses substantial military capability,\u201d compared to the poorly equipped, anti-government rebel forces trying to overthrow him.",

            "en": "He turned up in a government vehicle at a hotel held by loyalists, a day after the rebels said they had detained him. A BBC correspondent said Saif al-Islam seemed confident and full of adrenalin. On Monday the rebels met strong resistance from pro-Gaddafi forces as they continued their push. Both sides say they control most of Tripoli. Saif al-Islam Gaddafi turned up at Hotel Rixos in the early hours of Tuesday. He told the BBC's Matthew Price: \"We have broken the backbone of the rebels.\" He added that by moving into Tripoli, the rebels had fallen into \"a trap\". \"We gave them a hard time, so we're winning,\" he said. Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, 39, had been widely regarded as a likely successor to his father. On Sunday the rebels claimed they had captured him, along with other members of his family. Asked if Col Gaddafi was safe and in Tripoli, Saif al-Islam replied: \"Of course.\" The <em>Libyan</em> leader's whereabouts are still unclear. His sprawling Bab al-Azizia compound is being defended by loyalist troops A diplomatic source told AFP news agency that Col Gaddafi could still be there. He has not been seen in public for months, although he has broadcast audio messages from undisclosed locations.  In a broadcast late on Sunday, he urged residents to \"save Tripoli\" from the rebels. In other developments: \u009f Pro-Gaddafi forces fire a suspected Scud missile from near their stronghold city of Sirte, US defence officials tell Reuters news agency  \u009f Col Gaddafi's eldest son Muhammad reportedly escaped from rebel custody hours after being detained  \u009f China and Russia issue statements urging Gaddafi forces to stop fighting  \u009f UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon says leaders of regional blocs will meet in New York later this week  \u009f Egypt formally recognises the rebel National Transitional Council as the legitimate representative of the <em>Libyan</em> people Ambush  The rebels swept into Tripoli from several direction following an uprising in the capital at the weekend. They who were greeted by jubilant crowds in central Green Square when they arrived on Sunday. Rebel fighters have set up checkpoints in parts of the city, and say reinforcements are arriving by boat. But they have met stiff resistance in a number of areas. There was sustained gunfire near the Bab al-Azizia compound in western Tripoli throughout Monday. Gaddafi loyalists also remain in control of the area further south around the Rixos Hotel, where many Western journalists are based. A rebel convoy coming in from the west was ambushed by Gaddafi loyalists using anti-aircraft fire on Monday. The convoy forced to pull out of the city. As night fell the fighting appeared to die down in many areas. Both sides insist they have the upper hand. Government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim claimed late pro-Gaddafi had control of at least 75% of the city, while the rebels said they were holding about 80%. Our correspondents says it is impossible to determine who is telling the truth. World leaders have urged Col Gaddafi to step down. US President Barack Obama said elements of the Gaddafi regime continued to pose a threat. \"But this much is clear: the Gaddafi regime is coming to an end and the future of Libya is in the hands of its people,\" he said. He appealed to Col Gaddafi to reduce further bloodshed by \"explicitly relinquishing power to the people of Libya and calling on those forces that continue to fight to lay down their arms\".",

Dutch officials said Ruben van Assouw would return to the Netherlands with his aunt and uncle on Saturday morning.  The Afriqiyah Airways Airbus 330 crashed short of the runway at Tripoli airport on Wednesday.  The head <em>Libyan</em> investigator has said the pilot reported no problems during the plane's approach to land.  Ruben's aunt and uncle said their nine-year-old nephew was doing well under the circumstances.  \"We have explained to Ruben exactly what happened,\" they said in a statement to journalists in Tripoli.  \"He knows his parents and brother are dead. The whole family is going to bear the responsibility for Ruben's future,\" they said. Ruben had been on holiday in South Africa with his parents, Trudy and Patrick van Assouw, and his older brother, Enzo.  \"The time ahead will be a difficult period for us. We hope that the media will respect our privacy,\" they added.  The family had been celebrating the parents' twelve-and-a-half year wedding anniversary, a Dutch custom.  Dutch foreign ministry officials said the boy, accompanied by his aunt and uncle and a doctor, would return to the Netherlands on Saturday morning.  Sedig Benzala, the head of the team caring for him, said Ruben was recovering well after a four-and-a-half hour operation to repair multiple fractures to his legs.  The Airbus 330 - carrying 93 passengers and 11 crew - crashed on Wednesday morning as it arrived from Johannesburg, South Africa.  The plane's flight recorders have been sent to Paris for examination It is not clear what caused the plane to crash just short of the runway as it approached Tripoli airport.  The head of the investigation team said the pilot had not reported any problems.  \"Until the very last moment things were normal between the pilot and the control tower,\" Neji Dhaou told AFP news agency. Dutch, French, South African and US experts are helping Libya with the investigation.  Dutch forensic experts are helping to identify the bodies.  Most of the passengers on the flight were from the Netherlands.",

When local people there came out to protest last week, they were fired on from a huge army base in the centre of the city with heavy artillery, including anti-aircraft guns. In response, they simply took on the army, with homemade petrol bombs. They loaded construction site vehicles with petrol and rammed them against the walls of the barracks, and ground down the troops inside. After two or three days of bitter fighting - with the aid of some defection from the government side - they took the base, defeating some of the country's most elite forces. It is now a kind of local tourist attraction, people are wandering around looking at what was inside. 'Gunfire all around'  By Monday, Benghazi was safely in opposition hands but it is tense because of the bitterness of the fighting. People say 300 protesters and 120 members of the government forces were killed.  There is also a worry that government supporters may be hunkered down here, hoping for better days, and that prisoners have escaped and may loot. Benghazi is now in the control of a committee of judges, lawyers, business people and academics. They are running the city from the local court house. They have put up signs everywhere urging people to go back to work - urging bakers and pharmacists, even government employees to get the place going again. And on the face of it, it does seem to be working. Someone joked that the traffic is running more smoothly, and people driving more carefully, than they were under Col Gaddafi. Some people from the city have armed themselves with looted weapons. Those people are now heading west, to oust Col Gaddafi's forces from their remaining strongholds in the rest of the country. Benghazi is also a big centre for the evacuation of foreign nationals. There are thousands and thousands of foreigners of all nationalities at the port. As word spread that the British Navy frigate HMS Cumberland was arriving there, British citizens began arriving from across Libya. Despite criticism of the British government's slow response to the crisis, the commander of the ship, Cpt Steve Dainton, said they had made all speed to get here. \"From all points of view we've reacted very quickly,\" he said.  \"In that time from three days ago we've managed to head up to Crete, take a suck of fuel, embark a whole heap of stores and extra personnel and be down here, which I think is a pretty fast response.\" Some workers had travelled hundreds of miles from remote desert compounds in southern Libya, some had just come from the city. All were delighted the Royal Navy had come to rescue them. Sue Rogers said she had been in Benghazi itself, and heard the battles. \"It was gunfire all around,\" she told the BBC. \"All the smoke was happening at the military installations all around. It started off just with simple gunfire and then it got worse, with heavy artillery fire.\" HMS Cumberland took around 200 British Nationals out of Libya. There are also other, larger ships taking nationals, particularly from East Asia and also Turkish nationals - three large ships taking them out from here.",

The UNHCR says tens of thousands of people are stuck at the borders and in urgent need of help.  The U.N. refugee agency says the situation at the Libya-Tunisia border is chaotic. It says 14,000 people crossed the border Monday, the highest number to date.  The agency says it is crucial to move tens of thousands of people away from the overcrowded border to avoid a humanitarian crisis. But transportation is scarce.  UNHCR spokeswoman Melissa Fleming says the agency has erected 1,500 tents, which can shelter 12,000 people. And she says two airlifts planned for Thursday will deliver tents and supplies for up to 10,000 people. \u201cWe have now visited the border entry point to Tunisia. What is unfortunate is that thousands of people are waiting on the <em>Libyan</em> side of the border to enter. Some for as long as three days. They are obliged to spend the night outside in the bitter cold without shelter. We are very concerned that a large number of sub-Saharan Africans are not being allowed into Tunisia at this point. We are in negotiation with self-appointed volunteers from the local community who are guarding the border,\" she said. Fleming says nearly 70,000 people have crossed from Libya into Egypt since February 19. She says the majority are Egyptians.  She says the UNHCR is particularly worried about thousands of refugees and asylum-seekers stuck inside Libya. She says the refugees come mainly from Iraq, Palestine, Somalia, Sudan and Eritrea. She says they have been living in Libya for a long time but now are desperate to leave. Fleming reads a recent message sent by a refugee to UNHCR staff in Libya describing the fearful conditions under which he and his family are living. She says refugees and migrants from sub-Saharan Africa are particularly vulnerable. \u201cWe are under attack by local people who are saying that we are mercenaries killing people. Let me say that they did not want to see black people. There is racism. We need help. Please, please, please, where is the humanity? Where is the United Nations? I am crying. I need help. Our home was burnt down. Ten Somalis were killed in Libya in the last seven days. Why is nobody concerned about the Somali migrants in Libya? We are victims of racism and ruthless exploitation,\" she said. Fleming says the UNHCR offers assistance to those refugees who are able to reach its office in Tripoli. She says the agency\u2019s 24-hour hotline continues to receive desperate calls from refugees in Libya and their family members outside. She says they say they feel trapped, threatened and hunted.",

Liverpool-born Tim Hetherington, 40, and American Chris Hondros, 41, died on Wednesday while covering the conflict in the besieged city of Misrata. Two other journalists were injured, including Briton Guy Martin. The men's bodies were put aboard the Ionian Spirit, a ferry being used to take food and medicine to Misrata. Misrata is the only rebel-held city in western Libya and has been under attack from forces loyal to Col Muammar Gaddafi for weeks. It is understood Mr Hetherington and Mr Hondros were among a group of journalists pulling back from near the front line, during a lull in the fighting, when they suffered their injuries. Mr Hetherington's family said he was killed by a rocket-propelled grenade. Tributes In addition to taking aid, the ferry used to transport the bodies is also being used to evacuate the injured and foreigners fleeing Misrata. The bodies were taken to Benghazi, the de facto rebel capital, in eastern Libya. The Associated Press news agency said representatives from the UK and the US were to take custody of the bodies in Benghazi and arrange their evacuation from Libya. The two photojournalists wounded alongside their colleagues remain in Misrata's hospital.  Mr Martin, a Cornish photographer who was working with Panos Pictures agency, was hit by shrapnel and remains in intensive care, although reports say his condition has improved after surgery on his leg. New York-based photographer Michael Christopher Brown, who is also being treated for shrapnel injuries, is said to be up and walking. Tributes poured in on Thursday for Mr Hetherington and Mr Hondros, who were both well-respected war photographers. Mr Hetherington, who had dual UK and US citizenship, was best known for his work in Afghanistan and won the World Press Photo of the Year Award in 2007. He also co-directed the Oscar-nominated documentary Restrepo, which followed US troops in Afghanistan. New-York based Mr Hondros was working for Getty Images and his previous awards include the Robert Capa Gold Medal for war photography. The <em>Libyan</em> government has expressed \"sadness\" over the photographers' deaths but spokesman Moussa Ibrahim said there were always casualties in war, adding: \"People die from our side, from their side, people get caught in the middle.\" The conflict in Libya began with an uprising against Col Muammar Gaddafi's 42-year rule in mid-February and it has developed into a battle for a territory. Nato is currently in charge of a no-fly zone and coalition operations have been largely confined to air attacks. On Thursday, the US sanctioned the use of armed drones over Libya to give \"precision capability\" to the military operation",
