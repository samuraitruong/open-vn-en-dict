            "en": "Chili peppers get their kick from capsaicin, which some research suggests also has plenty of health benefits. But a diet rich in capsaicin has also been linked to stomach cancer.  Now, new research shows that one compound in ginger appears to offset the negative health effects of the chili pepper ingredient, and that used together, the two compounds might actually inhibit cancer growth.  Researchers at Pharmacy College of Henan University in China conducted a study with mice prone to lung cancer. Over the course of several weeks, they fed the mice either capsaicin or 6-<em>gingerol</em> or both.",
