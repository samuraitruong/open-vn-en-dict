            "en": "10 Common symptoms in infants and young toddlers    Babies, Toddlers, and Diarrhea Diarrhea is one of the most common childhood illnesses. Causes can include infection, food intolerance, or drinking too much fruit juice. Until diarrhea stops, keep your child at home and hydrated. Avoid dairy, high-fiber, and greasy foods. Call your pediatrician if she isn\u2019t better in 24 hours, is under 6 months old, or has other symptoms, including a fever of 101.4 F or higher, vomiting, bloody or black stool, or abdominal pain. Fever in babies and toddlers In newborns, a low-grade fever can signal serious infection. Call the doctor immediately if a baby under 3 months has a rectal temperature of 100.4 F or higher, or a baby 3 to 6 months old has a temperature of 101 F or higher. Look whether he or she gets ear pain, cough, lethargy, rash, vomiting, or diarrhea. Soothe baby with fluids, a lukewarm bath, and by dressing him in lightweight clothes. Ask your doctor about safe fever reliever use. Little children and constipation Some babies poop several times a day; others go a few days between bowel movements. Don't worry if your baby or toddler doesn't go as often as you'd expect. True constipation is when stools are hard and painful to pass. Your doctor may suggest adding a few extra ounces of water or a little bit of prune juice to your child's bottle or sippy cup. If constipation continues or your baby has other symptoms, such as abdominal pain or vomiting, call the doctor. Rashes Babies have sensitive skin. Rashes can range from pimples to little white bumps (milia) to red, dry, itchy patches (eczema). To avoid diaper rash, change diapers often, and apply an ointment for protection. For eczema, avoid harsh soaps and keep skin moisturized. Most rashes aren't serious, but call the doctor if your baby\u2019s rash is painful or severe, or if he also has a fever or blisters. Cough: Babies and Toddlers Babies' coughs come in many varieties. A seal-like barking cough could be croup. Coughs with a low-grade fever are often from a cold, but a higher fever may mean pneumonia. Wheezing with a cough could be asthma or an infection. Babies with pertussis make a \"whooping\" sound. A cool-mist humidifier and fluids can ease symptoms. Cough medicines should not be given to babies or children under 4. Stomach ache symptoms Uncontrollable crying, back arching, and spitting up are all symptoms of an upset tummy. It could be caused by colic, gastroesophageal reflux, food intolerance, virus, or other reasons. Toddlers can also have problems as they try different foods. Most stomach aches aren't dangerous and will go away. If it doesn't improve, or your child vomits, has diarrhea, becomes <em>lethargic</em>, or runs a fever, call the doctor. Teething pain By about the 6th month, baby\u2019s first little teeth will start poking through her gums. Sore gums can make babies very cranky. Relieve teething pain by giving your baby something to chew on. A frozen wet washcloth or rubber teething ring work well. Gently massaging baby\u2019s gums with your finger can also help. Babies, Toddlers, and Gas pain Burping, crying, and flatulence can be signs of infant gas. Gas isn't the same as colic, which can lead to inconsolable crying. Because gas is often caused by swallowing air, feed your baby slowly and burp often. Toddlers can get gas from high-fiber or fatty foods, or by drinking too much juice. Moving around while eating also can cause children to swallow air, so encourage your child to sit during meals. Stuffy noses When babies have colds, their noses can get very stuffy. Over-the-counter cold medicine should not be used in children under 4 years old. Instead, use saline drops to thin out mucus and then suction it out of baby's nose with a bulb syringe. Turn on the vaporizer to help your child breathe easier at night.  Nausea and vomiting Babies often spit up after eating, but forceful or persistent vomiting needs a doctor's evaluation. Vomiting with diarrhea may signal a virus. Fluid loss from vomiting can lead to dehydration. Keep your child hydrated with small, frequent amounts of an electrolyte solution. If vomiting doesn't stop in a few hours, or is accompanied by a fever in an infant, or your child can't keep down fluids, call your doctor. Keeping calm when baby's not good  There's nothing more distressing to a new parent than a sick baby. Try not to lose your cool. Trust your instincts, but stay alert for signs that you need to call your health care provider or seek emergency care. Some warning signs include changes in appetite, extreme fussiness, lethargy, breathing problems, rash, neck stiffness, seizure, and high fever.",

Even though you may be in a hurry to lose those pregnancy pounds, regularly eating foods that boost energy for new moms will give you the stamina you need to be the best mom you can be. That's because eating nutrient rich foods at regular intervals throughout the day can maximize the little energy you probably have as a new mom. And for nursing moms, it's important to know that the quality of your breast milk stays pretty much the same no matter what you choose to eat. That's because if you aren't getting the needed nutrients from your diet, your body will provide them from your own stores. But for your own well-being, it's best to make sure you're obtaining the nutrients your baby needs by incorporating a variety of healthy breastfeeding foods in your nursing mom food plan. If you make sure the following 12 foods for new moms are a regular part of your diet, your body -- and your baby -- will thank you. 1. Salmon There's no such thing as a perfect food. But salmon is pretty close when it comes to a nutritional powerhouse for new moms. One of the best breastfeeding foods out there, salmon, like other fatty fish, is loaded with a type of fat called DHA. DHA is crucial to the development of your baby's nervous system. All breast milk contains DHA, but levels of this essential nutrient are higher in the milk of women who get more DHA from their diets. The DHA in salmon may also help your mood. Studies suggest it may play a role in preventing postpartum depression. One caution: FDA guidelines say breastfeeding women should limit consumption of fish lower in mercury to 12 ounces per week because of potential exposure to mercury. Salmon is considered to have a low mercury content when compared to other types of fish, such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel, or tilefish. 2. Low-fat dairy products Whether you prefer yogurt, milk, or cheese, dairy products are an important part of healthy breastfeeding. In addition to providing protein, B vitamins, and vitamin D, dairy products are one of the best sources of calcium. If you're breastfeeding, your milk is loaded with calcium to help your baby's bones develop, so it's important for you to eat enough calcium to meet your own needs. One way to do that is to include at least three servings of dairy each day as part of your diet. 3. Lean beef When you're looking for foods to boost your energy as a new mom, seek out iron-rich foods like lean beef. A deficiency of iron can drain your energy levels, making it hard for you to keep up with the demands of a newborn baby. Also, when you're nursing, you need to eat extra protein and vitamin B-12. Lean beef is an excellent source for both of these nutrients. 4. Legumes Beans, especially dark-colored ones like black beans and kidney beans, are a great breastfeeding food, especially for vegetarians. Not only are they rich in iron, they're a budget-friendly source of high quality, non-animal protein. 5. Blueberries Breastfeeding moms should be sure to get two or more servings of fruit or juice each day. Antioxidant-rich blueberries are an excellent choice to help you meet your needs. These satisfying and yummy berries are filled with good-for-you vitamins and minerals and will give you a healthy dose of carbohydrates to keep your energy levels high. 6. Brown rice If you're attempting to lose weight, you might be tempted to drastically cut back on your carbohydrate consumption. But losing weight too quickly may cause you to produce less milk for the baby and leave you feeling <em>lethargic</em> and sluggish. It's better to incorporate healthy, whole-grain carbs like brown rice in your diet to keep your energy levels up. And foods like brown rice provide your body with the calories it needs to produce the best quality milk for your baby. 7. Oranges Portable and nutritious, oranges are a great food to boost energy for new moms. Since nursing moms need even more vitamin C than pregnant women, oranges and other citrus fruits are an excellent breastfeeding food, too. Can't find time to sit down to a snack? Sip on some orange juice -- you'll get the vitamin C benefit and even calcium to get even more benefit from your beverage. 8. Eggs Egg yolk is one of the few natural sources of vitamin D -- an essential nutrient to keep your bones strong and help your baby's bones grow. Beyond that, eggs are a versatile way to meet your daily protein needs. Try scrambling up a couple of eggs for breakfast, tossing a hard-boiled egg or two on your lunchtime salad, or having an omelet and salad for dinner. As part of your diet, you might even opt for DHA-fortified eggs to increase the level of this essential fatty acid in your milk. 9. Whole-wheat bread Folic acid is crucial to your baby's development in the early stages of pregnancy. But its importance doesn't end there. Folic acid is an important nutrient in your breast milk that your baby needs for good health. And it's crucial you eat enough for your own well-being, too. Whole-grain breads and pastas are fortified with this vital nutrient. They also give you a healthy dose of fiber and iron. 10. Leafy greens The list of benefits you get from eating leafy green vegetables such as spinach, Swiss chard, and broccoli goes on and on. They're filled with vitamin A, which your baby needs to get from your breast milk. They're a non-dairy source of dietary calcium. They've got vitamin C and iron. On top of that, green veggies are filled with heart-healthy antioxidants, they're low calorie, and they're tasty to boot. 11. Whole-grain cereal  After yet another sleepless night, one of the best foods to boost energy for new moms in the morning is a healthy breakfast of whole-grain cereal. Many cold cereals are available that are fortified with essential vitamins and nutrients to help you meet your daily needs. Or, whip up a healthy hot breakfast by stirring blueberries and skim milk into a delicious serving of oatmeal. 12. Water Dehydration is one of the biggest energy drains there is. And new moms who are breastfeeding are especially at risk. To keep your energy levels and milk production up, make sure you drink at least eight cups of liquid every day. You can vary your options and meet some of your fluid requirements by drinking juice and milk, but be careful when it comes to caffeinated drinks like coffee and tea. Keep your intake low or switch to decaffeinated varieties. That's because caffeine enters your breast milk and can become concentrated in your baby's body. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0",

            "en": "All expectant parents hope that their babies will be healthy. Yet sometimes problems arise that require a newborn to be hospitalized. When this happens, the baby may be admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for treatment. It's almost always stressful when a baby is unexpectedly admitted to the NICU. But the doctors, nurses, and other caregivers in the unit will do their best to provide emotional support for you while caring for your infant's medical needs. About the NICU With equipment designed for infants and a hospital staff who have special training in newborn care, the NICU is an intensive care unit created for sick newborns who need specialized treatment. Sometimes the NICU is also called: * a special care nursery  * an intensive care nursery  * newborn intensive care  Babies may be sent to the NICU if: * they're born prematurely  * difficulties occur during their deliveries  * they show signs of a problem in the first few days of life  Only very young babies (or babies with a condition linked to being born prematurely) are treated in the NICU \u2014 they're usually infants who haven't gone home from the hospital yet after being born. How long they'll remain in the unit depends on the severity of their illness. Although not all babies in the NICU have the same illness or condition, some diagnoses are common to newborns who need intensive care. Here's a brief look at those conditions, what causes them, how they're diagnosed, how they're treated, and how long infants usually stay in the unit after they've been diagnosed. Anemia What is it? One of the more common blood disorders, anemia is a low number of red blood cells in the blood. Babies who are anemic may: * have apnea (stop breathing for 20 seconds or more)  * have low blood pressure  * have a high heart rate  * seem sleepy What causes it? Premature infants may develop anemia for a number of reasons. In the first few weeks of life, infants don't make many new red blood cells. Also, their red blood cells have a shorter life than an adult's. And the frequent blood samples that must be taken for laboratory testing make it difficult for red blood cells to replenish. In full-term or preterm infants, hemolytic disease of the newborn (incompatibility between the blood types of the mother and baby) can lead to anemia. How is it diagnosed? A doctor can diagnose anemia with a blood test. How is it treated? Minor cases are monitored closely, whereas severe cases (especially in those premature babies who weigh less than 2.2 pounds [1,000 grams]) may require red blood cell transfusions. Doctors also try to treat the underlying cause of the anemia. How long will my baby be in the NICU? By the time the underlying problem has been treated, the number of red blood cells in the infant's circulation stabilizes. As long as the baby is doing well and no longer has symptoms, then the doctors usually let the infant go home with close follow-up with the child's doctor. Apnea What is it? Although it's perfectly normal for everyone to experience occasional pauses in breathing, newborns who don't take at least one breath in 20 seconds or more have a condition called apnea. During an apnea spell: * the baby stops breathing  * the heart rate may decrease  * the skin may turn pale, purplish, or blue from lack of oxygen  What causes it? Apnea is usually caused by immaturity in the area of the brain that controls the drive to breathe (the brain doesn't \"remember\" to take a breath), although illness can also be responsible. Almost all babies born at 30 weeks or less will experience apnea, but apnea spells become less frequent with age. How is it diagnosed? To accurately diagnose apnea, doctors monitor a baby's breathing rate in the NICU and may order a polysomnogram, which involves attaching the baby to several monitors and observing the infant for about 8 to 12 hours. The pneumogram provides information about the baby's heart rate, breathing, and oxygen saturation in the blood. How is it treated? In the NICU, all premature babies are monitored for apnea spells. The first line of treatment for apnea is simply stimulating the baby to help him or her remember to breathe. This can mean rubbing the infant's back or tapping the feet. However, when apnea occurs frequently, the infant may require medication (most commonly caffeine or theophylline) and/or a special nasal device that blows a steady stream of air into the airways to keep them open. How long will my baby be in the NICU? Babies remain in the unit until they've been apnea-free for 24 to 48 hours. Some may go home with an apnea monitor and on caffeine so parents can continue to watch for the condition. Many babies outgrow apnea by the time they're 10 weeks past their original due date. Bradycardia What is it? This is an abnormal slowing of the heart rate. What causes it? Bradycardia often arises from other problems like low oxygen levels in the blood or apnea. How is it diagnosed? Taking the baby's pulse and monitoring in the NICU will confirm a diagnosis of bradycardia. How is it treated? Bradycardia is treated by dealing with the underlying cause, such as apnea. In some rare cases, a heart defect may be responsible for the slower heart rate. For the appropriate care, babies with a heart defect need to see a pediatric cardiologist (a doctor who specializes in treating heart problems in children). How long will my baby be in the NICU? Usually, the length of the stay is determined by the condition causing the bradycardia, not the bradycardia itself. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) What is it? Babies who still need oxygen at 4 weeks before their original due date are considered to have bronchopulmonary dysplasia \u2014 one of the most common chronic lung diseases in infants in the United States. What causes it? Bronchopulmonary dysplasia occurs in different infants for different reasons. It can happen in full-term as well as premature infants and doctors believe that it's due to an individual infant's response to a number of possible factors. The combination of the premature baby's immature lungs and the treatments (including machines and oxygen) to help the little one breathe is thought to cause damage (or scarring) to the lungs. Infections and pneumonia can also lead to the condition. Milder levels of damage are called chronic lung disease of prematurity (CLD). As the babies mature, they grow more lung tissue, which can improve their breathing over time. How is it diagnosed? The diagnosis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia usually doesn't occur until 2 to 4 weeks into the infant's life. At that point, the doctors make a diagnosis based on whether there was lung damage or an injury at birth and whether the infant has needed extra oxygen for a prolonged period of time. Chest X-rays can also help determine the extent of the lung damage. How is it treated? Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is sometimes treated with steroids to decrease the amount of scarring. However, because steroids can cause side effects, doctors usually wait as long as possible to begin steroid treatment. Steroids are never used without a complete discussion with the family as to potential benefits and risks. Other, more commonly used medicines include diuretics (which make the child urinate, or pee, and help eliminate excess fluid that can build up in the damaged lungs) and bronchodilators (which relax the muscles that surround the airways and allow them to open up). Babies with the disease also sometimes need ventilators (breathing machines) at home to help them breathe. And although it's uncommon, in severe cases, the surgical insertion of a breathing tube in the neck (called a tracheostomy) may be required so the baby can go home on a ventilator. Occasionally, babies need home oxygen therapy for several months. How long will my baby be in the NICU? Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is a serious condition that calls for longer stays in the NICU, sometimes up to several months. The smallest infants are usually the ones who develop the disease, so their stays are longer to make sure they're stable before they're discharged. Hydrocephalus What is it? Hydrocephalus means \"water on the brain.\" What causes it? A buildup of cerebrospinal fluid that surrounds the brain and the spinal cord causes hydrocephalus. It occurs when something \u2014 often bleeding from an intraventricular hemorrhage or an abnormality of the brain or skull \u2014 blocks the flow of the fluid. The buildup can create pressure that can damage the brain. How is it diagnosed? Doctors suspect hydrocephalus if a baby has a particularly large head or if head size increases rapidly. A computed tomography (or CT scan \u2014 a type of X-ray) can confirm this suspicion. How is it treated? Less serious cases are usually simply monitored, but more severe ones require a surgeon to place a tube in the brain that drains the fluid from the brain into the abdomen. How long will my baby be in the NICU? Again, this depends on the severity of the case. A serious condition may require a stay of several weeks or months, with careful monitoring so as to recognize potential long-term side effects like mental retardation and seizures. Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) What is it? Intraventricular hemorrhage is bleeding in the brain. Severe cases may cause a drop in blood pressure or seizures. Other symptoms could include: * a weak suck  * high-pitched cry  * apnea  * bradycardia \u00a0 * anemia  What causes it? IVH usually occurs in premature babies because the vessels in their developing brains are especially fragile and can bleed easily. How is it diagnosed? It's diagnosed with an ultrasound of the head so that doctors can look for collections of blood in the brain. How is it treated? There's no specific treatment for intraventricular hemorrhage, so NICUs try to prevent it by controlling babies' blood pressure. Once diagnosed, the problem is closely monitored with frequent ultrasounds. If serious, IVH leads to severe hydrocephalus, which can be treated with a surgically placed shunt. How long will my baby be in the NICU? This depends on the severity of the bleeding. Infants with serious cases may spend several weeks to months in the NICU and be at risk for conditions like cerebral palsy or seizures later in life. Jaundice What is it? Jaundice is a high level of bilirubin in the blood (bilirubin is a byproduct of the natural breakdown of blood cells, and the liver usually \"recycles\" it back into the body). Although mild jaundice is fairly common in full-term babies, it's much more common in premature babies. What causes it? Jaundice occurs when a baby has increased blood cell breakdown and the liver can't handle the extra bilirubin, which builds up, giving the skin and the whites of the eyes a yellowish color. Babies with jaundice are sometimes more sleepy than usual and, in severe cases, may be <em>lethargic</em>. How is it diagnosed? Although the yellow skin is a fairly good indicator, a diagnosis is made with a blood test to measure the bilirubin level. How is it treated? Extremely high levels of bilirubin can cause brain damage, so infants are monitored for jaundice and treated quickly, before bilirubin reaches dangerous levels. Standard treatment includes providing adequate fluids and light therapy, in which the baby spends time under a special blue-colored light. Some cases may also require a blood transfusion. How long will my baby be in the NICU? Babies with this condition stay in the NICU until their bilirubin level drops, usually in about 2 to 3 days. Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) What is it? The most common intestinal condition in newborns, necrotizing enterocolitis occurs in about 1% to 5% of infants in the NICU and happens more commonly in low birth weight and premature infants. What causes it? It's thought that a number of factors can contribute to the development of NEC, which is the necrosis, or death, of parts of the intestine. Although a full-term infant can get the condition, the more premature a baby is, the greater the risk for NEC \u2014 perhaps because the intestines aren't developed enough to handle digestion. Factors that are also believed to contribute include the introduction of milk feeding, damage to the intestines from an infection, and poor blood flow. Babies with NEC may: * have a tense abdomen  * need more oxygen or higher ventilator settings  * have blood in their bowel movements  * exhibit signs of apnea  How is it diagnosed? An X-ray of the abdomen confirms the diagnosis. How is it treated? If there's no sign of a rupture in the intestines, doctors treat necrotizing enterocolitis by: * giving antibiotics  * stopping all intestinal feeding (such as formula feeding, breastfeeding, or using a feeding tube) * switching to an IV * draining the baby's stomach  * performing regular abdominal X-rays  In the case of an intestinal rupture, a surgeon may remove the diseased section of the intestine or make an incision in the abdomen to allow the infected fluid to drain. How long will my baby be in the NICU? Recovering from NEC can take a long time. Babies may spend many weeks in the NICU readjusting to regular feeding. Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) What is it? The ductus arteriosus (DA) is a blood vessel in the heart that connects the aorta (which provides blood to the rest of the body) to the pulmonary artery (which sends blood to the lung). It allows blood to bypass the lungs while a baby is still in the womb. What causes it? The ductus arteriosus usually closes shortly after birth, which allows for normal blood circulation. But in some babies, most often premature ones, it remains open, or patent. Then blood flows through the ductus arteriosus and floods the vessels in the lungs, causing respiratory problems. How is it diagnosed? Those breathing problems are one clue that a baby has PDA. A heart murmur may also lead doctors to suspect the condition, which is then confirmed with an ultrasound of the heart. How is it treated? Sometimes doctors can close the ductus arteriosus by administering medicine. But if that doesn't work, or if the baby is too sick to take the medicine, the infant will need surgery to close it. How long will my baby be in the NICU? Although recovery time varies from child to child, many babies bounce back from PDA treatment in several days. Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) What is it? A type of brain injury, periventricular leukomalacia occurs in the brain tissue that surrounds the fluid-filled cavities of the brain, called ventricles. This area of the brain is called white matter, in contrast to the grey matter that makes up the rest of the brain. So, the injury occurs to the white matter that provides connections between the brain and the muscles of the body. What causes it? PVL is thought to be caused by severe intraventricular hemorrhaging (bleeding in the brain). How is it diagnosed? Often no signs of PVL will be apparent in the nursery. Premature infants are at greater risk of having it, so doctors will frequently get studies like a head ultrasound or an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) to look for periventricular leukomalacia. As the infant gets a little older, he or she may show signs of developmental delays. How is it treated? There's no specific treatment, only close monitoring and support with therapists if a child does develop significant delays, usually after discharge from the hospital How long will my baby be in the NICU? Babies with this condition may be in the NICU for several weeks or months. Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) What is it? One of the most common and immediate problems facing premature infants is difficulty breathing. Although there are many causes of breathing difficulties in premature babies, the most common is called respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). What causes it? In RDS, the infant's immature lungs don't produce enough of an important substance called surfactant. Surfactant allows the inner surface of the lungs to expand properly when the infant makes the change from the womb to breathing air after birth. How is it diagnosed? Doctors suspect respiratory distress syndrome in any premature baby or in full-term infants who are breathing particularly hard and fast or require extra oxygen. A chest X-ray can confirm this diagnosis. How is it treated? RDS is treatable and many infants do quite well. When premature delivery can't be stopped, most pregnant women can be given medication just before delivery to help prevent RDS. Then, immediately after birth and several times later, artificial surfactant can be given to the infant through a breathing tube. Although most premature babies who lack surfactant will require a breathing machine, or ventilator, the use of artificial surfactant has greatly decreased the amount of time they spend on the ventilator. How long will my baby be in the NICU? Babies with serious cases usually require many days or weeks in the unit. Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) What is it? The eyes of premature infants are especially vulnerable to injury after birth. A serious complication is called retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), which is an abnormal growth of the blood vessels in an infant's eye (within the retina). About 7% of babies weighing 2.8 pounds (1,250 grams) or less at birth develop the condition, and the resulting damage may range from mild (the need for glasses) to severe (blindness). What causes it? The cause of ROP in premature infants is unknown. Although it was previously thought that too much oxygen was the primary problem, further research has shown that oxygen levels (either too low or too high) play only a contributing factor in the development of the condition. How is it diagnosed? Because many very premature babies have some level of ROP, an eye exam by a pediatric eye doctor is standard at 8 to 10 weeks before the premature baby's original due date. How is it treated? For slight damage, the eye doctor may just follow the baby with frequent exams. But if the damage is greater, laser surgery will be needed to prevent it from progressing. How long will my baby be in the NICU? ROP alone doesn't usually determine the length of a newborn's stay in the unit. It often occurs in conjunction with other problems, and those will be a greater influence on when a baby can leave. But babies generally recover from the laser surgery in 24 to 48 hours. Sepsis What is it? A very serious condition, sepsis is the body's response to infection that has spread throughout the blood and tissues.  Babies with sepsis may: * be <em>lethargic</em>  * have a low or high temperature  * not eat well  * have apnea or difficulty breathing  * appear jaundiced  * just not look right  What causes it? Sepsis is an infection caused by bacteria growing in the blood. The bacteria can get into the blood: * during labor and delivery from the mother  * from IV lines  * after close contact with an individual who's infected with, or is a carrier of, bacteria  How is it diagnosed? A blood culture \u2014 sometimes along with a urine test or spinal tap \u2014 is used to diagnose the illness. How is it treated? When doctors suspect sepsis, they'll treat the baby with antibiotics until the lab results come back \u2014 usually for 48 hours. If those results are positive for sepsis, the baby receives antibiotics for 7 to 14 more days while being closely monitored. How long will my baby be in the NICU? Cases of sepsis are often severe (the infection can lead to meningitis, organ damage, and occasionally, death) and require a fairly long NICU stay, sometimes several weeks. Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) What is it? Rapid breathing in a full-term newborn (more than 60 breaths a minute) is called transient tachypnea. Until about 4 hours after the delivery, this can actually be normal. What causes it? After 4 hours after delivery, doctors start to look for a cause of the rapid breathing, such as pneumonia, a blood infection, or problems with the lungs, including underdevelopment. How is it diagnosed? Blood tests and X-rays can help diagnose the underlying condition. How is it treated? The lung condition usually subsides within a few days with treatment. Babies are helped to breathe or receive oxygen, if needed, and the NICU staff closely watch their oxygen levels. How long will my baby be in the NICU? A stay of 24 to 72 hours is normal while NICU staff monitor the baby's condition. Other complications In addition to specific diagnoses, infants in the NICU can experience general problems. For instance, newborns lose heat easily, and preemies in particular have trouble regulating their body temperature, as they lack the energy or fat reserves to generate heat and the body mass to maintain it. So NICU babies must be kept warm in warmers or isolettes. High or low blood pressure can also be a risk for premature babies because their developing blood vessels can't handle changes in blood pressure and may tear more easily. Some preemies have trouble feeding because they aren't physically coordinated enough yet to do it. Eating is the most energy-consuming process for a newborn, and babies in the NICU often don't have the strength or energy to feed on their own. Instead, they have to be fed through an IV line or a tube. And if the digestive tract isn't sufficiently developed to handle food, that can cause problems too, as seen with necrotizing enterocolitis. A related condition is reflux. Although all infants have some reflux in the early months, preemies have a particular problem with it because they have poor muscle tone. Sphincters are muscles, and when the one between the esophagus and the stomach is weak, it allows the acidic stomach contents to bubble back up into the esophagus. (A preemie's immature nervous system has trouble controlling the sphincter as well.) The acid irritates the esophagus, which can lead to feeding problems. Inhaling and choking on the reflux is a more serious risk. Newborns who need intensive care are also vulnerable to infections. Their skin and mucous membranes \u2014 the body's primary lines of defense against bacteria and viruses \u2014 aren't well developed enough to provide adequate protection. With several immune-compromised babies in one space, infections that are introduced into the NICU can spread easily, and with nurses caring for multiple babies, the possibility of communicating infectious agents increases. That's why NICU staff are vigilant about keeping that environment as clean as possible. Talking to the doctor If your baby is admitted to the NICU, you'll want to find out as much about his or her care as possible. Some questions to ask the doctor are: * How long will my baby be in the unit?  * What, specifically, is the problem?  * What will be involved in my baby's treatment?  * What medicines will my baby have to take? * What can I do to help my baby? \u00a0 You may also want to talk to the nurses to find out more about your baby's daily care and what to expect when you spend time with your little one. Once you have the answers to these questions, you'll know the way to help your baby during his or her time in intensive care. \u00a0",

            "en": "What is cancer     The human body is made up of hundreds of different types of cell, all of which behave differently.   A cell in the kidney, although it contains the same genetic information as a brain cell, performs a completely separate role.   Cancer happens when a tiny part of the cell's mechanism goes wrong.   What is a cancer cell?  And just as there are hundreds of types of cell, there are hundreds of types of cancer, few of which can be treated in the same way.   Every cell's life is mapped out in advance by coded instructions, called genes, held in its nucleus.   These tell it how to behave, when to reproduce by dividing - and when to die.   When the instructions relating to cell multiplication and dying are wrong, the cell may start dividing uncontrollably, and not die when it should.   In addition, the cancer may not follow the usual instructions that keep cells spaced out properly.   Every time the cell divides, the \"bad\" instruction is reproduced, so the out-of-control multiplication carries on.   As these cells can be multiplying more rapidly than healthy cells, the cancer cells can form a growing lump in the body called a tumour or a lesion.   As this gets larger, it can even grow its own vessels to keep it supplied with blood.   A benign, or non-cancerous tumour shares this uncontrolled growth, but will not generally invade neighbouring tissues and damage them.   Tumours which do this are \"malignant\", or \"cancerous\".   The type of cell in which the cancer starts will generally determine the speed at which it grows, and its resistance to treatment, although there are many variations.   Cancers harm health in a number of ways. The very size of the tumour can interfere with nearby organs, or ducts which carry important chemicals, causing pain or other symptoms.   For example, a tumour on the pancreas can grow to block the bile duct, leading to the patient developing obstructive jaundice.   And a brain tumour can push on important parts of the brain, causing blackouts, fits and other problems.   Even benign tumours can cause these problems if located in the wrong place.   When a cancer invade nearby tissues, they can cause bleeding from damaged blood vessels, and stop the organ which they are invading from working properly.   What happens if it spreads?   As a tumour grows, cells can break off and start growing on adjacent tissues and organs.   For example, if a bowel cancer has spread through the wall of the bowel itself, it can start growing on the bladder.   Cells can also enter the bloodstream and travel to distant organs, such as the lungs or brain.   The technical term for this is \"metastasis\".   When new tumours form on distant organs, they behave like the original tumour - so a bowel cancer cell growing in the lung will be lung cancer.   Once other organs are involved, then any symptoms of the cancer can get worse.   However, it may be some time before a growing cancer in certain parts of the body produces symptoms that the patient can notice.   Once a cancer has started to spread beyond its original site, then the chances of a cure often begin to fall, as it becomes more difficult to treat.   How is it treated?  There are three principal ways of treating cancer.   The first is surgery, normally an operation to remove the cancerous growth, and, depending on its type, nearby tissues and organs.   A cancer patient may first undergo a minor operation called a biopsy to take a small sample of the cancer for analysis.   The surgeon will try to remove as much of the cancer as possible, but sometimes extra treatment will be needed.   This could either take the form of radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or a combination of treatments.   http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3243569.stm \nWhat is chemotherapy? \n  Chemotherapy is drug treatment which is used to try and kill cancer cells or stop them spreading.   Different cancer cells respond to different drugs, so not all chemotherapy is the same.   Sometimes as many as eight different drugs is employed to get the best effect, and doctors are constantly trying out new combinations to improve treatment.   Chemotherapy is often associated with debillitating side effects, but many types of modern chemotherapy cause only mild problems.   Who gets chemotherapy?  Because chemotherapy drugs are usually injected into the blood, they travel around the body and can attack cancer cells regardless of where they find them.   For this reason, doctors will use them when they think there might be cancer cells in more than one part of the body.   If some cancers have been growing for a while undetected, bits of them can break away from the main tumour and travel to either nearby tissue, or to more distant organs like the liver and lungs - and start growing there.   A surgeon can only cut out the a main cancer tumour, and nearby tissues which may be involved.   Radiotherapy, which uses radiation to destroy cancer cells, can only be given to small areas of the body or it will cause damage to too many healthy cells.   Often, after an operation to remove cancer, chemotherapy will be given to \"mop up\" any remaining cells.   Some cancers, such as leukaemia, need chemotherapy because they involve cells which are found throughout the body.   Chemotherapy can be given to shrink a tumour to make it easier for the surgeon to remove.   It can also ease the symptoms of patients whose cancer is not curable.   How does it work?  Chemotherapy, in its traditional sense, is a chemical which is poisonous to cancer cells and kills them.   This is called a cytotoxic chemical - one very early chemotherapy was produced from mustard gas, which was used as chemical weaponry during the First World War.   However, anything which is poisonous to cancer cells may also be poisonous to the body's healthy cells, which it needs to survive.   The trick with chemotherapy is to find a chemical which kills as many cancer cells as possible, and as few healthy cells.   Doctors have been getting increasingly successful at developing such chemicals, by spotting the differences between the cancer cells and neighbouring normal cells, and exploiting them.   The principle difference between many cancer cells and normal cells is the speed at which they reproduce, or divide.   Cancers tend to be dividing and growing faster than other cells in the body - which is why lumps or tumours sometimes appear.   Other cancer cells may become more or less active in response to natural chemicals called hormones produced by the body.   Some chemotherapy harnesses this reaction to control the growth of the cancer cells, so rather than poisoning the cells, they starve them of something they need to grow and multiply.   Cancer cells are not attacked by the body's own immune defence system because the immune system does not recognise them as foreign.   Some chemotherapies try to programme the immune system to see the cancer cells as foreign so they can be attacked and destroyed.   How is it given?  Often, chemotherapy is delivered by injection into a blood vein.   In many cases a saline drip will be set up to dilute the drug as it enters the body. This stops it harming the vein because it is so concentrated.   If the patient needs frequent doses of different drugs, to avoid the discomfort of having to have separate injections every time by having a tube kept in the vein which attaches to the syringe. This line is often left in a vein in the chest - one type is called a \"Hickman line\".   Sometimes, a concentrated dose of chemotherapy is needed on a particular part of the body, and side effects can be lessened by injecting it directly onto the cancerous area.   For example, for some bladder cancers, the drug can be pumped into the bladder so it works directly on the tissue involved.   How long chemotherapy courses last varies between different cancer types, with some being given intensively over a fortnight, normally in hospital, and some over a period of months.   What about side-effects?  Because some chemotherapy targets fast-growing, or fast-dividing cells, it is more likely to harm similar cells in the body.   These include the cells in the hair follicles, which is why cancer treatment is often associated with hair loss, although hair does regrow once treatment has ended.   Other fast-dividing cells can be found in the stomach and bowel lining, which leads to nausea and diarrhoea.   There are, however, drugs which help control this, and timing meals to avoid having a full stomach when the drugs take effect can also help in some cases.   Other types of normal cell that can suffer are the blood cells.   Red cells are important to carry oxygen to keep other cells alive. Other blood cells help stave off infection.  As a result, chemotherapy patients may be more prone to infections, and find them harder to fight off.   Hospitals will take regular blood tests to monitor the levels of different cells. This is called a full blood count.  Generally, patients on chemotherapy can be expected to have less energy than usual, or perhaps even feel extreme fatigue.   Chemotherapy can also affect the fertility of both men and women, and both can now freeze their sperm and eggs with the hope of using them to produce a test-tube baby.   Source: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3243613.stm \nWhat is radiotherapy? \n  It has long been known that radiation can damage human cells - and radiotherapy harnesses that power to treat cancers.   Ionizing radiation - similar to x-rays - can penetrate tissue, and alter the part of the cell which regulates its growth and reproduction.   Healthy cells can recover from this damage, while cancer cells cannot.   There are two types of radiotherapy - delivered from outside the body by a machine, and using radioactive implants placed inside the body.   Researchers are working to increase the effectiveness of radiotherapy by targeting the beam of energy more precisely, and making the cancer cells more sensitive to it.   Who gets radiotherapy?  The principal use of radiotherapy is to tackle solid tumours found in just one location, for example skin, brain, breast or uterine cancers.   Sometimes doctors will use the treatment to shrink a tumour so that a subsequent operation will be more effective.   In some cases, for example in invasive bladder cancer, radiotherapy is considered as the first option, as an alternative to surgery that would have permanent effects on the lifestyle of the patient.   But although radiotherapy alone can cure many cancers, in other cases the radiotherapy is given after surgery over the surrounding area to \"mop up\" any remaining cells which have spread from the original cancer site.   If there is a suspicion or firm evidence that cells could have spread further afield, then chemotherapy may be the preferred option.   What form does treatment take?  If the radiotherapy is delivered by a machine, then the patient will normally be given repeated treatments over a brief period.   Although treatment timing varies depending on the type of cancer, its location, size, and the dose chosen by the doctors, it is not unusual to be given treatments every day for a few weeks.   If the therapy involves inserting a radioactive implant near a tumour, then a brief hospital stay is normally needed.   What about side-effects?  Although the treatment itself is painless at the time, the cumulative effect of many sessions does produce side effects.   The radiation can produce a sunburn-like effect on the skin as it passes through. The extent of this depends on the number and intensity of treatments.   There can be hair loss in the area being treated - which is usually temporary.   The treatment can also leave the patient feeling fatigued and generally <em>lethargic</em>.   Are there long-term risks?  Ionizing radiation produces changes within the genetic structure of the body's cells, and there is a small risk that an increased radiation dose leads to changes in healthy cells which can cause cancer.   New equipment and techniques help to reduce the risk of side effects by targeting doses more accurately on the cancer, thus lowering the dose received by critical organs and tissue around the treatment area, while allowing the malignant tissue itself to be zapped by higher doses than before.   Older radiotherapy equipment tended to target a larger area, so healthy tissue as well as cancerous tissue would be irradiated, increasing the risk of side effects.   The UK government is now investing in the latest machines.   The risks of medical radiation exposure are miniscule when compared to the risks to the patient's health of not having the treatment.   What's likely to happen in the future?  Researchers are fine-tuning radiotherapy to improve the outcomes for patients.   The main efforts focus on delivering a more powerful radiotherapy beam accurately to smaller and smaller targets.   Some drugs seem to make cancer cells more vulnerable to radiation, which means less powerful radiotherapy, or fewer sessions, are needed.   Another field of research is looking at heating cells in a specific area to make them more sensitive to radiotherapy.",

            "en": "14         714. MIND OVER MATTER He could drive well, when he kept the speed reasonable, I had to admit.  Like so many things, it seemed to be effortless to him. He barely looked at the road, yet the tires never deviated so much as a centimeter from the center of the lane. He drove one-handed, holding my hand on the seat. Sometimes he gazed into the setting sun, sometimes he glanced at me \u2014 my face, my hair blowing out the open window, our hands twined together. He had turned the radio to an oldies station, and he sang along with a song I'd never heard. He knew every line. \"You like fifties music?\" I asked.  \"Music in the fifties was good. Much better than the sixties, or the seventies, ugh!\" He shuddered. \"The eighties were bearable.\" \"Are you ever going to tell me how old you are?\" I asked, tentative, not wanting to upset his buoyant humor. \"Does it matter much?\" His smile, to my relief, remained unclouded. \"No, but I still wonder\u2026\" I grimaced. \"There's nothing like an unsolved mystery to keep you up at night.\" \"I wonder if it will upset you,\" he reflected to himself. He gazed into the sun; the minutes passed. \"Try me,\" I finally said. He sighed, and then looked into my eyes, seeming to forget the road completely for a time. Whatever he saw there must have encouraged him. He looked into the sun \u2014 the light of the setting orb glittered off his skin in ruby-tinged sparkles \u2014 and spoke.  \"I was born in Chicago in 1901.\" He paused and glanced at me from the corner of his eyes. My face was carefully unsurprised, patient for the rest. He smiled a tiny smile and continued. \"Carlisle found me in a hospital in the summer of 1918. I was seventeen, and dying of the Spanish influenza.\" He heard my intake of breath, though it was barely audible to my own ears. He looked down into my eyes again. \"I don't remember it well \u2014 it was a very long time ago, and human memories fade.\" He was lost in his thoughts for a short time before he went on. \"I do remember how it felt, when Carlisle saved me. It's not an easy thing, not something you could forget.\" \"Your parents?\" \"They had already died from the disease. I was alone. That was why he chose me. In all the chaos of the epidemic, no one would ever realize I was gone.\" \"How did he\u2026 save you?\" A few seconds passed before he answered. He seemed to choose his words carefully. \"It was difficult. Not many of us have the restraint necessary to accomplish it. But Carlisle has always been the most humane, the most compassionate of us\u2026 I don't think you could find his equal throughout all of history.\" He paused. \"For me, it was merely very, very painful.\" I could tell from the set of his lips, he would say no more on this subject. I suppressed my curiosity, though it was far from idle. There were many things I needed to think through on this particular issue, things that were only beginning to occur to me. No doubt his quick mind had already comprehended every aspect that eluded me.  His soft voice interrupted my thoughts. \"He acted from loneliness. That's usually the reason behind the choice. I was the first in Carlisle's family, though he found Esme soon after. She fell from a cliff. They brought her straight to the hospital morgue, though, somehow, her heart was still beating.\" \"So you must be dying, then, to become\u2026\" We never said the word, and I couldn't frame it now. \"No, that's just Carlisle. He would never do that to someone who had another choice.\" The respect in his voice was profound whenever he spoke of his father figure. \"It is easier he says, though,\" he continued, \"if the blood is weak.\" He looked at the now-dark road, and I could feel the subject closing again. \"And Emmett and Rosalie?\" \"Carlisle brought Rosalie to our family next. I didn't realize till much later that he was hoping she would be to me what Esme was to him \u2014 he was careful with his thoughts around me.\" He rolled his eyes. \"But she was never more than a sister. It was only two years later that she found Emmett. She was hunting \u2014 we were in Appalachia at the time \u2014 and found a bear about to finish him off. She carried him back to Carlisle, more than a hundred miles, afraid she wouldn't be able to do it herself. I'm only beginning to guess how difficult that journey was for her.\" He threw a pointed glance in my direction, and raised our hands, still folded together, to brush my cheek with the back of his hand. \"But she made it,\" I encouraged, looking away from the unbearable beauty of his eyes. \"Yes,\" he murmured. \"She saw something in his face that made her strong enough. And they've been together ever since. Sometimes they live separately from us, as a married couple. But the younger we pretend to be, the longer we can stay in any given place. Forks seemed perfect, so we all enrolled in high school.\" He laughed. \"I suppose we'll have to go to their wedding in a few years, again.\" \"Alice and Jasper?\" \"Alice and Jasper are two very rare creatures. They both developed a conscience, as we refer to it, with no outside guidance. Jasper belonged to another\u2026 family, a very different kind of family. He became depressed, and he wandered on his own. Alice found him. Like me, she has certain gifts above and beyond the norm for our kind.\" \"Really?\" I interrupted, fascinated. \"But you said you were the only one who could hear people's thoughts.\" \"That's true. She knows other things. She sees things \u2014 things that might happen, things that are coming. But it's very subjective. The future isn't set in stone. Things change.\" His jaw set when he said that, and his eyes darted to my face and away so quickly that I wasn't sure if I only imagined it. \"What kinds of things does she see?\" \"She saw Jasper and knew that he was looking for her before he knew it himself. She saw Carlisle and our family, and they came together to find us. She's most sensitive to non-humans. She always sees, for example, when another group of our kind is coming near. And any threat they may pose.\" \"Are there a lot of\u2026 your kind?\" I was surprised. How many of them could walk among us undetected? \"No, not many. But most won't settle in any one place. Only those like us, who've given up hunting you people\" \u2014 a sly glance in my direction \u2014 \"can live together with humans for any length of time. We've only found one other family like ours, in a small village in Alaska. We lived together for a time, but there were so many of us that we became too noticeable. Those of us who live\u2026 differently tend to band together.\"  \"And the others?\" \"Nomads, for the most part. We've all lived that way at times. It gets tedious, like anything else. But we run across the others now and then, because most of us prefer the North.\" \"Why is that?\" We were parked in front of my house now, and he'd turned off the truck.  It was very quiet and dark; there was no moon. The porch light was off so I knew my father wasn't home yet.  \"Did you have your eyes open this afternoon?\" he teased. \"Do you think I could walk down the street in the sunlight without causing traffic accidents? There's a reason why we chose the Olympic Peninsula, one of the most sunless places in the world. It's nice to be able to go outside in the day. You wouldn't believe how tired you can get of nighttime in eighty-odd years.\" \"So that's where the legends came from?\" \"Probably.\" \"And Alice came from another family, like Jasper?\" \"No, and that is a mystery. Alice doesn't remember her human life at all.  And she doesn't know who created her. She awoke alone. Whoever made her walked away, and none of us understand why, or how, he could. If she hadn't had that other sense, if she hadn't seen Jasper and Carlisle and known that she would someday become one of us, she probably would have turned into a total savage.\" There was so much to think through, so much I still wanted to ask. But, to my great embarrassment, my stomach growled. I'd been so intrigued, I hadn't even noticed I was hungry. I realized now that I was ravenous.  \"I'm sorry, I'm keeping you from dinner.\" \"I'm fine, really.\" \"I've never spent much time around anyone who eats food. I forget.\" \"I want to stay with you.\" It was easier to say in the darkness, knowing as I spoke how my voice would betray me, my hopeless addiction to him.  \"Can't I come in?\" he asked. \"Would you like to?\" I couldn't picture it, this godlike creature sitting in my father's shabby kitchen chair. \"Yes, if it's all right.\" I heard the door close quietly, and almost simultaneously he was outside my door, opening it for me. \"Very human,\" I complimented him. \"It's definitely resurfacing.\" He walked beside me in the night, so quietly I had to peek at him constantly to be sure he was still there. In the darkness he looked much more normal. Still pale, still dreamlike in his beauty, but no longer the fantastic sparkling creature of our sunlit afternoon. He reached the door ahead of me and opened it for me. I paused halfway through the frame. \"The door was unlocked?\" \"No, I used the key from under the eave.\" I stepped inside, flicked on the porch light, and turned to look at him with my eyebrows raised. I was sure I'd never used that key in front of him. \"I was curious about you.\" \"You spied on me?\" But somehow I couldn't infuse my voice with the proper outrage. I was flattered. He was unrepentant. \"What else is there to do at night?\" I let it go for the moment and went down the hall to the kitchen. He was there before me, needing no guide. He sat in the very chair I'd tried to picture him in. His beauty lit up the kitchen. It was a moment before I could look away. I concentrated on getting my dinner, taking last night's lasagna from the fridge, placing a square on a plate, heating it in the microwave. It revolved, filling the kitchen with the smell of tomatoes and oregano. I didn't take my eyes from the plate of food as I spoke. \"How often?\" I asked casually. \"Hmmm?\" He sounded as if I had pulled him from some other train of thought. I still didn't turn around. \"How often did you come here?\" \"I come here almost every night.\" I whirled, stunned. \"Why?\" \"You're interesting when you sleep.\" He spoke matter-of-factly. \"You talk.\" \"No!\" I gasped, heat flooding my face all the way to my hairline. I gripped the kitchen counter for support. I knew I talked in my sleep, of course; my mother teased me about it. I hadn't thought it was something I needed to worry about here, though. His expression shifted instantly to chagrin. \"Are you very angry with me?\" \"That depends!\" I felt and sounded like I'd had the breath knocked out of me. He waited. \"On?\" he urged. \"What you heard!\" I wailed. Instantly, silently, he was at my side, taking my hands carefully in his.  \"Don't be upset!\" he pleaded. He dropped his face to the level of my eyes, holding my gaze. I was embarrassed. I tried to look away.  \"You miss your mother,\" he whispered. \"You worry about her. And when it rains, the sound makes you restless. You used to talk about home a lot, but it's less often now. Once you said, 'It's too green.'\" He laughed softly, hoping, I could see, not to offend me further. \"Anything else?\" I demanded. He knew what I was getting at. \"You did say my name,\" he admitted. I sighed in defeat. \"A lot?\" \"How much do you mean by 'a lot,' exactly?\" \"Oh no!\" I hung my head. He pulled me against his chest, softly, naturally. \"Don't be self-conscious,\" he whispered in my ear. \"If I could dream at all, it would be about you. And I'm not ashamed of it.\" Then we both heard the sound of tires on the brick driveway, saw the headlights flash through the front windows, down the hall to us. I stiffened in his arms. \"Should your father know I'm here?\" he asked. \"I'm not sure\u2026\" I tried to think it through quickly. \"Another time then\u2026\" And I was alone. \"Edward!\" I hissed. I heard a ghostly chuckle, then nothing else. My father's key turned in the door. \"Bella?\" he called. It had bothered me before; who else would it be? Suddenly he didn't seem so far off base. \"In here.\" I hoped he couldn't hear the hysterical edge to my voice. I grabbed my dinner from the microwave and sat at the table as he walked in. His footsteps sounded so noisy after my day with Edward.  \"Can you get me some of that? I'm bushed.\" He stepped on the heels of his boots to take them off, holding the back of Edward's chair for support. I took my food with me, scarfing it down as I got his dinner. It burned my tongue. I filled two glasses with milk while his lasagna was heating, and gulped mine to put out the fire. As I set the glass down, I noticed the milk trembling and realized my hand was shaking. Charlie sat in the chair, and the contrast between him and its former occupant was comical. \"Thanks,\" he said as I placed his food on the table. \"How was your day?\" I asked. The words were rushed; I was dying to escape to my room. \"Good. The fish were biting\u2026 how about you? Did you get everything done that you wanted to?\" \"Not really \u2014 it was too nice out to stay indoors.\" I took another big bite. \"It was a nice day,\" he agreed. What an understatement, I thought to myself. Finished with the last bite of lasagna, I lifted my glass and chugged the remains of my milk. Charlie surprised me by being observant. \"In a hurry?\" \"Yeah, I'm tired. I'm going to bed early.\" \"You look kinda keyed up,\" he noted. Why, oh why, did this have to be his night to pay attention? \"Do I?\" was all I could manage in response. I quickly scrubbed my dishes clean in the sink, and placed them upside down on a dish towel to dry. \"It's Saturday,\" he mused. I didn't respond. \"No plans tonight?\" he asked suddenly. \"No, Dad, I just want to get some sleep.\" \"None of the boys in town your type, eh?\" He was suspicious, but trying to play it cool. \"No, none of the boys have caught my eye yet.\" I was careful not to over-emphasize the word boys in my quest to be truthful with Charlie. \"I thought maybe that Mike Newton\u2026 you said he was friendly.\" \"He's Just a friend, Dad.\" \"Well, you're too good for them all, anyway. Wait till you get to college to start looking.\" Every father's dream, that his daughter will be out of the house before the hormones kick in. \"Sounds like a good idea to me,\" I agreed as I headed up the stairs. \"'Night, honey,\" he called after me. No doubt he would be listening carefully all evening, waiting for me to try to sneak out. \"See you in the morning, Dad.\" See you creeping into my room tonight at midnight to check on me. I worked to make my tread sound slow and tired as I walked up the stairs to my room. I shut the door loud enough for him to hear, and then sprinted on my tiptoes to the window. I threw it open and leaned out into the night. My eyes scanned the darkness, the impenetrable shadows of the trees. \"Edward?\" I whispered, feeling completely idiotic. The quiet, laughing response came from behind me. \"Yes?\" I whirled, one hand flying to my throat in surprise. He lay, smiling hugely, across my bed, his hands behind his head, his feet dangling off the end, the picture of ease. \"Oh!\" I breathed, sinking unsteadily to the floor.  \"I'm sorry.\" He pressed his lips together, trying to hide his amusement. \"Just give me a minute to restart my heart.\" He sat up slowly, so as not to startle me again. Then he leaned forward and reached out with his long arms to pick me up, gripping the tops of my arms like I was a toddler. He sat me on the bed beside him. \"Why don't you sit with me,\" he suggested, putting a cold hand on mine. \"How's the heart?\" \"You tell me \u2014 I'm sure you hear it better than I do.\" I felt his quiet laughter shake the bed. We sat there for a moment in silence, both listening to my heartbeat slow. I thought about having Edward in my room, with my father in the house. \"Can I have a minute to be human?\" I asked. \"Certainly.\" He gestured with one hand that I should proceed. \"Stay,\" I said, trying to look severe. \"Yes, ma'am.\" And he made a show of becoming a statue on the edge of my bed. I hopped up, grabbing my pajamas from off the floor, my bag of toiletries off the desk. I left the light off and slipped out, closing the door. I could hear the sound from the TV rising up the stairs. I banged the bathroom door loudly, so Charlie wouldn't come up to bother me. I meant to hurry. I brushed my teeth fiercely, trying to be thorough and speedy, removing all traces of lasagna. But the hot water of the shower couldn't be rushed. It unknotted the muscles in my back, calmed my pulse. The familiar smell of my shampoo made me feel like I might be the same person I had been this morning. I tried not to think of Edward, sitting in my room, waiting, because then I had to start all over with the calming process. Finally, I couldn't delay anymore. I shut off the water, toweling hastily, rushing again. I pulled on my holey t-shirt and gray sweatpants. Too late to regret not packing the Victoria's Secret silk pajamas my mother got me two birthdays ago, which still had the tags on them in a drawer somewhere back home. I rubbed the towel through my hair again, and then yanked the brush through it quickly. I threw the towel in the hamper, flung my brush and toothpaste into my bag. Then I dashed down the stairs so Charlie could see that I was in my pajamas, with wet hair. \"'Night, Dad.\" \"'Night, Bella.\" He did look startled by my appearance. Maybe that would keep him from checking on me tonight. I took the stairs two at a time, trying to be quiet, and flew into my room, closing the door tightly behind me. Edward hadn't moved a fraction of an inch, a carving of Adonis perched on my faded quilt. I smiled, and his lips twitched, the statue coming to life. His eyes appraised me, taking in the damp hair, the tattered shirt. He raised one eyebrow. \"Nice.\" I grimaced. \"No, it looks good on you.\" \"Thanks,\" I whispered. I went back to his side, sitting cross-legged beside him. I looked at the lines in the wooden floor. \"What was all that for?\" \"Charlie thinks I'm sneaking out.\" \"Oh.\" He contemplated that. \"Why?\" As if he couldn't know Charlie's mind much more clearly than I could guess. \"Apparently, I look a little overexcited.\" He lifted my chin, examining my face. \"You look very warm, actually.\" He bent his face slowly to mine, laying his cool cheek against my skin. I held perfectly still. \"Mmmmmm\u2026\" he breathed. It was very difficult, while he was touching me, to frame a coherent question. It took me a minute of scattered concentration to begin. \"It seems to be\u2026 much easier for you, now, to be close to me.\" \"Does it seem that way to you?\" he murmured, his nose gliding to the corner of my jaw. I felt his hand, lighter than a moth's wing, brushing my damp hair back, so that his lips could touch the hollow beneath my ear. \"Much, much easier,\" I said, trying to exhale. \"Hmm.\" \"So I was wondering\u2026\" I began again, but his fingers were slowly tracing my collarbone, and I lost my train of thought. \"Yes?\" he breathed. \"Why is that,\" my voice shook, embarrassing me, \"do you think?\" I felt the tremor of his breath on my neck as he laughed. \"Mind over matter.\" I pulled back; as I moved, he froze \u2014 and I could no longer hear the sound of his breathing. We stared cautiously at each other for a moment, and then, as his clenched jaw gradually relaxed, his expression became puzzled. \"Did I do something wrong?\" \"No \u2014 the opposite. You're driving me crazy,\" I explained.  He considered that briefly, and when he spoke, he sounded pleased. \"Really?\" A triumphant smile slowly lit his face. \"Would you like a round of applause?\" I asked sarcastically. He grinned. \"I'm just pleasantly surprised,\" he clarified. \"In the last hundred years or so,\" his voice was teasing, \"I never imagined anything like this. I didn't believe I would ever find someone I wanted to be with\u2026 in another way than my brothers and sisters. And then to find, even though it's all new to me, that I'm good at it\u2026 at being with you\u2026\" \"You're good at everything,\" I pointed out. He shrugged, allowing that, and we both laughed in whispers. \"But how can it be so easy now?\" I pressed. \"This afternoon\u2026\" \"It's not easy,\" he sighed. \"But this afternoon, I was still\u2026 undecided. I am sorry about that, it was unforgivable for me to behave so.\" \"Not unforgivable,\" I disagreed. \"Thank you.\" He smiled. \"You see,\" he continued, looking down now, \"I wasn't sure if I was strong enough\u2026\" He picked up one of my hands and pressed it lightly to his face. \"And while there was still that possibility that I might be\u2026 overcome\" \u2014 he breathed in the scent at my wrist \u2014 \"I was\u2026 susceptible. Until I made up my mind that I was strong enough, that there was no possibility at all that I would\u2026 that I ever could\u2026\" I'd never seen him struggle so hard for words. It was so\u2026 human. \"So there's no possibility now?\" \"Mind over matter,\" he repeated, smiling, his teeth bright even in the darkness. \"Wow, that was easy,\" I said. He threw back his head and laughed, quietly as a whisper, but still exuberantly. \"Easy for you!\" he amended, touching my nose with his fingertip. And then his face was abruptly serious. \"I'm trying,\" he whispered, his voice pained. \"If it gets to be\u2026 too much, I'm fairly sure I'll be able to leave.\" I scowled. I didn't like the talk of leaving. \"And it will be harder tomorrow,\" he continued. \"I've had the scent of you in my head all day, and I've grown amazingly desensitized. If I'm away from you for any length of time, I'll have to start over again. Not quite from scratch, though, I think.\" \"Don't go away, then,\" I responded, unable to hide the longing in my voice. \"That suits me,\" he replied, his face relaxing into a gentle smile. \"Bring on the shackles \u2014 I'm your prisoner.\" But his long hands formed manacles around my wrists as he spoke. He laughed his quiet, musical laugh. He'd laughed more tonight than I'd ever heard in all the time I'd spent with him. \"You seem more\u2026 optimistic than usual,\" I observed. \"I haven't seen you like this before.\" \"Isn't it supposed to be like this?\" He smiled. \"The glory of first love, and all that. It's incredible, isn't it, the difference between reading about something, seeing it in the pictures, and experiencing it?\" \"Very different,\" I agreed. \"More forceful than I'd imagined.\" \"For example\" \u2014 his words flowed swiftly now, I had to concentrate to catch it all \u2014 \"the emotion of jealousy. I've read about it a hundred thousand times, seen actors portray it in a thousand different plays and movies. I believed I understood that one pretty clearly. But it shocked me\u2026\" He grimaced. \"Do you remember the day that Mike asked you to the dance?\" I nodded, though I remembered that day for a different reason. \"The day you started talking to me again.\" \"I was surprised by the flare of resentment, almost fury, that I felt \u2014 I didn't recognize what it was at first. I was even more aggravated than usual that I couldn't know what you were thinking, why you refused him. Was it simply for your friend's sake? Was there someone else? I knew I had no right to care either way. I tried not to care. \"And then the line started forming,\" he chuckled. I scowled in the darkness. \"I waited, unreasonably anxious to hear what you would say to them, to watch your expressions. I couldn't deny the relief I felt, watching the annoyance on your face. But I couldn't be sure. \"That was the first night I came here. I wrestled all night, while watching you sleep, with the chasm between what I knew was right, moral, ethical, and what I wanted. I knew that if I continued to ignore you as I should, or if I left for a few years, till you were gone, that someday you would say yes to Mike, or someone like him. It made me angry. \"And then,\" he whispered, \"as you were sleeping, you said my name. You spoke so clearly, at first I thought you'd woken. But you rolled over restlessly and mumbled my name once more, and sighed. The feeling that coursed through me then was unnerving, staggering. And I knew I couldn't ignore you any longer.\" He was silent for a moment, probably listening to the suddenly uneven pounding of my heart. \"But jealousy\u2026 it's a strange thing. So much more powerful than I would have thought. And irrational! Just now, when Charlie asked you about that vile Mike Newton\u2026\" He shook his head angrily. \"I should have known you'd be listening,\" I groaned. \"Of course.\" \"That made you feel jealous, though, really?\" \"I'm new at this; you're resurrecting the human in me, and everything feels stronger because it's fresh.\" \"But honestly,\" I teased, \"for that to bother you, after I have to hear that Rosalie \u2014 Rosalie, the incarnation of pure beauty, Rosalie \u2014 was meant for you. Emmett or no Emmett, how can I compete with that?\" \"There's no competition.\" His teeth gleamed. He drew my trapped hands around his back, holding me to his chest. I kept as still as I could, even breathing with caution. \"I know there's no competition,\" I mumbled into his cold skin. \"That's the problem.\" \"Of course Rosalie is beautiful in her way, but even if she wasn't like a sister to me, even if Emmett didn't belong with her, she could never have one tenth, no, one hundredth of the attraction you hold for me.\" He was serious now, thoughtful. \"For almost ninety years I've walked among my kind, and yours\u2026 all the time thinking I was complete in myself, not realizing what I was seeking. And not finding anything, because you weren't alive yet.\" \"It hardly seems fair,\" I whispered, my face still resting on his chest, listening to his breath come and go. \"I haven't had to wait at all. Why should I get off so easily?\" \"You're right,\" he agreed with amusement. \"I should make this harder for you, definitely.\" He freed one of his hands, released my wrist, only to gather it carefully into his other hand. He stroked my wet hair softly, from the top of my head to my waist. \"You only have to risk your life every second you spend with me, that's surely not much. You only have to turn your back on nature, on humanity\u2026 what's that worth?\" \"Very little \u2014 I don't feel deprived of anything.\" \"Not yet.\" And his voice was abruptly full of ancient grief. I tried to pull back, to look in his face, but his hand locked my wrists in an unbreakable hold. \"What \u2014\" I started to ask, when his body became alert. I froze, but he suddenly released my hands, and disappeared. I narrowly avoided falling on my face. \"Lie down!\" he hissed. I couldn't tell where he spoke from in the darkness. I rolled under my quilt, balling up on my side, the way I usually slept. I heard the door crack open, as Charlie peeked in to make sure I was where I was supposed to be. I breathed evenly, exaggerating the movement. A long minute passed. I listened, not sure if I'd heard the door close. Then Edward's cool arm was around me, under the covers, his lips at my ear. \"You are a terrible actress \u2014 I'd say that career path is out for you.\" \"Darn it,\" I muttered. My heart was crashing in my chest. He hummed a melody I didn't recognize; it sounded like a lullaby. He paused. \"Should I sing you to sleep?\" \"Right,\" I laughed. \"Like I could sleep with you here!\" \"You do it all the time,\" he reminded me. \"But I didn't know you were here,\" I replied icily. \"So if you don't want to sleep\u2026\" he suggested, ignoring my tone. My breath caught. \"If I don't want to sleep\u2026 ?\" He chuckled. \"What do you want to do then?\" I couldn't answer at first. \"I'm not sure,\" I finally said. \"Tell me when you decide.\" I could feel his cool breath on my neck, feel his nose sliding along my jaw, inhaling. \"I thought you were desensitized.\" \"Just because I'm resisting the wine doesn't mean I can't appreciate the bouquet,\" he whispered. \"You have a very floral smell, like lavender\u2026 or freesia,\" he noted. \"It's mouthwatering.\" \"Yeah, it's an off day when I don't get somebody telling me how edible I smell.\" He chuckled, and then sighed. \"I've decided what I want to do,\" I told him. \"I want to hear more about you.\" \"Ask me anything.\" I sifted through my questions for the most vital. \"Why do you do it?\" I said. \"I still don't understand how you can work so hard to resist what you\u2026 are. Please don't misunderstand, of course I'm glad that you do. I just don't see why you would bother in the first place.\" He hesitated before answering. \"That's a good question, and you are not the first one to ask it. The others \u2014 the majority of our kind who are quite content with our lot \u2014 they, too, wonder at how we live. But you see, just because we've been\u2026 dealt a certain hand\u2026 it doesn't mean that we can't choose to rise above \u2014 to conquer the boundaries of a destiny that none of us wanted. To try to retain whatever essential humanity we can.\" I lay unmoving, locked in awed silence. \"Did you fall asleep?\" he whispered after a few minutes. \"No.\" \"Is that all you were curious about?\" I rolled my eyes. \"Not quite.\" \"What else do you want to know?\" \"Why can you read minds \u2014 why only you? And Alice, seeing the future\u2026 why does that happen?\" I felt him shrug in the darkness. \"We don't really know. Carlisle has a theory\u2026 he believes that we all bring something of our strongest human traits with us into the next life, where they are intensified \u2014 like our minds, and our senses. He thinks that I must have already been very sensitive to the thoughts of those around me. And that Alice had some precognition, wherever she was.\" \"What did he bring into the next life, and the others?\" \"Carlisle brought his compassion. Esme brought her ability to love passionately. Emmett brought his strength, Rosalie her\u2026 tenacity. Or you could call it pigheadedness.\" he chuckled. \"Jasper is very interesting. He was quite charismatic in his first life, able to influence those around him to see things his way. Now he is able to manipulate the emotions of those around him \u2014 calm down a room of angry people, for example, or excite a <em>lethargic</em> crowd, conversely. It's a very subtle gift.\" I considered the impossibilities he described, trying to take it in. He waited patiently while I thought. \"So where did it all start? I mean, Carlisle changed you, and then someone must have changed him, and so on\u2026\" \"Well, where did you come from? Evolution? Creation? Couldn't we have evolved in the same way as other species, predator and prey? Or, if you don't believe that all this world could have just happened on its own, which is hard for me to accept myself, is it so hard to believe that the same force that created the delicate angelfish with the shark, the baby seal and the killer whale, could create both our kinds together?\" \"Let me get this straight \u2014 I'm the baby seal, right?\" \"Right.\" He laughed, and something touched my hair \u2014 his lips? I wanted to turn toward him, to see if it was really his lips against my hair. But I had to be good; I didn't want to make this any harder for him than it already was. \"Are you ready to sleep?\" he asked, interrupting the short silence. \"Or do you have any more questions?\" \"Only a million or two.\" \"We have tomorrow, and the next day, and the next\u2026\" he reminded me. I smiled, euphoric at the thought.  \"Are you sure you won't vanish in the morning?\" I wanted this to be certain. \"You are mythical, after all.\" \"I won't leave you.\" His voice had the seal of a promise in it. \"One more, then, tonight\u2026\" And I blushed. The darkness was no help \u2014 I'm sure he could feel the sudden warmth under my skin. \"What is it?\" \"No, forget it. I changed my mind.\" \"Bella, you can ask me anything.\" I didn't answer, and he groaned. \"I keep thinking it will get less frustrating, not hearing your thoughts. But it just gets worse and worse.\" \"I'm glad you can't read my thoughts. It's bad enough that you eavesdrop on my sleep-talking.\" \"Please?\" His voice was so persuasive, so impossible to resist. I shook my head. \"If you don't tell me, I'll just assume it's something much worse than it is,\" he threatened darkly. \"Please?\" Again, that pleading voice. \"Well,\" I began, glad that he couldn't see my face. \"Yes?\" \"You said that Rosalie and Emmett will get married soon\u2026 Is that\u2026 marriage\u2026 the same as it is for humans?\" He laughed in earnest now, understanding. \"Is that what you're getting at?\" I fidgeted, unable to answer. \"Yes, I suppose it is much the same,\" he said. \"I told you, most of those human desires are there, just hidden behind more powerful desires.\" \"Oh,\" was all I could say. \"Was there a purpose behind your curiosity?\" \"Well, I did wonder\u2026 about you and me\u2026 someday\u2026\" He was instantly serious, I could tell by the sudden stillness of his body. I froze, too, reacting automatically. \"I don't think that\u2026 that\u2026 would be possible for us.\" \"Because it would be too hard for you, if I were that\u2026 close?\" \"That's certainly a problem. But that's not what I was thinking of. It's just that you are so soft, so fragile. I have to mind my actions every moment that we're together so that I don't hurt you. I could kill you quite easily, Bella, simply by accident.\" His voice had become just a soft murmur. He moved his icy palm to rest it against my cheek. \"If I was too hasty\u2026 if for one second I wasn't paying enough attention, I could reach out, meaning to touch your face, and crush your skull by mistake. You don't realize how incredibly breakable you are. I can never, never afford to lose any kind of control when I'm with you.\" He waited for me to respond, growing anxious when I didn't. \"Are you scared?\" he asked. I waited for a minute to answer, so the words would be true. \"No. I'm fine.\" He seemed to deliberate for a moment. \"I'm curious now, though,\" he said, his voice light again. \"Have you ever\u2026 ?\" He trailed off suggestively. \"Of course not.\" I flushed. \"I told you I've never felt like this about anyone before, not even close.\" \"I know. It's just that I know other people's thoughts. I know love and lust don't always keep the same company.\" \"They do for me. Now, anyway, that they exist for me at all,\" I sighed. \"That's nice. We have that one thing in common, at least.\" He sounded satisfied. \"Your human instincts\u2026\" I began. He waited. \"Well, do you find me attractive, in that way, at all?\" He laughed and lightly rumpled my nearly dry hair.  \"I may not be a human, but I am a man,\" he assured me. I yawned involuntarily. \"I've answered your questions, now you should sleep,\" he insisted. \"I'm not sure if I can.\" \"Do you want me to leave?\" \"No!\" I said too loudly. He laughed, and then began to hum that same, unfamiliar lullaby; the voice of an archangel, soft in my ear. More tired than I realized, exhausted from the long day of mental and emotional stress like I'd never felt before, I drifted to sleep in his cold arms.",
