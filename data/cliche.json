Then again, any serious\u00a0review of the creativity research literature\u00a0and\u00a0the history of creativity\u00a0suggests that the very definition of creativity has evolved in rather creative ways. Particularly in business innovation, creativity, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder. Your creative solution may be my <em>cliche</em>.
