            "en": "Omega-3: The good fat Doctors may tell you to cut the fat, but not all fats are unhealthy. Omega-3 fatty acids may have far-reaching health benefits. Studies suggest they help lower the risk of heart disease, the nation\u2019s top killer. They may also protect against symptoms of depression, dementia, cancer, and arthritis. Omega-3s are found in salmon, nuts, leafy greens, and more \u2013 but the health benefits can differ greatly from one source to another. The Omega-3 alphabet Omega-3 fatty acids come in more than one form. The types found in fish, called DHA and EPA, appear to have the strongest health benefits. Another form known as ALA is found in vegetable oils, flaxseed, walnuts, and dark leafy vegetables such as spinach. The body converts a small amount of ALA into EPA and DHA, and ALA also has some health benefits of its own. How Omega-3 fights disease Omega-3 fatty acids are believed to help fight disease by reducing inflammation in the blood vessels, joints, and elsewhere in the body. They also decrease the risk for an abnormal heart rhythm, reduce levels of unhealthy fats in the bloodstream, and slow the rate of plaque build-up in the blood vessels. Our bodies can\u2019t make omega-3s, so we must get them from our diet. Omega-3 and heart deaths If you\u2019ve had a previous heart attack, omega-3 fatty acids may help lower the risk of death from heart disease. Studies show a reduction in heart attacks and sudden death among heart attack survivors who boost their levels of omega-3s. This includes people who take fish oil supplements and those who regularly eat fatty fish, such as salmon or lake trout. Omega-3 and arrhythmias Omega-3s seem to have a stabilizing effect on the heart. They can lower heart rate and reduce the risk of life-threatening arrhythmias or abnormal heart rhythms. Several common sources of omega-3s are shown here: fish, walnuts, broccoli, and edamame, green soy beans that are often steamed and served in the pod. Omega-3 and triglycerides Omega-3s can lower your level of triglycerides, a type of blood fat that\u2019s linked to heart disease. Triglycerides collect in the bloodstream and in the body's fat cells (seen here). Unfortunately, omega-3s increase cholesterol \u2013 both the \u201cgood\u201d (HDL) and \u201cbad\u201d (LDL) kind. People with high triglycerides should consult with their doctors before taking omega-3. Eating more omega-3-rich fish is generally safe. Omega-3 and high blood pressure There\u2019s strong evidence that omega-3s lower blood pressure. The effect is small, though. If you have high blood pressure, eating fish could be helpful along with other dietary changes and medications, as recommended by your doctor. One strategy is to replace red meat with fish during some meals. But it\u2019s best to avoid salty fish, such as smoked salmon. Omega-3 and stroke The evidence is mixed on whether omega-3 can help prevent strokes. It curbs plaque build-up inside blood vessels and has anti-clotting effects, so it may help prevent ischemic strokes, the type caused by clots or a blockage in the arteries. At very high doses, omega-3 supplements might increase the risk of hemorrhagic strokes, the less common type that involves bleeding in the brain. Omega-3 and rheumatoid arthritis Studies suggest omega-3s can reduce symptoms such as joint pain and stiffness in people with rheumatoid arthritis. A diet high in omega-3s may also boost the effectiveness of anti-inflammatory drugs. Omega-3 and depression Omega-3 fatty acids may help smooth out mood disorders and make antidepressants more effective. However, results of studies have been mixed so far. Countries with higher levels of omega-3 in the typical diet have lower levels of depression. Although more studies are needed, the evidence so far is promising. Omega-3 and ADHD Some studies suggest omega-3 supplements may ease the symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We know omega-3 fatty acids are important in brain development and function. Although evidence isn\u2019t conclusive and a diet supplement can\u2019t offer a cure-all for ADHD, omega-3s may provide some added benefits to traditional treatment. Omega-3 and dementia The jury is still out, but there\u2019s some evidence that omega-3s may protect against dementia and improve mental function. In one study, older people with a diet high in omega-3 fatty acids had a lower risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease. More research is necessary to confirm the link. Omega-3 and cancer Omega-3s may help reduce the risk of colon cancer, breast cancer, and advanced prostate cancer, but more research is needed. The American Cancer Society recommends a diet that includes fish, but the organization stops short of endorsing omega-3 supplements for cancer prevention. Omega-3 and children Be wary of promises that omega-3s have \u201cbrain-boosting\u201d powers for children. The Federal Trade Commission asked companies to stop that claim unless they can prove it scientifically. The American Academy of Pediatrics does recommend that kids eat more fish, as long as it\u2019s not breaded and fried. Pediatricians also caution against types of fish that are high in mercury, such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish. Source of Omega-3: Fish  The best source of omega-3 fatty acids is fish, though some varieties deliver a higher dose than others. Top choices are salmon, mackerel, herring, lake trout, sardines, anchovies, and tuna. The American Heart Association recommends at least two servings a week of fish.  Omega-3 and tuna Tuna is an old-school staple in many people's pantries that can be a good source of omega-3. Albacore tuna has more omega-3 than canned light tuna, but it also has a higher concentration of mercury contamination. The amount of omega-3 in a fresh tuna steak varies, depending on the species. Dangers of contaminated fish For most people, mercury in fish is not a health concern. But the FDA has this advice for pregnant women, nursing mothers, and young children: * Limit Albacore tuna.  * Limit fish in mercury.  * Avoid shark, swordfish, king mackerel, tilefish.  * Remove skin and fat before cooking fish. Omega-3 supplements If you don\u2019t like fish, you can get omega-3 from supplements. One gram per day is the amount recommended for people with cardiovascular disease. At high levels, omega-3 can increase the risk of bleeding and may interfere with some medications. Fish oil also may deplete vitamin E, so some supplements include vitamin E. Be sure to consult your doctor before taking omega-3 supplements.  Omega-3 for vegetarians If you don\u2019t eat fish or fish oil, you can get a dose of DHA from algae supplements. Algae that is commercially grown is generally considered safe, though blue-green algae in the wild can contain toxins. Vegetarians also can get the ALA of omega-3 from foods such as canola oil, flaxseed, walnuts, broccoli, and spinach \u2013 or products fortified with omega-3s. Avoiding the Omega-3 hype Many food products now boast that they have added omega-3 to support various aspects of your health. But be aware that the amount of omega-3 they contain may be minimal. They may contain the ALA form of omega-3, which hasn\u2019t yet shown the same health benefits as EPA and DHA. For a measured dose of omega-3, taking fish oil supplements may be more reliable. Omega 6: The other healthy fat There\u2019s another healthy fat known as Omega-6. Research suggests it may protect against heart disease, especially when eaten in place of less healthy fats. The <em>AHA</em> recommends getting up to 10% of your total daily calories from omega-6 fats, which are found in vegetable oils and nuts. And now for some good news \u2013 most Americans already get enough omega-6 in their diet, thanks to cooking oils and salad dressings. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0",

            "en": "THE LAW OF LIFE \u2013 JACK LONDON      The old Indian was sitting on the snow. It was Koskoosh, former chief of his tribe. Now, all he could do was sit and listen to the others. His eyes were old. He could not see, but his ears were wide open to every sound. \u201c<em>Aha</em>.\u201d That was the sound of his daughter, Sit-cum-to-ha. She was beating the dogs, trying to make them stand in front of the snow sleds. He was forgotten by her, and by the others, too. They had to look for new hunting grounds. The long, snowy ride waited. The days of the northlands were growing short. The tribe could not wait for death. Koskoosh was dying. The stiff, crackling noises of frozen animal skins told him that the chief\u2019s tent was being torn down. The chief was a mighty hunter. He was his son, the son of Koskoosh. Koskoosh was being left to die. As the women worked, old Koskoosh could hear his son\u2019s voice drive them to work faster. He listened harder. It was the last time he would hear that voice. A child cried, and a woman sang softly to quiet it. The child was Koo-tee, the old man thought, a sickly child. It would die soon, and they would burn a hole in the frozen ground to bury it. They would cover its small body with stones to keep the wolves away. \u201cWell, what of it? A few years, and in the end, death. Death waited ever hungry. Death had the hungriest stomach of all.\u201d Koskoosh listened to other sounds he would hear no more: the men tying strong leather rope around the sleds to hold their belongings; the sharp sounds of leather whips, ordering the dogs to move and pull the sleds. \u201cListen to the dogs cry. How they hated the work.\u201d They were off. Sled after sled moved slowly away into the silence. They had passed out of his life. He must meet his last hour alone. \u201cBut what was that?\u201d The snow packed down hard under someone\u2019s shoes. A man stood beside him, and placed a hand gently on his old head. His son was good to do this. He remembered other old men whose sons had not done this, who had left without a goodbye. His mind traveled into the past until his son\u2019s voice brought him back. \u201cIt is well with you?\u201d his son asked. And the old man answered, \u201cIt is well.\u201d \u201cThere is wood next to you and the fire burns bright,\u201d the son said. \u201cThe morning is gray and the cold is here. It will snow soon. Even now it is snowing. Ahh, even now it is snowing. \u201cThe tribesmen hurry. Their loads are heavy and their stomachs flat from little food. The way is long and they travel fast. I go now. All is well?\u201d \u201cIt is well. I am as last year\u2019s leaf that sticks to the tree. The first breath that blows will knock me to the ground. My voice is like an old woman\u2019s. My eyes no longer show me the way my feet go. I am tired and all is well.\u201d He lowered his head to his chest and listened to the snow as his son rode away. He felt the sticks of wood next to him again. One by one, the fire would eat them. And step by step, death would cover him. When the last stick was gone, the cold would come. First, his feet would freeze. Then, his hands. The cold would travel slowly from the outside to the inside of him, and he would rest. It was easy\u2026all men must die. He felt sorrow, but he did not think of his sorrow. It was the way of life. He had lived close to the earth, and the law was not new to him. It was the law of the body. Nature was not kind to the body. She was not thoughtful of the person alone. She was interested only in the group, the race, the species. This was a deep thought for old Koskoosh. He had seen examples of it in all his life. The tree sap in early spring; the new-born green leaf, soft and fresh as skin; the fall of the yellowed, dry leaf. In this alone was all history. He placed another stick on the fire and began to remember his past. He had been a great chief, too. He had seen days of much food and laughter; fat stomachs when food was left to rot and spoil; times when they left animals alone, unkilled; days when women had many children. And he had seen days of no food and empty stomachs, days when the fish did not come, and the animals were hard to find. For seven years the animals did not come. Then, he remembered when as a small boy how he watched the wolves kill a moose. He was with his friend Zing-ha, who was killed later in the Yukon River. Ah, but the moose. Zing-ha and he had gone out to play that day. Down by the river they saw fresh steps of a big, heavy moose. \u201cHe\u2019s an old one,\u201d Zing-ha had said. \u201cHe cannot run like the others. He has fallen behind. The wolves have separated him from the others. They will never leave him.\u201d And so it was. By day and night, never stopping, biting at his nose, biting at his feet, the wolves stayed with him until the end. Zing-ha and he had felt the blood quicken in their bodies. The end would be a sight to see. They had followed the steps of the moose and the wolves. Each step told a different story. They could see the tragedy as it happened: here was the place the moose stopped to fight. The snow was packed down for many feet. One wolf had been caught by the heavy feet of the moose and kicked to death. Further on, they saw how the moose had struggled to escape up a hill. But the wolves had attacked from behind. The moose had fallen down and crushed two wolves. Yet, it was clear the end was near. The snow was red ahead of them. Then they heard the sounds of battle. He and Zing-ha moved closer, on their stomachs, so the wolves would not see them. They saw the end. The picture was so strong it had stayed with him all his life. His dull, blind eyes saw the end again as they had in the far off past. For long, his mind saw his past. The fire began to die out, and the cold entered his body. He placed two more sticks on it, just two more left. This would be how long he would live. It was very lonely. He placed one of the last pieces of wood on the fire. Listen, what a strange noise for wood to make in the fire. No, it wasn\u2019t wood. His body shook as he recognized the sound\u2026wolves. The cry of a wolf brought the picture of the old moose back to him again. He saw the body torn to pieces, with fresh blood running on the snow. He saw the clean bones lying gray against the frozen blood. He saw the rushing forms of the gray wolves, their shinning eyes, their long wet tongues and sharp teeth. And he saw them form a circle and move ever slowly closer and closer. A cold, wet nose touched his face. At the touch, his soul jumped forward to awaken him. His hand went to the fire and he pulled a burning stick from it. The wolf saw the fire, but was not afraid. It turned and howled into the air to his brother wolves. They answered with hunger in their throats, and came running. The old Indian listened to the hungry wolves. He heard them form a circle around him and his small fire. He waved his burning stick at them, but they did not move away. Now, one of them moved closer, slowly, as if to test the old man\u2019s strength. Another and another followed. The circle grew smaller and smaller. Not one wolf stayed behind. Why should he fight? Why cling to life? And he dropped his stick with the fire on the end of it. It fell in the snow and the light went out. The circle of wolves moved closer. Once again the old Indian saw the picture of the moose as it struggled before the end came. He dropped his head to his knees. What did it matter after all? Isn\u2019t this the law of life?",
