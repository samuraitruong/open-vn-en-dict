UNHAPPY ENDING Rosalie hesitated in the doorway, her breathtaking face unsure. \u201cOf course,\u201d I replied, my voice an octave high with surprise. \u201cCome on in.\u201d I sat up, sliding to the end of the sofa to make room. My stomach twisted nervously as the one Cullen who did not like me moved silently to sit down in the open space. I tried to come up with a reason why she would want to see me, but my mind was a blank on that point. \u201cDo you mind talking to me for a few minutes?\u201d she asked. \u201cI didn\u2019t wake you or anything, did I?\u201d Her eyes shifted to the stripped bed and back to my couch. \u201cNo, I was awake. Sure, we can talk.\u201d I wondered if she could hear the alarm in my voice as clearly as I could. She laughed lightly, and it sounded like a chorus of bells. \u201cHe so rarely leaves you alone,\u201d she said. \u201cI figured I\u2019d better make the best of this opportunity.\u201d What did she want to say that couldn\u2019t be said in front of Edward? My hands twisted and untwisted around the edge of the comforter. \u201cPlease don\u2019t think I\u2019m horribly interfering,\u201d Rosalie said, her voice gentle and almost pleading. She folded her hands in her lap and looked down at them as she spoke. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ve hurt your feelings enough in the past, and I don\u2019t want to do that again.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Rosalie. My feelings are great. What is it?\u201d She laughed again, sounding oddly embarrassed. \u201cI\u2019m going to try to tell you why I think you should stay human \u2014 why I would stay human if I were you.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d She smiled at the shocked tone of my voice, and then she sighed. \u201cDid Edward ever tell you what led to this?\u201d she asked, gesturing to her glorious immortal body. I nodded slowly, suddenly somber. \u201cHe said it was close to what happened to me that time in Port Angeles, only no one was there to save you .\u201d I shuddered at the memory. \u201cIs that really all he told you?\u201d she asked. \u201cYes,\u201d I said, my voice blank with confusion. \u201cWas there more?\u201d She looked up at me and smiled; it was a harsh, bitter \u2014 but still stunning \u2014 expression. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was more.\u201d I waited while she stared out the window. She seemed to be trying to calm herself. \u201cWould you like to hear my story, Bella? It doesn\u2019t have a happy ending \u2014 but which of ours does? If we had happy endings, we\u2019d all be under gravestones now.\u201d I nodded, though I was frightened by the edge in her voice. \u201cI lived in a different world than you do, Bella. My human world was a much simpler place. It was nineteen thirty-three. I was eighteen, and I was beautiful. My life was perfect.\u201d She stared out the window at the silver clouds, her expression far away. \u201cMy parents were thoroughly middle class. My father had a stable job in a bank, something I realize now that he was smug about \u2014 he saw his prosperity as a reward for talent and hard work, rather than acknowledging the luck involved. I took it all for granted then; in my home, it was as if the Great Depression was only a troublesome rumor. Of course I saw the poor people, the ones who weren\u2019t as lucky. My father left me with the impression that they\u2019d brought their troubles on themselves.  \u00a0\u201cIt was my mother\u2019s job to keep our house \u2014 and myself and my two younger brothers \u2014 in spotless order. It was clear that I was both her first priority and her favorite. I didn\u2019t fully understand at the time, but I was always vaguely aware that my parents weren\u2019t satisfied with what they had, even if it was so much more than most. They wanted more. They had social aspirations \u2014 social climbers, I suppose you could call them. My beauty was like a gift to them. They saw so much more potential in it than I did.  \u00a0\u201cThey weren\u2019t satisfied, but I was. I was thrilled to be me, to be Rosalie Hale. Pleased that men\u2019s eyes watched me everywhere I went, from the year I turned twelve. Delighted that my girlfriends sighed with envy when they touched my hair. Happy that my mother was proud of me and that my father liked to buy me pretty dresses.  \u00a0\u201cI knew what I wanted out of life, and there didn\u2019t seem to be any way that I wouldn\u2019t get exactly what I wanted. I wanted to be loved, to be adored. I wanted to have a huge, flowery wedding, where everyone in town would watch me walk down the aisle on my father\u2019s arm and think I was the most beautiful thing they\u2019d ever seen. Admiration was like air to me, Bella. I was silly and shallow, but I was content.\u201d She smiled, amused at her own evaluation. \u00a0\u201cMy parents\u2019 influence had been such that I also wanted the material things of life. I wanted a big house with elegant furnishings that someone else would clean and a modern kitchen that someone else would cook in. As I said, shallow. Young and very shallow. And I didn\u2019t see any reason why I wouldn\u2019t get these things. \u00a0\u201cThere were a few things I wanted that were more meaningful. One thing in particular. My very closest friend was a girl named Vera. She married young, just seventeen. She married a man my parents would never have considered for me \u2014 a carpenter. A year later she had a son, a beautiful little boy with dimples and curly black hair. It was the first time I\u2019d ever felt truly jealous of anyone else in my entire life.\u201d She looked at me with unfathomable eyes. \u201cIt was a different time. I was the same age as you, but I was ready for it all. I yearned for my own little baby. I wanted my own house and a husband who would kiss me when he got home from work \u2014 just like Vera. Only I had a very different kind of house in mind. . .\u201d It was hard for me to imagine the world that Rosalie had known. Her story sounded more like a fairy tale than history to me. With a slight shock, I realized that this was very close to the world that Edward would have experienced when he was human, the world he had grown up in. I wondered \u2014 while Rosalie sat silent for a moment \u2014 if my world seemed as baffling to him as Rosalie\u2019s did to me? Rosalie sighed, and when she spoke again her voice was different, the wistfulness gone. \u201cIn Rochester, there was one royal family \u2014 the Kings, ironically enough. Royce King owned the bank my father worked at, and nearly every other really profitable business in town. That\u2019s how his son, Royce King the Second\u201d \u2014 her mouth twisted around the name, it came out through her teeth \u2014 \u201csaw me the first time. He was going to take over at the bank, and so he began overseeing the different \u00a0positions. Two days later, my mother conveniently forgot to send my father\u2019s lunch to work with him. I remember being confused when she insisted that I wear my white organza and roll my hair up just to run over to the bank.\u201d Rosalie laughed without humor. \u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t notice Royce watching me particularly. Everyone watched me. But that night the first of the\u00a0 roses came. Every night of our courtship, he sent a bouquet of roses to me. My room was always overflowing with them. It got to the point that I would smell like roses when I left the house. \u201cRoyce was handsome, too. He had lighter hair than I did, and pale blue eyes. He said my eyes were like violets, and then those started showing up alongside the roses. \u00a0\u201cMy parents approved \u2014 that\u2019s putting it mildly. This was everything they\u2019d dreamed of. And Royce seemed to be everything I\u2019d dreamed of. The fairy tale prince, come to make me a princess. Everything I wanted, yet it was still no more than I expected. We were engaged before I\u2019d known him for two months. \u00a0\u201cWe didn\u2019t spend a great deal of time alone with each other. Royce told me he had many responsibilities at work, and, when we were together, he liked people to look at us, to see me on his arm. I liked that, too. There were lots of parties, dancing, and pretty dresses. When you were a King, every door was open for you, every red carpet rolled out to greet you. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a long engagement. Plans went ahead for the most lavish wedding. It was going to be everything I\u2019d ever wanted. I was completely happy. When I called at Vera\u2019s, I no longer felt jealous. I pictured my fair-haired children playing on the huge lawns of the Kings\u2019 estate, and I pitied her.\u201d Rosalie broke off suddenly, clenching her teeth together. It pulled me out of her story, and I realized that the horror was not far off. There would be no happy ending, as she\u2019d promised. I wondered if this was why she had so much more bitterness in her than the rest of them \u2014 because she\u2019d been within reach of everything she\u2019d wanted when her human life was cut short. \u201cI was at Vera\u2019s that night,\u201d Rosalie whispered. Her face was smooth as marble, and as hard. \u201cHer little Henry really was adorable, all smiles and dimples \u2014 he was just sitting up on his own. Vera walked me to the door as I was leaving, her baby in her arms and her husband at her side, his arm around her waist. He kissed her on the cheek when he thought I wasn\u2019t looking. That bothered me. When Royce kissed me, it wasn\u2019t quite the same \u2014 not so sweet somehow. . . . I shoved that thought aside. Royce was my prince. Someday, I would be queen.\u201d It was hard to tell in the moonlight, but it looked like her bone white face got paler. \u201cIt was dark in the streets, the lamps already on. I hadn\u2019t realized how late it was.\u201d  She continued to whisper almost inaudibly. \u201cIt was cold, too. Very cold for late April. The wedding was only a week away, and I was worrying about the weather as I hurried home \u2014 I can remember that clearly. I remember every detail about that night. I clung to it so hard . . . in the beginning. I thought of nothing else. And so I remember this, when so many pleasant memories have faded away completely. . . .\u201d She sighed, and began whispering again. \u201cYes, I was worrying about the weather. . . . I didn\u2019t want to have to move the wedding indoors. . . . \u201cI was a few streets from my house when I heard them. A cluster of men under a broken streetlamp, laughing too loud. Drunk. I wished I\u2019d called my father to escort me home, but the way was so short, it seemed silly. And then he called my name. \u00a0\u201c\u2018Rose!\u2019 he yelled, and the others laughed stupidly. \u201cI hadn\u2019t realized the drunks were so well dressed. It was Royce and some of his friends, sons of other rich men. \u201c\u2018Here\u2019s my Rose!\u2019 Royce shouted, laughing with them, sounding just as stupid. \u2018You\u2019re late. We\u2019re cold, you\u2019ve kept us waiting so long.\u2019\u201d \u201cI\u2019d never seen him drink before. A toast, now and then, at a party. He\u2019d told me he didn\u2019t like champagne. I hadn\u2019t realized that he preferred something much stronger. \u00a0\u201cHe had a new friend \u2014 the friend of a friend, come up from Atlanta. \u201c\u2018What did I tell you, John,\u2019 Royce crowed, grabbing my arm and pulling me closer. \u2018Isn\u2019t she lovelier than all your Georgia peaches?\u2019 \u201cThe man named John was dark-haired and suntanned. He looked me over like I was a horse he was buying. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s hard to tell,\u2019 he drawled slowly. \u2018She\u2019s all covered up.\u2019 \u201cThey laughed, Royce like the rest. \u00a0\u201cSuddenly, Royce ripped my jacket from my shoulders \u2014 it was a gift from him \u2014 popping the brass buttons off. They scattered all over the street. \u201c\u2018Show him what you look like, Rose!\u2019 He laughed again and then he tore my hat out of my hair. The pins wrenched my hair from the roots, and I cried out in pain. They seemed to enjoy that \u2014 the sound of my pain. . . .\u201d Rosalie looked at me suddenly, as if she\u2019d forgotten I was there. I was sure my face was as white as hers. Unless it was green. \u201cI won\u2019t make you listen to the rest,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cThey left me in the street, still laughing as they stumbled away. They thought I was dead. They were teasing Royce that he would have to find a new bride. He laughed and said he\u2019d have to learn some patience first. \u00a0\u201cI waited in the road to die. It was cold, though there was so much pain that I was surprised it bothered me. It started to snow, and I wondered why I wasn\u2019t dying. I was impatient for death to come, to end the pain. It was taking so long. . . . \u00a0\u201cCarlisle found me then. He\u2019d smelled the blood, and come to investigate. I remember being vaguely irritated as he worked over me, trying to save my life. I\u2019d never liked Dr. Cullen or his wife and her brother \u2014 as Edward pretended to be then. It had upset me that they were all more beautiful than I was, especially that the men were. But they didn\u2019t mingle in society, so I\u2019d only seen them once or twice. \u00a0\u201cI thought I\u2019d died when he pulled me from the ground and ran with me \u2014 because of the speed \u2014 it felt like I was flying. I remembered being horrified that the pain didn\u2019t stop. . . . \u00a0\u201cThen I was in a bright room, and it was warm. I was slipping away, and I was grateful as the pain began to dull. But suddenly something sharp was cutting me, my throat, my wrists, my ankles. I screamed in shock, thinking he\u2019d brought me there to hurt me more. Then fire started burning through me, and I didn\u2019t care about anything else. I begged him to kill me. When Esme and Edward returned home, I begged them to kill me, too. Carlisle sat with me. He held my hand and said that he was so sorry, promising that it would end. He told me everything, and sometimes I listened. He told me what he was, what I was becoming. I didn\u2019t believe him. He apologized each time I screamed. \u00a0\u201cEdward wasn\u2019t happy. I remember hearing them discuss me. I stopped screaming sometimes. It did no good to scream. \u201c\u2018What were you thinking, Carlisle?\u2019 Edward said. \u2018Rosalie Hale?\u2019\u201d Rosalie imitated Edward\u2019s irritated tone to perfection. \u201cI didn\u2019t like the way he said my name, like there was something wrong with me. \u201c\u2018I couldn\u2019t just let her die,\u2019 Carlisle said quietly. \u2018It was too much \u2014 too horrible, too much waste.\u2019 \u00a0\u201c\u2018I know,\u2019 Edward said, and I thought he sounded dismissive. It angered me. I didn\u2019t know then that he really could see exactly what Carlisle had seen. \u201c\u2018It was too much waste. I couldn\u2019t leave her,\u2019 Carlisle repeated in a whisper. \u201c\u2018Of course you couldn\u2019t,\u2019 Esme agreed. \u201c\u2018People die all the time,\u2019 Edward reminded him in a hard voice. \u2018Don\u2019t you think she\u2019s just a little recognizable, though? The Kings will have to put up a huge search \u2014 not that anyone suspects the <em>fiend</em>,\u2019 he growled. \u00a0\u201cIt pleased me that they seemed to know that Royce was guilty. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize that it was almost over \u2014 that I was getting stronger and that was why I was able to concentrate on what they were saying. The pain was beginning to fade from my fingertips. \u201c\u2018What are we going to do with her?\u2019 Edward said disgustedly \u2014 or that\u2019s how it sounded to me, at least. \u00a0\u201cCarlisle sighed. \u2018That\u2019s up to her, of course. She may want to go her own way.\u2019 \u201cI\u2019d believed enough of what he\u2019d told me that his words terrified me. I knew that my life was ended, and there was no going back for me. I couldn\u2019t stand the thought of being alone. . . . \u201cThe pain finally ended and they explained to me again what I was. This time I believed. I felt the thirst, my hard skin; I saw my brilliant red eyes. \u201cShallow as I was, I felt better when I saw my reflection in the mirror the first time. Despite the eyes, I was the most beautiful thing I\u2019d ever seen.\u201d She laughed at herself for a moment. \u201cIt took some time before I began to blame the beauty for what had happened to me \u2014 for me to see the curse of it. To wish that I had been . . . well, not ugly, but normal. Like Vera. So I could have been allowed to marry someone who loved me, and have pretty babies. That\u2019s what I\u2019d really wanted, all along. It still doesn\u2019t seem like too much to have asked for.\u201d She was thoughtful for a moment, and I wondered if she\u2019d forgotten my presence again. But then she smiled at me, her expression suddenly triumphant. \u201cYou know, my record is almost as clean as Carlisle\u2019s,\u201d she told me. \u201cBetter than Esme. A thousand times better than Edward. I\u2019ve never tasted human blood,\u201d she announced proudly. She understood my puzzled expression as I wondered why her record was only almost as clean. \u00a0\u201cI did murder five humans,\u201d she told me in a complacent tone. \u201cIf you can really call them human . But I was very careful not to spill their blood \u2014 I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to resist that, and I didn\u2019t want any part of them in me, you see. \u00a0\u201cI saved Royce for last. I hoped that he would hear of his friends\u2019 deaths and understand, know what was coming for him. I hoped the fear would make the end worse for him. I think it worked. He was hiding inside a windowless room behind a door as thick as a bank vault\u2019s, guarded outside by armed men, when I caught up with him. Oops \u2014 seven murders,\u201d she corrected herself. \u201cI forgot about his guards. They only took a second.\u201d \u00a0\u201cI was overly theatrical. It was kind of childish, really. I wore a wedding dress I\u2019d stolen for the occasion. He screamed when he saw me. He screamed a lot that night. Saving him for last was a good idea \u2014 it made it easier for me to control myself, to make it slower \u2014\u201d  She broke off suddenly, and she glanced down at me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said in a chagrined voice. \u201cI\u2019m frightening you, aren\u2019t I?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I lied. \u00a0\u201cI got carried away.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m surprised Edward didn\u2019t tell you more about it.\u201d \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like to tell other people\u2019s stories \u2014 he feels like he\u2019s betraying confidences, because he hears so much more than just the parts they mean for him to hear.\u201d She smiled and shook her head. \u201cI probably ought to give him more credit. He\u2019s really quite decent, isn\u2019t he?\u201d \u201cI think so.\u201d \u00a0\u201cI can tell.\u201d Then she sighed. \u201cI haven\u2019t been fair to you, either, Bella. Did he tell you why? Or was that too confidential?\u201d \u201cHe said it was because I was human. He said it was harder for you to have someone on the outside who knew.\u201d  Rosalie\u2019s musical laughter interrupted me. \u201cNow I really feel guilty. He\u2019s been much, much kinder to me than I deserve.\u201d She seemed warmer as she laughed, like she\u2019d let down some guard that had never been absent in my presence before. \u201cWhat a liar that boy is.\u201d She laughed again. \u00a0\u201cHe was lying?\u201d I asked, suddenly wary. \u201cWell, that\u2019s probably putting it too strongly. He just didn\u2019t tell you the whole story. What he told you was true, even truer now than it was before. However, at the time . . .\u201d She broke off, chuckling nervously. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing. You see, at first, I was mostly jealous because he wanted you and not me.\u201d Her words sent a thrill of fear through me. Sitting there in the silver light, she was more beautiful than anything else I could imagine. I could not compete with Rosalie. \u201cBut you love Emmett . . . ,\u201d I mumbled. She shook her head back and forth, amused. \u201cI don\u2019t want Edward that way, Bella. I never did \u2014 I love him as a brother, but he\u2019s irritated me from the first moment I heard him speak. You have to understand, though . . . I was so used to people wanting me . And Edward wasn\u2019t the least bit interested. It frustrated me, even offended me in the beginning. But he never wanted anyone, so it didn\u2019t bother me long. Even when we first met Tanya\u2019s clan in Denali \u2014 all those females! \u2014 Edward never showed the slightest preference. And then he met you.\u201d She looked at me with confused eyes. I was only half paying attention. I was thinking about Edward and Tanya and all those females, and my lips pressed together in a hard line. \u00a0\u201cNot that you aren\u2019t pretty, Bella,\u201d she said, misreading my expression. \u201cBut it just meant that he found you more attractive than me. I\u2019m vain enough that I minded.\u201d \u201cBut you said \u2018at first.\u2019 That doesn\u2019t still . . . bother you, does it? I mean, we both know you\u2019re the most beautiful person on the planet.\u201d I laughed at having to say the words \u2014 it was so obvious. How odd that Rosalie should need such reassurances. Rosalie laughed, too. \u201cThanks, Bella. And no, it doesn\u2019t really bother me anymore. Edward has always been a little strange.\u201d She laughed again. \u201cBut you still don\u2019t like me,\u201d I whispered. Her smile faded. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d We sat in silence for a moment, and she didn\u2019t seem inclined to go on. \u201cWould you tell me why? Did I do something . . . ?\u201d Was she angry that I\u2019d put her family \u2014 her Emmett \u2014 in danger? Time and time again. James, and now Victoria . . . \u00a0\u201cNo, you haven\u2019t done anything,\u201d she murmured. \u201cNot yet.\u201d I stared at her, perplexed. \u201cDon\u2019t you see, Bella?\u201d Her voice was suddenly more passionate than before, even while she\u2019d told her unhappy story. \u201cYou already have everything . You have a whole life ahead of you \u2014 everything I want.  And you\u2019re going to just throw it away . Can\u2019t you see that I\u2019d trade everything I have to be you? You have the choice that I didn\u2019t have, and you\u2019re choosing wrong !\u201d I flinched back from her fierce expression. I realized my mouth had fallen open and I snapped it shut. She stared at me for a long moment and, slowly, the fervor in her eyes dimmed. Abruptly, she was abashed. \u201cAnd I was so sure that I could do this calmly.\u201d She shook her head, seeming a little dazed by the flood of emotion. \u201cIt\u2019s just that it\u2019s harder now than it was then, when it was no more than vanity.\u201d She stared at the moon in silence. It was a few moments before I was brave enough to break into her reverie. \u201cWould you like me better if I chose to stay human?\u201d She turned back to me, her lips twitching into a hint of a smile. \u201cMaybe.\u201d \u201cYou did get some of your happy ending, though,\u201d I reminded her. \u201cYou got Emmett.\u201d \u201cI got half.\u201d She grinned. \u201cYou know that I saved Emmett from a bear that was mauling him, and carried him home to Carlisle. But can you guess why I stopped the bear from eating him?\u201d I shook my head. \u201cWith the dark curls . . . the dimples that showed even while he was grimacing in pain . . . the strange innocence that seemed so out of place on a grown man\u2019s face . . . he reminded me of Vera\u2019s little Henry. I didn\u2019t want him to die \u2014 so much that, even though I hated this life, I was selfish enough to ask Carlisle to change him for me. \u00a0\u201cI got luckier than I deserved. Emmett is everything I would have asked for if I\u2019d known myself well enough to know what to ask for. He\u2019s exactly the kind of person someone like me needs. And, oddly enough, he needs me, too. That part worked out better than I could have hoped. But there will never be more than the two of us. And I\u2019ll never sit on a porch somewhere, with him gray-haired by my side, surrounded by our grandchildren.\u201d Her smile was kind now. \u201cThat sounds quite bizarre to you, doesn\u2019t it? In some ways, you are much more mature than I was at eighteen. But in other ways . . . there are many things you\u2019ve probably never thought about seriously. You\u2019re too young to know what you\u2019ll want in ten years, fifteen years \u2014 and too young to give it all up without thinking it through. You don\u2019t want to be rash about \u00a0permanent things, Bella.\u201d She patted my head, but the gesture didn\u2019t feel condescending. I sighed. \u201cJust think about it a little. Once it\u2019s done, it can\u2019t be undone. Esme\u2019s made do with us as substitutes . . . and Alice doesn\u2019t remember anything human so she can\u2019t miss it. . . . You will remember, though. It\u2019s a lot to give up.\u201d But more to get in return, I didn\u2019t say aloud.  \u201cThanks, Rosalie. It\u2019s nice to understand . . . to know you better.\u201d \u00a0\u201cI apologize for being such a monster.\u201d She grinned. \u201cI\u2019ll try to behave myself from now on.\u201d I grinned back at her. We weren\u2019t friends yet, but I was pretty sure she wouldn\u2019t always hate me so much. \u201cI\u2019ll let you sleep now.\u201d Rosalie\u2019s eyes flickered to the bed, and her lips twitched. \u201cI know you\u2019re frustrated that he\u2019s keeping you locked up like this, but don\u2019t give him too bad a time when he gets back.  He loves you more than you know. It terrifies him to be away from you.\u201d She got up silently and ghosted to the door. \u201cGoodnight, Bella,\u201d she whispered as she shut it behind herself. \u201cGoodnight, Rosalie,\u201d I murmured a second too late. It took me a long time to fall asleep after that. When I did sleep, I had a nightmare. I was crawling across the dark, cold stones of an unfamiliar street, under lightly falling snow, leaving a trail of blood smeared behind me. A shadowy angel in a long white dress watched my progress with resentful eyes. The next morning, Alice drove me to school while I stared grumpily out the windshield. I was feeling sleep-deprived, and it made the irritation of my imprisonment that much stronger. \u201cTonight we\u2019ll go out to Olympia or something,\u201d she promised. \u201cThat would be fun, right?\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just lock me in the basement,\u201d I suggested, \u201cand forget the sugar coating?\u201d Alice frowned. \u201cHe\u2019s going to take the Porsche back. I\u2019m not doing a very good job. You\u2019re supposed to be having fun.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault,\u201d I muttered. I couldn\u2019t believe I actually felt guilty. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at lunch.\u201d I trudged off to English. Without Edward, the day was guaranteed to be unbearable. I sulked through my first class, well aware that my attitude wasn\u2019t helping anything. When the bell rang, I got up without much enthusiasm. Mike was there at the door, holding it open for me. \u201cEdward hiking this weekend?\u201d he asked sociably as we walked out into the light rain. \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cYou want to do something tonight?\u201d How could he still sound hopeful? \u201cCan\u2019t. I\u2019ve got a slumber party,\u201d I grumbled. He gave me a strange look as he processed my mood. \u00a0\u201cWho are you \u2014\u201d Mike\u2019s question was cut short as a loud, growling roar erupted from behind us in the parking lot. Everyone on the sidewalk turned to look, staring in disbelief as the noisy black motorcycle screeched to a stop on the edge of the concrete, the engine still snarling. Jacob waved to me urgently. \u201cRun, Bella!\u201d he yelled over the engine\u2019s roar. I was frozen for a second before I understood. I looked at Mike quickly. I knew I only had seconds. How far would Alice go to restrain me in public? \u201cI got really sick and went home, okay?\u201d I said to Mike, my voice filled with sudden excitement. \u201cFine,\u201d he muttered. I pecked Mike swiftly on the cheek. \u201cThanks, Mike. I owe you one!\u201d I called as I sprinted away. Jacob revved his engine, grinning. I jumped on the back of his seat, wrapping my arms tightly around his waist. I caught sight of Alice, frozen at the edge of the cafeteria, her eyes sparking with fury, her lip curled back over her teeth. I shot her one pleading glance. Then we were racing across the blacktop so fast that my stomach got lost somewhere behind me. \u201cHold on,\u201d Jacob shouted. I hid my face in his back as he sped down the highway. I knew he would slow down when we hit the Quileute border. I just had to hold on till then. I prayed silently and fervently that Alice wouldn\u2019t follow, and that Charlie wouldn\u2019t happen to see me. . . . It was obvious when we had reached the safe zone. The bike slowed, and Jacob straightened up and howled with laughter. I opened my eyes. \u201cWe made it,\u201d he shouted. \u201cNot bad for a prison break, eh?\u201d \u201cGood thinking, Jake.\u201d \u201cI remembered what you said about the psychic leech not being about to predict what I\u2019m going to do. I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t think of this \u2014 she wouldn\u2019t have let you go to school.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s why I didn\u2019t consider it.\u201d He laughed triumphantly. \u201cWhat do you want to do today?\u201d \u201cAnything!\u201d I laughed back. It felt great to be free.",

            "en": "15          15. THE CULLENS The muted light of yet another cloudy day eventually woke me. I lay with my arm across my eyes, groggy and dazed. Something, a dream trying to be remembered, struggled to break into my consciousness. I moaned and rolled on my side, hoping more sleep would come. And then the previous day flooded back into my awareness. \"Oh!\" I sat up so fast it made my head spin. \"Your hair looks like a haystack\u2026 but I like it.\u201dHis unruffled voice came from the rocking chair in the corner. \"Edward! You stayed!\" I rejoiced, and thoughtlessly threw myself across the room and into his lap. In the instant that my thoughts caught up with my actions, I froze, shocked by my own uncontrolled enthusiasm. I stared up at him, afraid that I had crossed the wrong line. But he laughed. \"Of course,\u201dHe answered, startled, but seeming pleased by my reaction. His hands rubbed my back. I laid my head cautiously against his shoulder, breathing in the smell of his skin. \"I was sure it was a dream.\" \"You're not that creative,\u201dHe scoffed. \"Charlie!\" I remembered, thoughtlessly jumping up again and heading to the door. \"He left an hour ago \u2014 after reattaching your battery cables, I might add. I have to admit I was disappointed. Is that really all it would take to stop you, if you were determined to go?\" I deliberated where I stood, wanting to return to him badly, but afraid I might have morning breath. \"You're not usually this confused in the morning,\u201dHe noted. He held his arms open for me to return. A nearly irresistible invitation. \"I need another human minute,\" I admitted. \"I'll wait.\" I skipped to the bathroom, my emotions unrecognizable. I didn't know myself, inside or out. The face in the mirror was practically a stranger \u2014 eyes too bright, hectic spots of red across my cheekbones. After I brushed my teeth, I worked to straighten out the tangled chaos that was my hair. I splashed my face with cold water, and tried to breathe normally, with no noticeable success. I half-ran back to my room.  It seemed like a miracle that he was there, his arms still waiting for me. He reached out to me, and my heart thumped unsteadily. \"Welcome back,\u201dHe murmured, taking me into his arms. He rocked me for a while in silence, until I noticed that his clothes were changed, his hair smooth. \"You left?\" I accused, touching the collar of his fresh shirt. \"I could hardly leave in the clothes I came in \u2014 what would the neighbors think?\"  I pouted. \"You were very deeply asleep; I didn't miss anything.\u201dHis eyes gleamed. \"The talking came earlier.\" I groaned. \"What did you hear?\" His gold eyes grew very soft. \"You said you loved me.\" \"You knew that already,\" I reminded him, ducking my head. \"It was nice to hear, just the same.\" I hid my face against his shoulder. \"I love you,\" I whispered. \"You are my life now,\u201dHe answered simply. There was nothing more to say for the moment. He rocked us back and forth as the room grew lighter. \"Breakfast time,\u201dHe said eventually, casually \u2014 to prove, I'm sure, that he remembered all my human frailties. So I clutched my throat with both hands and stared at him with wide eyes. Shock crossed his face. \"Kidding!\" I snickered. \"And you said I couldn't act!\" He frowned in disgust. \"That wasn't funny.\" \"It was very funny, and you know it.\" But I examined his gold eyes carefully, to make sure that I was forgiven. Apparently, I was. \"Shall I rephrase?\u201dHe asked. \"Breakfast time for the human.\" \"Oh, okay.\" He threw me over his stone shoulder, gently, but with a swiftness that left me breathless. I protested as he carried me easily down the stairs, but he ignored me. He sat me right side up on a chair. The kitchen was bright, happy, seeming to absorb my mood. \"What's for breakfast?\" I asked pleasantly. That threw him for a minute. \"Er, I'm not sure. What would you like?\u201dHis marble brow puckered. I grinned, hopping up. \"That's all right, I fend for myself pretty well. Watch me hunt.\" I found a bowl and a box of cereal. I could feel his eyes on me as I poured the milk and grabbed a spoon. I sat my food on the table, and then paused. \"Can I get you anything?\" I asked, not wanting to be rude. He rolled his eyes. \"Just eat, Bella.\" I sat at the table, watching him as I took a bite. He was gazing at me, studying my every movement. It made me self-conscious. I cleared my mouth to speak, to distract him. \"What's on the agenda for today?\" I asked. \"Hmmm\u2026\" I watched him frame his answer carefully. \"What would you say to meeting my family?\" I gulped. \"Are you afraid now?\u201dHe sounded hopeful. \"Yes,\" I admitted; how could I deny it \u2014 he could see my eyes. \"Don't worry.\u201dHe smirked. \"I'll protect you.\" \"I'm not afraid of them,\" I explained. \"I'm afraid they won't\u2026 like me. Won't they be, well, surprised that you would bring someone\u2026 like me\u2026 home to meet them? Do they know that I know about them?\" \"Oh, they already know everything. They'd taken bets yesterday, you know\" \u2014 he smiled, but his voice was harsh \u2014 \"on whether I'd bring you back, though why anyone would bet against Alice, I can't imagine. At any rate, we don't have secrets in the family. It's not really feasible, what with my mind reading and Alice seeing the future and all that.\" \"And Jasper making you feel all warm and fuzzy about spilling your guts, don't forget that.\" \"You paid attention,\u201dHe smiled approvingly. \"I've been known to do that every now and then.\" I grimaced. \"So did Alice see me coming?\" His reaction was strange. \"Something like that,\u201dHe said uncomfortably, turning away so I couldn't see his eyes. I stared at him curiously. \"Is that any good?\u201dHe asked, turning back to me abruptly and eyeing my breakfast with a teasing look on his face. \"Honestly, it doesn't look very appetizing.\" \"Well, it's no irritable grizzly\u2026\" I murmured, ignoring him when he glowered. I was still wondering why he responded that way when I mentioned Alice. I hurried through my cereal, speculating. He stood in the middle of the kitchen, the statue of Adonis again, staring abstractedly out the back windows. Then his eyes were back on me, and he smiled his heartbreaking smile. \"And you should introduce me to your father, too, I think.\" \"He already knows you,\" I reminded him. \"As your boyfriend, I mean.\" I stared at him with suspicion. \"Why?\" \"Isn't that customary?\u201dHe asked innocently. \"I don't know,\" I admitted. My dating history gave me few reference points to work with. Not that any normal rules of dating applied here. \"That's not necessary, you know. I don't expect you to\u2026 I mean, you don't have to pretend for me.\" His smile was patient. \"I'm not pretending.\" I pushed the remains of my cereal around the edges of the bowl, biting my lip. \"Are you going to tell Charlie I'm your boyfriend or not?\u201dHe demanded. \"Is that what you are?\" I suppressed my internal cringing at the thought of Edward and Charlie and the word boy friend all in the same room at the same time. \"It's a loose interpretation of the word 'boy,' I'll admit.\"  \"I was under the impression that you were something more, actually,\" I confessed, looking at the table. \"Well, I don't know if we need to give him all the gory details.\u201dHe reached across the table to lift my chin with a cold, gentle finger. \"But he will need some explanation for why I'm around here so much. I don't want Chief Swan getting a restraining order put on me.\" \"Will you be?\" I asked, suddenly anxious. \"Will you really be here?\" \"As long as you want me,\u201dHe assured me. \"I'll always want you,\" I warned him. \"Forever.\" He walked slowly around the table, and, pausing a few feet away, he reached out to touch his fingertips to my cheek. His expression was unfathomable. \"Does that make you sad?\" I asked. He didn't answer. He stared into my eyes for an immeasurable period of time. \"Are you finished?\u201dHe finally asked. I jumped up. \"Yes.\" \"Get dressed \u2014 I'll wait here.\" It was hard to decide what to wear. I doubted there were any etiquette books detailing how to dress when your vampire sweetheart takes you home to meet his vampire family. It was a relief to think the word to myself. I knew I shied away from it intentionally. I ended up in my only skirt \u2014 long, khaki-colored, still casual. I put on the dark blue blouse he'd once complimented. A quick glance in the mirror told me my hair was entirely impossible, so I pulled it back into a pony tail. \"Okay.\" I bounced down the stairs. \"I'm decent.\" He was waiting at the foot of the stairs, closer than I'd thought, and I bounded right into him. He steadied me, holding me a careful distance away for a few seconds before suddenly pulling me closer. \"Wrong again,\u201dHe murmured in my ear. \"You are utterly indecent \u2014 no one should look so tempting, it's not fair.\" \"Tempting how?\" I asked. \"I can change\u2026\" He sighed, shaking his head. \"You are so absurd.\u201dHe pressed his cool lips delicately to my forehead, and the room spun. The smell of his breath made it impossible to think.  \"Shall I explain how you are tempting me?\u201dHe said. It was clearly a rhetorical question. His fingers traced slowly down my spine, his breath coming more quickly against my skin. My hands were limp on his chest, and I felt lightheaded again. He tilted his head slowly and touched his cool lips to mine for the second time, very carefully, parting them slightly. And then I collapsed. \"Bella?\u201dHis voice was alarmed as he caught me and held me up. \"You\u2026 made\u2026 me\u2026 faint,\" I accused him dizzily. \"What am I going to do with you?\u201dHe groaned in exasperation. \"Yesterday I kiss you, and you attack me! Today you pass out on me!\" I laughed weakly, letting his arms support me while my head spun. \"So much for being good at everything,\u201dHe sighed. \"That's the problem.\" I was still dizzy. \"You're too good. Far, far too good.\" \"Do you feel sick?\u201dHe asked; he'd seen me like this before. \"No \u2014 that wasn't the same kind of fainting at all. I don't know what happened.\" I shook my head apologetically, \"I think I forgot to breathe.\" \"I can't take you anywhere like this.\" \"I'm fine,\" I insisted. \"Your family is going to think I'm insane anyway, what's the difference?\" He measured my expression for a moment. \"I'm very partial to that color with your skin,\u201dHe offered unexpectedly. I flushed with pleasure, and looked away. \"Look, I'm trying really hard not to think about what I'm about to do, so can we go already?\" I asked. \"And you're worried, not because you're headed to meet a houseful of vampires, but because you think those vampires won't approve of you, correct?\" \"That's right,\" I answered immediately, hiding my surprise at his casual use of the word. He shook his head. \"You're incredible.\" I realized, as he drove my truck out of the main part of town, that I had no idea where he lived. We passed over the bridge at the Calawah River, the road winding northward, the houses flashing past us growing farther apart, getting bigger. And then we were past the other houses altogether, driving through misty forest. I was trying to decide whether to ask or be patient, when he turned abruptly onto an unpaved road. It was unmarked, barely visible among the ferns. The forest encroached on both sides, leaving the road ahead only discernible for a few meters as it twisted, serpentlike, around the ancient trees. And then, after a few miles, there was some thinning of the woods, and we were suddenly in a small meadow, or was it actually a lawn? The gloom of the forest didn't relent, though, for there were six primordial cedars that shaded an entire acre with their vast sweep of branches. The trees held their protecting shadow right up to the walls of the house that rose among them, making obsolete the deep porch that wrapped around the first story. I don't know what I had expected, but it definitely wasn't this. The house was timeless, graceful, and probably a hundred years old. It was painted a soft, faded white, three stories tall, \u00a0\u00a0rectangular and well proportioned. The windows and doors were either part of the original structure or a perfect restoration. My truck was the only car in sight. I could hear the river close by, hidden in the obscurity of the forest. \"Wow.\" \"You like it?\u201dHe smiled. \"It\u2026 has a certain charm.\" He pulled the end of my ponytail and chuckled. \"Ready?\u201dHe asked, opening my door. \"Not even a little bit \u2014 let's go.\" I tried to laugh, but it seemed to get stuck in my throat. I smoothed my hair nervously. \"You look lovely.\u201dHe took my hand easily, without thinking about it. We walked through the deep shade up to the porch. I knew he could feel my tension; his thumb rubbed soothing circles into the back of my hand. He opened the door for me. The inside was even more surprising, less predictable, than the exterior. It was very bright, very open, and very large. This must have originally been several rooms, but the walls had been removed from most of the first floor to create one wide space. The back, south-facing wall had been entirely replaced with glass, and, beyond the shade of the cedars, the lawn stretched bare to the wide river. A massive curving staircase dominated the west side of the room. The walls, the high-beamed ceiling, the wooden floors, and the thick carpets were all varying shades of white. Waiting to greet us, standing just to the left of the door, on a raised portion of the floor by a spectacular grand piano, were Edward's parents. I'd seen Dr. Cullen before, of course, yet I couldn't help but be struck again by his youth, his outrageous perfection. At his side was Esme, I assumed, the only one of the family I'd never seen before. She had the same pale, beautiful features as the rest of them. Something about her heart-shaped face, her billows of soft, caramel-colored hair, reminded me of the ing\u00e9nues of the silent-movie era. She was small, slender, yet less angular, more rounded than the others. They were both dressed casually, in light colors that matched the inside of the house. They smiled in welcome, but made no move to approach us. Trying not to frighten me, I guessed. \"Carlisle, Esme,\u201dEdward's voice broke the short silence, \"this is Bella.\" \"You're very welcome, Bella.\u201dCarlisle's step was measured, careful as he approached me. He raised his hand tentatively, and I stepped forward to shake hands with him. \"It's nice to see you again, Dr. Cullen.\" \"Please, call me Carlisle.\" \"Carlisle.\" I grinned at him, my sudden confidence surprising me. I could feel Edward's relief at my side. Esme smiled and stepped forward as well, reaching for my hand. Her cold, stone grasp was just as I expected. \"It's very nice to know you,\" she said sincerely. \"Thank you. I'm glad to meet you, too.\u201dAnd I was. It was like meeting a fairy tale \u2014 Snow White, in the flesh. \"Where are Alice and Jasper?\u201dEdward asked, but no one answered, as they had just appeared at the top of the wide staircase. \"Hey, Edward!\u201dAlice called enthusiastically. She ran down the stairs, a streak of black hair and white skin, coming to a sudden and graceful stop in front of me. Carlisle and Esme shot warning glances at her, but I liked it. It was natural \u2014 for her, anyway. \"Hi, Bella!\u201dAlice said, and she bounced forward to kiss my cheek. If Carlisle and Esme had looked cautious before, they now looked staggered. There was shock in my eyes, too, but I was also very pleased that she seemed to approve of me so entirely. I was startled to feel Edward stiffen at my side. I glanced at his face, but his expression was unreadable. \"You do smell nice, I never noticed before,\" she commented, to my extreme embarrassment. No one else seemed to know quite what to say, and then Jasper was there \u2014 tall and leonine. A feeling of ease spread through me, and I was suddenly comfortable despite where I was. Edward stared at Jasper, raising one eyebrow, and I remembered what Jasper could do.  \"Hello, Bella,\" Jasper said. He kept his distance, not offering to shake my hand. But it was impossible to feel awkward near him. \"Hello, Jasper.\" I smiled at him shyly, and then at the others. \"It's nice to meet you all \u2014 you have a very beautiful home,\" I added conventionally. \"Thank you,\u201dEsme said. \"We're so glad that you came.\" She spoke with feeling, and I realized that she thought I was brave. I also realized that Rosalie and Emmett were nowhere to be seen, and I remembered Edward's too-innocent denial when I'd asked him if the others didn't like me. Carlisle's expression distracted me from this train of thought; he was gazing meaningfully at Edward with an intense expression. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Edward nod once. I looked away, trying to be polite. My eyes wandered again to the beautiful instrument on the platform by the door. I suddenly remembered my childhood fantasy that, should I ever win a lottery, I would buy a grand piano for my mother. She wasn't really good \u2014 she only played for herself on our secondhand upright \u2014 but I loved to watch her play. She was happy, absorbed \u2014 she seemed like a new, mysterious being to me then, someone outside the \"mom\" persona I took for granted. She'd put me through lessons, of course, but like most kids, I whined until she let me quit. Esme noticed my preoccupation. \"Do you play?\" she asked, inclining her head toward the piano. I shook my head. \"Not at all. But it's so beautiful. Is it yours?\" \"No,\" she laughed. \"Edward didn't tell you he was musical?\" \"No.\" I glared at his suddenly innocent expression with narrowed eyes. \"I should have known, I guess.\" Esme raised her delicate eyebrows in confusion. \"Edward can do everything, right?\" I explained. Jasper snickered and Esme gave Edward a reproving look. \"I hope you haven't been showing off\u2014 it's rude,\" she scolded. \"Just a bit,\u201dHe laughed freely. Her face softened at the sound, and they shared a brief look that I didn't understand, though Esme's face seemed almost smug. \"He's been too modest, actually,\" I corrected. \"Well, play for her,\u201dEsme encouraged. \"You just said showing off was rude,\u201dHe objected. \"There are exceptions to every rule,\" she replied. \"I'd like to hear you play,\" I volunteered. \"It's settled then.\u201dEsme pushed him toward the piano. He pulled me along, sitting me on the bench beside him. He gave me a long, exasperated look before he turned to the keys. And then his fingers flowed swiftly across the ivory, and the room was filled with a composition so complex, so luxuriant, it was impossible to believe only one set of hands played. I felt my chin drop, my mouth open in astonishment, and heard low chuckles behind me at my reaction. Edward looked at me casually, the music still surging around us without a break, and winked. \"Do you like it?\" \"You wrote this?\" I gasped, understanding. He nodded. \"It's Esme's favorite.\" I closed my eyes, shaking my head. \"What's wrong?\" \"I'm feeling extremely insignificant.\" The music slowed, transforming into something softer, and to my surprise I detected the melody of his lullaby weaving through the profusion of notes. \"You inspired this one,\u201dHe said softly. The music grew unbearably sweet. I couldn't speak. \"They like you, you know,\u201dHe said conversationally. \"Esme especially.\" I glanced behind me, but the huge room was empty now. \"Where did they go?\" \"Very subtly giving us some privacy, I suppose.\" I sighed. \"They like me. But Rosalie and Emmett\u2026\" I trailed off, not sure how to express my doubts. He frowned. \"Don't worry about Rosalie,\u201dHe said, his eyes wide and persuasive. \"She'll come around.\" I pursed my lips skeptically. \"Emmett?\" \"Well, he thinks I'm a lunatic, it's true, but he doesn't have a problem with you. He's trying to reason with Rosalie.\" \"What is it that upsets her?\" I wasn't sure if I wanted to know the answer. He sighed deeply. \"Rosalie struggles the most with\u2026 with what we are.\u00a0 It's hard for her to have someone on the outside know the truth. And she's a little jealous.\" \"Rosalie is jealous of me?\" I asked incredulously. I tried to imagine a universe in which someone as breathtaking as Rosalie would have any possible reason to feel jealous of someone like me. \"You're human.\u201dHe shrugged. \"She wishes that she were, too.\" \"Oh,\" I muttered, still stunned. \"Even Jasper, though\u2026\" \"That's really my fault,\u201dHe said. \"I told you he was the most recent to try our way of life. I warned him to keep his distance.\" I thought about the reason for that, and shuddered. \"Esme and Carlisle\u2026 ?\" I continued quickly, to keep him from noticing. \"Are happy to see me happy. Actually, Esme wouldn't care if you had a third eye and webbed feet. All this time she's been worried about me, afraid that there was something missing from my essential makeup, that I was too young when Carlisle changed me\u2026 She's ecstatic. Every time I touch you, she just about chokes with satisfaction.\" \"Alice seems very\u2026 enthusiastic.\" \"Alice has her own way of looking at things,\u201dHe said through tight lips. \"And you're not going to explain that, are you?\" A moment of wordless communication passed between us. He realized that I knew he was keeping something from me. I realized that he wasn't going to give anything away. Not now. \"So what was Carlisle telling you before?\" His eyebrows pulled together. \"You noticed that, did you?\" I shrugged. \"Of course.\" He looked at me thoughtfully for a few seconds before answering. \"He wanted to tell me some news \u2014 he didn't know if it was something I would share with you.\" \"Will you?\" \"I have to, because I'm going to be a little\u2026 overbearingly protective over the next few days \u2014 or weeks \u2014 and I wouldn't want you to think I'm naturally a tyrant.\" \"What's wrong?\" \"Nothing's wrong, exactly. Alice just sees some visitors coming soon. They know we're here, and they're curious.\" \"Visitors?\" \"Yes\u2026 well, they aren't like us, of course \u2014 in their hunting habits, I mean. They probably won't come into town at all, but I'm certainly not going to let you out of my sight till they're gone.\" I shivered. \"Finally, a rational response!\u201dHe murmured. \"I was beginning to think you had no sense of self-preservation at all.\" I let that one pass, looking away, my eyes wandering again around the spacious room. He followed my gaze. \"Not what you expected, is it?\u201dHe asked, his voice smug. \"No,\" I admitted. \"No coffins, no piled skulls in the corners; I don't even think we have cobwebs\u2026 what a disappointment this must be for you,\u201dHe continued slyly. I ignored his teasing. \"It's so light\u2026 so open.\" He was more serious when he answered. \"It's the one place we never have to hide.\" ,  The song he was still playing, my song, drifted to an end, the final chords shifting to a more melancholy key. The last note hovered poignantly in the silence. \"Thank you,\" I murmured. I realized there were tears in my eyes. I dabbed at them, embarrassed. He touched the corner of my eye, trapping one I missed. He lifted his finger, examining the drop of moisture broodingly. Then, so quickly I couldn't be positive that he really did, he put his finger to his mouth to taste it. I looked at him questioningly, and he gazed back for a long moment before he finally smiled. \"Do you want to see the rest of the house?\" \"No coffins?\" I verified, the sarcasm in my voice not entirely masking the slight but genuine anxiety I felt. He laughed, taking my hand, leading me away from the piano. \"No coffins,\u201dHe promised. We walked up the massive staircase, my hand trailing along the satin-smooth rail. The long hall at the top of the stairs was paneled with a honey-colored wood, the same as the floorboards. \"Rosalie and Emmett's room\u2026 Carlisle's office\u2026 Alice's room\u2026\u201dHe gestured as he led me past the doors. He would have continued, but I stopped dead at the end of the hall, staring incredulously at the ornament hanging on the wall above my head. Edward chuckled at my bewildered expression. \"You can laugh,\u201dHe said. \"It is sort of ironic.\" I didn't laugh. My hand raised automatically, one finger extended as if to touch the large wooden cross, its dark patina contrasting with the lighter tone of the wall. I didn't touch it, though I was curious if the aged wood would feel as silky as it looked. \"It must be very old,\" I guessed. He shrugged. \"Early sixteen-thirties, more or less.\" I looked away from the cross to stare at him. \"Why do you keep this here?\" I wondered. \"Nostalgia. It belonged to Carlisle's father.\" \"He collected antiques?\" I suggested doubtfully. \"No. He carved this himself. It hung on the wall above the pulpit in the vicarage where he preached.\" I wasn't sure if my face betrayed my shock, but I returned to gazing at the simple, ancient cross, just in case. I quickly did the mental math; the cross was over three hundred and seventy years old. The silence stretched on as I struggled to wrap my mind around the concept of so many years. \"Are you all right?\u201dHe sounded worried. \"How old is Carlisle?\" I asked quietly, ignoring his question, still staring up. \"He just celebrated his three hundred and sixty-second birthday,\u201dEdward said. I looked back at him, a million questions in my eyes. He watched me carefully as he spoke. \"Carlisle was born in London, in the sixteen-forties, he believes. Time wasn't marked as accurately then, for the common people anyway. It was just before Cromwell's rule, though.\" I kept my face composed, aware of his scrutiny as I listened. It was easier if I didn't try to believe. \"He was the only son of an Anglican pastor. His mother died giving birth to him. His father was an intolerant man. As the Protestants came into power, he was enthusiastic in his persecution of Roman Catholics and other religions. He also believed very strongly in the reality of evil. He led hunts for witches, werewolves\u2026 and vampires.\" I grew very still at the word. I'm sure he noticed, but he went on without pausing. \"They burned a lot of innocent people \u2014 of course the real creatures that he sought were not so easy to catch. \"When the pastor grew old, he placed his obedient son in charge of the raids. At first Carlisle was a disappointment; he was not quick to accuse, to see demons where they did not exist. But he was persistent, and more clever than his father. He actually discovered a coven of true vampires that lived hidden in the sewers of the city, only coming out by night to hunt. In those days, when monsters were not just myths and legends, that was the way many lived. \"The people gathered their pitchforks and torches, of course\" \u2014 his brief laugh was darker now \u2014 \"and waited where Carlisle had seen the monsters exit into the street. Eventually one emerged.\" His voice was very quiet; I strained to catch the words. \"He must have been ancient, and weak with hunger. Carlisle heard him call out in Latin to the others when he caught the scent of the mob. He ran through the streets, and Carlisle \u2014 he was twenty-three and very fast \u2014 was in the lead of the pursuit. The creature could have easily outrun them, but Carlisle thinks he was too hungry, so he turned and attacked. He fell on Carlisle first, but the others were close behind, and he turned to defend himself. He killed two men, and made off with a third, leaving Carlisle bleeding in the street.\" He paused. I could sense he was editing something, keeping something from me. \"Carlisle knew what his father would do. The bodies would be burned \u2014 anything infected by the monster must be destroyed. Carlisle acted instinctively to save his own life. He crawled away from the alley while the mob followed the <em>fiend</em> and his victim. He hid in a cellar, buried himself in rotting potatoes for three days. It's a miracle he was able to keep silent, to stay undiscovered. \"It was over then, and he realized what he had become.\" I'm not sure what my face was revealing, but he suddenly broke off. \"How are you feeling?\u201dHe asked. \"I'm fine,\" I assured him. And, though I bit my lip in hesitation, he must have seen the curiosity burning in my eyes. He smiled. \"I expect you have a few more questions for me.\" \"A few.\" His smile widened over his brilliant teeth. He started back down the hall, pulling me along by the hand. \"Come on, then,\u201dHe encouraged. \"I'll show you.\"",
