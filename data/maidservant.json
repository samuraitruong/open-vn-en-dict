He would then make a move depending on the woman\u2019s reaction.  In 1914 when Albert Einstein found that after 11 years, his marriage to first wife Mileva Maric - one of the first women to study mathematics and physics in Europe - was floundering, he issued a list of demands that he believed would allow them to maintain a relationship for the sake of the children. The list is a set of demands that would see Maric become more <em>maidservant</em> than lover. Five years later, Einstein's wife filed for divorce and, in 1919, it was granted.  The father of the theory of relativity is known to have had many liaisons throughout his marriage to Maric. In fact, he became involved with Elsa, a first cousin who would become his second wife, in 1912, when he was still married to his first wife.",
