To another, it's a dare, driving them to do it even more. Michael Jordan famously was cut from the <em>Laney</em> High School basketball team in Wilmington, N.C., as a freshman. Jordan had the ability to use rejection or any perceived slight towards him as a motivator, not a deterrent.  While some people can simply ignore the naysayers, Jordan instead seemed able to convert their words into fuel. This approach requires a uniquely simultaneous combination of vengeance-minded mental toughness with whole-hearted self-confidence and optimism.",
