The fox escaped into his hole but not before the hound had bitten into its leg and <em>lamed</em> it for life. Later I rode into a village and saw the same hound there. It was barking at a man.

His knee was shattered and he fell to the ground, disabled for life. The horse began to run but it fell into a hole and broke its leg.
