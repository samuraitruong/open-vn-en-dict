Among this population is much of the literary world, or so my conversations with literary people suggest. At the National Book Award and <em>Dayton</em> Literary Peace Prize ceremonies that I attended recently, most of the speech givers proclaimed their opposition to the values that Trump espoused, which contradict literature itself. Great literature cannot exist if it is based on hate, fear, division, exclusion, scapegoating, or the worship of injustice. Bad literature and demagogic power, on the other hand, exploit these very things, and they do so through telling the kind of demonizing story that most literary writers reject.",
