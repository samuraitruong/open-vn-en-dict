The 28 member states are hoping to reach a \"New Strategic Concept\" to shape the way Nato defends itself against threats over the next decade. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev will also attend, in a sign of warming ties. Afghanistan will be top of the agenda, with plans to bring Nato's combat operations to an end by 2014.  Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who is scheduled to address the summit on Saturday, has said he wants Nato to hand back control of the country by the end of 2014 - a deadline the US has described as realistic but not set in stone. Pentagon press secretary Geoff Morrell said the deadline had existed for some time as \"an aspirational goal\" but that this did not mean all coalition forces would have to leave by that date. Alliance credibility  The <em>Lisbon</em> talks are expected to shape the future of Nato at a time of shrinking budget cuts and expanding challenges, says the BBC's defence correspondent, Caroline Wyatt. Key to the future credibility of the alliance will be ensuring a workable transition in Afghanistan, our correspondent adds. On Thursday, Nato Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said the alliance had \"underestimated the challenge\" in Afghanistan but was confident it was now \"on the right track\". \"I'm very optimistic about our Afghanistan operation and we'll make a positive announcement in <em>Lisbon</em> - that the handover is about to begin,\" he told Portugal's Renascenca newspaper. There are some 120,000 international troops attached to the Nato-led International Security Assistance Force (Isaf) in Afghanistan. Budget resignation  Mr Medvedev will meet the leaders on Saturday, becoming the first Russian president to attend a Nato summit since his country's conflict with Georgia in 2008. The alliance is keen to build bridges with Moscow, and a key issue at the summit will be agreeing plans for a joint study of missile defence. The efforts have been aided by US President Barack Obama's insistence that the US will ratify a new nuclear arms treaty with Russia He said there was \"no higher national security priority\" for the government before the start of the new Congress in January. Moscow is also promising logistical help for Nato in Afghanistan by easing restrictions on transit routes into the country. Spy chief resigns The summit will also debate proposals on changing Nato's command structure, in an attempt to reduce bureaucracy and expenditure. The changes could see the number of Nato agencies which look after areas such as logistics, communications, research and training cut from 14 to three. Meanwhile Portugal's Defence Minister Augusto Santos Silva has said the resignation of the country's spy chief will have no effect on security or intelligence gathering. Jorge Silva Carvalho resigned on Thursday in protest over budget cuts being imposed by the government. He is reported to have told colleagues he was quitting \"to draw attention to the mistake that is being made\" in closing seven of the agency's overseas bureaux. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11793407",

            "en": "Gaddafi forces beat up BBC team         Libyan leader Col Muammar Gaddafi's security forces detained and beat up a BBC news team who were trying to reach the strife-torn western city of Zawiya. The three were beaten with fists, knees and rifles, hooded and subjected to mock executions by members of Libya's army and secret police. The men were detained on Monday and held for 21 hours, but have now flown out of Libya.  Government forces are in a fierce fight to wrest Zawiya from rebel control. Artillery and tanks have pounded the city - which lies 50km (30 miles) from the capital Tripoli - over the last four days. 'Gun against neck'  The BBC team showed their identification when they were detained at an army roadblock on Monday. They had been seeking, like many journalists, to get around government restrictions by reaching besieged Zawiya. The three of them were taken to a huge military barracks in Tripoli, where they were blindfolded, handcuffed and beaten. One of the three, Chris Cobb-Smith, said: \"We were lined up against the wall. I was the last in line - facing the wall.  \"I looked and I saw a plain-clothes guy with a small sub-machine gun. He put it to everyone's neck. I saw him and he screamed at me. \"Then he walked up to me, put the gun to my neck and pulled the trigger twice. The bullets whisked past my ear. The soldiers just laughed.\" A second member of the team - Feras Killani, a correspondent of Palestinian descent - is said to have been singled out for repeated beatings. Their captors told him they did not like his reporting of the Libyan popular uprising and accused him of being a spy. The third member of the team, cameraman Goktay Koraltan, said they were all convinced they were going to die. During their detention, the BBC team saw evidence of torture against Libyan detainees, many of whom were from Zawiya. 'Abusive treatment' Koraltan said: \"I cannot describe how bad it was. Most of them [other detainees] were hooded and handcuffed really tightly, all with swollen hands and broken ribs. They were in agony. They were screaming.\" Killani said: \"Four of them [detainees] were in a very bad situation. There was evidence of torture on their faces and bodies. One of them said he had at least two broken ribs. I spent at least six hours helping them drink, sleep, urinate and move from one side to another.\" A senior Libyan government official later apologised for the BBC team's ordeal. But the BBC said in a statement that it \"strongly condemns this abusive treatment\". \"The safety of our staff is our primary concern especially when they are working in such difficult circumstances and it is essential that journalists working for the BBC, or any media organisation, are allowed to report on the situation in Libya without fear of attack,\" said the statement from Liliane Landor, languages controller of BBC Global News.  \"Despite these attacks, the BBC will continue to cover the evolving story in Libya for our audiences both inside and outside the country.\" Rebel bounty  Government forces have been mounting a strong fightback against the rebels who rose up in mid-February to end Col Gaddafi's 41 years in power. The main square of Zawiya reportedly changed hands twice on Wednesday in the fighting between pro-Gaddafi forces and the insurgents. State TV reported that the army had retaken Zawiya, and showed pictures of what it said were residents staging a pro-Gaddafi rally. On the eastern front around the Mediterranean oil port of Ras Lanuf, rebels retreated in the face of heavy government shelling and ongoing air strikes, amid reports that oil facilities were blown up. Col Gaddafi also launched a diplomatic offensive, dispatching envoys overseas on the eve of a summit by Nato defence ministers in Brussels. High-ranking members of the Libyan leader's inner circle were sent to Cairo, Brussels, <em>Lisbon</em> and Malta to approach government officials. The Libyan government meanwhile offered a reward for the capture of rebel leader Mustafa Abdel Jalil, the ex-justice minister. The amount was 500,000 Libyan dinars ($400,000; \u00a3250,000).",
