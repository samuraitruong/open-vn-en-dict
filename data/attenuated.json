            "en": "6           6. SCARY STORIES  As I sat in my room, trying to concentrate on the third act of Macbeth, I was really listening for my truck. I would have thought, even over the pounding rain, I could have heard the engine's roar. But when I went to peek out the curtain \u2014 again \u2014 it was suddenly there. I wasn't looking forward to Friday, and it more than lived up to my non-expectations. Of course there were the fainting comments. Jessica especially seemed to get a kick out of that story. Luckily Mike had kept his mouth shut, and no one seemed to know about Edward's involvement. She did have a lot of questions about lunch, though. \"So what did Edward Cullen want yesterday?\" Jessica asked in Trig. \"I don't know,\" I answered truthfully. \"He never really got to the point.\" \"You looked kind of mad,\" she fished. \"Did I?\" I kept my expression blank. \"You know, I've never seen him sit with anyone but his family before. That was weird.\" \"Weird,\" I agreed. She seemed annoyed; she flipped her dark curls impatiently \u2014 I guessed she'd been hoping to hear something that would make a good story for her to pass on. The worst part about Friday was that, even though I knew he wasn't going to be there, I still hoped. When I walked into the cafeteria with Jessica and Mike, I couldn't keep from looking at his table, where Rosalie, Alice, and Jasper sat talking, heads close together. And I couldn't stop the gloom that engulfed me as I realized I didn't know how long I would have to wait before I saw him again. At my usual table, everyone was full of our plans for the next day. Mike was animated again, putting a great deal of trust in the local weatherman who promised sun tomorrow. I'd have to see that before I believed it. But it was warmer today \u2014 almost sixty. Maybe the outing wouldn't be completely miserable. I intercepted a few unfriendly glances from Lauren during lunch, which I didn't understand until we were all walking out of the room together. I was right behind her, just a foot from her slick, silver blond hair, and she was evidently unaware of that. \"\u2026don't know why Bella\" \u2014 she sneered my name \u2014 \"doesn't just sit with the Cullens from now on.\" I heard her muttering to Mike. I'd never noticed what an unpleasant, nasal voice she had, and I was surprised by the malice in it. I really didn't know her well at all, certainly not well enough for her to dislike me \u2014 or so I'd thought. \"She's my friend; she sits with us,\" Mike whispered back loyally, but also a bit territorially. I paused to let Jess and Angela pass me. I didn't want to hear any more. That night at dinner, Charlie seemed enthusiastic about my trip to La Push in the morning. I think he felt guilty for leaving me home alone on the weekends, but he'd spent too many years building his habits to break them now. Of course he knew the names of all the kids going, and their parents, and their great-grandparents, too, probably. He seemed to approve. I wondered if he would approve of my plan to ride to Seattle with Edward Cullen. Not that I was going to tell him. \"Dad, do you know a place called Goat Rocks or something like that? I think it's south of Mount Rainier,\" I asked casually. \"Yeah \u2014 why?\" I shrugged. \"Some kids were talking about camping there.\" \"It's not a very good place for camping.\" He sounded surprised. \"Too many bears. Most people go there during the hunting season.\" \"Oh,\" I murmured. \"Maybe I got the name wrong.\" I meant to sleep in, but an unusual brightness woke me. I opened my eyes to see a clear yellow light streaming through my window. I couldn't believe it. I hurried to the window to check, and sure enough, there was the sun. It was in the wrong place in the sky, too low, and it didn't seem to be as close as it should be, but it was definitely the sun. Clouds ringed the horizon, but a large patch of blue was visible in the middle. I lingered by the window as long as I could, afraid that if I left the blue would disappear again. The Newtons' Olympic Outfitters store was just north of town. I'd seen the store, but I'd never stopped there \u2014 not having much need for any supplies required for being outdoors over an extended period of time. In the parking lot I recognized Mike's Suburban and Tyler's Sentra. As I pulled up next to their vehicles, I could see the group standing around in front of the Suburban. Eric was there, along with two other boys I had class with; I was fairly sure their names were Ben and Conner. Jess was there, flanked by Angela and Lauren. Three other girls stood with them, including one I remembered falling over in Gym on Friday. That one gave me a dirty look as I got out of the truck, and whispered something to Lauren. Lauren shook out her cornsilk hair and eyed me scornfully.  So it was going to be one of those days. At least Mike was happy to see me. \"You came!\" he called, delighted. \"And I said it would be sunny today, didn't I?\" \"I told you I was coming,\" I reminded him. \"We're just waiting for Lee and Samantha\u2026 unless you invited someone,\" Mike added. \"Nope,\" I lied lightly, hoping I wouldn't get caught in the lie. But also wishing that a miracle would occur, and Edward would appear. Mike looked satisfied. \"Will you ride in my car? It's that or Lee's mom's minivan.\" \"Sure.\" He smiled blissfully. It was so easy to make Mike happy. \"You can have shotgun,\" he promised. I hid my chagrin. It wasn't as simple to make Mike and Jessica happy at the same time. I could see Jessica glowering at us now. The numbers worked out in my favor, though. Lee brought two extra people, and suddenly every seat was necessary. I managed to wedge Jess in between Mike and me in the front seat of the Suburban. Mike could have been more graceful about it, but at least Jess seemed appeased. It was only fifteen miles to La Push from Forks, with gorgeous, dense green forests edging the road most of the way and the wide Quillayute River snaking beneath it twice. I was glad I had the window seat. We'd rolled the windows down \u2014 the Suburban was a bit claustrophobic with nine people in it \u2014 and I tried to absorb as much sunlight as possible.  I'd been to the beaches around La Push many times during my Forks summers with Charlie, so the mile-long crescent of First Beach was familiar to me. It was still breathtaking. The water was dark gray, even in the sunlight, white-capped and heaving to the gray, rocky shore. Islands rose out of the steel harbor waters with sheer cliff sides, reaching to uneven summits, and crowned with austere, soaring firs. The beach had only a thin border of actual sand at the water's edge, after which it grew into millions of large, smooth stones that looked uniformly gray from a distance, but close up were every shade a stone could be: terra-cotta, sea green, lavender, blue gray, dull gold. The tide line was strewn with huge driftwood trees, bleached bone white in the salt waves, some piled together against the edge of the forest fringe, some lying solitary, just out of reach of the waves. There was a brisk wind coming off the waves, cool and briny. Pelicans floated on the swells while seagulls and a lone eagle wheeled above them. The clouds still circled the sky, threatening to invade at any moment, but for now the sun shone bravely in its halo of blue sky. We picked our way down to the beach, Mike leading the way to a ring of driftwood logs that had obviously been used for parties like ours before. There was a fire circle already in place, filled with black ashes. Eric and the boy I thought was named Ben gathered broken branches of driftwood from the drier piles against the forest edge, and soon had a teepee-shaped construction built atop the old cinders. \"Have you ever seen a driftwood fire?\" Mike asked me. I was sitting on one of the bone-colored benches; the other girls clustered, gossiping excitedly, on either side of me. Mike kneeled by the fire, lighting one of the smaller sticks with a cigarette lighter. \"No,\" I said as he placed the blazing twig carefully against the teepee.  \"You'll like this then \u2014 watch the colors.\" He lit another small branch and laid it alongside the first. The flames started to lick quickly up the dry wood. \"It's blue,\" I said in surprise. \"The salt does it. Pretty, isn't it?\" He lit one more piece, placed it where the fire hadn't yet caught, and then came to sit by me. Thankfully, Jess was on his other side. She turned to him and claimed his attention.  I watched the strange blue and green flames crackle toward the sky. After a half hour of chatter, some of the boys wanted to hike to the nearby tidal pools. It was a dilemma. On the one hand, I loved the tide pools. They had fascinated me since I was a child; they were one of the only things I ever looked forward to when I had to come to Forks. On the other hand, I'd also fallen into them a lot. Not a big deal when you're seven and with your dad. It reminded me of Edward's request \u2014 that I not fall into the ocean. Lauren was the one who made my decision for me. She didn't want to hike, and she was definitely wearing the wrong shoes for it. Most of the other girls besides Angela and Jessica decided to stay on the beach as well. I waited until Tyler and Eric had committed to remaining with them before I got up quietly to join the pro-hiking group. Mike gave me a huge smile when he saw that I was coming. The hike wasn't too long, though I hated to lose the sky in the woods.  The green light of the forest was strangely at odds with the adolescent laughter, too murky and ominous to be in harmony with the light banter around me. I had to watch each step I took very carefully, avoiding roots below and branches above, and I soon fell behind. Eventually I broke through the emerald confines of the forest and found the rocky shore again. It was low tide, and a tidal river flowed past us on its way to the sea. Along its pebbled banks, shallow pools that never completely drained were teeming with life. I was very cautious not to lean too far over the little ocean ponds. The others were fearless, leaping over the rocks, perching precariously on the edges. I found a very stable-looking rock on the fringe of one of the largest pools and sat there cautiously, spellbound by the natural aquarium below me. The bouquets of brilliant anemones undulated ceaselessly in the invisible current, twisted shells scurried about the edges, obscuring the crabs within them, starfish stuck motionless to the rocks and each other, while one small black eel with white racing stripes wove through the bright green weeds, waiting for the sea to return. I was completely absorbed, except for one small part of my mind that wondered what Edward was doing now, and trying to imagine what he would be saying if he were here with me. Finally the boys were hungry, and I got up stiffly to follow them back. I tried to keep up better this time through the woods, so naturally I fell a few times. I got some shallow scrapes on my palms, and the knees of my jeans were stained green, but it could have been worse.  When we got back to First Beach, the group we'd left behind had multiplied. As we got closer we could see the shining, straight black hair and copper skin of the newcomers, teenagers from the reservation come to socialize. The food was already being passed around, and the boys hurried to claim a share while Eric introduced us as we each entered the driftwood circle.  Angela and I were the last to arrive, and, as Eric said our names, I noticed a younger boy sitting on the stones near the fire glance up at me in interest. I sat down next to Angela, and Mike brought us sandwiches and an array of sodas to choose from, while a boy who looked to be the oldest of the visitors rattled off the names of the seven others with him. All I caught was that one of the girls was also named Jessica, and the boy who noticed me was named Jacob. It was relaxing to sit with Angela; she was a restful kind of person to be around \u2014 she didn't feel the need to fill every silence with chatter.  She left me free to think undisturbed while we ate. And I was thinking about how disjointedly time seemed to flow in Forks, passing in a blur at times, with single images standing out more clearly than others. And then, at other times, every second was significant, etched in my mind. I knew exactly what caused the difference, and it disturbed me. During lunch the clouds started to advance, slinking across the blue sky, darting in front of the sun momentarily, casting long shadows across the beach, and blackening the waves. As they finished eating, people started to drift away in twos and threes. Some walked down to the edge of the waves, trying to skip rocks across the choppy surface. Others were gathering a second expedition to the tide pools. Mike \u2014 with Jessica shadowing him \u2014 headed up to the one shop in the village. Some of the local kids went with them; others went along on the hike. By the time they all had scattered, I was sitting alone on my driftwood log, with Lauren and Tyler occupying themselves by the CD player someone had thought to bring, and three teenagers from the reservation perched around the circle, including the boy named Jacob and the oldest boy who had acted as spokesperson. A few minutes after Angela left with the hikers, Jacob sauntered over to take her place by my side. He looked fourteen, maybe fifteen, and had long, glossy black hair pulled back with a rubber band at the nape of his neck. His skin was beautiful, silky and russet-colored; his eyes were dark, set deep above the high planes of his cheekbones. He still had just a hint of childish roundness left around his chin. Altogether, a very pretty face. However, my positive opinion of his looks was damaged by the first words out of his mouth. \"You're Isabella Swan, aren't you?\" It was like the first day of school all over again. \"Bella,\" I sighed. \"I'm Jacob Black.\" He held his hand out in a friendly gesture. \"You bought my dad's truck.\" \"Oh,\" I said, relieved, shaking his sleek hand. \"You're Billy's son. I probably should remember you.\" \"No, I'm the youngest of the family \u2014 you would remember my older sisters.\" \"Rachel and Rebecca,\" I suddenly recalled. Charlie and Billy had thrown us together a lot during my visits, to keep us busy while they fished. We were all too shy to make much progress as friends. Of course, I'd kicked up enough tantrums to end the fishing trips by the time I was eleven. \"Are they here?\" I examined the girls at the ocean's edge, wondering if I would recognize them now. \"No.\" Jacob shook his head. \"Rachel got a scholarship to Washington State, and Rebecca married a Samoan surfer \u2014 she lives in Hawaii now.\" \"Married. Wow.\" I was stunned. The twins were only a little over a year older than I was. \"So how do you like the truck?\" he asked. \"I love it. It runs great.\" \"Yeah, but it's really slow,\" he laughed. \"I was so relived when Charlie bought it. My dad wouldn't let me work on building another car when we had a perfectly good vehicle right there.\" \"It's not that slow,\" I objected. \"Have you tried to go over sixty?\" \"No,\" I admitted. \"Good. Don't.\" He grinned. I couldn't help grinning back. \"It does great in a collision,\" I offered in my truck's defense. \"I don't think a tank could take out that old monster,\" he agreed with another laugh. \"So you build cars?\" I asked, impressed. \"When I have free time, and parts. You wouldn't happen to know where I could get my hands on a master cylinder for a 1986 Volkswagen Rabbit?\" he added jokingly. He had a pleasant, husky voice. \"Sorry,\" I laughed, \"I haven't seen any lately, but I'll keep my eyes open for you.\" As if I knew what that was. He was very easy to talk with. He flashed a brilliant smile, looking at me appreciatively in a way I was learning to recognize. I wasn't the only one who noticed. \"You know Bella, Jacob?\" Lauren asked \u2014 in what I imagined was an insolent tone \u2014 from across the fire. \"We've sort of known each other since I was born,\" he laughed, smiling at me again. \"How nice.\" She didn't sound like she thought it was nice at all, and her pale, fishy eyes narrowed. \"Bella,\" she called again, watching my face carefully, \"I was just saying to Tyler that it was too bad none of the Cullens could come out today. Didn't anyone think to invite them?\" Her expression of concern was unconvincing. \"You mean Dr. Carlisle Cullen's family?\" the tall, older boy asked before I could respond, much to Lauren's irritation. He was really closer to a man than a boy, and his voice was very deep. \"Yes, do you know them?\" she asked condescendingly, turning halfway toward him. \"The Cullens don't come here,\" he said in a tone that closed the subject, ignoring her question. Tyler, trying to win back her attention, asked Lauren's opinion on a CD he held. She was distracted. I stared at the deep-voiced boy, taken aback, but he was looking away toward the dark forest behind us. He'd said that the Cullens didn't come here, but his tone had implied something more \u2014 that they weren't allowed; they were prohibited. His manner left a strange impression on me, and I tried to ignore it without success. Jacob interrupted my meditation. \"So is Forks driving you insane yet?\" \"Oh, I'd say that's an understatement.\" I grimaced. He grinned understandingly. I was still turning over the brief comment on the Cullens, and I had a sudden inspiration. It was a stupid plan, but I didn't have any better ideas. I hoped that young Jacob was as yet inexperienced around girls, so that he wouldn't see through my sure-to-be-pitiful attempts at flirting. \"Do you want to walk down the beach with me?\" I asked, trying to imitate that way Edward had of looking up from underneath his eyelashes. It couldn't have nearly the same effect, I was sure, but Jacob jumped up willingly enough. As we walked north across the multihued stones toward the driftwood seawall, the clouds finally closed ranks across the sky, causing the sea to darken and the temperature to drop. I shoved my hands deep into the pockets of my jacket. \"So you're, what, sixteen?\" I asked, trying not to look like an idiot as I fluttered my eyelids the way I'd seen girls do on TV. \"I just turned fifteen,\" he confessed, flattered. \"Really?\" My face was full of false surprise. \"I would have thought you were older.\" \"I'm tall for my age,\" he explained. \"Do you come up to Forks much?\" I asked archly, as if I was hoping for a yes. I sounded idiotic to myself. I was afraid he would turn on me with disgust and accuse me of my fraud, but he still seemed flattered. \"Not too much,\" he admitted with a frown. \"But when I get my car finished I can go up as much as I want \u2014 after I get my license,\" he amended.  \"Who was that other boy Lauren was talking to? He seemed a little old to be hanging out with us.\" I purposefully lumped myself in with the youngsters, trying to make it clear that I preferred Jacob. \"That's Sam \u2014 he's nineteen,\" he informed me. \"What was that he was saying about the doctor's family?\" I asked innocently. \"The Cullens? Oh, they're not supposed to come onto the reservation.\" He looked away, out toward James Island, as he confirmed what I'd thought I'd heard in Sam's voice. \"Why not?\" He glanced back at me, biting his lip. \"Oops. I'm not supposed to say anything about that.\" \"Oh, I won't tell anyone, I'm just curious.\" I tried to make my smile alluring, wondering if I was laying it on too thick. He smiled back, though, looking allured. Then he lifted one eyebrow and his voice was even huskier than before. \"Do you like scary stories?\" he asked ominously. \"I love them,\" I enthused, making an effort to smolder at him. Jacob strolled to a nearby driftwood tree that had its roots sticking out like the <em>attenuated</em> legs of a huge, pale spider. He perched lightly on one of the twisted roots while I sat beneath him on the body of the tree. He stared down at the rocks, a smile hovering around the edges of his broad lips. I could see he was going to try to make this good. I focused on keeping the vital interest I felt out of my eyes.  \"Do you know any of our old stories, about where we came from \u2014 the Quileutes, I mean?\" he began. \"Not really,\" I admitted. \"Well, there are lots of legends, some of them claiming to date back to the Flood \u2014 supposedly, the ancient Quileutes tied their canoes to the tops of the tallest trees on the mountain to survive like Noah and the ark.\" He smiled, to show me how little stock he put in the histories. \"Another legend claims that we descended from wolves \u2014 and that the wolves are our brothers still. It's against tribal law to kill them.  \"Then there are the stories about the cold ones.\" His voice dropped a little lower. \"The cold ones?\" I asked, not faking my intrigue now. \"Yes. There are stories of the cold ones as old as the wolf legends, and some much more recent. According to legend, my own great-grandfather knew some of them. He was the one who made the treaty that kept them off our land.\" He rolled his eyes. \"Your great-grandfather?\" I encouraged. \"He was a tribal elder, like my father. You see, the cold ones are the natural enemies of the wolf\u2014well, not the wolf, really, but the wolves that turn into men, like our ancestors. You would call them werewolves.\" \"Werewolves have enemies?\" \"Only one.\" I stared at him earnestly, hoping to disguise my impatience as admiration. \"So you see,\" Jacob continued, \"the cold ones are traditionally our enemies. But this pack that came to our territory during my great-grandfather's time was different. They didn't hunt the way others of their kind did \u2014 they weren't supposed to be dangerous to the tribe. So my great-grandfather made a truce with them. If they would promise to stay off our lands, we wouldn't expose them to the pale-faces.\" He winked at me. \"If they weren't dangerous, then why\u2026 ?\" I tried to understand, struggling not to let him see how seriously I was considering his ghost story. \"There's always a risk for humans to be around the cold ones, even if they're civilized like this clan was. You never know when they might get too hungry to resist.\" He deliberately worked a thick edge of menace into his tone. \"What do you mean, 'civilized'?\" \"They claimed that they didn't hunt humans. They supposedly were somehow able to prey on animals instead.\" I tried to keep my voice casual. \"So how does it fit in with the Cullens? Are they like the cold ones your greatgrandfather met?\" \"No.\" He paused dramatically. \"They are the same ones.\" He must have thought the expression on my face was fear inspired by his story. He smiled, pleased, and continued. \"There are more of them now, a new female and a new male, but the rest are the same. In my great-grandfather's time they already knew of the leader, Carlisle. He'd been here and gone before your people had even arrived.\" He was fighting a smile. \"And what are they?\" I finally asked. \"What are the cold ones?\" He smiled darkly. \"Blood drinkers,\" he replied in a chilling voice. \"Your people call them vampires.\" I stared out at the rough surf after he answered, not sure what my face was exposing. \"You have goose bumps,\" he laughed delightedly. \"You're a good storyteller,\" I complimented him, still staring into the waves. \"Pretty crazy stuff, though, isn't it? No wonder my dad doesn't want us to talk about it to anyone.\" I couldn't control my expression enough to look at him yet. \"Don't worry, I won't give you away.\" \"I guess I just violated the treaty,\" he laughed. \"I'll take it to the grave,\" I promised, and then I shivered. \"Seriously, though, don't say anything to Charlie. He was pretty mad at my dad when he heard that some of us weren't going to the hospital since Dr. Cullen started working there.\" \"I won't, of course not.\" \"So do you think we're a bunch of superstitious natives or what?\" he asked in a playful tone, but with a hint of worry. I still hadn't looked away from the ocean. I turned and smiled at him as normally as I could.  \"No. I think you're very good at telling scary stories, though. I still have goose bumps, see?\" I held up my arm. \"Cool.\" He smiled. And then the sound of the beach rocks clattering against each other warned us that someone was approaching. Our heads snapped up at the same time to see Mike and Jessica about fifty yards away, walking toward us.  \"There you are, Bella,\" Mike called in relief, waving his arm over his head. \"Is that your boyfriend?\" Jacob asked, alerted by the jealous edge in Mike's voice. I was surprised it was so obvious. \"No, definitely not,\" I whispered. I was tremendously grateful to Jacob, and eager to make him as happy as possible. I winked at him, carefully turning away from Mike to do so. He smiled, elated by my inept flirting. \"So when I get my license\u2026\" he began. \"You should come see me in Forks. We could hang out sometime.\" I felt guilty as I said this, knowing that I'd used him. But I really did like Jacob. He was someone I could easily be friends with. Mike had reached us now, with Jessica still a few paces back. I could see his eyes appraising Jacob, and looking satisfied at his obvious youth. \"Where have you been?\" he asked, though the answer was right in front of him. \"Jacob was just telling me some local stories,\" I volunteered. \"It was really interesting.\" I smiled at Jacob warmly, and he grinned back. \"Well,\" Mike paused, carefully reassessing the situation as he watched our camaraderie. \"We're packing up \u2014 it looks like it's going to rain soon.\" We all looked up at the glowering sky. It certainly did look like rain. \"Okay.\" I jumped up. \"I'm coming.\" \"It was nice to see you again,\" Jacob said, and I could tell he was taunting Mike just a bit. \"It really was. Next time Charlie comes down to see Billy, I'll come, too,\" I promised. His grin stretched across his face. \"That would be cool.\" \"And thanks,\" I added earnestly. I pulled up my hood as we tramped across the rocks toward the parking lot. A few drops were beginning to fall, making black spots on the stones where they landed. When we got to the Suburban the others were already loading everything back in. I crawled into the backseat by Angela and Tyler, announcing that I'd already had my turn in the shotgun position. Angela just stared out the window at the escalating storm, and Lauren twisted around in the middle seat to occupy Tyler's attention, so I could simply lay my head back on the seat and close my eyes and try very hard not to think.",

            "en": "Your child\u2019s immunization        At birth, infants have protection against certain diseases because antibodies have passed through the placenta from the mother to the unborn child. After birth, breastfed babies get the continued benefits of additional antibodies in breast milk. But in both cases, the protection is temporary. Immunization (vaccination) is a way of creating immunity to certain diseases by using small amounts of a killed or weakened microorganism that causes the particular disease. Microorganisms can be viruses, such as the measles virus, or they can be bacteria, such as pneumococcus. Vaccines stimulate the immune system to react as if there were a real infection \u2014 it fends off the \"infection\" and remembers the organism so that it can fight it quickly should it enter the body later. Some parents may hesitate to have their kids vaccinated because they're worried that the children will have serious reactions or may get the illness the vaccine is supposed to prevent. Because the components of vaccines are weakened or killed \u2014 and in some cases, only parts of the microorganism are used \u2014 they're unlikely to cause any serious illness. Some vaccines may cause mild reactions, such as soreness where the shot was given or fever, but serious reactions are rare. The risks of vaccinations are small compared with the health risks associated with the diseases they're intended to prevent. The following vaccinations and schedules are recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). Please note that some variations are acceptable and that changes in recommendations frequently occur as new vaccines are developed. The AAP recommends that children get combination vaccines (rather than single vaccines) whenever possible. Many vaccines are offered in combination to help reduce the number of shots a child receives. Your doctor will determine the best vaccinations and schedule for your child. Recommended vaccinations: Hepatitis B Hepatitis B virus (HBV) affects the liver. Those who are infected can become lifelong carriers of the virus and may develop long-term problems such as cirrhosis (liver disease) or cancer of the liver. Immunization schedule Hepatitis B vaccine usually is given as a series of three injections. The first shot is often given to infants shortly after birth. If the mother of a newborn carries the hepatitis B virus in her blood, the infant needs to receive the first shot within 12 hours after birth, along with another shot (HBIG) to immediately provide protection against the virus. If a newborn's mother shows no evidence of HBV in her blood, the infant may receive the hepatitis B vaccine any time prior to leaving the hospital. It may also be delayed until the 1- or 2- month visit to your doctor. If the first dose is given shortly after birth, the second shot is given at 1 to 2 months and the third at 6 to 18 months. For infants who don't receive the first shot until 1 to 2 months, the second shot is given at 3 to 4 months and the third at 6 to 18 months. In either case, the second and third shots are usually given in conjunction with other routine childhood immunizations. Why the vaccine is recommended The hepatitis B vaccine usually creates long-term immunity. Infants who receive the HBV series should be protected from hepatitis B infection not only throughout their childhood but also into the adult years. Eliminating the risk of infection also decreases risk for cirrhosis of the liver, chronic liver disease, and liver cancer. Young adults and adolescents should also receive the vaccine if they did not as infants. Possible risks There is a very small chance of an allergic reaction with any vaccine. Serious problems associated with receiving the HBV vaccine are rare. Problems that do occur tend to be minor, such as fever or redness or tenderness at the injection site. When to delay or avoid immunization * if your child is currently sick, although simple colds or other minor illnesses should not prevent immunization  * if a severe allergic reaction (called anaphylaxis) occurred after a previous injection of the HBV vaccine Caring for your child after immunization The vaccine may cause mild fever, and soreness and redness in the area where the shot was given. Depending on the age of your child, pain and fever may be treated with acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Very young infants should not be given either medication, but for older infants or children, check with the doctor about the appropriate medication and dose. When to call the doctor * if you're not sure of the recommended schedule for the hepatitis B vaccine  * if you have concerns about your own HBV carrier state  * if serious adverse symptom appear after your child has received an HBV injection  Pneumococcal Vaccine (PCV) The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) protects against pneumococcal infections. The bacterium is a leading cause of serious infections, including pneumonia, blood infections, and bacterial meningitis. Children under 2 years old, adults over 65 years old, and people with certain medical conditions are most susceptible to serious pneumococcal infections. The pneumococcus bacterium is spread through person-to-person contact. The vaccine not only prevents the infection in children who receive it, it also helps stop its spread. Immunization schedule PCV immunizations are given as a series of four injections starting at 2 months of age and following at 4 months, 6 months, and 12 to 15 months. Kids who miss the first dose or may have missed subsequent doses due to vaccine shortage should still receive the vaccine, and your doctor can give you a modified schedule for immunization. Why the vaccine is recommended The most serious infections affect children younger than 2 years old, and the vaccine will protect them when they're at greatest risk. PCV also is recommended for kids between 2 and 5 years of age who are at high risk for serious pneumococcal infections because they have medical problems such as: * sickle cell anemia  * a damaged spleen or no spleen  * HIV/AIDS  * cochlear implants  * a disease that affects the immune system, such as diabetes or cancer  * receiving medications that affect the immune system, such as steroids or chemotherapy  * chronic heart or lung disease  In addition, these high-risk children may also receive the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) in addition to the PCV when they're older than 24 months. Possible risks Children who receive the PCV vaccine may have redness, tenderness, or swelling where the shot was given. A child may also have a fever after receiving the shot. There is a very small chance of an allergic reaction with any vaccine.  When to delay or avoid immunization * if your child is currently sick, although simple colds or other minor illnesses should not prevent immunization  * if your child has had a severe allergic reaction to a previous dose of the vaccine  Caring for your child after immunization The vaccine may cause mild fever, and soreness and redness in the area where the shot was given. Depending on the age of your child, pain and fever may be treated with acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Check with your doctor to see if you can give either medication, and to find out the appropriate dose. When to call the doctor * if your child missed a dose in the series  * if a severe allergic reaction or high fever occurs after immunization DTaP The DTaP vaccine protects against: * diphtheria \u2014 a serious infection of the throat that can block the airway and cause severe breathing difficulty  * tetanus \u2014 a nerve disease, which can occur at any age, caused by toxin-producing bacteria contaminating a wound  * pertussis (whooping cough) \u2014 a respiratory illness with cold symptoms that progress to severe coughing (the \"whooping\" sound occurs when the child breathes in deeply after a severe coughing bout); serious complications of pertussis can occur in children under 1 year of age, and those under 6 months old are especially susceptible. Teens and adults with a persistent cough may not realize they have pertussis, and may pass it to vulnerable infants.  Immunization schedule DTaP immunizations are given as a series of five injections and are usually administered at ages 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 15 to 18 months, and 4 to 6 years. After the initial series of immunizations, a vaccine called Tdap (the booster shot) should be given at ages 11 to 12, or to older teens and adults who haven't yet received a booster with pertussis coverage. Then, Td (tetanus and diphtheria) boosters are recommended every 10 years.  Why the vaccine is recommended Use of the DTaP vaccine has virtually eliminated diphtheria and tetanus in childhood and has markedly reduced the number of pertussis cases. Possible risks The vaccine frequently causes mild side effects: fever, mild crankiness, tiredness, loss of appetite, and tenderness, redness, or swelling in the area where the shot was given. Rarely, seizures or allergic reactions can occur following DTaP. Most of these side effects result from the pertussis component of the vaccine. Severe complications caused by DTaP immunization are rare. Most kids have little or no problem. When to delay or avoid immunization * if your child is currently sick, although simple colds or other minor illnesses should not prevent immunization  * if your child has an uncontrolled seizure disorder or certain neurologic diseases or seems not to be developing normally \u2014 the pertussis component of the vaccine may not be given, and your child may receive a DT (diphtheria and tetanus) vaccine instead  If your child experienced any of the following after an earlier DTaP, consult with your doctor before your child receives another injection of the vaccine: * seizures within 7 days after injection  * worsening of seizures  * an allergic reaction after receiving the vaccine, such as mouth, throat, or facial swelling  * difficulty breathing  * temperature of 105\u00b0 Fahrenheit (40.5\u00b0 Celsius) or higher during the first 2 days after injection  * shock or collapse during the first 2 days after injection  * persistent, uncontrolled crying that lasts for more than 3 hours during the first 2 days after injection  Caring for your child after immunization Your child may experience fever, soreness, and some swelling and redness in the area where the shot was given. Depending on the age of your child, pain and fever may be treated with acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Check with your doctor to see if you can give either medication, and to find out the appropriate dose. A warm, damp cloth or a heating pad also may help reduce soreness. Moving or using the limb that has received the injection often reduces the soreness. When to call the doctor * if you aren't sure whether the vaccine should be postponed or avoided. Children who have had certain problems with the DTaP vaccine usually can safely receive the DT vaccine.  * if complications or severe symptoms develop after immunization, including seizures, fever above 105\u00b0 Fahrenheit (40.5\u00b0 Celsius), difficulty breathing or other signs of allergy, shock or collapse, or uncontrolled crying for more than 3 hours  Hib Haemophilus influenzae type b bacteria were the leading cause of meningitis in children under 5 years until the Hib vaccine became available. Immunization schedule The Hib vaccine is given by injection at ages 2 months, 4 months, and 6 months (however, some of the Hib vaccines do not require a dose at 6 months). A booster dose is given at 12 to 15 months. Why the vaccine is recommended The vaccine provides long-term protection from Haemophilus influenzae type b. Those immunized have protection against Hib meningitis, pneumonia, pericarditis (an infection of the membrane covering the heart), and infections of the blood, bones, and joints caused by the bacteria. Possible risks Minor problems, such as redness, swelling, or tenderness where the shot was given, may occur. There is a very small chance of an allergic reaction with any vaccine. When to delay or avoid immunization * if your child is currently sick, although simple colds or other minor illnesses should not prevent immunization  * if severe allergic reaction occurs after an injection of the Hib vaccine, further Hib immunizations may not be given to your child  Caring for your child after immunization The vaccine may cause mild soreness and redness in the area where the shot was given. Depending on the age of your child, pain and fever may be treated with acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Check with your doctor to see if you can give either medication, and to find out the appropriate dose. When to call the doctor * if you aren't sure whether the vaccine should be postponed or avoided  * if serious adverse reactions appear after the Hib injection  IPV Polio is a viral infection that can result in permanent paralysis. Immunization schedule The inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) is usually given at ages 2 months, 4 months, 6 to 18 months, and 4 to 6 years. Until recently, the oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) was given in the United States. Updated recommendations by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices now call for IPV injections. This change eliminates the previous small risk of developing polio after receiving the live oral polio vaccine. Why the vaccine is recommended The vaccine offers protection against polio, which can cause paralysis and death. Possible risks Side effects include fever and redness or soreness at the site of injection. There is a very small chance of an allergic reaction with any vaccine. When to delay or avoid immunization * IPV should not be given to kids with severe allergy to neomycin, streptomycin, or polymyxin B.  * IPV should not be given to kids who had a severe allergic reaction to a previous IPV shot.  Caring for your child after immunization IPV may cause mild fever, and soreness and redness at the site of the injection for several days. Depending on the age of your child, pain and fever may be treated with acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Check with your doctor to see if you can give either medication, and to find out the appropriate dose. When to call the doctor * if you aren't sure whether the vaccine should be postponed or avoided  * if severe adverse reactions occur after the immunization Influenza Influenza, or \"the flu,\" is a highly contagious viral infection of the respiratory tract. Immunization schedule Beginning in the 2010-2011 flu season, the seasonal flu vaccine protects against H1N1 flu, as well as other flu viruses. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the flu vaccine for all people age 6 months and older. Certain people are at higher risk of complications from the flu. They include: * pregnant women  * children younger than age 5, especially those younger than 2  * people age 65 and older  * people of any age who have chronic health conditions  Infants younger than 6 months are too young to receive the vaccine, but all other high risk persons should be vaccinated. Health care workers, caregivers, and close contacts of at-risk persons (including those who care for infants younger than 6 months) should also get the flu vaccine. In the past, there have been times when there were vaccine shortages and delays. So talk with your doctor about availability. For kids younger than 9 who are getting the seasonal influenza vaccine for the first time or did not get the H1N1 vaccine during the 2009-2010 flu season, it's given in two separate shots a month apart. It can take about 2 weeks after the shot is given for the body to build up protection against the flu. A non-shot option called the nasal mist vaccine came on the market in 2003 for the seasonal flu and is now approved for use in healthy 2- to 49-year-olds. The nasal mist contains live but weakened virus that will not cause the flu. However, the vaccine isn't recommended for kids with certain medical conditions or pregnant women. Talk to your doctor about which vaccine is right for your child. Why the vaccine is recommended The flu vaccine reduces a person's chances of catching the flu by up to 80% during the season. Getting the shot before the flu season is in full force gives the body a chance to build up immunity to, or protection from, the virus. The shot usually becomes available between September and mid-November. Although you can get a flu shot well into flu season, it's best to try to get it earlier rather than later. However, later in the flu season, it's still a good idea to get protection. Even if you or your child got the seasonal flu vaccine last year, that won't protect you from getting the seasonal flu this year, because the protection wears off and flu viruses constantly change. That's why the vaccine is updated each year to include the most current strains of the virus. A good example of how flu viruses change (and sometimes develop new strains) was the outbreak of the H1N1 flu in 2009. This flu strain was not included in the 2009-2010 seasonal flu vaccine, so a separate H1N1 flu vaccine was developed. Since then, the H1N1 flu shot has been incorporated into the seasonal flu shot.  Possible risks Usually given as an injection in the upper arm, the flu shot contains killed flu viruses that will not cause someone to get the flu, but will cause the body to make antibodies to fight off a live flu virus if it does enter the body.  Some of the most common side effects from the flu shot are soreness, redness, or swelling at the site of the injection. A low-grade fever and aches are also possible. Because the nasal spray flu vaccine is made from live viruses, it may cause mild flu-like symptoms, including runny nose, headache, vomiting, muscle aches, and fever. Very rarely, the flu vaccine can cause serious side effects such as a severe allergic reaction. When to delay or avoid immunization People who should not get the seasonal flu shot include: * infants under 6 months old  * anyone who's severely allergic to eggs and egg products. Tell the doctor if your child is allergic before he or she gets a flu shot. * anyone who's ever had a severe reaction to a flu vaccination  * anyone who's had Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS, a rare medical condition that affects the nerves)  * anyone with a severe illness Caring for your child after immunization Pain and fever may be treated with acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Check with your doctor to see if you can give either medication, and to find out the appropriate dose. Some doctors recommend a dose just before the immunization. A warm, damp cloth or a heating pad also may help minimize soreness. Moving or using the limb that has received the injection often reduces the soreness as well. When to call the doctor * if you aren't sure if the vaccine should be postponed or avoided  * if there are serious problems after the immunization, such as an allergic reaction, high fever, or other concern  MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) The MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps, and rubella (German measles). MMR vaccinations are given by injection in two doses. The first is administered at age 12 to 15 months; the second generally is given at age 4 to 6 years. Why the vaccine is recommended Measles, mumps, and rubella are infections that can lead to significant illness. More than 95% of children receiving MMR will be protected from the three diseases throughout their lives. Possible risks Serious problems such as allergic reactions are rare. Potential mild to moderate adverse effects include rash, fever, swollen cheeks, febrile seizures, and mild joint pain. When to delay or avoid immunization * if your child is currently sick, although simple colds or other minor illnesses should not prevent immunization  * if your child has an allergy to gelatin or to the antibiotic neomycin, check with your doctor about immunization  * if your child had a severe allergic reaction to a previous dose of MMR vaccine  * if your child has recently received gamma globulin or a blood transfusion, check with your doctor about immunization  * if your child has a medical problem that affects the immune system, such as cancer  * if your child is taking prednisone, steroids, or other immunosuppressive drugs  * if your child is undergoing chemotherapy or radiation therapy  * if your child has ever had a low platelet count, check with your doctor about immunization  * pregnant women should wait until after delivery for the vaccine  Caring for your child after immunization If a rash develops without other symptoms, no treatment is necessary and it should resolve within several days. Pain and fever may be treated with acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Check with your doctor to see if you can give either medication, and find out the appropriate dose. When to call the doctor * if you aren't sure if the vaccine should be postponed or avoided  * if there are problems after the immunization  Varicella (chickenpox) The varicella vaccine protects against chickenpox (varicella), a common and very contagious childhood viral illness. Immunization schedule The varicella vaccine is given by injection between the ages of 12 and 15 months, followed by a booster shot at 4 to 6 years of age for further protection. Older kids under the age of 13 years who have not had chickenpox may also receive the vaccine, with the two doses given at least 3 months apart. Kids 13 years or older who have not had either chickenpox or the vaccine need two vaccine doses at least 1 month apart. Why the vaccine is recommended The varicella vaccine prevents severe illness in almost all children who are immunized. It's up to 85% effective in preventing mild illness. Vaccinated kids who do get chickenpox generally have a mild case. Possible risks Serious reactions such as allergic reactions are extremely rare. Possible mild effects are tenderness and redness where the shot was given, fever, fatigue, and a varicella-like illness. A rash can occur up to 1 month after the injection. It may last for several days but will disappear on its own without treatment. There is a very small risk of febrile seizures after vaccination. When to delay or avoid immunization * if your child is currently sick, although simple colds or other minor illnesses should not prevent immunization  * if your child has an allergy to gelatin or to the antibiotic neomycin  * if your child had a severe allergic reaction to a previous dose of varicella vaccine  * if your child has recently received gamma globulin or a blood transfusion, talk to your doctor about immunization  * if your child has a disorder that affects the immune system, such as cancer; is taking prednisone, steroids, or other immunosuppressive drugs; or is undergoing chemotherapy or radiation therapy  * pregnant women should wait until after delivery for vaccination  Caring for your child after immunization Pain and fever may be treated with acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Check with your doctor to see if you can give either medication, and find out the appropriate dose. When to call the doctor * if you aren't sure if the vaccine should be postponed or avoided  * if there are problems after the immunization MCV4 The meningitis vaccine protects against meningococcal disease, a serious bacterial infection that can lead to bacterial meningitis. The vaccine is recommended for kids at age 11 or 12 years, at ages 13 to 18 years if not previously vaccinated, and older teens who are entering college and will be living in a dormitory setting, and those entering the military. It is also recommended for children between the ages of 2 and 10 with certain high risk medical problems. When medical problems continue, these kids also need a follow-up booster dose a few years later, depending on the age at which the first dose was given. Why the vaccine is recommended Bacterial meningitis, an inflammation of the membrane that protects the brain and spinal cord, is a rare but highly contagious disease that can spread rapidly among kids who are in close quarters. It can be life-threatening if not promptly treated. Possible risks Some of the most common side effects are swelling, redness, and pain at the site of the injection, along with headache, fever, or fatigue. Severe problems, such as allergic reactions, are rare. When to delay or avoid immunization * if your child has had allergic reactions to the DTaP vaccine or to latex  * if your child has a history of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, a disease of the nervous system which causes progressive weakness  * if your child is currently sick, although simple colds or other minor illnesses should not prevent immunization Caring for your child after immunization Your child may experience fever, soreness, and some swelling and redness in the area where the shot was given. Pain and fever may be treated with acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Check with your doctor to see if you can give either medication, and to find out the appropriate dose. A warm, damp cloth or a heating pad also may help reduce soreness. Moving or using the limb that has received the injection often reduces the soreness. When to Call the Doctor * if you aren't sure if the vaccine should be postponed or avoided  * if there are problems after the immunization Hepatitis A The hepatitis A virus (HAV) causes fever, nausea, vomiting, and jaundice, and can lead to community-wide epidemics. Childcare centers are a common site of outbreaks. The vaccine is recommended for children 12 to 23 months old, followed by a second dose 6 months later. Although in the past the vaccine was recommended for older kids and adults who were at high risk for the disease (such as those who lived in or traveled to locations with high rates of HAV), the vaccine is now recommended for anyone who desires immunity to the disease. Why the vaccine is recommended Vaccination against HAV can help stop epidemics from developing in the community, in addition to protecting the individual child. Some infected children do not have any symptoms, and can spread the virus to others. The more young children who are vaccinated against HAV, the more limited the spread of disease will be in a community. Possible risks Side effects are usually mild fever, and tenderness, swelling, and redness at the site of the injection. Allergic reactions to the vaccine are rare. When to delay or avoid immunization * if your child is currently sick, although simple colds or other minor illnesses should not prevent immunization * if your child had an allergic reaction to the first dose of hepatitis A vaccine  Caring for your child after immunization Your child may experience fever, soreness, and some swelling and redness in the area where the shot was given. Pain and fever may be treated with acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Check with your doctor to see if you can give either medication, and to find out. When to call the doctor * if you aren't sure if the vaccine should be postponed or avoided  * if there are problems after the immunization  Rotavirus Rotavirus is a common virus that causes diarrhea, especially in infants and young children. Childcare centers are a common site of outbreaks. The vaccine, which is a liquid given by mouth, is recommended at ages 2 and 4 months, as well as a dose at 6 months depending on the brand vaccine used. Why the vaccine is recommended Rotavirus can cause dehydration secondary to large amounts of diarrhea, and can result in children requiring hospitalization. Vaccination against rotavirus can help stop spread in the community, in addition to protecting the individual child. Possible risks Side effects can include diarrhea and vomiting, in addition to fever. When to delay or avoid immunization * if your child is currently sick, although simple colds should not prevent immunization  * if your child had an allergic reaction to a previous dose of the vaccine  * let the doctor know if your child has an allergy to latex * if your child has an abnormality of the digestive system or a gastrointestinal disease, talk to your doctor about immunization  * if your child has a history of intussusception, a type of serious bowel blockage, talk to your doctor about immunization  * if your child has recently received gamma globulin or a blood transfusion  * if your child has immune system problems from a disease such as cancer; is taking steroids or other immunosuppressive drugs; or is undergoing chemotherapy or radiation therapy  Caring for your child after immunization Depending on the age of your child, fever may be treated with acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Check with your doctor to see if you can give either medication, and to find out the appropriate dose. If vomiting or diarrhea occur, make sure to give your child frequent amounts of fluid and watch for signs of dehydration, such as less urine than usual. When to call the doctor * if you aren't sure if the vaccine should be postponed or avoided  * if there are problems after the immunization  HPV Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) that causes genital warts and changes in the cervix that can result in cervical cancer. The vaccine is given as a series of three shots over a 6-month period and is recommended for girls 11 or 12 years old, as well as for older girls who are unvaccinated. The vaccine can also be given to boys ages 9 through 18 years, to prevent the development of genital warts.  Why the vaccine is recommended Because HPV can cause serious problems such as genital warts and cervical cancer, a vaccine is an important step in preventing infection and protecting against the spread of HPV. It works best when given before a girl becomes sexually active. Possible risks Side effects are usually mild fever and tenderness, swelling, and redness at the site of the injection. Dizziness, fainting, nausea, and vomiting may also occur after the shot. Allergic reactions to the vaccine occur rarely. When to delay or avoid immunization * if your daughter is currently sick, although simple colds or other minor illnesses should not prevent immunization  * if your daughter had an allergic reaction to the first dose of HPV vaccine  * if your daughter has had a severe allergic reaction to yeast  * if your daughter is pregnant  * if your daughter has a bleeding disorder (discuss with your hematologist)  Caring for your child after immunization Your child may experience fever, soreness, and some swelling and redness in the area where the shot was given. Pain and fever may be treated with acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Check with your doctor to see if you can give either medication, and find out the appropriate dose. When to call the doctor * if you aren't sure if the vaccine should be postponed or avoided  * if there are problems after the immunization  Immunization schedule This immunization schedule is a handy reference to help you keep track of which vaccines your child needs to receive and when. Types of vaccines Some types of vaccines are: 1. <em>Attenuated</em> (weakened) live viruses are used in some vaccines such as in the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.  2. Killed (inactivated) viruses or bacteria are used in some vaccines, such as in IPV.  3. Toxoid vaccines contain an inactivated toxin produced by the bacterium. For example, the diphtheria and tetanus vaccines are toxoid vaccines.  4. Conjugate vaccines (such as Hib) contain parts of bacteria combined with proteins.  Immunizations for travel Specific information about which immunizations are required by travelers to each country worldwide is available directly from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Ask your doctor for more information. Depending on the type and length of travel, some vaccines may be recommended. Most immunizations should be given at least 1 month before travel. Take your child's immunization records with you when you travel internationally. Helping kids through vaccine injections Sometimes it's hard to tell who dreads immunizations more \u2014 parents or kids. Here are some tips to help make the procedure easier for everyone: * Tell older kids what's going to happen and that the shot helps to keep them healthy.  * Tell younger kids that it's OK to cry, but also encourage them to be brave. * Try to be calm yourself. Your child can pick up on your concerns.  * Distraction at the moment of the injection is helpful. Try having kids count, sing a song with you, or look away (perhaps at a picture on the wall). You may want to have a joke or funny comment ready.  * Offer praise after the injection is over.  * Plan something fun for after the appointment. A trip to the park or playground can make the overall immunization experience less unpleasant.  As uneasy as getting vaccinated may make both you and your child, remember that immunizations are one of the best means of protection against contagious diseases.",
