Rescuers found no survivors when they reached the site of the crash, Cuba's Civil Aviation Authority said.  The state-run Aerocaribbean aircraft had been flying from the eastern city of <em>Santiago</em> de Cuba to Havana. The passengers included 28 foreigners. The other 33 passengers and seven crew members were all Cuban. There is no word on the cause of the crash. The French-built ATR twin turboprop went down late on Thursday local time in mountains near the town of Guasimal in Santi Spiritus province. Many of the 61 passengers it was carrying are believed to have been tourists. A Civil Aviation Authority statement said the foreigners on the passenger list included nine Argentines, seven Mexicans, three Dutch citizens, two Germans, two Austrians, a French citizen, an Italian, a Spaniard, a Venezuelan and a Japanese citizen.  The twice-weekly flight 883 had originated in Port-au-Prince in Haiti and stopped over in <em>Santiago</em>. The pilot reported an emergency before contact was lost. Emergency crews and local residents had to use bulldozers to cut through thick vegetation to reach the crash scene, Cuban media say.  They pulled bodies from the wreckage but found no-one alive. One eyewitness described the crash site as \"a ball of flame in the middle of the mountain\". It is not clear if bad weather was a factor in the crash. A tropical storm warning had been issued in <em>Santiago</em> de Cuba province where the plane took off. \"At the moment, aviation and regional authorities are gathering the facts and details and have created a commission to investigate such a regrettable accident,\" the Civil Aviation Authority statement said.",

            "en": "Search For Survivors Continues After Chile Massive Quake       Rescue workers are tearing through the rubble in search of survivors in Chile Sunday, a day after a massive earthquake shattered the country's central region.  The 8.8 magnitude quake struck the South American country Saturday in the early morning hours.  Many Chileans have continued to stay out of their homes because of the jolting series of aftershocks, some as strong as 6.9 magnitude. The quake has killed more than 300 people and damaged as many as 1.5 million homes. Officials say the death toll is expected to rise. Rescuers are working to reach about a 100 people trapped in an apartment building that collapsed in Concepcion, the country's second-largest city. The main rescue operation is centered in the city, about 100 kilometers from the epicenter of the quake. Looters ransacked stores in Concepcion Sunday, stealing both food and electrical appliances. Police used tear gas and water cannons to disperse a crowd of looters at one supermarket. Chilean President Michelle Bachelet declared a \"state of catastrophe\" in central Chile, where the quake toppled buildings, overturned cars and brought down power and phone lines.  Bridges fell and many streets were covered with rubble. Fires were reported. Several hospitals collapsed. The president has not asked for assistance from other countries, but several nations have offered to send aid. Speaking at the Vatican Sunday, Pope Benedict said he is praying for the people of Chile and other populations in the Pacific tested by the calamity.  The earthquake has raised a daunting first challenge for billionaire Sebastian Pinera, who was elected Chile's president in January. He takes office in two weeks. Chile's children who were preparing to return to school Monday at the end of their summer break have had their vacation extended another week. In the capital, <em>Santiago</em>, officials closed the international airport because of damage. Argentina and other parts of South America also felt the earthquake. While cell phone communication was knocked out by the quake, many people used social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook to reach out to friends and loved ones. The U.S. Geological Survey says an earthquake with a magnitude of 8 or more is classified as a \"great\" earthquake that can cause tremendous damage.  The biggest earthquake ever recorded struck the same area of Chile in 1960. It had a magnitude of 9.5 and also set off a tsunami, which had devastating effects in Pacific countries including Japan and the Philippines, where at least 1,600 people were killed.",

            "en": "Five Reasons Why Inter Beat Bayern Munich    1) Diego Milito It\u2019s not hard to figure out that the 30-year-old was an important factor, simply by looking at the scoreboard.  You\u2019ll see the Argentine\u2019s name not once, but twice as he continued his penchant of scoring in big matches.  His goals clinched all three of Inter\u2019s titles this season \u2013 the Coppa Italia, Serie A and now the Champions League.  President Massimo Moratti\u2019s dream has been realised in no small part due to his efforts.  At Real Zaragoza and Genoa he proved to be a capable scorer, but at Inter he displayed a world-class pedigree at the top level and will hope to carry that into the World Cup.  2) Bayern\u2019s Weak Defense Milito clincially took both his chances with great aplomb, but also exposed FC Hollywood\u2019s centre-backs, a weakness that had been highlighted throughout the season in Europe\u2019s top competition, even against Manchester United and Fiorentina, and an Achilles heel that Goal.com\u2019s Ewan Macdonald pinpointed before the match. In the first instance, he beat Martin Demichelis in the air before playing a give-and-go with Wesley Sneijder and completed his brace when he left Daniel van Buyten for dead. 3) Motivation Of course both sides had their motivations, but in reality it may have propelled the Beneamata further than the Bavarians on the day. As Goal.com\u2019s Peter Staunton reports, Mourinho was motivated to defeat former mentor Louis van Gaal and win \u2018the war\u2019 with Italy.  The players were motivated by history \u2013 an Italian club\u2019s first-ever treble season and patron Massimo Moratti motivated to replicate his father\u2019s success.  Eto\u2019o determined to succeed somewhere other than Barcelona, Lucio resolute in overcoming the side that let him go, Sneijder unwavering in his goal to succeed at the <em>Santiago</em> Bernabeu, the list goes on...  4) Selfless Style Of Play It may not be the most pretty football to watch \u2013 Arsenal or Barcelona will offer you more of a spectacle \u2013 but the Nerazzurri proved they are the most effective in 2009-10 by working hard and diligently for one another.  Samuel Eto\u2019o is a true example, having given up his goalscoring instincts for a spot on the wing, Lucio and Walter Samuel threw their bodies on the line time and time again, Javier Zanetti dug deep to find the energy reserves to cover men and ground, and even Maicon curbed his attacking enthusiasm on Saturday evening.  5) Jose Mourinho Yes, you all knew this list would end with \u2018The Special One\u2019.  Tactically he was spot on once again \u2013 denying Bayern space in the attacking third, keeping their opportunities to a minimum, and of course ending their hopes \u2013 as he did to Chelsea, CSKA Moscow and former champions Barcelona.  Now on his way to Real Madrid, he leaves a legacy in Milan having won a historic treble that the fans will remember for years to come. His time in Serie A was anything but smooth, but in the end it was a boost for himself, the club and the country.",

            "en": "Many obstacles to a final Middle East peace deal      \n \n15 October 2010 Last updated at 02:14 GMT  Three of the 33 men rescued after 69 days trapped in the San Jose mine in Chile have been discharged from hospital and allowed to go home. The three, who were not officially identified, left in a white car amid tight security. Doctors said all the miners had responded well to treatment and many more of them would go home on Friday. Earlier President Sebastian Pinera visited them and promised to stamp out \"inhuman\" working conditions in Chile. Copiapo hospital's deputy medical director Dr Jorge Montes the three men who left would be allowed to carry out physical activity and would need sunglasses only if they were exposed to intense light. However, he warned that \"the psychological condition of the patients is something we cannot predict\". Dramatic rescue The miners had been told they would need to be held in the hospital for 48 hours but Health Minister Jaime Manalich announced earlier that their condition was so good that many would be able to leave within 24 hours. He said their condition was nothing short of a miracle. Some of the men have been given dental surgery and two have the lung disease, silicosis: Mario Sepulveda, the second miner to have been rescued, and Mario Gomez, 63, who is on a course of antibiotics for pneumonia. The men were hauled to the surface one at a time in a complicated and dramatic operation that took about 22 hours from the time the first miner reached the ground to when the last miner surfaced. They were winched up a narrow shaft in a metal capsule from where they had been trapped 625m (2,050 feet) below ground since the mine partially collapsed on 5 August. \"The trip up was calm,\" said rescued miner Richard Villarroel. \"Everything was well prepared. I came up listening to music.\" He and the 32 other miners have set a world record for surviving the longest time trapped underground. As they arrived at the surface, each miner was greeted by President Pinera, who promised a review that would lead to a \"very radical change\" affecting the health and safety of workers in mining as well as the transport, fishing and construction industries. He said it was impossible to guarantee that Chile would never face such an accident in the future. \"But we can guarantee one thing: never again in our country will we allow working in conditions so inhuman and so unsafe as happened in the San Jose mine and many other places in our country.\" He told the miners there will be a big celebration for them on 25 October, in the capital <em>Santiago</em>. He also invited them for a game of football the same day against the officials who had helped rescue them.  Mr Pinera joked that the winners would be allowed to live at the presidential palace, La Moneda, while the losers would have to go back down the mine. Offers The miners survived the first 17 days of their ordeal by eking out rations that were meant to last just a few days before rescuers found them via a probe lowered down a bore hole about the width of a grapefruit. Food and other supplies were lowered to the men while they waited for a larger shaft to be drilled for their rescue. Now that the men are safe, thoughts have turned to their emotional wellbeing. An insight into how the miners are adjusting to life above ground has come from a diary written for the BBC by the three children of Omar Reygadas, the 17th to be freed. One of the children, Ximena, has described how her father has become so pale after his 69 days underground that he resembles the cartoon ghost, Casper. \"In general, he's in good spirits. But then when he remembers the first few days after the accident, he starts crying, he gets very upset,\" she wrote. \"But then he pulls himself together and his spirits are high once more.\" The Chilean government has promised to care for the miners for at least six months. Offers and invitations to the men have begun to pour in.  European football clubs Manchester United and Real Madrid have invited the 33 to watch them play and they have also received offers of holidays and TV appearances. They are also expected to receive offers of jobs, advertising deals and book and movie contracts to tell their extraordinary stories http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11547889",
