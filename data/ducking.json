            "en": "7 REPETITION          18. THE FUNERAL I SPRINTED DOWN THE STAIRS AND THREW THE DOOR open. It was Jacob, of course. Even blind, Alice wasn't slow. He was standing about six feet back from the door, his nose wrinkled in distaste, but his face otherwise smooth\u2014masklike. He didn't fool me; I could see the faint trembling of his hands. Hostility rolled off of him in waves. It brought back that awful afternoon when he'd chosen Sam over me, and I felt my chin jerk up defensively in response. Jacob's Rabbit idled by the curb with Jared behind the wheel and Embry in the passenger seat. I understood what this meant: they were afraid to let him come here alone. It made me sad, and a little annoyed. The Cullens weren't like that. \"Hey,\" I finally said when he didn't speak. Jake pursed his lips, still hanging back from the door. His eyes flickered across the front of the house. I ground my teeth. \"She's not here. Do you need something?\" He hesitated. \"You're alone?\" \"Yes.\" I sighed. \"Can I talk to you a minute?\" \"Of course you can, Jacob. Come on in.\" Jacob glanced over his shoulder at his friends in the car. I saw Embry shake his head just a tiny bit. For some reason, this bugged me to no end. My teeth clenched together again. \"Chicken\" I mumbled under my breath. Jake's eyes flashed back to me, his thick, black brows pushing into a furious angle over \u00a0his deep-set eyes. His jaw set, and he marched\u2014there was no other way to describe the way he moved\u2014up the sidewalk and shrugged past me into the house. I locked gazes with first Jared and then Embry\u2014I didn't like the hard way they eyed me; did they really think I would let anything hurt Jacob?\u2014before I shut the door on them. Jacob was in the hall behind me, staring at the mess of blankets in the living room. \"Slumber party?\" he asked, his tone sarcastic. \"Yeah,\" I answered with the same level of acid. I didn't like Jacob when he acted this way. \"What's it to you? He wrinkled his nose again like he smelled something unpleasant. \"Where's your friend'?\" I could hear the quotation marks in his tone. \"She had some errands to run. Look, Jacob, what do you want?\" Something about the room seemed to make him edgier\u2014his long arms were quivering. He didn't answer my question. Instead he moved on to the kitchen, his restless eyes darting everywhere. I followed him. He paced back and forth along the short counter. \"Hey,\" I said, putting myself in his way. He stopped pacing and stared down at me. \"What's your problem?\" \"I don't like having to be here.\" That stung. I winced, and his eyes tightened. \"Then I'm sorry you had to come,\" I muttered. \"Why don't you tell me what you need so you can leave?\" \"I just have to ask you a couple of questions. It shouldn't take long. We have to get back for the funeral.\" \"Okay. Get it over with then.\" I was probably overdoing it with the antagonism, but I didn't want him to see how much this hurt. I knew I wasn't being fair. After all, I'd picked the bloodsucker over him last night. I'd hurt him first. He took a deep breath, and his trembling fingers were suddenly still. His face smoothed into a serene mask. \"One of the Cullens is staying here with you,\" he stated. \"Yes. Alice Cullen.\" He nodded thoughtfully. \"How long is she here for?\" \"As long as she wants to be.\" The belligerence was still there in my tone. \"It's an open invitation.\" \"Do you think you could\u2026 please\u2026 explain to her about the other one\u2014Victoria?\" I paled. \"I told her about that.\" He nodded. \"You should know that we can only watch our own lands with a Cullen here. You'll only be safe in La Push. I can't protect you here anymore.\" \"Okay,\" I said in a small voice. He looked away then, out the back windows. He didn't continue. \"Is that all?\" He kept his eyes on the glass as he answered. \"Just one more thing.\" I waited, but he didn't continue. \"Yes?\" I finally prompted. \"Are the rest of them coming back now?\" he asked in a cool, quiet voice. It reminded me of Sam's always calm manner. Jacob was becoming more like Sam\u2026 I wondered why that bothered me so much. Now I didn't speak. He looked back at my face with probing eyes. \"Well?\" he asked. He struggled to conceal the tension behind his serene expression. \"No.\" I said finally. Grudgingly. \"They aren't coming back.\" His expression didn't change. \"Okay. That's all.\" I glared at him, annoyance rekindled. \"Well, run along now. Go tell Sam that the scary monsters aren't coming to get you.\" \"Okay,\" he repeated, still calm. That seemed to be it. Jacob walked swiftly from the kitchen. I waited to hear the front door open, but I heard nothing. I could hear the clock over the stove ticking, and I marveled again at how quiet he'd become. What a disaster. How could I have alienated him so completely in such a short amount of time?  Would he forgive me when Alice was gone? What if he didn't? I slumped against the counter and buried my face in my hands. How had I made such a mess of everything? But what could I have done differently? Even in hindsight, I couldn't think of any better way, any perfect course of action. \"Bella\u2026 ?\" Jacob asked in a troubled voice. I pulled my face out of my hands to see Jacob hesitating in the kitchen doorway; he hadn't left when I'd thought. It was only when I saw the clear drops sparkling in my hands that I realized I was crying. Jacob's calm expression was gone; his face was anxious and unsure. He walked quickly back to stand in front of me, <em>ducking</em> his head so that his eyes were closer to being on the same level with mine. \"Did it again, didn't I?\" \"Did what?\" I asked, my voice cracking. \"Broke my promise. Sorry.\" \"'It\u2019s okay,\" I mumbled. \"I started it this time.\" His face twisted. \"I knew how you felt about them. It shouldn't have taken me by surprise like that.\" I could see the revulsion in his eyes. I wanted to explain to him what Alice was really like, to defend her against the judgments he'd made, but something warned me that now was not the time. So I just said, \"Sorry,\" again. \"Let's not worry about it, okay? She's just visiting, right? She'll leave, and things will go back to normal.\" \"Can't I be friends with you both at the same time?\" I asked, my voice not hiding an ounce of the hurt I felt. He shook his head slowly. \"No, I don't think you can.\" I sniffed and stared at his big feet. \"But you'll wait, right? You'll still be my friend, even though I love Alice, too?\" I didn't look up, afraid to see what he'd think of that last part. It took him a minute to answer, so I was probably right not to look. \"Yeah, I'll always be your friend,\" he said gruffly. \"No matter what you love.\" \"Promise?\" \"Promise.\" I felt his arms wind around me, and I leaned against his chest, still sniffling. \"This sucks.\" \"Yeah.\" Then he sniffed my hair and said, \"Ew.\" \"What?\" I demanded. I looked up to see that his nose was wrinkled again. \"Why does everyone keep doing that to me? I don't smell!\" He smiled a little. \"Yes, you do\u2014you smell like them. Blech. Too sweet\u2014sickly sweet. And\u2026 icy. It burns my nose.\" \"Really?\" That was strange. Alice smelled unbelievably wonderful. To a human, anyway. \"But why would Alice think I smelled, too, then?\" That wiped his smile away. \"Huh. Maybe I don't smell so good to her, either. Huh.\" \"Well, you both smell fine to me.\" I rested my head against him again. I was going to miss him terribly when he walked out my door. It was a nasty catch-22\u2014on the one hand, I wanted Alice to stay forever. I was going to die\u2014metaphorically\u2014when she left me. But how was I supposed to go without seeing Jake for any length of time? What a mess, I thought again. \"I'll miss you,\" Jacob whispered, echoing my thoughts. \"Every minute. I hope she leaves soon.\" \"It really doesn't have to be that way, Jake.\" He sighed. \"Yes, it really does. Bella. You\u2026 love her. So I'd better not get anywhere near her. I'm not sure that I'm even-tempered enough to handle that. Sam would be mad if I broke the treaty, and\"\u2014his voice turned sarcastic\u2014\"you probably wouldn't like it too much if I killed your friend.\" I recoiled from him when he said that, but he only tightened his arms, refusing to let me escape. \"There's no point in avoiding the truth. That's the way things are, Bells.\" \"I do not like the way things are.\" Jacob freed one arm so that he could cup his big brown hand under my chin and make me look at him. \"Yeah. It was easier when we were both human, wasn't it?\" I sighed. We stared at each other for a long moment. His hand smoldered against my skin. In my face, I knew there was nothing but wistful sadness\u2014I didn't want to have to say goodbye now, no matter for how short a time. At first his face reflected mine, but then, as neither of us looked away, his expression changed. He released me, lifting his other hand to brush his fingertips along my cheek, trailing them down to my jaw. I could feel his fingers tremble\u2014not with anger this time. He pressed his palm against my cheek, so that my face was trapped between his burning hands. \"Bella,\" he whispered. I was frozen. No! I hadn't made this decision yet. I didn't know if I could do this, and now I was out of time to think. But I would have been a fool if I thought rejecting him now would have no consequences. I stared back at him. He was not my Jacob, but he could be. His face was familiar and beloved. In so many real ways, I did love him. He was my comfort, my safe harbor. Right now, I could choose to have him belong to me. Alice was back for the moment, but that changed nothing. True love was forever lost. The prince was never coming back to kiss me awake from my enchanted sleep. I was not a princess, after all. So what was the fairy-tale protocol for other kisses? The mundane kind that didn't break any spells? Maybe it would be easy\u2014like holding his hand or having his arms around me. Maybe it would feel nice. Maybe it wouldn't feel like a betrayal. Besides, who was I betraying, anyway? Just \u00a0myself. Keeping his eyes on mine, Jacob began to bend his face toward me. And I was still absolutely undecided. .  The shrill ring of the phone made us both jump, but it did not break his focus. He took his hand from under my chin and reached over me to grab the receiver, but still held my face securely with the hand against my cheek. His dark eyes did not free mine. I was too muddled to react, even to take advantage of the distraction. \"Swan residence,\" Jacob said, his husky voice low and intense. Someone answered, and Jacob altered in an instant. He straightened up, and his hand dropped from my face. His eyes went flat, his face blank, and I would have bet the measly remainder of my college and that it was Alice. I recovered myself and held out my hand for the phone. Jacob ignored me. \"He's not here,\" Jacob said, and the words were menacing. There was some very short reply, a request for more information it seemed, because he added unwillingly, \"He's at the funeral.\" Then Jacob hung up the phone. \"Filthy bloodsucker,\" he muttered under his breath. The face he turned back to me was the bitter mask again. \"Who did you just hang up on?\" I gasped, infuriated. \"In my house, and on my phone?\" \"Easy! He hung up on me!\" \"He? Who was it?!\" He sneered the title. \"Dr. Carlisle Cullen.\" \"Why didn't you let me talk to him?!\" \"He didn't ask for you,\" Jacob said coldly. His face was smooth, expressionless, but his hands shook. \"He asked where Charlie was and I told him. I don't think I broke any rules of etiquette.\" \"You listen to me, Jacob Black\u2014\" But he obviously wasn't listening. He looked quickly over his shoulder, as if someone had called his name from the other room. His eyes went wide and his body stiff, then he started trembling. I listened too, automatically, but heard nothing. \"Bye, Bells,\" he spit out, and wheeled toward the front door. I ran after him. \"What is it?\" And then I ran into him, as he rocked back on his heels, cussing under his breath. He spun around again, knocking me sideways. I bobbled and fell to the floor, my legs tangled with his. \"Shoot, ow!\" I protested as he hurriedly jerked his legs free one at a time. I struggled to pull myself up as he darted for the back door; he suddenly froze again. Alice stood motionless at the foot of the stairs. \"Bella,\" she choked. I scrambled to my feet and lurched to her side. Her eyes were dazed and far away, her face drawn and whiter than bone. Her slim body trembled to an inner turmoil. \"Alice, what's wrong?\" I cried. I put my hands on her face, trying to calm her. Her eyes focused on mine abruptly, wide with pain. \"Edward,\" was all she whispered. My body reacted faster than my mind was able to catch up with the implications of her reply. I didn't at first understand why the room was spinning or where the hollow roar in my ears was coming from. My mind labored, unable to make sense of Alice's bleak face and how it could possibly relate to Edward, while my body was already swaying, seeking the relief of unconsciousness before the reality could hit me. The stairway tilted at the oddest angle. Jacob's furious voice was suddenly in my ear, hissing out a stream of profanities. I felt a vague disapproval. His new friends were clearly a bad influence. I was on the couch without understanding how I got there, and Jacob was still swearing. It felt like there was an earthquake\u2014the couch was shaking under me. \"What did you do to her?\" he demanded. Alice ignored him. \"Bella? Bella, snap out of it. We have to hurry.\" \"Stay back,\" Jacob warned. \"Calm down, Jacob Black,\" Alice ordered. \"You don't want to do that so close to her.\" \"I don't think I'll have any problem keeping my focus,\" he retorted, but his voice sounded a little cooler. \"Alice?\" My voice was weak. \"What happened?\" I asked, even though I didn't want to hear. \"I don't know,\" she suddenly wailed. \"What is he thinking?!\" I labored to pull myself up despite the dizziness. I realized it was Jacob's arm I was gripping for balance. He was the one shaking, not the couch. Alice was pulling a small silver phone from her bag when my eyes relocated her. Her fingers dialed the numbers so fast they were a blur. \"Rose, I need to talk to Carlisle now.\" Her voice whipped through the words. \"Fine, as soon as he's back. No, I'll be on a plane. Look, have you heard anything from Edward?\" Alice paused now, listening with an expression that grew more appalled every second. Her mouth opened into a little O of horror, and the phone shook in her hand. \"Why?\" she gasped. \"Why would you do that, Rosalie?\" Whatever the answer was, it made her jaw tighten in anger. Her eyes flashed and narrowed. \"Well, you're wrong on both counts, though, Rosalie, so that would be a problem, don't you think?\" she asked acidly. \"Yes, that's right. She's absolutely fine\u2014I was wrong\u2026 It's a long story\u2026 But you're wrong about that part, too, that's why I'm calling\u2026 Yes, that's exactly what I saw.\" Alice's voice was very hard and her lips were pulled back from her teeth.  \"It's a bit late for that, Rose.\u00a0 Save your remorse for someone who believes it.\" Alice snapped the phone shut with a sharp twist of her fingers. Her eyes were tortured as she turned to face me. \"Alice,\" I blurted out quickly. I couldn't let her speak yet. I needed a few more seconds before she spoke and her words destroyed what was left of my life. \"Alice, Carlisle is back, though. He called just before\u2026\" She stared at me blankly. \"How long ago?\" she asked in a hollow voice. \"Half a minute before you showed up.\" \"What did he say?\" She really focused now, waiting for my answer. \"I didn't talk to him.\" My eyes flickered to Jacob. Alice turned her penetrating gaze on him. He flinched, but held his place next to me. He sit awkwardly, almost as if he were trying to shield me with his body. \"He asked for Charlie, and I told him Charlie wasn't here,\" Jacob muttered resentfully. \"Is that everything?\" Alice demanded, her voice like ice. \"Then he hung up on me,\" Jacob spit back. A tremor rolled down his spine, shaking me with it.  \"You told him Charlie was at the funeral,\" I reminded him. Alice jerked her head back toward me \"What were his exact words?\" \"He said, 'He's not here,' and when Carlisle asked where Charlie was, Jacob said, 'At the funeral.'\" Alice moaned and sank to her knees. \"Tell me Alice,\" I whispered. \"That wasn't Carlisle on the phone,\" she said hopelessly. \"Are you calling me a liar?\" Jacob snarled from beside me. Alice ignored him, focusing on my bewildered face. \"It was Edward.\" The words were just a choked whisper. \"He thinks you're dead.\" My mind started to work again. These words weren't the ones I'd been afraid of, and the relief cleared my head. \"Rosalie told him I killed myself, didn't she?\" I said, sighing as I relaxed. \"Yes,\" Alice admitted, her eyes flashing hard again. \"In her defense, she did believe it. They rely on my sight far too much for something that works so imperfectly. But for her to track him down to tell him this! Didn't she realize\u2026 or care\u2026 ?\" Her voice faded away in horror. \"And when Edward called here, he thought Jacob meant my funeral,\" I realized. It stung to know how close I'd been, just inches away from his voice. My nails dug into Jacob's arm, but he didn't flinch. Alice looked at me strangely. \"You're not upset,\" she whispered. \"Well, it's really rotten timing, but it will all get straightened out. The next time he calls, someone will tell him\u2026 what\u2026 really\u2026\" I trailed off. Her gaze strangled the words in my throat. Why was she so panicked? Why was her face twisting now with pity and horror? What was it she had said to Rosalie on the phone just now? Something about what she'd seen\u2026 and Rosalie's remorse; Rosalie would never feel remorse for anything that happened to me. But if she'd hurt her family, hurt her brother\u2026 \"Bella,\" Alice whispered. \"Edward won't call again. He believed her.\" \"I. Don't. Understand.\" My mouth framed each word in silence. I couldn't push the air out to actually say the words that would make her explain what that meant. \"He's going to Italy.\" It took the length of one heartbeat for me to comprehend. When Edward's voice came back to me now, it was not the perfect imitation of my \u00a0delusions. It was just the weak, flat tone of my memories. But the words alone were enough to shred through my chest and leave it gaping open. Words from a time when I would have bet everything that I owned or could borrow on that fact that he loved me. Well, I wasn't going to live without you, he'd said as we watched Romeo and Juliet die, here in this very room. But I wasn't sure how to do it\u2026 I knew Emmett and Jasper would never help\u2026 so I was thinking maybe I would go to Italy and do something to provoke the Volturi\u2026 You don't irritate them. Not unless you want to die. Not unless you want to die. \"NO!\" The half-shrieked denial was so loud after the whispered words, it made us all jump. I felt the blood rushing to my face as I realized what she'd seen. \"No! No, no, no! He can't! He can't do that!\" \"He made up his mind as soon as your friend confirmed that it was too late to save you.\" \"But he\u2026 he left! He didn't want me anymore! What difference does it make now? He knew I would die sometime!\" \"I don't think he ever planned to outlive you by long,\" Alice said quietly. \"How dare he!\" I screamed. I was on my feet now, and Jacob rose uncertainly to put himself between Alice and me again. \"Oh, get out of the way, Jacob!\" I elbowed my way around his trembling body with desperate impatience. \"What do we do?\" I begged Alice. There had to be something. \"Can't we call him? Can Carlisle?\" She was shaking her head. \"That was the first thing I tried. He left his phone in a trash can in Rio\u2014someone answered it\u2026\" she whispered. \"You said before we had to hurry. Hurry how? Let's do it, whatever it is!\" \"Bella, I\u2014I don't think I can ask you to\u2026\" She trailed off in indecision. \"Ask me!\" I commanded. She put her hands on my shoulders, holding me in place, her fingers flexing sporadically to emphasize her words. \"We may already be too late. I saw him going to the Volturi\u2026 and asking to die.\" We both cringed, and my eyes were suddenly blind. I blinked feverishly at the tears. \"It all depends on what they choose. I can't see that till they make a decision. \"But if they say no, and they might\u2014Aro is fond of Carlisle, and wouldn't want to offend him\u2014Edward has a backup plan. They're very protective of their city. If Edward does something to upset the peace, he thinks they'll act to stop him. And he's right. They will.\" I stared at her with my jaw clenched in frustration. I'd heard nothing yet that would explain why we were still standing here. \"So if they agree to grant his favor, we're too late. If they say no, and he comes up with a plan to offend them quickly enough, we're too late. If he gives into his more theatrical tendencies\u2026 we might have time.\" \"Let's go!\" \"Listen, Bella! Whether we are in time or not, we will be in the heart of the Volturi city. I will be considered his accomplice if he is successful. You will be a human who not only knows too much, but also smells too good. There's a very good chance that they will eliminate us all\u2014though in your case it won't be punishment so much as dinnertime.\" \"This is what's keeping us here?\" I asked in disbelief. \"I'll go alone if you're afraid.\" I mentally tabulated what money was left in my account, and wondered if Alice would lend me the rest. \"I'm only afraid of getting you killed.\" I snorted in disgust. \"I almost get myself killed on a daily basis! Tell me what I need to do!\" \"You write a note to Charlie. I'll call the airlines.\" \"Charlie,\" I gasped. Not that my presence was protecting him, but could I leave him here alone to face\u2026 \"I'm not going to let anything happen to Charlie.\" Jacob's low voice was gruff and angry. \"Screw the treaty.\" I glanced up at him, and he scowled at my panicked expression. \"Hurry, Bella,\" Alice interrupted urgently. I ran to the kitchen, yanking the drawers open and throwing the contents all over the floor as I searched for a pen. A smooth, brown hand held one out to me. \"Thanks,\" I mumbled, pulling the cap off with my teeth. He silently handed me the pad of paper we wrote phone messages on. I tore off the top sheet and threw it over my shoulder. Dad, I wrote. I'm with Alice. Edward's in trouble. You can ground me when I get back. I know it's a bad time. So sorry. Love you so much. Bella. \"Don't go,\" Jacob whispered. The anger was all gone now that Alice was out of sight. I wasn't about to waste time arguing with him. \"Please, please, please take care of \u00a0Charlie,\" I said as I dashed back out to the front room. Alice was waiting in the doorway with a bag over her shoulder. \"Get your wallet\u2014you'll need ID. Please tell me you have a passport. I don't have time to forge one.\" I nodded and then raced up the stairs, my knees weak with gratitude that my mother had wanted to marry Phil on a beach in Mexico. Of course, like all her plans, it had fallen through. But not before I'd made all the practical arrangements I could for her. I tore through my room. I stuffed my old wallet, a clean T-shirt, and sweatpants into my backpack, and then threw my toothbrush on top. I hurled myself back down the stairs. The sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu was nearly stifling by this point. At least, unlike the last time\u2014when I'd run away from Forks to escape thirsty vampires rather than to find them\u2014I wouldn't have to say goodbye to Charlie in person. Jacob and Alice were locked in some kind of confrontation in front of the open door, standing so far apart you wouldn't assume at first that they were having a conversation. Neither one seemed to notice my noisy reappearance. \"You might control yourself on occasion, but these leeches you're taking her to\u2014\" Jacob was furiously accusing her. \"Yes. You're right, dog.\" Alice was snarling, too. \"The Volturi are the very essence of our kind\u2014they're the reason your hair stands on end when you smell me. They are the substance of your nightmares, the dread behind your instincts. I'm not unaware of that.\" \"And you take her to them like a bottle of wine for a party!\" he shouted. \"You think she'd be better off if I left her here alone, with Victoria stalking her?\" \"We can handle the redhead.\" \"Then why is she still hunting?\" Jacob growled, and a shudder rippled through his torso. \"Stop that!\" I shouted at them both, wild with impatience. \"Argue when we get back, let's \u00a0go!\" Alice turned for the car, disappearing in her haste. I hurried after her, pausing automatically to turn and lock the door. Jacob caught my arm with a shivering hand. \"Please, Bella. I'm begging.\" His dark eyes were glistening with tears. A lump filled my throat. \"Jake, I have to\u2014\" \"You don't, though. You really don't. You could stay here with me. You could stay alive. For Charlie. For me.\" The engine of Carlisle's Mercedes purred; the rhythm of the thrumming spiked when Alice revved it impatiently. I shook my head, tears spattering from my eyes with the sharp motion. I pulled my arm free, and he didn't fight me. \"Don't die, Bella,\" he choked out. \"Don't go. Don't.\" What if I never saw him again? The thought pushed me past the silent tears; a sob broke out from my chest. I threw my arms around his waist and hugged for one too-short moment, burying my tear-wet face against his chest. He put his big hand on the back of my hair, as if to hold me there. \"Bye, Jake.\" I pulled his hand from my hair, and kissed his palm. I couldn't bear to look at his face. \"Sorry,\" I whispered. Then I spun and raced for the car. The door on the passenger side was open and waiting. I threw my backpack over the headrest and slid in, slamming the door behind me. \"Take care of Charlie!\" I turned to shout out the window, but Jacob was nowhere in sight. As Alice stomped on the gas and\u2014with the tires screeching like human screams\u2014spun us around to face the road, I caught sight of a shred of white near the edge of the trees. A piece of a shoe.",

            "en": "12         12. INTRUDER My eyes flew wide open with fright, though i was so exhausted and muddled that I was not yet positive whether I was awake or asleep. Something scratched against my window again with the same thin, high-pitched sound. Confused and clumsy with sleep, I stumbled out of my bed and to the window, blinking the lingering tears from my eyes on the way. A huge, dark shape wobbled erratically on the other side of the glass, lurching toward me like it was going to smash right through. I staggered back, terrified, my throat closing around a scream. Victoria. She'd come for me. I was dead. Not Charlie, too! I choked back the building scream. I would have to keep quiet through this. Somehow. I had to keep Charlie from coming to investigate\u2026 And then a familiar, husky voice called from the dark shape. \"Bella!\" it hissed. \"Ouch! Damn it, open the window! OUCH!\" I needed two seconds to shake off the horror before I could move, but then I hurried to the window and shoved the glass out of the way. The clouds were dimly lit from behind, enough for me to make sense of the shapes. \"What are you doing?\" I gasped. Jacob was clinging precariously to the top of the spruce that grew in the middle of Charlie's little front yard. His weight had bowed the tree toward the house and he now swung\u2014his legs dangling twenty feet above the ground\u2014not a yard away from me. The thin branches at the tip of the tree scraped against the side of the house again with a grating squeal. \"I'm trying to keep\"\u2014he huffed, shifting his weight as the treetop bounced him\u2014\"my promise!\" I blinked my wet blurry eyes, suddenly sure that I was dreaming. \"When did you ever promise to kill yourself falling out of Charlie's tree?\" He snorted, unamused, swinging his legs to improve his balance. \"Get out of the way,\" he ordered. \"What?\" He swung his legs again, backwards and forward, increasing his momentum. I realized what he was trying to do. \"No, Jake!\" But I ducked to the side, because it was too late. With a grunt, he launched himself toward my open window. Another scream built in my throat as I waited for him to fall to his death\u2014or at least maim himself against the wooden siding. To my shock, he swung agilely into my room, landing on the balls of his feet with a low thud. We both looked to the door automatically, holding our breath, waiting to see if the noise had woken Charlie. A short moment of silence passed, and then we heard the muffled sound of Charlie's snore. A wide grin spread slowly across Jacob's face; he seemed extremely pleased with himself. It wasn't the grin that I knew and loved\u2014it was a new grin, one that was a bitter mockery of his old sincerity, on the new face that belonged to Sam. That was a bit much for me. I'd cried myself to sleep over this boy. His harsh rejection had punched a painful new hole in what was left of my chest. He'd left a new nightmare behind him, like an infection in a sore\u2014the insult after the injury. And now he was here in my room, smirking at me as if none of that had passed. Worse than that, even though his arrival had been noisy and awkward, it reminded me of when Edward used to sneak in through my window at night, and the reminder picked viciously at the unhealed wounds.  All of this, coupled with the fact that I was dog-tired, did not put me in a friendly mood. \"Get out!\" I hissed, putting as much venom into the whisper as I could. He blinked, his face going blank with surprise. \"No,\" he protested. \"I came to apologize.\" \"I don't accept!\" I tried to shove him back out the window\u2014after all, if this was a dream, it wouldn't really hurt him. It was useless, though. I didn't budge him an inch. I dropped my hands quickly, and stepped away from him. He wasn't wearing a shirt, though the air blowing in the window was cold enough to make me shiver, and it made me uncomfortable to have my hands on his bare chest. His skin was burning hot, like his head had been the last time I'd touched him. Like he was still sick with the fever. He didn't look sick. He looked huge. He leaned over me, so big that he blacked out the window, tongue-tied by my furious reaction. Suddenly, it was just more than I could handle\u2014it felt as if all of my sleepless nights were crashing down on me en masse. I was so brutally tired that I thought I might collapse right there on the floor. I swayed unsteadily, and struggled to keep my eyes open. \"Bella?\" Jacob whispered anxiously. He caught my elbow as I swayed again, and steered me back to the bed. My legs gave out when I reached the edge, and I plopped into a limp heap on the mattress. \"Hey, are you okay?\" Jacob asked, worry creasing his forehead. I looked up at him, the tears not yet dried on my cheeks. \"Why in the world would I be okay, Jacob?\" Anguish replaced some of the bitterness in his face. \"Right,\" he agreed, and took a deep breath. \"Crap. Well\u2026 I\u2014I'm so sorry, Bella.\" The apology was sincere, no doubt about it, though there was still an angry twist to his features. \"Why did you come here? I don't want apologies from you, Jake.\" \"I know,\" he whispered. \"But I couldn't leave things the way I did this afternoon. That was horrible. I'm sorry.\" I shook my head wearily. \"I don't understand anything.\" \"I know. I want to explain\u2014\" He broke off suddenly, his mouth open, almost like something had cut off his air. Then he sucked in a deep breath. \"But I can't explain,\" he said, still angry. \"I wish I could.\" I let my head fall into my hands. My question came out muffled by my arm. \"Why?\" He was quiet for a moment. I twisted my head to the side\u2014too tired to hold it up\u2014to see his expression.  It surprised me. His eyes were squinted, his teeth clenched, his forehead wrinkled in effort. \"What's wrong?\" I asked. He exhaled heavily, and I realized he'd been holding his breath, too. \"I can't do it,\" he muttered, frustrated. \"Do what?\" He ignored my question. \"Look, Bella, haven't you ever had a secret that you couldn't tell anyone?\" He looked at me with knowing eyes, and my thoughts jumped immediately to the Cullens. I hoped my expression didn't look guilty. \"Something you felt like you had to keep from Charlie, from your mom\u2026 ?\" he pressed. \"Something you won't even talk about with me? Not even now?\" I felt my eyes tighten. I didn't answer his question, though I knew he would take that as a confirmation. \"Can you understand that I might have the same kind of\u2026 situation?\" He was struggling again, seeming to fight for the right words. \"Sometimes, loyalty gets in the way of what you want to do. Sometimes, it's not your secret to tell.\" So, I couldn't argue with that. He was exactly right\u2014I had a secret that wasn't mine to tell, yet a secret I felt bound to protect. A secret that, suddenly, he seemed to know all about. I still didn't see how it applied to him, or Sam, or Billy. What was it to them, now that the Cullens were gone? \"I don't know why you came here, Jacob, if you were just going to give me riddles instead of answers.\" \"I'm sorry,\" he whispered. \"This is so frustrating.\" We looked at each other for a long moment in the dark room, both our faces hopeless. \"The part that kills me,\" he said abruptly, \"is that you already know. I already told yon everything!\" \"What are you talking about?\" He sucked in a startled breath, and then leaned toward me, his face shifting from hopelessness to blazing intensity in a second. He stared fiercely into my eyes, and his voice was fast and eager. He spoke the words right into my face; his breath was as hot as his skin. \"I think I see a way to make this work out\u2014because you know this, Bella! I can't tell you, but if you guessed it! That would let me right off the hook!\" \"You want me to guess? Guess what?\" \"My secret! You can do it\u2014you know the answer!\" I blinked twice, trying to clear my head. I was so tired. Nothing he said made sense. He took in my blank expression, and then his face tensed with effort again. \"Hold on, let me see if I give you some help,\" he said. Whatever he was trying to do, it was so hard he was panting. \"Help?\" I asked, trying to keep up. My lids wanted to slip closed, but I forced them open. \"Yeah,\" he said, breathing hard. \"Like clues.\" He took my face in his enormous, too-warm hands and held it just a few inches from his. He stared into my eyes while he whispered, as if to communicate something besides the words he spoke. \"Remember the first day we met\u2014on the beach in La Push?\" \"Of course I do.\" \"Tell me about it.\" I took a deep breath and tried to concentrate. \"You asked about my truck\u2026\" He nodded, urging me on. \"We talked about the Rabbit\u2026\" \"Keep going.\" \"We went for a walk down the beach\u2026\" My cheeks were growing warm under his palms as I remembered, but he wouldn't notice, hot as his skin was. I'd asked him to walk with me, flirting ineptly but successfully, in order to pump him for information. He was nodding, anxious for more. My voice was nearly soundless. \"You told me scary stories\u2026 Quileute legends.\" He closed his eyes and opened them again. \"Yes.\" The word was tense, fervent, like he was on the edge of something vital. He spoke slowly, making each word distinct. \"Do you remember what I said?\" Even in the dark, he must be able to see the change in the color of my face. How could I ever forget that? Without realizing what he was doing, Jacob had told me exactly what I needed to know that day\u2014that Edward was a vampire. He looked at me with eyes that knew too much. \"Think hard,\" he told me. \"Yes, I remember,\" I breathed. He inhaled deeply, struggling. \"Do you remember all the story\u2014\" He couldn't finish the question. His mouth popped open like something had stuck in his throat. \"All the stories?\" I asked. He nodded mutely. My head churned. Only one story really mattered. I knew he'd begun with others, but I couldn't remember the inconsequential prelude, especially not while my brain was so clouded with exhaustion. I started to shake my head. Jacob groaned and jumped off the bed. He pressed his fists against his forehead and breathed fast and angry. \"You know this, you know this,\" he muttered to himself. \"Jake? Jake, please, I'm exhausted. I'm no good at this right now. Maybe in the morning\u2026\" He took a steadying breath and nodded. \"Maybe it will come back to you. I guess I understand why you only remember the one story,\" he added in a sarcastic, bitter tone. He plunked back onto the mattress beside me. \"Do you mind if I ask you a question about that?\" he asked, still sarcastic. \"I've been dying to know.\" \"A question about what?\" I asked warily. \"About the vampire story I told you.\" I stared at him with guarded eyes, unable to answer. He asked his question anyway. \"Did you honestly not know?\" he asked me, his voice turning husky. \"Was I the one who told you what he was?\" How did he know this? Why did he decide to believe, why now? My teeth clenched together. I stared back at him, no intention of speaking. He could see that. \"See what I mean about loyalty?\" he murmured, even huskier now. \"It's the same for me, only worse.\u00a0 You can't imagine how tight I'm bound\u2026\" I didn't like that\u2014didn't like the way his eyes closed as if he were in pain when he spoke of being bound. More than dislike\u2014I realized I hated it, hated anything that caused him pain. Hated it fiercely. Sam's face filled my mind. For me, this was all essentially voluntary. I protected the Cullens' secret out of love; unrequited, but true. For Jacob, it didn't seem to be that way. \"Isn't there any way for you to get free?\" I whispered, touching the rough edge at the back of his shorn hair. His hands began to tremble, but he didn't open his eyes. \"No. I'm in this for life. A life sentence.\" A bleak laugh. \"Longer, maybe.\" \"No, Jake,\" I moaned. \"What if we ran away? Just you and me. What if we left home, and left Sam behind?\" \"It's not something I can run away from, Bella,\" he whispered. \"I would run with you, though, if I could.\" His shoulders were shaking now, too. He took a deep breath. \"Look, I've got to leave.\" \"Why?\" \"For one thing, you look like you're going to pass out at any second. You need your sleep\u2014I need you firing on all pistons. You're going to figure this out, you have to.\" \"And why else?\" He frowned. \"I had to sneak out\u2014I'm not supposed to see you. They've got to be wondering where I am.\" His mouth twisted. \"I suppose I should go let them know.\" \"You don't have to tell them anything,\" I hissed. \"All the same, I will.\" The anger flashed hot inside me. \"I hate them!\" Jacob looked at me with wide eyes, surprised. \"No, Bella. Don't hate the guys. It's not Sam's or any of the others' faults. I told you before\u2014it's me. Sam is actually\u2026 well, incredibly cool. Jared and Paul are great, too, though Paul is kind of\u2026 And Embry's always been my friend. Nothing's changed there\u2014the only thing that hasn't changed. I feel really bad about the things I used to think about Sam\u2026\" \"Sam was incredibly cool.\" I glared at him in disbelief, but let it go. \"Then why aren't you supposed to see me?\" I demanded. \"It's not safe,\" he mumbled looking down. His words sent a thrill of fear through me. Did he know that, too? Nobody knew that besides me. But he was right\u2014it was the middle of the night, the perfect time for hunting. Jacob shouldn't be here in my room. If someone came for me, I had to be alone. \"If I thought it was too\u2026 too risky,\" he whispered, \"I wouldn't have come. But Bella,\" he looked at me again, \"I made you a promise. I had no idea it would be so hard to keep, but that doesn't mean I'm not going to try.\" He saw the incomprehension in my face. \"After that stupid movie,\" he reminded me. \"I promised you that I wouldn't ever hurt you\u2026 So I really blew it this afternoon, didn't I?\" \"I know you didn't want to do it, Jake. It's okay.\" \"Thanks, Bella.\" He took my hand. \"I'm going to do what I can to be here for you, just like I promised.\" He grinned at me suddenly. The grin was not mine, nor Sam's, but some strange combination of the two. \"It would really help if you could figure this out on your own, Bella. Put some honest effort into it.\" I made a weak grimace. \"I'll try.\" \"And I'll try to see you soon.\" He sighed. \"And they'll try to talk me out of that.\" \"Don't listen to them.\" \"I'll try.\" He shook his head, as if he doubted his success. \"Come and tell me as soon as you figure it out.\" Something occurred to him just then, something that made his hands shake. \"If you\u2026 if you want to.\" \"Why wouldn't I want to see you?\" His face turned hard and bitter, one hundred percent the face that belonged to Sam. \"Oh, I can think of a reason,\" he said in a harsh tone. \"Look, I really have to go. Could you do something for me?\" I just nodded, frightened of the change in him. \"At least call me\u2014if you don't want to see me again. Let me know if it's like that.\" \"That won't happen\u2014\" He raised one hand, cutting me off. \"Just let me know.\" He stood and headed for the window. \"Don't be an idiot, Jake,\" I complained. \"You'll break your leg. Use the door. Charlie's not going to catch you.\" \"I won't get hurt,\" he muttered, but he turned for the door. He hesitated as he passed me, staring at me with an expression like something was stabbing him. He held one hand out, pleading. I took his hand, and suddenly he yanked me\u2014too roughly\u2014right off the bed so that I thudded against his chest. \"Just in case,\" he muttered against my hair, crushing me in a bear hug that about broke my ribs. \"Can't\u2014breathe!\" I gasped. He dropped me at once, keeping one hand at my waist so I didn't fall over. He pushed me, more gently this time, back down on the bed. \"Get some sleep, Bells. You've got to get your head working. I know you can do this. I need you. To understand. I won't lose you, Bella. Not for this.\" He was to the door in one stride, opening it quietly, and then disappearing through it. I listened for him to hit the squeaky step in the stairs, but there was no sound. I lay back on my bed, my head spinning. I was too confused, too worn out. I closed my eyes, trying to make sense of it, only to be swallowed up by unconsciousness so swiftly that it was disorienting. It was not the peaceful, dreamless sleep I'd yearned for\u2014of course not. I was in the forest again, and I started to wander the way I always did. I quickly became aware that this was not the same dream as usual. For one thing, I felt no compulsion to wander or to search; I was merely wandering out of habit, because that was what was usually expected of me here. Actually, this wasn't even the same forest. The smell was different, and the light, too. It smelled, not like the damp earth of the woods, but like the brine of the ocean. I couldn't see the sky; still, it seemed like the sun must be shining\u2014the leaves above were bright jade green. This was the forest around La Push\u2014near the beach there, I was sure of it. I knew that if I found the beach, I would be able to see the sun, so I hurried forward, following the faint sound of waves in the distance. And then Jacob was there. He grabbed my hand, pulling me back toward the blackest part of the forest.  \"Jacob, what's wrong?\" I asked. His face was the frightened face of a boy, and his hair was beautiful again, swept back into a ponytail on the nape of his neck. He yanked with all his strength, but I resisted; I didn't want to go into the dark. \"Run, Bella, you have to run!\" he whispered, terrified. The abrupt wave of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu was so strong it nearly woke me up. I knew why I recognized this place now. It was because I'd been here before, in another dream. A million years ago, part of a different life entirely. This was the dream I'd had the night after I'd walked with Jacob on the beach, the first night I knew that Edward was a vampire. Reliving that day with Jacob must have dredged this dream out of my buried memories. Detached from the dream now, I waited for it to play out. A light was coming toward me from the beach. In just a moment, Edward would walk through the trees, his skin faintly glowing and his eyes black and dangerous. He would beckon to me, and smile. He would be beautiful as an angel, and his teeth would be pointed and sharp\u2026 But I was getting ahead of myself. Something else had to happen first. Jacob dropped my hand and yelped. Shaking and twitching, he fell to the ground at my feet. \"Jacob!\" I screamed, but he was gone. In his place was an enormous, red-brown wolf with dark, intelligent eyes. The dream veered off course, like a train jumping the tracks. This was not the same wolf that I'd dreamed of in another life. This was the great russet wolf I'd stood half a foot from in the meadow, just a week ago. This wolf was gigantic, monstrous, bigger than a bear. This wolf stared intently at me, trying to convey something vital with his intelligent eyes. The black-brown, familiar eyes of Jacob Black. I woke screaming at the top of my lungs. I almost expected Charlie to come check on me this time. This wasn't my usual screaming. I buried my head in my pillow and tried to muffle the hysterics that my screams were building into. I pressed the cotton tight against my face, wondering if I couldn't also somehow smother the connection I'd just made. But Charlie didn't come in. and eventually I was able to strangle the strange screeching coming out of my throat. I remembered it all now\u2014every word that Jacob had said to me that day on the beach, even the part before he got to the vampires, the \"cold ones.\" Especially that first part. \"Do you know any of our old stories, about where we came from\u2014the Quileutes, I mean?\" he asked. \"Not really,\" I admitted. \"Well, there are lots of legends, some of them claiming to date back to the Flood\u2014supposedly, the ancient Quileutes tied their canoes to the tops of the tallest trees on the mountain to survive, like Noah and the ark.\" He smiled then, to show me how little stock he put in the histories. \"Another legend claims that we descended from wolves\u2014and that the wolves are our brothers still. It's against tribal law to kill them. \"Then there are the stories about the cold ones.\" His voice dropped a little lower. \"The cold ones?\" \"Yes. There are stories of the cold ones as old as the wolf legends, and some much more recent. According to legend, my own great-grandfather knew some of them. He was the one who made the treaty that kept them off our land.\" Jacob rolled his eyes. \" Your great-grandfather?\" \"He was a tribal elder, like my father. You see, the cold ones are the natural enemies of the wolf\u2014 well, not the wolf really, but the wolves that turn into men, like our ancestors. You would call them werewolves.\" \"Werewolves have enemies?\" \"Only one.\" There was something stuck in my throat, choking me. I tried to swallow it down, but it was lodged there, un-moving. I tried to spit it out. \"Werewolf,\" I gasped. Yes, that was the word that I was choking on. The whole world lurched, tilting the wrong way on its axis. What kind of a place was this? Could a world really exist where ancient legends went wandering around the borders of tiny, insignificant towns, facing down mythical monsters? Did this mean every impossible fairy tale was grounded somewhere in absolute truth? Was there anything sane or normal at all, or was everything just magic and ghost stories? I clutched my head in my hands, trying to keep it from exploding. A small, dry voice in the back of my mind asked me what the big deal was. Hadn't I already accepted the existence of vampires long ago\u2014and without all the hysterics that time? Exactly, I wanted to scream back at the voice. Wasn't one myth enough for anyone, enough for a lifetime? Besides, there'd never been one moment that I wasn't completely aware that Edward Cullen was above and beyond the ordinary. It wasn't such a surprise to find out what he was\u2014because he so obviously was something. But Jacob? Jacob, who was just Jacob, and nothing more than that? Jacob, my friend? Jacob, the only human I'd ever been able to relate to\u2026 And he wasn't even human. I fought the urge to scream again. What did this say about me? I knew the answer to that one. It said that there was something deeply wrong with me. Why else would my life be filled with characters from horror movies? Why else would I care so much about them that it would tear big chunks right out of my chest when they went off along their mythical ways? In my head, everything spun and shifted, rearranging so that things that had meant one thing before, now meant something else. There was no cult. There had never been a cult, never been a gang. No, it was much worse than that. It was a pack. A pack of five mind-blowingly gigantic, multihued werewolves that had stalked right past me in Edward's meadow\u2026 Suddenly, I was in a frantic hurry. I glanced at the clock\u2014it was way too early and I didn't care. I had to go to La Push now. I had to see Jacob so he could tell me that I hadn't lost my mind altogether. I pulled on the first clean clothes I could find, not bothering to be sure they matched, and took the stairs two at a time. I almost ran into Charlie as I skidded into the hallway, headed for the door. \"Where are you going?\" he asked, as surprised to see me as I was to see him. \"Do you know what time it is?\" \"Yeah. I have to go see Jacob.\" \"I thought the thing with Sam\u2014\" \"That doesn't matter, I have to talk to him right now.\" \"It's pretty early.\" He frowned when my expression didn't change. \"Don't you want breakfast?\" \"Not hungry.\" The words flew through my lips. He was blocking my path to the exit. I considered <em>ducking</em> around him and making a run for it, but I knew I would have to explain that to him later. \"I'll be back soon, okay?\" Charlie frowned. \"Straight to Jacob's house, right? No stops on the way?\" \"Of course not, where would I stop?\" My words were running together in my hurry. \"I don't know,\" he admitted. \"It's just\u2026 well, there's been another attack\u2014the wolves again. It was real close to the resort by the hot springs\u2014there's a witness this time. The victim was only a dozen yards from the road when he disappeared. His wife saw a huge gray wolf just a few minutes later, while she was searching for him, and ran for help.\" My stomach dropped like I'd hit a corkscrew on a roller coaster. \"A wolf attacked him?\" \"There's no sign of him\u2014just a little blood again.\" Charlie's face was pained. \"The rangers are going out armed, taking armed volunteers. There're a lot of hunters who are eager to be involved\u2014there's a reward being offered for wolf carcasses. That's going to mean a lot of firepower out there in the forest, and it worries me.\" He shook his head. \"When people get too excited, accidents happen\u2026\" \"They're going to shoot the wolves?\" My voice shot through three octaves. \"What else can we do? What's wrong?\" he asked, his tense eyes studying my face. I felt faint; I must be whiter than usual. \"You aren't turning into a tree-hugger on me, are you?\" I couldn't answer. If he hadn't been watching me, I would have put my head between my knees. I'd forgotten about the missing hikers, the bloody paw prints\u2026 I hadn't connected those facts to my first realization. \"Look, honey, don't let this scare you. Just stay in town or on the highway\u2014no stops\u2014okay?\" \"Okay,\" I repeated in a weak voice. \"I've got to go.\" I looked at him closely for the first time, and saw that he had his gun strapped to his waist and hiking boots on. \"You aren't going out there after the wolves, are you, Dad?\" \"I've got to help, Bells. People are disappearing.\" My voice shot up again, almost hysterical now. \"No! No, don't go. It's too dangerous!\" \"I've got to do my job, kid. Don't be such a pessimist\u2014I'll be fine.\" He turned for the door, and held it open. \"You leaving?\" I hesitated, my stomach still spinning in uncomfortable loops. What could I say to stop him? I was too dizzy to think of a solution. \"Bells?\" \"Maybe it's too early to go to La Push,\" I whispered. \"I agree,\" he said, and he stepped out into the rain, shutting the door behind him. As soon as he was out of sight, I dropped to the floor and put my head between my knees. Should I go after Charlie? What would I say? And what about Jacob? Jacob was my best friend; I needed to warn him. If he really was a\u2014I cringed and forced myself to think the word\u2014werewolf (and I knew it was true, I could feel it), then people would be shooting at him! I needed to tell him and his friends that people would try to kill them if they went running around like gigantic wolves. I needed to tell them to stop. They had to stop! Charlie was out there in the woods. Would they care about that? I wondered\u2026 Up until now, only strangers had disappeared. Did that mean anything, or was it just chance? I needed to believe that Jacob, at least, would care about that. Either way, I had to warn him. Or\u2026 did I? Jacob was my best friend, but was he a monster, too? A real one? A bad one? Should I warn him, if he and his friends were\u2026 were murderers! If they were out slaughtering innocent hikers in cold blood? If they were truly creatures from a horror movie in every sense, would it be wrong to protect them? It was inevitable that I would have to compare Jacob and his friends to the Cullens. I wrapped my arms around my chest, fighting the hole, while I thought of them. I didn't know anything about werewolves, clearly. I would have expected something closer to the movies\u2014big hairy half-men creatures or something\u2014if I'd expected anything at all. So I didn't know what made them hunt, whether hunger or thirst or just a desire to kill. It was hard to judge, not knowing that. But it couldn't be worse than what the Cullens endured in their quest to be good. I thought of Esme\u2014the tears started when I pictured her kind, lovely face\u2014and how, as motherly and loving as she was, she'd had to hold her nose, all ashamed, and run from me when I was bleeding. It couldn't be harder than that. I thought of Carlisle, the centuries upon centuries that he had struggled to teach himself to ignore blood, so that he could save lives as a doctor. Nothing could be harder than that. The werewolves had chosen a different path. Now, what should I choose?",

            "en": "15          15. THE CULLENS The muted light of yet another cloudy day eventually woke me. I lay with my arm across my eyes, groggy and dazed. Something, a dream trying to be remembered, struggled to break into my consciousness. I moaned and rolled on my side, hoping more sleep would come. And then the previous day flooded back into my awareness. \"Oh!\" I sat up so fast it made my head spin. \"Your hair looks like a haystack\u2026 but I like it.\u201dHis unruffled voice came from the rocking chair in the corner. \"Edward! You stayed!\" I rejoiced, and thoughtlessly threw myself across the room and into his lap. In the instant that my thoughts caught up with my actions, I froze, shocked by my own uncontrolled enthusiasm. I stared up at him, afraid that I had crossed the wrong line. But he laughed. \"Of course,\u201dHe answered, startled, but seeming pleased by my reaction. His hands rubbed my back. I laid my head cautiously against his shoulder, breathing in the smell of his skin. \"I was sure it was a dream.\" \"You're not that creative,\u201dHe scoffed. \"Charlie!\" I remembered, thoughtlessly jumping up again and heading to the door. \"He left an hour ago \u2014 after reattaching your battery cables, I might add. I have to admit I was disappointed. Is that really all it would take to stop you, if you were determined to go?\" I deliberated where I stood, wanting to return to him badly, but afraid I might have morning breath. \"You're not usually this confused in the morning,\u201dHe noted. He held his arms open for me to return. A nearly irresistible invitation. \"I need another human minute,\" I admitted. \"I'll wait.\" I skipped to the bathroom, my emotions unrecognizable. I didn't know myself, inside or out. The face in the mirror was practically a stranger \u2014 eyes too bright, hectic spots of red across my cheekbones. After I brushed my teeth, I worked to straighten out the tangled chaos that was my hair. I splashed my face with cold water, and tried to breathe normally, with no noticeable success. I half-ran back to my room.  It seemed like a miracle that he was there, his arms still waiting for me. He reached out to me, and my heart thumped unsteadily. \"Welcome back,\u201dHe murmured, taking me into his arms. He rocked me for a while in silence, until I noticed that his clothes were changed, his hair smooth. \"You left?\" I accused, touching the collar of his fresh shirt. \"I could hardly leave in the clothes I came in \u2014 what would the neighbors think?\"  I pouted. \"You were very deeply asleep; I didn't miss anything.\u201dHis eyes gleamed. \"The talking came earlier.\" I groaned. \"What did you hear?\" His gold eyes grew very soft. \"You said you loved me.\" \"You knew that already,\" I reminded him, <em>ducking</em> my head. \"It was nice to hear, just the same.\" I hid my face against his shoulder. \"I love you,\" I whispered. \"You are my life now,\u201dHe answered simply. There was nothing more to say for the moment. He rocked us back and forth as the room grew lighter. \"Breakfast time,\u201dHe said eventually, casually \u2014 to prove, I'm sure, that he remembered all my human frailties. So I clutched my throat with both hands and stared at him with wide eyes. Shock crossed his face. \"Kidding!\" I snickered. \"And you said I couldn't act!\" He frowned in disgust. \"That wasn't funny.\" \"It was very funny, and you know it.\" But I examined his gold eyes carefully, to make sure that I was forgiven. Apparently, I was. \"Shall I rephrase?\u201dHe asked. \"Breakfast time for the human.\" \"Oh, okay.\" He threw me over his stone shoulder, gently, but with a swiftness that left me breathless. I protested as he carried me easily down the stairs, but he ignored me. He sat me right side up on a chair. The kitchen was bright, happy, seeming to absorb my mood. \"What's for breakfast?\" I asked pleasantly. That threw him for a minute. \"Er, I'm not sure. What would you like?\u201dHis marble brow puckered. I grinned, hopping up. \"That's all right, I fend for myself pretty well. Watch me hunt.\" I found a bowl and a box of cereal. I could feel his eyes on me as I poured the milk and grabbed a spoon. I sat my food on the table, and then paused. \"Can I get you anything?\" I asked, not wanting to be rude. He rolled his eyes. \"Just eat, Bella.\" I sat at the table, watching him as I took a bite. He was gazing at me, studying my every movement. It made me self-conscious. I cleared my mouth to speak, to distract him. \"What's on the agenda for today?\" I asked. \"Hmmm\u2026\" I watched him frame his answer carefully. \"What would you say to meeting my family?\" I gulped. \"Are you afraid now?\u201dHe sounded hopeful. \"Yes,\" I admitted; how could I deny it \u2014 he could see my eyes. \"Don't worry.\u201dHe smirked. \"I'll protect you.\" \"I'm not afraid of them,\" I explained. \"I'm afraid they won't\u2026 like me. Won't they be, well, surprised that you would bring someone\u2026 like me\u2026 home to meet them? Do they know that I know about them?\" \"Oh, they already know everything. They'd taken bets yesterday, you know\" \u2014 he smiled, but his voice was harsh \u2014 \"on whether I'd bring you back, though why anyone would bet against Alice, I can't imagine. At any rate, we don't have secrets in the family. It's not really feasible, what with my mind reading and Alice seeing the future and all that.\" \"And Jasper making you feel all warm and fuzzy about spilling your guts, don't forget that.\" \"You paid attention,\u201dHe smiled approvingly. \"I've been known to do that every now and then.\" I grimaced. \"So did Alice see me coming?\" His reaction was strange. \"Something like that,\u201dHe said uncomfortably, turning away so I couldn't see his eyes. I stared at him curiously. \"Is that any good?\u201dHe asked, turning back to me abruptly and eyeing my breakfast with a teasing look on his face. \"Honestly, it doesn't look very appetizing.\" \"Well, it's no irritable grizzly\u2026\" I murmured, ignoring him when he glowered. I was still wondering why he responded that way when I mentioned Alice. I hurried through my cereal, speculating. He stood in the middle of the kitchen, the statue of Adonis again, staring abstractedly out the back windows. Then his eyes were back on me, and he smiled his heartbreaking smile. \"And you should introduce me to your father, too, I think.\" \"He already knows you,\" I reminded him. \"As your boyfriend, I mean.\" I stared at him with suspicion. \"Why?\" \"Isn't that customary?\u201dHe asked innocently. \"I don't know,\" I admitted. My dating history gave me few reference points to work with. Not that any normal rules of dating applied here. \"That's not necessary, you know. I don't expect you to\u2026 I mean, you don't have to pretend for me.\" His smile was patient. \"I'm not pretending.\" I pushed the remains of my cereal around the edges of the bowl, biting my lip. \"Are you going to tell Charlie I'm your boyfriend or not?\u201dHe demanded. \"Is that what you are?\" I suppressed my internal cringing at the thought of Edward and Charlie and the word boy friend all in the same room at the same time. \"It's a loose interpretation of the word 'boy,' I'll admit.\"  \"I was under the impression that you were something more, actually,\" I confessed, looking at the table. \"Well, I don't know if we need to give him all the gory details.\u201dHe reached across the table to lift my chin with a cold, gentle finger. \"But he will need some explanation for why I'm around here so much. I don't want Chief Swan getting a restraining order put on me.\" \"Will you be?\" I asked, suddenly anxious. \"Will you really be here?\" \"As long as you want me,\u201dHe assured me. \"I'll always want you,\" I warned him. \"Forever.\" He walked slowly around the table, and, pausing a few feet away, he reached out to touch his fingertips to my cheek. His expression was unfathomable. \"Does that make you sad?\" I asked. He didn't answer. He stared into my eyes for an immeasurable period of time. \"Are you finished?\u201dHe finally asked. I jumped up. \"Yes.\" \"Get dressed \u2014 I'll wait here.\" It was hard to decide what to wear. I doubted there were any etiquette books detailing how to dress when your vampire sweetheart takes you home to meet his vampire family. It was a relief to think the word to myself. I knew I shied away from it intentionally. I ended up in my only skirt \u2014 long, khaki-colored, still casual. I put on the dark blue blouse he'd once complimented. A quick glance in the mirror told me my hair was entirely impossible, so I pulled it back into a pony tail. \"Okay.\" I bounced down the stairs. \"I'm decent.\" He was waiting at the foot of the stairs, closer than I'd thought, and I bounded right into him. He steadied me, holding me a careful distance away for a few seconds before suddenly pulling me closer. \"Wrong again,\u201dHe murmured in my ear. \"You are utterly indecent \u2014 no one should look so tempting, it's not fair.\" \"Tempting how?\" I asked. \"I can change\u2026\" He sighed, shaking his head. \"You are so absurd.\u201dHe pressed his cool lips delicately to my forehead, and the room spun. The smell of his breath made it impossible to think.  \"Shall I explain how you are tempting me?\u201dHe said. It was clearly a rhetorical question. His fingers traced slowly down my spine, his breath coming more quickly against my skin. My hands were limp on his chest, and I felt lightheaded again. He tilted his head slowly and touched his cool lips to mine for the second time, very carefully, parting them slightly. And then I collapsed. \"Bella?\u201dHis voice was alarmed as he caught me and held me up. \"You\u2026 made\u2026 me\u2026 faint,\" I accused him dizzily. \"What am I going to do with you?\u201dHe groaned in exasperation. \"Yesterday I kiss you, and you attack me! Today you pass out on me!\" I laughed weakly, letting his arms support me while my head spun. \"So much for being good at everything,\u201dHe sighed. \"That's the problem.\" I was still dizzy. \"You're too good. Far, far too good.\" \"Do you feel sick?\u201dHe asked; he'd seen me like this before. \"No \u2014 that wasn't the same kind of fainting at all. I don't know what happened.\" I shook my head apologetically, \"I think I forgot to breathe.\" \"I can't take you anywhere like this.\" \"I'm fine,\" I insisted. \"Your family is going to think I'm insane anyway, what's the difference?\" He measured my expression for a moment. \"I'm very partial to that color with your skin,\u201dHe offered unexpectedly. I flushed with pleasure, and looked away. \"Look, I'm trying really hard not to think about what I'm about to do, so can we go already?\" I asked. \"And you're worried, not because you're headed to meet a houseful of vampires, but because you think those vampires won't approve of you, correct?\" \"That's right,\" I answered immediately, hiding my surprise at his casual use of the word. He shook his head. \"You're incredible.\" I realized, as he drove my truck out of the main part of town, that I had no idea where he lived. We passed over the bridge at the Calawah River, the road winding northward, the houses flashing past us growing farther apart, getting bigger. And then we were past the other houses altogether, driving through misty forest. I was trying to decide whether to ask or be patient, when he turned abruptly onto an unpaved road. It was unmarked, barely visible among the ferns. The forest encroached on both sides, leaving the road ahead only discernible for a few meters as it twisted, serpentlike, around the ancient trees. And then, after a few miles, there was some thinning of the woods, and we were suddenly in a small meadow, or was it actually a lawn? The gloom of the forest didn't relent, though, for there were six primordial cedars that shaded an entire acre with their vast sweep of branches. The trees held their protecting shadow right up to the walls of the house that rose among them, making obsolete the deep porch that wrapped around the first story. I don't know what I had expected, but it definitely wasn't this. The house was timeless, graceful, and probably a hundred years old. It was painted a soft, faded white, three stories tall, \u00a0\u00a0rectangular and well proportioned. The windows and doors were either part of the original structure or a perfect restoration. My truck was the only car in sight. I could hear the river close by, hidden in the obscurity of the forest. \"Wow.\" \"You like it?\u201dHe smiled. \"It\u2026 has a certain charm.\" He pulled the end of my ponytail and chuckled. \"Ready?\u201dHe asked, opening my door. \"Not even a little bit \u2014 let's go.\" I tried to laugh, but it seemed to get stuck in my throat. I smoothed my hair nervously. \"You look lovely.\u201dHe took my hand easily, without thinking about it. We walked through the deep shade up to the porch. I knew he could feel my tension; his thumb rubbed soothing circles into the back of my hand. He opened the door for me. The inside was even more surprising, less predictable, than the exterior. It was very bright, very open, and very large. This must have originally been several rooms, but the walls had been removed from most of the first floor to create one wide space. The back, south-facing wall had been entirely replaced with glass, and, beyond the shade of the cedars, the lawn stretched bare to the wide river. A massive curving staircase dominated the west side of the room. The walls, the high-beamed ceiling, the wooden floors, and the thick carpets were all varying shades of white. Waiting to greet us, standing just to the left of the door, on a raised portion of the floor by a spectacular grand piano, were Edward's parents. I'd seen Dr. Cullen before, of course, yet I couldn't help but be struck again by his youth, his outrageous perfection. At his side was Esme, I assumed, the only one of the family I'd never seen before. She had the same pale, beautiful features as the rest of them. Something about her heart-shaped face, her billows of soft, caramel-colored hair, reminded me of the ing\u00e9nues of the silent-movie era. She was small, slender, yet less angular, more rounded than the others. They were both dressed casually, in light colors that matched the inside of the house. They smiled in welcome, but made no move to approach us. Trying not to frighten me, I guessed. \"Carlisle, Esme,\u201dEdward's voice broke the short silence, \"this is Bella.\" \"You're very welcome, Bella.\u201dCarlisle's step was measured, careful as he approached me. He raised his hand tentatively, and I stepped forward to shake hands with him. \"It's nice to see you again, Dr. Cullen.\" \"Please, call me Carlisle.\" \"Carlisle.\" I grinned at him, my sudden confidence surprising me. I could feel Edward's relief at my side. Esme smiled and stepped forward as well, reaching for my hand. Her cold, stone grasp was just as I expected. \"It's very nice to know you,\" she said sincerely. \"Thank you. I'm glad to meet you, too.\u201dAnd I was. It was like meeting a fairy tale \u2014 Snow White, in the flesh. \"Where are Alice and Jasper?\u201dEdward asked, but no one answered, as they had just appeared at the top of the wide staircase. \"Hey, Edward!\u201dAlice called enthusiastically. She ran down the stairs, a streak of black hair and white skin, coming to a sudden and graceful stop in front of me. Carlisle and Esme shot warning glances at her, but I liked it. It was natural \u2014 for her, anyway. \"Hi, Bella!\u201dAlice said, and she bounced forward to kiss my cheek. If Carlisle and Esme had looked cautious before, they now looked staggered. There was shock in my eyes, too, but I was also very pleased that she seemed to approve of me so entirely. I was startled to feel Edward stiffen at my side. I glanced at his face, but his expression was unreadable. \"You do smell nice, I never noticed before,\" she commented, to my extreme embarrassment. No one else seemed to know quite what to say, and then Jasper was there \u2014 tall and leonine. A feeling of ease spread through me, and I was suddenly comfortable despite where I was. Edward stared at Jasper, raising one eyebrow, and I remembered what Jasper could do.  \"Hello, Bella,\" Jasper said. He kept his distance, not offering to shake my hand. But it was impossible to feel awkward near him. \"Hello, Jasper.\" I smiled at him shyly, and then at the others. \"It's nice to meet you all \u2014 you have a very beautiful home,\" I added conventionally. \"Thank you,\u201dEsme said. \"We're so glad that you came.\" She spoke with feeling, and I realized that she thought I was brave. I also realized that Rosalie and Emmett were nowhere to be seen, and I remembered Edward's too-innocent denial when I'd asked him if the others didn't like me. Carlisle's expression distracted me from this train of thought; he was gazing meaningfully at Edward with an intense expression. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Edward nod once. I looked away, trying to be polite. My eyes wandered again to the beautiful instrument on the platform by the door. I suddenly remembered my childhood fantasy that, should I ever win a lottery, I would buy a grand piano for my mother. She wasn't really good \u2014 she only played for herself on our secondhand upright \u2014 but I loved to watch her play. She was happy, absorbed \u2014 she seemed like a new, mysterious being to me then, someone outside the \"mom\" persona I took for granted. She'd put me through lessons, of course, but like most kids, I whined until she let me quit. Esme noticed my preoccupation. \"Do you play?\" she asked, inclining her head toward the piano. I shook my head. \"Not at all. But it's so beautiful. Is it yours?\" \"No,\" she laughed. \"Edward didn't tell you he was musical?\" \"No.\" I glared at his suddenly innocent expression with narrowed eyes. \"I should have known, I guess.\" Esme raised her delicate eyebrows in confusion. \"Edward can do everything, right?\" I explained. Jasper snickered and Esme gave Edward a reproving look. \"I hope you haven't been showing off\u2014 it's rude,\" she scolded. \"Just a bit,\u201dHe laughed freely. Her face softened at the sound, and they shared a brief look that I didn't understand, though Esme's face seemed almost smug. \"He's been too modest, actually,\" I corrected. \"Well, play for her,\u201dEsme encouraged. \"You just said showing off was rude,\u201dHe objected. \"There are exceptions to every rule,\" she replied. \"I'd like to hear you play,\" I volunteered. \"It's settled then.\u201dEsme pushed him toward the piano. He pulled me along, sitting me on the bench beside him. He gave me a long, exasperated look before he turned to the keys. And then his fingers flowed swiftly across the ivory, and the room was filled with a composition so complex, so luxuriant, it was impossible to believe only one set of hands played. I felt my chin drop, my mouth open in astonishment, and heard low chuckles behind me at my reaction. Edward looked at me casually, the music still surging around us without a break, and winked. \"Do you like it?\" \"You wrote this?\" I gasped, understanding. He nodded. \"It's Esme's favorite.\" I closed my eyes, shaking my head. \"What's wrong?\" \"I'm feeling extremely insignificant.\" The music slowed, transforming into something softer, and to my surprise I detected the melody of his lullaby weaving through the profusion of notes. \"You inspired this one,\u201dHe said softly. The music grew unbearably sweet. I couldn't speak. \"They like you, you know,\u201dHe said conversationally. \"Esme especially.\" I glanced behind me, but the huge room was empty now. \"Where did they go?\" \"Very subtly giving us some privacy, I suppose.\" I sighed. \"They like me. But Rosalie and Emmett\u2026\" I trailed off, not sure how to express my doubts. He frowned. \"Don't worry about Rosalie,\u201dHe said, his eyes wide and persuasive. \"She'll come around.\" I pursed my lips skeptically. \"Emmett?\" \"Well, he thinks I'm a lunatic, it's true, but he doesn't have a problem with you. He's trying to reason with Rosalie.\" \"What is it that upsets her?\" I wasn't sure if I wanted to know the answer. He sighed deeply. \"Rosalie struggles the most with\u2026 with what we are.\u00a0 It's hard for her to have someone on the outside know the truth. And she's a little jealous.\" \"Rosalie is jealous of me?\" I asked incredulously. I tried to imagine a universe in which someone as breathtaking as Rosalie would have any possible reason to feel jealous of someone like me. \"You're human.\u201dHe shrugged. \"She wishes that she were, too.\" \"Oh,\" I muttered, still stunned. \"Even Jasper, though\u2026\" \"That's really my fault,\u201dHe said. \"I told you he was the most recent to try our way of life. I warned him to keep his distance.\" I thought about the reason for that, and shuddered. \"Esme and Carlisle\u2026 ?\" I continued quickly, to keep him from noticing. \"Are happy to see me happy. Actually, Esme wouldn't care if you had a third eye and webbed feet. All this time she's been worried about me, afraid that there was something missing from my essential makeup, that I was too young when Carlisle changed me\u2026 She's ecstatic. Every time I touch you, she just about chokes with satisfaction.\" \"Alice seems very\u2026 enthusiastic.\" \"Alice has her own way of looking at things,\u201dHe said through tight lips. \"And you're not going to explain that, are you?\" A moment of wordless communication passed between us. He realized that I knew he was keeping something from me. I realized that he wasn't going to give anything away. Not now. \"So what was Carlisle telling you before?\" His eyebrows pulled together. \"You noticed that, did you?\" I shrugged. \"Of course.\" He looked at me thoughtfully for a few seconds before answering. \"He wanted to tell me some news \u2014 he didn't know if it was something I would share with you.\" \"Will you?\" \"I have to, because I'm going to be a little\u2026 overbearingly protective over the next few days \u2014 or weeks \u2014 and I wouldn't want you to think I'm naturally a tyrant.\" \"What's wrong?\" \"Nothing's wrong, exactly. Alice just sees some visitors coming soon. They know we're here, and they're curious.\" \"Visitors?\" \"Yes\u2026 well, they aren't like us, of course \u2014 in their hunting habits, I mean. They probably won't come into town at all, but I'm certainly not going to let you out of my sight till they're gone.\" I shivered. \"Finally, a rational response!\u201dHe murmured. \"I was beginning to think you had no sense of self-preservation at all.\" I let that one pass, looking away, my eyes wandering again around the spacious room. He followed my gaze. \"Not what you expected, is it?\u201dHe asked, his voice smug. \"No,\" I admitted. \"No coffins, no piled skulls in the corners; I don't even think we have cobwebs\u2026 what a disappointment this must be for you,\u201dHe continued slyly. I ignored his teasing. \"It's so light\u2026 so open.\" He was more serious when he answered. \"It's the one place we never have to hide.\" ,  The song he was still playing, my song, drifted to an end, the final chords shifting to a more melancholy key. The last note hovered poignantly in the silence. \"Thank you,\" I murmured. I realized there were tears in my eyes. I dabbed at them, embarrassed. He touched the corner of my eye, trapping one I missed. He lifted his finger, examining the drop of moisture broodingly. Then, so quickly I couldn't be positive that he really did, he put his finger to his mouth to taste it. I looked at him questioningly, and he gazed back for a long moment before he finally smiled. \"Do you want to see the rest of the house?\" \"No coffins?\" I verified, the sarcasm in my voice not entirely masking the slight but genuine anxiety I felt. He laughed, taking my hand, leading me away from the piano. \"No coffins,\u201dHe promised. We walked up the massive staircase, my hand trailing along the satin-smooth rail. The long hall at the top of the stairs was paneled with a honey-colored wood, the same as the floorboards. \"Rosalie and Emmett's room\u2026 Carlisle's office\u2026 Alice's room\u2026\u201dHe gestured as he led me past the doors. He would have continued, but I stopped dead at the end of the hall, staring incredulously at the ornament hanging on the wall above my head. Edward chuckled at my bewildered expression. \"You can laugh,\u201dHe said. \"It is sort of ironic.\" I didn't laugh. My hand raised automatically, one finger extended as if to touch the large wooden cross, its dark patina contrasting with the lighter tone of the wall. I didn't touch it, though I was curious if the aged wood would feel as silky as it looked. \"It must be very old,\" I guessed. He shrugged. \"Early sixteen-thirties, more or less.\" I looked away from the cross to stare at him. \"Why do you keep this here?\" I wondered. \"Nostalgia. It belonged to Carlisle's father.\" \"He collected antiques?\" I suggested doubtfully. \"No. He carved this himself. It hung on the wall above the pulpit in the vicarage where he preached.\" I wasn't sure if my face betrayed my shock, but I returned to gazing at the simple, ancient cross, just in case. I quickly did the mental math; the cross was over three hundred and seventy years old. The silence stretched on as I struggled to wrap my mind around the concept of so many years. \"Are you all right?\u201dHe sounded worried. \"How old is Carlisle?\" I asked quietly, ignoring his question, still staring up. \"He just celebrated his three hundred and sixty-second birthday,\u201dEdward said. I looked back at him, a million questions in my eyes. He watched me carefully as he spoke. \"Carlisle was born in London, in the sixteen-forties, he believes. Time wasn't marked as accurately then, for the common people anyway. It was just before Cromwell's rule, though.\" I kept my face composed, aware of his scrutiny as I listened. It was easier if I didn't try to believe. \"He was the only son of an Anglican pastor. His mother died giving birth to him. His father was an intolerant man. As the Protestants came into power, he was enthusiastic in his persecution of Roman Catholics and other religions. He also believed very strongly in the reality of evil. He led hunts for witches, werewolves\u2026 and vampires.\" I grew very still at the word. I'm sure he noticed, but he went on without pausing. \"They burned a lot of innocent people \u2014 of course the real creatures that he sought were not so easy to catch. \"When the pastor grew old, he placed his obedient son in charge of the raids. At first Carlisle was a disappointment; he was not quick to accuse, to see demons where they did not exist. But he was persistent, and more clever than his father. He actually discovered a coven of true vampires that lived hidden in the sewers of the city, only coming out by night to hunt. In those days, when monsters were not just myths and legends, that was the way many lived. \"The people gathered their pitchforks and torches, of course\" \u2014 his brief laugh was darker now \u2014 \"and waited where Carlisle had seen the monsters exit into the street. Eventually one emerged.\" His voice was very quiet; I strained to catch the words. \"He must have been ancient, and weak with hunger. Carlisle heard him call out in Latin to the others when he caught the scent of the mob. He ran through the streets, and Carlisle \u2014 he was twenty-three and very fast \u2014 was in the lead of the pursuit. The creature could have easily outrun them, but Carlisle thinks he was too hungry, so he turned and attacked. He fell on Carlisle first, but the others were close behind, and he turned to defend himself. He killed two men, and made off with a third, leaving Carlisle bleeding in the street.\" He paused. I could sense he was editing something, keeping something from me. \"Carlisle knew what his father would do. The bodies would be burned \u2014 anything infected by the monster must be destroyed. Carlisle acted instinctively to save his own life. He crawled away from the alley while the mob followed the fiend and his victim. He hid in a cellar, buried himself in rotting potatoes for three days. It's a miracle he was able to keep silent, to stay undiscovered. \"It was over then, and he realized what he had become.\" I'm not sure what my face was revealing, but he suddenly broke off. \"How are you feeling?\u201dHe asked. \"I'm fine,\" I assured him. And, though I bit my lip in hesitation, he must have seen the curiosity burning in my eyes. He smiled. \"I expect you have a few more questions for me.\" \"A few.\" His smile widened over his brilliant teeth. He started back down the hall, pulling me along by the hand. \"Come on, then,\u201dHe encouraged. \"I'll show you.\"",

            "en": "7 REPETITION        9. THIRD WHEEL TIME BEGAN TO TRIP ALONG MUCH MORE QUICKLY than before. School, work, and Jacob\u2014though not necessarily in that order\u2014created a neat and effortless pattern to follow. And Charlie got his wish: I wasn't miserable anymore. Of course, I couldn't fool myself completely. When I stopped to take stock of my life, which I tried not to do too often, I couldn't ignore the implications of my behavior. I was like a lost moon\u2014my planet destroyed in some cataclysmic, disaster-movie scenario of desolation\u2014that continued, nevertheless, to circle in a tight little orbit around the empty space left behind, ignoring the laws of gravity. I was getting better with my bike, which meant fewer bandages to worry Charlie. But it also meant that the voice in my head began to fade, until I heard it no more. Quietly, I panicked. I threw myself into the search for the meadow with slightly frenzied intensity. I racked my brain for other adrenaline-producing activities. I didn't keep track of the days that passed\u2014there was no reason, as I tried to live as much in the present as possible, no past fading, no future impending. So I was surprised by the date when Jacob brought it up on one of our homework days. He was waiting when I pulled up in front of his house. \"Happy Valentine's Day,\" Jacob said, smiling, but <em>ducking</em> his head as he greeted me. He held out a small, pink box, balancing it on his palm. Conversation hearts. \"Well, I feel like a schmuck,\" I mumbled. \"Is today Valentine's Day?\" Jacob shook his head with mock sadness. \"You can be so out of it sometimes. Yes, it is the fourteenth day of February. So are you going to be my Valentine? Since you didn't get me a fifty-cent box of candy, it's the least you can do.\" I started to feel uncomfortable. The words were teasing, but only on the surface. \"What exactly does that entail?\" I hedged. \"The usual\u2014slave for life, that kind of thing.\" \"Oh, well, if that's all\u2026\" I took the candy. But I was trying to think of some way to make the boundaries clear. Again. They seemed to get blurred a lot with Jacob. \"So, what are we doing tomorrow? Hiking, or the ER?\" \"Hiking,\" I decided. \"You're not the only one who can be obsessive. I'm starting to think I imagined that place\u2026\" I frowned into space. \"We'll find it,\" he assured me. \"Bikes Friday?\" he offered. I saw a chance and took it without taking time to think it through. \"I'm going to a movie Friday. I've been promising my cafeteria crowd that I would go out forever.\" Mike would be pleased. But Jacob's face fell. I caught the expression in his dark eyes before he dropped them to look at the ground. \"You'll come too, right?\" I added quickly. \"Or will it be too much of a drag with a bunch of boring seniors?\" So much for my chance to put some distance between us. I couldn't stand hurting Jacob; we seemed to be connected in an odd way, and his pain set off little stabs of my own. Also, the idea of having his company for the ordeal\u2014I had promised Mike, but really didn't feel any enthusiasm at the thought of following through\u2014was just too tempting. \"You'd like me to come, with your friends there?\" \"Yes,\" I admitted honestly, knowing as I continued that I was probably shooting myself in the foot with my words. \"I'll have a lot more fun if you're there. Bring Quil, and we'll make it a party.\" \"Quil's gonna freak. Senior girls.\" He chortled and rolled his eyes. I didn't mention Embry, and neither did he. I laughed, too. \"I'll try to get him a good selection.\" I broached the subject with Mike in English. \"Hey, Mike,\" I said when class was over. \"Are you free Friday night?\" He looked up, his blue eyes instantly hopeful. \"Yeah, I am. You want to go out?\" I worded my reply carefully. \"I was thinking about getting a group\"\u2014I emphasized the word\u2014\"together to go see Crosshairs.\" I'd done my homework this time\u2014even reading the movie spoilers to be sure I wouldn't be caught off guard. This movie was supposed to be a bloodbath from start to finish. I wasn't so recovered that I could stand to sit through a romance. \"Does that sound like fun?\" \"Sure,\" he agreed, visibly less eager. \"Cool.\" After a second, he perked back up to near his former excitement level. \"How about we get Angela and Ben? Or Eric and Katie?\" He was determined to make this some kind of double date, apparently. \"How about both?\" I suggested \"And Jessica, too, of course. And Tyler and Conner, and maybe Lauren,\" I tacked on grudgingly. I had promised Quil variety. \"Okay,\" Mike muttered, foiled. \"And,\" I continued, \"I've got a couple of friends from La Push I'm inviting. So it sounds like we'll need your Suburban if everyone comes.\" Mike's eyes narrowed in suspicion. \"These are the friends you spend all your time studying with now?\" \"Yep, the very ones,\" I answered cheerfully. \"Though you could look at it as tutoring\u2014they're only sophomores.\" \"Oh,\" Mike said, surprised. After a second of thought, he smiled. In the end, though, the Suburban wasn't necessary. Jessica and Lauren claimed to be busy as soon as Mike let it slip that I was involved in the planning. Eric and Katie already had plans\u2014it was their three-week anniversary or something. Lauren got to Tyler and Conner before Mike could, so those two were also busy. Even Quil was out\u2014grounded for fighting at school. In the end, only Angela and Ben, and, of course Jacob, were able to go. The diminished numbers didn't dampen Mike's anticipation, though. It was all he could talk about Friday. \"Are you sure you don't want to see Tomorrow and Forever instead?\" he asked at lunch, naming the current romantic comedy that was ruling the box office. \"Rotten Tomatoes gave it a better review.\" \"I want to see Crosshairs\" I insisted. \"I'm in the mood for action. Bring on the blood and guts! \" \"Okay.\" Mike turned away, but not before I saw his maybe-she's-crazy-after-all expression. When I got home from school, a very familiar car was parked in front of my house. Jacob was leaning against the hood, a huge grin lighting up his face. \"No way! \" I shouted as I jumped out of the truck. \"You're done! \u00a0I can't believe it! \u00a0You finished the Rabbit! \" He beamed. \"Just last night. This is the maiden voyage.\" \"Incredible.\" I held my hand up for a high five. He smacked his hand against mine, but left it there, twisting his fingers through mine. \"So do I get to drive tonight?\" \"Definitely,\" I said, and then I sighed. \"What's wrong?\" \"I'm giving up\u2014I can't top this one. So you win. You're oldest.\" He shrugged, unsurprised by my capitulation. \"Of course I am.\" Mike's Suburban chugged around the corner. I pulled my hand out of Jacob's, and he nude a face that I wasn't meant to see. \"I remember this guy,\" he said in a low voice as Mike parked across the street. \"The one who thought you were his girlfriend. Is he still confused?\" I raised one eyebrow. \"Some people are hard to discourage.\" \"Then again,\" Jacob said thoughtfully, \"sometimes persistence pays off.\" \"Most of the time it's just annoying, though.\" Mike got out of his car and crossed the road. \"Hey, Bella,\" he greeted me, and then his eyes turned wary as he looked up at Jacob. I glanced briefly at Jacob, too, trying to be objective. He really didn't look like a sophomore at all. He was just so big\u2014Mike's head barely cleared Jacob's shoulder; I didn't even want to think where I measured next to him\u2014and then his face was older-looking than it used to be, even a month ago. \"Hey, Mike! \u00a0Do you remember Jacob Black?\" \"Not really.\" Mike held out his hand. \"Old family friend,\" Jacob introduced himself, shaking hands. They locked hands with more force than necessary. When their grip broke, Mike flexed his fingers. I heard the phone ringing from the kitchen. \"I'd better get that\u2014it might be Charlie,\" I told them, and dashed inside. It was Ben. Angela was sick with the stomach flu, and he didn't feel like coming without her. He apologized for bailing on us. I walked slowly back to the waiting boys, shaking my head. I really hoped Angela would feel better soon, but I had to admit that I was selfishly upset by this development. Just the three of us, Mike and Jacob and me, together for the evening\u2014this had worked out brilliantly, I thought with grim sarcasm. It didn't seem like Jake and Mike had made any progress towards friendship in my absence. They were several yards apart, facing away from each other as they waited for me; Mike's expression was sullen, though Jacob's was cheerful as always. \"Ang is sick,\" I told them glumly. \"She and Ben aren't coming.\" \"I guess the flu is making another round. Austin and Conner were out today, too. Maybe we should do this another time,\" Mike suggested. Before I could agree, Jacob spoke. \"I'm still up for it. But if you'd rather to stay behind, Mike\u2014\" \"No, I'm coming,\" Mike interrupted. \"I was just thinking of Angela and Ben. Let's go.\" He started toward his Suburban. \"Hey, do you mind if Jacob drives?\" I asked. \"I told him he could\u2014he just finished his car. He built it from scratch, all by himself,\" I bragged, proud as a PTA mom with a student on the principal's list. \"Fine,\" Mike snapped. \"All right, then,\" Jacob said, as if that settled everything. He seemed more comfortable than anyone else. Mike climbed in the backseat of the Rabbit with a disgusted expression. Jacob was his normal sunny self, chattering away until I'd all but forgotten Mike sulking silently in the back. And then Mike changed his strategy. He leaned forward, resting his chin on the shoulder of my seat; his cheek almost touched mine. I shifted away, turning my back toward the window. \"Doesn't the radio work in this thing?\" Mike asked with a hint of petulance, interrupting Jacob mid-sentence. \"Yes,\" Jacob answered. \"But Bella doesn't like music.\" I stared at Jacob, surprised. I'd never told him that. \"Bella?\" Mike asked, annoyed. \"He's right,\" I mumbled, still looking at Jacob's serene profile. \"How can you not like music?\" Mike demanded. I shrugged. \"I don't know. It just irritates me.\" \"Hmph.\" Mike leaned away. When we got to the theater, Jacob handed me a ten-dollar bill. \"What's this?\" I objected. \"I'm not old enough to get into this one,\" he reminded me. I laughed out loud. \"So much for relative ages. Is Billy going to kill me if I sneak you in?\" \"No. I told him you were planning to corrupt my youthful innocence.\" I snickered, and Mike quickened his pace to keep up with us. I almost wished that Mike had decided to bow out. He was still sullen\u2014not much of an addition to the party. But I didn't want to end up on a date alone with Jacob, either. That wouldn't help anything. The movie was exactly what it professed to be. In just the opening credits, four people got blown up and one got beheaded. The girl in front of me put her hands over her eyes and turned her face into her date's chest. He patted her shoulder, and winced occasionally, too. Mike didn't look like he was watching. His face was stiff as he glared toward the fringe of curtain above the screen. I settled in to endure the two hours, watching the colors and the movement on the screen rather than seeing the shapes of people and cars and houses. But then Jacob started sniggering. \"What?\" I whispered. \"Oh, c'mon! \" he hissed back. \"The blood squirted twenty feet out of that guy. How fake can you get?\" He chuckled again, as a flagpole speared another man into a concrete wall. After that, I really watched the show, laughing with him as the mayhem got more and more ridiculous. How was I ever going to fight the blurring lines in our relationship when I enjoyed being with him so much? Both Jacob and Mike had claimed the armrests on either side of me. Both of their hands rested lightly, palms up, in an unnatural looking position. Like steel bear traps, open and ready. Jacob was in the habit of taking my hand whenever the opportunity presented itself, but here in the darkened movie theater, with Mike watching, it would have a different significance\u2014and I was sure he knew that. I couldn't believe that Mike was thinking the same thing, but his hand was placed exactly like Jacob's. I folded my arms tightly across my chest and hoped that both their hands fell asleep. Mike gave up first. About halfway through the movie, he pulled his arm back, and leaned forward to put his head in his hands. At first I thought he was reacting to something on the screen, but then he moaned. \"Mike, are you okay?\" I whispered. The couple in front of us turned to look at him as he groaned again. I could see the sheen of sweat across his face in the light from the screen. Mike groaned again, and bolted for the door. I got up to follow him, and Jacob copied me immediately. \"No, stay,\" I whispered. \"I'll make sure he's okay.\" Jacob came with me anyway. \"You don't have to come. Get your eight bucks worth of carnage,\" I insisted as we walked up the aisle. \"That's okay. You sure can pick them, Bella. This movie really sucks.\" His voice rose from a whisper to its normal pitch as we walked out of the theater. There was no sign of Mike in the hallway, and I was glad then that Jacob had come with me\u2014he ducked into the men's bathroom to check for him there. Jacob was back in a few seconds. \"Oh, he's in there, all right,\" he said, rolling his eyes. \"What a marshmallow. You should hold out for someone with a stronger stomach. Someone who laughs at the gore that makes weaker men vomit.\" \"I'll keep my eyes open for someone like that.\" We were all alone in the hallway. Both theaters were halfway through the movie, and it was deserted\u2014quiet enough for us to hear the popcorn popping at the concession counter in the lobby. Jacob went to sit on the velveteen-upholstered bench against the wall, patting the space beside him. \"He sounded like he was going to be in there for a while,\" he said, stretching his long legs out in front of him as he settled in to wait. I joined him with a sigh. He looked like he was thinking about blurring more lines. Sure enough, as soon as I sat down, he shifted over to put his arm around my shoulders. \"Jake,\" I protested, leaning away. He dropped his arm, not looking bothered at all by the minor rejection. He reached out and took my hand firmly, wrapping his other hand around my wrist when I tried to pull away again. Where did he get the confidence from? \"Now, just hold on a minute, Bella,\" he said in a calm voice. \"Tell me something.\" I grimaced. I didn't want to do this. Not just not now, but not ever. There was nothing left in my life at this point that was more important than Jacob Black. But he seemed determined to ruin everything. \"What?\" I muttered sourly. \"You like me, right?\" \"You know I do.\" \"Better than that joker puking his guts out in there?\" He gestured toward the bathroom door. \"Yes,\" I sighed. \"Better than any of the other guys you know?\" He was calm, serene\u2014as if my answer didn't matter, or he already knew what it was. \"Better than the girls, too,\" I pointed out. \"But that's all,\" he said, and it wasn't a question. It was hard to answer, to say the word. Would he get hurt and avoid me? How would I stand that?  \"Yes,\" I whispered. He grinned down at me. \"That's okay, you know. As long as you like me the best. And you think I'm good-looking\u2014sort of. I'm prepared to be annoyingly persistent.\" \"I'm not going to change,\" I said, and though I tried to keep my voice normal, I could hear the sadness in it. His face was thoughtful, no longer teasing. \"It's still the other one, isn't it?\" I cringed. Funny how he seemed to know not to say the name\u2014just like before in the car with the music. He picked up on so much about me that I never said. \"You don't have to talk about it,\" he told me. I nodded, grateful. \"But don't get mad at me for hanging around, okay?\" Jacob patted the back of my hand. \"Because I'm not giving up. I've got loads of time.\" I sighed. \"You shouldn't waste it on me,\" I said, though I wanted him to. Especially if he was willing to accept me the way I was\u2014damaged goods, as is. \"It's what I want to do, as long as you still like to be with me.\" \"I can't imagine how I could not like being with you,\" I told him honestly. Jacob beamed. \"I can live with that.\" \"Just don't expect more,\" I warned him, trying to pull my hand away. He held onto it obstinately. \"This doesn't really bother you, does it?\" he demanded, squeezing my fingers. \"No,\" I sighed. Truthfully, it felt nice. His hand was so much warmer than mine; I always felt too cold these days. \"And you don't care what he thinks.\" Jacob jerked his thumb toward the bathroom. \"I guess not.\" \"So what's the problem?\" \"The problem,\" I said, \"is, that it means something different to me than it does to you.\" \"Well.\" He tightened his hand around mine \"That's my problem, isn't it?\" \"Fine,\" I grumbled. \"Don't forget it, though.\" \"I won't. The pin's out of the grenade for me, now, eh?\" He poked me in the ribs. I rolled my eyes. I guess if he felt like making a joke out of it, he was entitled. He chuckled quietly for a minute while his pinky finger absently traced designs against the side of my hand. \"That's a funny scar you've got there,\" he suddenly said, twisting my hand to examine it. \"How did that happen?\" The index finger of his free hand followed the line of the long silvery crescent that was barely visible against my pale skin. I scowled. \"Do you honestly expect me to remember where all my scars come from?\" I waited for the memory to hit\u2014to open the gaping hole. But, as it so often did, Jacob's presence kept me whole. \"It's cold,\" he murmured, pressing lightly against the place where James had cut me with his teeth. And then Mike stumbled out of the bathroom, his face ashen and covered in sweat. He looked horrible. \"Oh, Mike,\" I gasped. \"Do you mind leaving early?\" he whispered. \"No, of course not.\" I pulled my hand free and went to help Mike walk. He looked unsteady. \"Movie too much for you?\" Jacob asked heartlessly. Mike's glare was malevolent. \"I didn't actually see any of it,\" he mumbled. \"I was nauseated before the lights went down.\" \"Why didn't you say something?\" I scolded as we staggered toward the exit. \"I was hoping it would pass,\" he said. \"Just a sec,\" Jacob said as we reached the door. He walked quickly back to the concession stand. \"Could I have an empty popcorn bucket?\" he asked the salesgirl. She looked at Mike once, and then thrust a bucket at Jacob. \"Get him outside, please,\" she begged. She was obviously the one who would have to clean the floor. I towed Mike out into the cool, wet air. He inhaled deeply. Jacob was right behind us. He helped me get Mike into the back of the car, and handed him the bucket with a serious gaze. \"Please,\" was all Jacob said. We rolled down the windows, letting the icy night air blow through the car, hoping it would help Mike. I curled my arms around my legs to keep warm. \"Cold, again?\" Jacob asked, putting his arm around me before I could answer. \"You're not?\" He shook his head. \"You must have a fever or something,\" I grumbled. It was freezing. I touched my fingers to his forehead, and his head was hot. \"Whoa, Jake\u2014you're burning up! \" \"I feel fine.\" He shrugged. \"Fit as a fiddle.\" I frowned and touched his head again. His skin blazed under my fingers. \"Your hands are like ice,\" he complained. \"Maybe it's me,\" I allowed. Mike groaned in the backseat, and threw up in the bucket. I grimaced, hoping my own stomach could stand the sound and smell. Jacob checked anxiously over his shoulder to make sure his car wasn't defiled. The road felt longer on the way back. Jacob was quiet, thoughtful. He left his arm around me, and it was so warm that the cold wind felt good. I stared out the windshield, consumed with guilt. It was so wrong to encourage Jacob. Pure selfishness. It didn't matter that I'd tried to make my position clear. If he felt any hope at all that this could turn into something other than friendship, then I hadn't been clear enough. How could I explain so that he would understand? I was an empty shell. Like a vacant house\u2014condemned\u2014for months I'd been utterly uninhabitable. Now I was a little improved. The front room was in better repair. But that was all\u2014just the one small piece. He deserved better than that\u2014better than a one-room, falling-down fixer-upper. No amount of investment on his part could put me back in working order. Yet I knew that I wouldn't send him away, regardless. I needed him too much, and I was selfish. Maybe I could make my side more clear, so that he would know to leave me. The thought made me shudder, and Jacob tightened his arm around me. I drove Mike home in his Suburban, while Jacob followed behind us to take me home. Jacob was quiet all the way back to my house, and I wondered if he were thinking the same things that I was. Maybe he was changing his mind. \"I would invite myself in, since we're early,\" he said as we pulled up next to my truck. \"But I think you might be right about the fever. I'm starting to feel a little\u2026 strange.\" \"Oh no, not you, too! \u00a0Do you want me to drive you home?\" \"No.\" He shook his head, his eyebrows pulling together. \"I don't feel sick yet. Just\u2026 wrong. If I have to, I'll pull over.\" \"Will you call me as soon as you get in?\" I asked anxiously. \"Sure, sure.\" He frowned, staring ahead into the darkness and biting his lip. I opened my door to get out, but he grabbed my wrist lightly and held me there. I noticed again how hot his skin felt on mine. \"What is it, Jake?\" I asked. \"There's something I want to tell you, Bella\u2026 but I think it's going to sound kind of corny.\" I sighed. This would be more of the same from the theater. \"Go ahead.\" \"It's just that, I know how you're unhappy a lot. And, maybe it doesn't help anything, but I wanted you to know that I'm always here. I won't ever let you down\u2014I promise that you can always count on me.\u00a0 Wow, that does sound corny. But you know that, right? That I would never, ever hurt you?\" \"Yeah, Jake. I know that. And I already do count on you, probably more than you know.\" The smile broke across his face the way the sunrise set the clouds on fire, and I wanted to cut my tongue out. I hadn't said one word that was a lie, but I should have lied. The truth was wrong, it would hurt him. I would let him down. A strange look crossed his face. \"I really think I'd better go home now,\" he said. I got out quickly. \"Call me! \" I yelled as he pulled away. I watched him go, and he seemed to be in control of the car, at least. I stared at the empty street when he was gone, feeling a little sick myself, but not for any physical reason. How much I wished that Jacob Black had been born my brother, my flesh-and -blood brother, so that I would have some legitimate claim on him that still left me free of any blame now. Heaven knows I had never wanted to use Jacob, but I couldn't help but interpret the guilt I felt now to mean that I had. Even more, I had never meant to love him. One thing I truly knew\u2014knew it in the pit of my stomach, in the center of my bones, knew it from the crown of my head to the soles of my feet, knew it deep in my empty chest\u2014was how love gave someone the power to break you. I'd been broken beyond repair. But I needed Jacob now, needed him like a drug. I'd used him as a crutch for too long, and I was in deeper than I'd planned to go with anyone again. Now I couldn't bear for him to be hurt, and I couldn't keep from hurting him, either. He thought time and patience would change me, and, though I knew he was dead wrong, I also knew that I would let him try. He was my best friend. I would always love him, and it would never, ever be enough. I went inside to sit by the phone and bite my nails. \"Movie over already?\" Charlie asked in surprise when I came in. He was on the floor, just a foot from the TV. Must be an exciting game. \"Mike got sick,\" I explained. \"Some kind of stomach flu.\" \"You okay?\" \"I feel fine now,\" I said doubtfully. Clearly, I'd been exposed. I leaned against the kitchen counter, my hand inches from the phone, and tried to wait patiently. I thought of the strange look on Jacob's face before he drove away, and my fingers started drumming against the counter. I should have insisted on driving him home. I watched the clock as the minutes ticked by Ten. Fifteen. Even when I was driving, it took only fifteen minutes, and Jacob drove faster than I did. Eighteen minutes. I picked up the phone and dialed. It rang and rang. Maybe Billy was asleep. Maybe I'd dialed wrong. I tried again. On the eighth ring, just as I was about to hang up, Billy answered. \"Hello?\" he asked. His voice was wary, like he was expecting bad news. \"Billy, it's me, Bella\u2014did Jake make it home yet? He left here about twenty minutes ago.\" \"He's here,\" Billy said tonelessly. \"He was supposed to call me.\" I was a little irritated. \"He was getting sick when he left, and I was worried.\" \"He was\u2026 too sick to call. He's not feeling well right now.\" Billy sounded distant. I realized he must want to be with Jacob. \"Let me know if you need any help,\" I offered. \"I could come down.\" I thought of Billy, stuck in his chair, and Jake fending for himself\u2026 \"No, no,\" Billy said quickly. \"We're fine. Stay at your place.\" The way he said it was almost rude. \"Okay,\" I agreed. \"Bye, Bella.\" The line disconnected. \"Bye,\" I muttered. Well, at least he'd made it home. Oddly, I didn't feel less worried. I trudged up the stairs, fretting. Maybe I would go down before work tomorrow to check on him. I could take soup\u2014we had to have a can of Campbell's around here somewhere. I realized all such plans were canceled when I woke up early\u2014my clock said four thirty\u2014and sprinted to the bathroom. Charlie found me there a half hour later, lying on the floor, my cheek pressed against the cold edge of the bathtub. He looked at me for a long moment. \"Stomach flu,\" he finally said. \"Yes,\" I moaned. \"You need something?\" he asked. \"Call the Newtons for me, please,\" I instructed hoarsely. \"Tell them I have what Mike has, and that I can't make it in today. Tell them I'm sorry.\" \"Sure, no problem,\" Charlie assured me. I spent the rest of the day on the bathroom floor, sleeping for a few hours with my head on a crumpled up towel. Charlie claimed that he had to work, but I suspected that he just wanted access to a bathroom. He left a glass of water on the floor beside me to keep me hydrated. It woke me up when he came back home. I could see that it was dark in my room\u2014after nightfall. He clumped up the stairs to check on me. \"Still alive?\" \"Sort of,\" I said. \"Do you want anything?\" \"No, thanks.\" He hesitated, clearly out of his element. \"Okay, then,\" he said, and then he went back down to the kitchen. I heard the phone ring a few minutes later. Charlie spoke to someone in a low voice for a moment, and then hung up. \"Mike feels better,\" he called up to me. Well, that was encouraging. He'd only gotten sick eight hours or so before me. Eight more hours. The thought made my stomach turn, and I pulled myself up to lean over the toilet. I fell asleep on the towel again, but when I woke up I was in my bed and it was light outside my window. I didn't remember moving; Charlie must have carried me to my room\u2014he'd also put the glass of water on my bedside table. I felt parched. I chugged it down, though it tasted funny from sitting stagnant all night. I got up slowly, trying not to trigger the nausea again. I was weak, and my mouth tasted horrible, but my stomach felt fine. I looked at my clock. My twenty-four hours were up. I didn't push it, eating nothing but saltine crackers for breakfast. Charlie looked relieved to see me recovered. As soon as I was sure that I wasn't going to have to spend the day on the bathroom floor again, I called Jacob. Jacob was the one who answered, but when I heard his greeting I knew he wasn't over it. \"Hello?\" His voice was broken, cracking. \"Oh, Jake,\" I groaned sympathetically. \"You sound horrible.\" \"I feel horrible,\" he whispered. \"I'm so sorry I made you go out with me. This sucks.\" \"I'm glad I went.\" His voice was still a whisper. \"Don't blame yourself. This isn't your fault.\" \"You'll get better soon,\" I promised. \"I woke up this morning, and I was fine.\" \"You were sick?\" he asked dully. \"Yes, I got it, too. But I'm fine now.\" \"That's good.\" His voice was dead. \"So you'll probably be better in a few hours,\" I encouraged. I could barely hear his answer. \"I don't think I have the same thing you did.\" \"Don't you have the stomach flu?\" I asked, confused. \"No. This is something else.\" \"What's wrong with you?\" \"Everything,\" he whispered. \"Every part of me hurts.\" The pain in his voice was nearly tangible. \"What can I do, Jake? What can I bring you?\" \"Nothing. You can't come here.\" He was abrupt. It reminded me of Billy the other night. \"I've already been exposed to whatever you have,\" I pointed out. He ignored me. \"I'll call you when I can. I'll let you know when you can come down again.\" \"Jacob\u2014\" \"I've got to go,\" he said with sudden urgency. \"Call me when you feel better.\" \"Right,\" he agreed, and his voice had a strange, bitter edge. He was silent for a moment. I was waiting for him to say goodbye, but he waited too. \"I'll see you soon,\" I finally said.  \"Wait for me to call,\" he said again.  \"Okay\u2026 Bye, Jacob.\" \"Bella,\" he whispered my name, and then hung up the phone.",
