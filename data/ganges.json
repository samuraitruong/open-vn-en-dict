He turned to his disciples smiled and asked. 'Why do people shout in anger shout at each other?' Disciples thought for a while, one of them said, 'Because we lose our calm, we shout.'  'But, why should you shout when the other person is just next to you? You can as well tell him what you want to say in a soft manner.' asked the saint. Disciples gave some other answers but none satisfied the other disciples. Finally the saint explained,  'When two people are angry at each other, their hearts distance a lot. To cover that distance they must shout to be able to hear each other. The angrier they are, the stronger they will have to shout to hear each other to cover that great distance.  What happens when two people fall in love? They don't shout at each other but talk softly, Because their hearts are very close. The distance between them is either nonexistent or very small...' The saint continued, 'When they love each other even more, what happens? They do not speak, only whisper and they get even closer to each other in their love. Finally they even need not whisper, they only look at each other and that's all.\u201d He looked at his disciples and said. 'So when you argue do not let your hearts get distant, Do not say words that distance each other more, Or else there will come a day when the distance is so great that you will not find the path to return.'",
