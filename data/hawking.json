Inside, its pages told a story we all know today, but at the time it was a revelation: a Cambridge astrophysicist sought to solve the great mysteries of the universe, while he himself was trapped in a wheelchair by a progressive neurogenerative disease. I remember being struck by writer Timothy Ferris\u2019s description of Professor\u2019s Hawking\u2019s shoes, their soles pristine, having never touched the ground. I tucked the article in my knapsack, and a few days later I finished reading it on my way to lunch with a literary agent.",

I sent a letter to Professor <em>Hawking</em> along with our financial offer, making the case that Bantam could get his book in the hands of the widest possible readership.
