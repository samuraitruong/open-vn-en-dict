Eating a balanced diet with lots of fresh fruits and vegetables and cutting back on processed foods like chips and crackers can help. You might also want to reduce your salt intake (salt can make you retain water and become more bloated) and, believe it or not, drink more water. Say no to caffeine (it can make you <em>jumpy</em> and anxious) and yes to certain vitamins: B-complex vitamins, calcium, magnesium, and vitamin E are thought to be helpful.

            "en": "6            6. SWITZERLAND AS I DROVE HOME , I WASN\u2019T PAYING MUCH ATTENTION TO the road that shimmered wetly in the sun. I was thinking about the flood of information Jacob had shared with me, trying to sort it out, to force it all to make sense. Despite the overload, I felt lighter. Seeing Jacob smile, having all the secrets thrashed out . . . it didn\u2019t make things perfect, but it made them better. I was right to have gone. Jacob needed me. And obviously, I thought as I squinted into the glare, there was no danger. It came out of nowhere. One minute there was nothing but bright highway in my rearview mirror. The next minute, the sun was glinting off a silver Volvo right on my tail. \u201cAw, crap,\u201d I whimpered. I considered pulling over. But I was too much of a coward to face him right away. I\u2019d been counting on some prep time . . . and having Charlie nearby as a buffer. At least that would force him to keep his voice down. The Volvo followed inches behind me. I kept my eyes on the road ahead. Chicken through and through, I drove straight to Angela\u2019s without once meeting the gaze I could feel burning a hole in my mirror. He followed me until I pulled to the curb in front of the Webers\u2019 house. He didn\u2019t stop, and I didn\u2019t look up as he passed. I didn\u2019t want to see the expression on his face. I ran up the short concrete walk to Angela\u2019s door as soon as he was out of sight. Ben answered the door before I could finish knocking, like he\u2019d been standing right behind it. \u201cHey, Bella!\u201d he said, surprised. \u201cHi, Ben. Er, is Angela here?\u201d I wondered if Angela had forgotten our plans, and cringed at the thought of going home early. \u201cSure,\u201d Ben said just as Angela called, \u201cBella!\u201d and appeared at the top of the stairs. Ben peered around me as we both heard the sound of a car on the road; the sound didn\u2019t scare me \u2014 this engine stuttered to a stop, followed by the loud pop of a backfire. Nothing like the purr of the Volvo. This must be the visitor Ben had been waiting for. \u201cAustin\u2019s here,\u201d Ben said as Angela reached his side. A horn honked on the street. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll see you later,\u201d Ben promised. \u201cMiss you already.\u201d He threw his arm around Angela\u2019s neck and pulled her face down to his height so that he could kiss her enthusiastically. After a second of this, Austin honked again. \u201c\u2019Bye, Ang! Love you!\u201d Ben shouted as he dashed past me. Angela swayed, her face slightly pink, then recovered herself and waved until Ben and Austin were out of sight. Then she turned to me and grinned ruefully. \u201cThank you for doing this, Bella,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom the bottom of my heart. Not only are you saving my hands from permanent injury, you also just spared me two long hours of a plot-less, badly dubbed martial arts film.\u201d She sighed in relief. \u201cHappy to be of service.\u201d I was feeling a bit less panicked, able to breathe a little more evenly. It felt so ordinary here. Angela\u2019s easy human dramas were oddly reassuring. It was nice to know that life was normal somewhere . I followed Angela up the stairs to her room. She kicked toys out of the way as she went. The house was unusually quiet. \u201cWhere\u2019s your family?\u201d \u201cMy parents took the twins to a birthday party in Port Angeles. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re really going to help me with this. Ben\u2019s pretending he has tendonitis.\u201d She made a face. \u201cI don\u2019t mind at all,\u201d I said, and then I walked into Angela\u2019s room and saw the stacks of waiting envelopes. \u00a0\u201cOh!\u201d I gasped. Angela turned to look at me, apologies in her eyes. I could see why she\u2019d been putting this off, and why Ben had weaseled out. \u201cI thought you were exaggerating,\u201d I admitted. \u201cI wish. Are you sure you want to do this?\u201d \u201cPut me to work. I\u2019ve got all day.\u201d Angela divided a pile in half and put her mother\u2019s address book between us on her desk. For a while we concentrated, and there was just the sound of our pens scratching quietly across the paper. \u201cWhat\u2019s Edward doing tonight?\u201d she asked after a few minutes. My pen dug into the envelope I was working on. \u201cEmmet\u2019s home for the weekend. They\u2019re supposed to be hiking.\u201d \u201cYou say that like you\u2019re not sure.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky Edward has his brothers for all the hiking and camping. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do if Ben didn\u2019t have Austin for the guy stuff.\u201d \u201cYeah, the outdoors thing is not really for me. And there\u2019s no way I\u2019d ever be able to keep up.\u201d Angela laughed. \u201cI prefer the indoors myself.\u201d She focused on her pile for a minute. I wrote out four more addresses. There was never any pressure to fill a pause with meaningless chatter around Angela. Like Charlie, she was comfortable with silence. But, like Charlie, she was also too observant sometimes. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d she asked in a low voice now. \u201cYou seem . . . anxious.\u201d I smiled sheepishly. \u201cIs it that obvious?\u201d \u201cNot really.\u201d She was probably lying to make me feel better. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to talk about it unless you want to,\u201d she assured me. \u201cI\u2019ll listen if you think it will help.\u201d I was about to say thanks, but no thanks . After all, there were just too many secrets I was bound to keep. I really couldn\u2019t discuss my problems with someone human. That was against the rules. And yet, with a strange, sudden intensity, that\u2019s exactly what I wanted. I wanted to talk to a normal human girlfriend. I wanted to moan a little bit, like any other teenage girl. I wanted my problems to be that simple. It would also be nice to have someone outside the whole vampire-werewolf mess to put things in perspective. Someone unbiased. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll mind my own business,\u201d Angela promised, smiling down at the address she was working on. \u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I am anxious. It\u2019s . . . it\u2019s Edward.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d It was so easy to talk to Angela. When she asked a question like that, I could tell that she wasn\u2019t just morbidly curious or looking for gossip, like Jessica would have been. She cared that I was upset. \u201cOh, he\u2019s mad at me.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s hard to imagine,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s he mad about?\u201d I sighed. \u201cDo you remember Jacob Black?\u201d \u201cAh,\u201d she said. \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s jealous.\u201d \u201cNo, not jealous . . .\u201d I should have kept my mouth shut. There was no way to explain this right. But I wanted to keep talking anyway. I hadn\u2019t realized I was so starved for human conversation. \u201cEdward thinks Jacob is . . . a bad influence, I guess. Sort of . . . dangerous. You know how much trouble I got in a few months back. . . . It\u2019s all ridiculous, though.\u201d I was surprised to see Angela shaking her head. \u201cWhat?\u201d I asked. \u201cBella, I\u2019ve seen how Jacob Black looks at you. I\u2019d bet the real problem is jealousy.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not like that with Jacob.\u201d \u201cFor you, maybe. But for Jacob . . .\u201d I frowned. \u201cJacob knows how I feel. I\u2019ve told him everything.\u201d \u201cEdward\u2019s only human, Bella. He\u2019s going to react like any other boy.\u201d I grimaced. I didn\u2019t have a response to that. She patted my hand. \u201cHe\u2019ll get over it.\u201d \u201cI hope so. Jake\u2019s going through kind of a tough time. He needs me.\u201d \u201cYou and Jacob are pretty close, aren\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cLike family,\u201d I agreed. \u201cAnd Edward doesn\u2019t like him. . . . That must be hard. I wonder how Ben would handle that?\u201d she mused. I half-smiled. \u201cProbably just like any other boy.\u201d She grinned. \u201cProbably.\u201d Then she changed the subject. Angela wasn\u2019t one to pry, and she seemed to sense I wouldn\u2019t \u2014 couldn\u2019t \u2014 say any more. \u201cI got my dorm assignment yesterday. The farthest building from campus, naturally.\u201d \u00a0\u201cDoes Ben know where he\u2019s staying yet?\u201d \u201cThe closest dorm to campus. He\u2019s got all the luck. How about you? Did you decide where you\u2019re going?\u201d I stared down, concentrating on the clumsy scrawl of my handwriting. For a second I was distracted by the thought of Angela and Ben at the University of Washington. They would be off to Seattle in just a few months. Would it be safe then? Would the wild young vampire menace have moved elsewhere? Would there be a new place by then, some other city flinching from horror-movie headlines? Would those new headlines be my fault? I tried to shake it off and answered her question a beat late. \u201cAlaska, I think. The university there in Juneau.\u201d I could hear the surprise in her voice. \u201cAlaska? Oh. Really? I mean, that\u2019s great. I just figured you\u2019d go somewhere . . . warmer.\u201d I laughed a little, still staring at the envelope. \u201cYeah. Forks has really changed my perspective on life.\u201d \u00a0\u201cAnd Edward?\u201d Though his name set butterflies fluttering in my stomach, I looked up and grinned at her. \u201cAlaska\u2019s not too cold for Edward, either.\u201d She grinned back. \u201cOf course not.\u201d And then she sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s so far. You won\u2019t be able to come home very often. I\u2019ll miss you. Will you e-mail me?\u201d A swell of quiet sadness crashed over me; maybe it was a mistake to get closer to Angela now. But wouldn\u2019t it be sadder still to miss out on these last chances? I shook off the unhappy thoughts, so that I could answer her teasingly. \u201cIf I can type again after this.\u201d I nodded toward the stack of envelopes I\u2019d done. We laughed, and it was easy then to chat cheerfully about classes and majors while we finished the rest \u2014 all I had to do was not think about it. Anyway, there were more urgent things to worry about today. I helped her put the stamps on, too. I was afraid to leave. \u201cHow\u2019s your hand?\u201d she asked. I flexed my fingers. \u201cI think I\u2019ll recover the full use of it . . . someday.\u201d The door banged downstairs, and we both looked up. \u201cAng?\u201d Ben called. I tried to smile, but my lips trembled. \u201cI guess that\u2019s my cue to leave.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go. Though he\u2019s probably going to describe the movie for me . . . in detail.\u201d \u201cCharlie will be wondering where I am anyway.\u201d \u201cThanks for helping me.\u201d \u201cI had a good time, actually. We should do something like this again. It was nice to have some girl time.\u201d \u201cDefinitely.\u201d There was a light knock on the bedroom door. \u201cCome in, Ben,\u201d Angela said. I got up and stretched. \u201cHey, Bella! You survived,\u201d Ben greeted me quickly before going to take my place by Angela. He eyed\u00a0 our work. \u201cNice job. Too bad there\u2019s nothing left to do, I would have . . .\u201d He let the thought trail off, and then restarted excitedly. \u201cAng, I can\u2019t believe you missed this one! It was awesome. There was this final fight sequence \u2014 the choreography was unbelievable! This one guy \u2014 well, you\u2019re going to have to see it to know what I\u2019m talking about \u2014\u201d Angela rolled her eyes at me. \u201cSee you at school,\u201d I said with a nervous laugh. She sighed. \u201cSee you.\u201d I was <em>jumpy</em> on the way out to my truck, but the street was empty. I spent the whole drive glancing anxiously in all my mirrors, but there was never any sign of the silver car. His car was not in front of the house, either, though that meant little. \u201cBella?\u201d Charlie called when I opened the front door. \u201cHey, Dad.\u201d I found him in the living room, in front of the TV. \u00a0\u201cSo, how was your day?\u201d \u201cGood,\u201d I said. Might as well tell him everything \u2014 he\u2019d hear it from Billy soon enough. Besides, it would make him happy. \u201cThey didn\u2019t need me at work, so I went down to La Push.\u201d There wasn\u2019t enough surprise in his face. Billy had already talked to him. \u201cHow\u2019s Jacob?\u201d Charlie asked, attempting to sound indifferent. \u201cGood,\u201d I said, just as casual. \u201cYou get over to the Webers\u2019?\u201d \u201cYep. We got all her announcements addressed.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s nice.\u201d Charlie smiled a wide smile. He was strangely focused, considering that there was a game on. \u201cI\u2019m glad you spent some time with your friends today.\u201d \u201cMe, too.\u201d I ambled toward the kitchen, looking for busy work. Unfortunately, Charlie had already cleaned up his lunch. I stood there for a few minutes, staring at the bright patch of light the sun made on the floor. But I knew I couldn\u2019t delay this forever. .  \u201cI\u2019m going to go study,\u201d I announced glumly as I headed up the stairs. \u201cSee you later,\u201d Charlie called after me. If I survive, I thought to myself. I shut my bedroom door carefully before I turned to face my room. Of course he was there. He stood against the wall across from me, in the shadow beside the open window. His face was hard and his posture tense. He glared at me wordlessly.  I cringed, waiting for the torrent, but it didn\u2019t come. He just continued to glare, possibly too angry to speak. \u201cHi,\u201d I finally said. His face could have been carved from stone. I counted to a hundred in my head, but there was no change. \u201cEr . . . so, I\u2019m still alive,\u201d I began. A growl rumbled low in his chest, but his expression didn\u2019t change. \u00a0\u201cNo harm done,\u201d I insisted with a shrug. He moved. His eyes closed, and he pinched the bridge of his nose between the fingers of his right hand. \u201cBella,\u201d he whispered. \u201cDo you have any idea how close I came to crossing the line today? To breaking the treaty and coming after you? Do you know what that would have meant?\u201d I gasped and his eyes opened. They were as cold and hard as night. \u00a0\u201cYou can\u2019t!\u201d I said too loudly. I worked to modulate the volume of my voice so Charlie wouldn\u2019t hear, but I wanted to shout the words. \u201cEdward, they\u2019d use any excuse for a fight. They\u2019d love that. You can\u2019t ever break the rules!\u201d \u201cMaybe they aren\u2019t the only ones who would enjoy a fight.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you start,\u201d I snapped. \u201cYou made the treaty \u2014 you stick to it.\u201d \u201cIf he\u2019d hurt you \u2014\u201d \u201cEnough!\u201d I cut him off. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to worry about. Jacob isn\u2019t dangerous.\u201d \u00a0\u201cBella.\u201d He rolled his eyes. \u201cYou aren\u2019t exactly the best judge of what is or isn\u2019t dangerous.\u201d \u201cI know I don\u2019t have to worry about Jake. And neither do you.\u201d He ground his teeth together. His hands were balled up in fists at his sides. He was still standing against the wall, and I hated the space between us. I took a deep breath, and crossed the room. He didn\u2019t move when I wrapped my arms around him. Next to the warmth of the last of the afternoon sun streaming through the window, his skin felt especially icy. He seemed like ice, too, frozen the way he was. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry I made you anxious,\u201d I muttered. He sighed, and relaxed a little. His arms wound around my waist. \u201cAnxious is a bit of an understatement,\u201d he murmured. \u201cIt was a very long day.\u201d \u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to know about it,\u201d I reminded him. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be hunting longer.\u201d I looked up at his face, at his defensive eyes; I hadn\u2019t noticed in the stress of the moment, but they were too dark. The rings under them were deep purple. I frowned in disapproval. \u00a0\u201cWhen Alice saw you disappear, I came back,\u201d he explained. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have done that. Now you\u2019ll have to go away again.\u201d My frown intensified. \u201cI can wait.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. I mean, I know she couldn\u2019t see me with Jacob, but you should have known \u2014\u201d \u201cBut I didn\u2019t,\u201d he broke in. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t expect me to let you \u2014\u201d \u201cOh, yes, I can,\u201d I interrupted him. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I expect \u2014\u201d \u201cThis won\u2019t happen again.\u201d \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s right! Because you\u2019re not going to overreact next time.\u201d \u201cBecause there isn\u2019t going to be a next time.\u201d \u201cI understand when you have to leave, even if I don\u2019t like it \u2014\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not the same. I\u2019m not risking my life.\u201d \u201cNeither am I.\u201d \u201cWerewolves constitute a risk.\u201d \u00a0\u201cI disagree.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not negotiating this, Bella.\u201d \u201cNeither am I.\u201d His hands were in fists again. I could feel them against my back. The words popped out thoughtlessly. \u201cIs this really just about my safety?\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he demanded. \u00a0\u201cYou aren\u2019t . . .\u201d Angela\u2019s theory seemed sillier now than before. It was hard to finish the thought. \u201cI mean, you know better than to be jealous, right?\u201d He raised one eyebrow. \u201cDo I?\u201d \u201cBe serious.\u201d \u201cEasily \u2014 there\u2019s nothing remotely humorous about this.\u201d I frowned suspiciously. \u201cOr . . . is this something else altogether? Some vampires-and-werewolves-are-always-enemies nonsense? Is this just a testosterone-fueled \u2014\u201d His eyes blazed. \u201cThis is only about you. All I care is that you\u2019re safe.\u201d The black fire in his eyes was impossible to doubt. \u201cOkay,\u201d I sighed. \u201cI believe that. But I want you to know something \u2014 when it comes to all this enemies nonsense, I\u2019m out. I am a neutral country. I am Switzerland. I refuse to be affected by territorial disputes between mythical creatures. Jacob is family. You are . . . well, not exactly the love of my life, because I expect to love you for much longer than that. The love of my existence. I don\u2019t care who\u2019s a werewolf and who\u2019s a vampire. \u00a0If Angela turns out to be a witch, she can join the party, too.\u201d He stared at me silently through narrowed eyes. \u201cSwitzerland,\u201d I repeated again for emphasis. He frowned at me, and then sighed. \u201cBella . . . ,\u201d he began, but he paused, and his nose wrinkled in disgust. \u201cWhat now?\u201d \u201cWell . . . don\u2019t be offended, but you smell like a dog,\u201d he told me. And then he smiled crookedly, so I knew the fight was over. For now. Edward had to make up for the missed hunting trip, and so he was leaving Friday night with Jasper, Emmett, and Carlisle to hit some reserve in Northern California with a mountain lion problem. We\u2019d come to no agreement on the werewolf issue, but I didn\u2019t feel guilty calling Jake \u2014 during my brief window of opportunity when Edward took the Volvo home before climbing back in through my window \u2014 to let him know I\u2019d be coming over on Saturday again. It wasn\u2019t sneaking around. Edward knew how I felt. And if he broke my truck again, then I\u2019d have Jacob pick me up. Forks was neutral, just like Switzerland \u2014 just like me. So when I got off work Thursday and it was Alice rather than Edward waiting for me in the Volvo, I was not suspicious at first. The passenger door was open, and music I didn\u2019t recognize was shaking the frame when the bass played. \u201cHey, Alice,\u201d I shouted over the wailing as I climbed in. \u201cWhere\u2019s your brother?\u201d She was singing along to the song, her voice an octave higher than the melody, weaving through it with a complicated harmony. She nodded at me, ignoring my question as she concentrated on the music. I shut my door and put my hands over my ears. She grinned, and turned the volume down until it was just background. Then she hit the locks and the gas in the same second. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I asked, starting to feel uneasy. \u201cWhere is Edward?\u201d She shrugged. \u201cThey left early.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d I tried to control the absurd disappointment. If he left early, that meant he\u2019d be back sooner, I reminded myself. \u00a0\u201cAll the boys went, and we\u2019re having a slumber party!\u201d she announced in a trilling, singsong voice. \u201cA slumber party?\u201d I repeated, the suspicion finally settling in. \u201cAren\u2019t you excited?\u201d she crowed. I met her animated gaze for a long second. \u201cYou\u2019re kidnapping me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d She laughed and nodded. \u201cTill Saturday. Esme cleared it with Charlie; you\u2019re staying with me two nights, and I will drive you to and from school tomorrow.\u201d I turned my face to the window, my teeth grinding together. \u201cSorry,\u201d Alice said, not sounding in the least bit penitent. \u201cHe paid me off.\u201d \u201cHow?\u201d I hissed through my teeth. \u201cThe Porsche. It\u2019s exactly like the one I stole in Italy.\u201d She sighed happily. \u201cI\u2019m not supposed to drive it around Forks, but if you want, we could see how long it takes to get from here to L.A. \u2014 I bet I could have you back by midnight.\u201d I took a deep breath. \u201cI think I\u2019ll pass,\u201d I sighed, repressing a shudder. We wound, always too fast, down the long drive. Alice pulled around to the garage, and I quickly looked over the cars. Emmett\u2019s big jeep was there, with a shiny canary yellow Porsche between it and Rosalie\u2019s red convertible. Alice hopped out gracefully and went to stroke her hand along the length of her bribe. \u201cPretty, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cPretty over-the-top,\u201d I grumbled, incredulous. \u201cHe gave you that just for two days of holding me hostage?\u201d Alice made a face. A second later, comprehension came and I gasped in horror. \u201cIt\u2019s for every time he\u2019s gone, isn\u2019t it?\u201d She nodded. I slammed my door and stomped toward the house. She danced along next to me, still unrepentant. \u201cAlice, don\u2019t you think this is just a little bit controlling? Just a tiny bit psychotic, maybe?\u201d \u201cNot really.\u201d She sniffed. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem to grasp how dangerous a young werewolf can be.\u00a0 Especially when I can\u2019t see them. Edward has no way to know if you\u2019re safe. You shouldn\u2019t be so reckless.\u201d My voice turned acidic. \u201cYes, because a vampire slumber party is the pinnacle of safety conscious behavior.\u201d Alice laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a pedicure and everything,\u201d she promised. It wasn\u2019t so bad, except for the fact that I was being held against my will. Esme brought Italian food \u2014 the good stuff, all the way from Port Angeles \u2014 and Alice was prepared with my favorite movies. Even Rosalie was there, quietly in the background. Alice did insist on the pedicure, and I wondered if she was working from a list \u2014 maybe something she\u2019d compiled from watching bad sitcoms. \u00a0\u201cHow late do you want to stay up?\u201d she asked when my toenails were glistening a bloody red. Her enthusiasm remained untouched by my mood. \u201cI don\u2019t want to stay up. We have school in the morning.\u201d She pouted. \u201cWhere am I supposed to sleep, anyway?\u201d I measured the couch with my eyes. It was a little short. \u201cCan\u2019t you just keep me under surveillance at my house?\u201d \u201cWhat kind of a slumber party would that be?\u201d Alice shook her head in exasperation. \u201cYou\u2019re sleeping in Edward\u2019s room.\u201d I sighed. His black leather sofa was longer than this one. Actually, the gold carpet in his room was probably thick enough that the floor wouldn\u2019t be half bad either. \u00a0\u201cCan I go back to my place to get my things, at least?\u201d She grinned. \u201cAlready taken care of.\u201d \u201cAm I allowed to use your phone?\u201d \u201cCharlie knows where you are.\u201d \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to call Charlie.\u201d I frowned. \u201cApparently, I have some plans to cancel.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d She deliberated. \u201cI\u2019m not sure about that.\u201d \u201cAlice!\u201d I whined loudly. \u201cC\u2019mon!\u201d \u00a0\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d she said, flitting from the room. She was back in half a second, cell phone in hand. \u201cHe didn\u2019t specifically prohibit this . . . ,\u201d she murmured to herself as she handed it to me. I dialed Jacob\u2019s number, hoping he wasn\u2019t out running with his friends tonight. Luck was with me \u2014 Jacob was the one to answer. \u201cHello?\u201d \u00a0\u201cHey, Jake, it\u2019s me.\u201d Alice watched me with expressionless eyes for a second, before she turned and went to sit between Rosalie and Esme on the sofa. \u201cHi, Bella,\u201d Jacob said, suddenly cautious. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d \u201cNothing good. I can\u2019t come over Saturday after all.\u201d It was silent for a minute. \u201cStupid bloodsucker,\u201d he finally muttered. \u201cI thought he was leaving. Can\u2019t you have a life when he\u2019s gone? Or does he lock you in a coffin?\u201d I laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s funny.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m only laughing because you\u2019re close,\u201d I told him. \u201cBut he\u2019s going to be here Saturday, so it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d \u201cWill he be feeding there in Forks, then?\u201d Jacob asked cuttingly. \u201cNo.\u201d I didn\u2019t let myself get irritated with him. I wasn\u2019t that far from being as angry as he was. \u201cHe left early.\u201d \u00a0\u201cOh. Well, hey, come over now, then,\u201d he said with sudden enthusiasm. \u201cIt\u2019s not that late. Or I\u2019ll come up to Charlie\u2019s.\u201d \u201cI wish. I\u2019m not at Charlie\u2019s,\u201d I said sourly. \u201cI\u2019m kind of being held prisoner.\u201d He was silent as that sunk in, and then he growled. \u201cWe\u2019ll come and get you,\u201d he promised in a flat voice, slipping automatically into a plural. A chill slid down my spine, but I answered in a light and teasing voice. \u201cTempting. I have been tortured \u2014 Alice painted my toenails.\u201d \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be. They\u2019re just trying to keep me safe.\u201d He growled again. \u201cI know it\u2019s silly, but their hearts are in the right place.\u201d \u201cTheir hearts !\u201d he scoffed. \u201cSorry about Saturday,\u201d I apologized. \u201cI\u2019ve got to hit the sack\u201d \u2014 the couch, I corrected mentally \u2014 \u201cbut I\u2019ll call you again soon.\u201d \u00a0\u201cAre you sure they\u2019ll let you?\u201d he asked in a scathing tone. \u201cNot completely.\u201d I sighed. \u201c\u2019Night, Jake.\u201d \u201cSee you around.\u201d Alice was abruptly at my side, her hand held out for the phone, but I was already dialing. She saw the number. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019ll have his phone on him,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll leave a message.\u201d The phone rang four times, followed by a beep. There was no greeting. \u201cYou are in trouble,\u201d I said slowly, emphasizing each word. \u201cEnormous trouble. Angry grizzly bears are going to look tame next to what is waiting for you at home.\u201d I snapped the phone shut and placed it in her waiting hand. \u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d She grinned. \u201cThis hostage stuff is fun.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to sleep now,\u201d I announced, heading for the stairs. Alice tagged along. \u201cAlice,\u201d I sighed. \u201cI\u2019m not going to sneak out. You would know if I was planning to, and you\u2019d catch me if I tried.\u201d \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m just going to show you where your things are,\u201d she said innocently. Edward\u2019s room was at the farthest end of the third floor hallway, hard to mistake even when the huge house had been less familiar. But when I switched the light on, I paused in confusion. Had I picked the wrong door? Alice giggled. It was the same room, I realized quickly; the furniture had just been rearranged. The couch was pushed to the north wall and the stereo shoved up against the vast shelves of CDs \u2014 to make room for the colossal bed that now dominated the central space. The southern wall of glass reflected the scene back like a mirror, making it look twice as bad. It matched. The coverlet was a dull gold, just lighter than the walls; the frame was black, made of intricately patterned wrought iron. Sculpted metal roses wound in vines up the tall posts and formed a bowery lattice overhead. My pajamas were folded neatly on the foot of the bed, my bag of toiletries to one side. \u201cWhat the hell is all this?\u201d I spluttered. \u00a0\u201cYou didn\u2019t really think he would make you sleep on the couch, did you?\u201d I mumbled unintelligibly as I stalked forward to snatch my things off the bed. \u201cI\u2019ll give you some privacy,\u201d Alice laughed. \u201cSee you in the morning.\u201d After my teeth were brushed and I was dressed, I grabbed a puffy feather pillow off the huge bed and dragged the gold cover to the couch. I knew I was being silly, but I didn\u2019t care. Porsches as bribes and king-sized beds in houses where nobody slept \u2014 it was beyond irritating. I flipped off the lights and curled up on the sofa, wondering if I was too annoyed to sleep. In the dark, the glass wall was no longer a black mirror, doubling the room. The light of the moon brightened the clouds outside the window. As my eyes adjusted, I could see the diffused glow highlighting the tops of the trees, and glinting off a small slice of the river. I watched the silver light, waiting for my eyes to get heavy. There was a light knock on the door. \u00a0\u201cWhat, Alice?\u201d I hissed. I was on the defensive, imagining her amusement when she saw my makeshift bed. \u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d Rosalie said softly, opening the door enough that I could see the silver glow touch her perfect face. \u201cCan I come in?",

            "en": "3. MOTIVES THE SUN WAS SO DEEPLY BURIED BEHIND THE CLOUDS that there was no way to tell if it had set or not. After the long flight \u2014 chasing the sun westward so that it seemed unmoving in the sky \u2014 it was especially disorienting; time seemed oddly variable. It took me by surprise when the forest gave way to the first buildings, signaling that we were nearly home. \u201cYou\u2019ve been very quiet,\u201d Edward observed. \u201cDid the plane make you sick?\u201d \u201cNo, I\u2019m okay.\u201d \u201cAre you sad to leave?\u201d \u201cMore relieved than sad, I think.\u201d He raised one eyebrow at me. I knew it was useless and \u2014 much as I hated to admit it \u2014 unnecessary to ask him to keep his eyes on the road. \u201cRen\u00e9e is so much more . . .perceptive than Charlie in some ways. It was making me <em>jumpy</em>.\u201d Edward laughed. \u201cYour mother has a very interesting mind. Almost childlike, but very insightful. She sees things differently than other people.\u201d Insightful. It was a good description of my mother \u2014 when she was paying attention. Most of the time Ren\u00e9e was so bewildered by her own life that she didn\u2019t notice much else. But this weekend she\u2019d been paying plenty of attention to me. Phil was busy \u2014 the high school baseball team he coached was in the playoffs \u2014 and being alone with Edward and me had only sharpened Ren\u00e9e\u2019s focus. As soon as the hugs and squeals of delight were out of the way, Ren\u00e9e began to watch. And as she\u2019d watched, her wide blue eyes had become first confused and then concerned. This morning we\u2019d gone for a walk along the beach. She wanted to show off all the beauties of her new home, still hoping, I think, that the sun might lure me away from Forks. She\u2019d also wanted to talk with me alone, and that was easily arranged. Edward had fabricated a term paper to give himself an excuse to stay indoors during the day. In my head, I went through the conversation again. . . . Ren\u00e9e and I ambled along the sidewalk, trying to stay in the range of the infrequent palm tree shadows. Though it was early, the heat was smothering. The air was so heavy with moisture that just breathing in and out was giving my lungs a workout. \u201cBella?\u201d my mother asked, looking out past the sand to the lightly crashing waves as she spoke. \u201cWhat is it, Mom?\u201d She sighed, not meeting my gaze. \u201cI\u2019m worried. . . .\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked, anxious at once. \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not me.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m worried about you . . . and Edward.\u201d Ren\u00e9e finally looked at me when she said his name, her face apologetic. \u201cOh,\u201d I mumbled, fixing my eyes on a pair of joggers as they passed us, drenched with sweat. \u201cYou two are more serious than I\u2019d been thinking,\u201d she went on. I frowned, quickly reviewing the last two days in my head. Edward and I had barely touched \u2014 in front of her, at least. I wondered if Ren\u00e9e was about to give me a lecture on responsibility, too. I didn\u2019t mind that the way I had with Charlie. It wasn\u2019t embarrassing with my mom. After all, I\u2019d been the one giving her that lecture time and time again in the last ten years. \u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s something . . . strange about the way you two are together,\u201d she murmured, her forehead creasing over her troubled eyes. \u201cThe way he watches you \u2014 it\u2019s so . . . protective. Like he\u2019s about to throw himself in front of a bullet to save you or something.\u201d I laughed, though I was still not able to meet her gaze. \u201cThat\u2019s a bad thing?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d She frowned as she struggled for the words. \u201cIt\u2019s just different . He\u2019s very intense about you . . . and very careful. I feel like I don\u2019t really understand your relationship. Like there\u2019s some secret I\u2019m missing. . . .\u201d \u201cI think you\u2019re imagining things, Mom,\u201d I said quickly, struggling to keep my voice light. There was a flutter in my stomach. I\u2019d forgotten how much my mother saw . Something about her simple view of the world cut through all the distractions and pierced right to the truth of things. This had never been a problem before. Until now, there had never been a secret I couldn\u2019t tell her. \u201cIt\u2019s not just him.\u201d She set her lips defensively. \u201cI wish you could see how you move around him.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u00a0\u201cThe way you move \u2014 you orient yourself around him without even thinking about it. When he moves, even a little bit, you adjust your position at the same time. Like magnets . . . or gravity. You\u2019re like a . . . satellite, or something. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d She pursed her lips and stared down. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me,\u201d I teased, forcing a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re reading mysteries again, aren\u2019t you? Or is it sci-fi this time?\u201d Ren\u00e9e flushed a delicate pink. \u201cThat\u2019s beside the point.\u201d \u201cFound anything good?\u201d \u201cWell, there was one \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t matter. We\u2019re talking about you right now.\u201d \u201cYou should stick to romance, Mom. You know how you freak yourself out.\u201d Her lips turned up at the corners. \u201cI\u2019m being silly, aren\u2019t I?\u201d For half a second I couldn\u2019t answer. Ren\u00e9e was so easily swayed. Sometimes it was a good thing, because not all of her ideas were practical. But it pained me to see how quickly she caved in to my trivializing, especially since she was dead right this time. She looked up, and I controlled my expression. \u201cNot silly \u2014 just being a mom.\u201d She laughed and then gestured grandly toward the white sands stretching to the blue water. \u201cAnd all this isn\u2019t enough to get you to move back in with your silly mom?\u201d I wiped my hand dramatically across my forehead, and then pretended to wring my hair out. \u201cYou get used to the humidity,\u201d she promised. \u201cYou can get used to rain, too,\u201d I countered. She elbowed me playfully and then took my hand as we walked back to her car. Other than her worries about me, she seemed happy enough. Content. She still looked at Phil with goo-goo eyes, and that was comforting. Surely her life was full and satisfying. Surely she didn\u2019t miss me that much, even now. . . . Edward\u2019s icy fingers brushed my cheek. I looked up, blinking, coming back to the present. He leaned down and kissed my forehead. \u201cWe\u2019re home, Sleeping Beauty. Time to awake.\u201d We were stopped in front of Charlie\u2019s house. The porch light was on and the cruiser was parked in the driveway. As I examined the house, I saw the curtain twitch in the living room window, flashing a line of yellow light across the dark lawn. I sighed. Of course Charlie was waiting to pounce. Edward must have been thinking the same thing, because his expression was stiff and his eyes remote as he came to get my door for me. \u201cHow bad?\u201d I asked. \u201cCharlie\u2019s not going to be difficult,\u201d Edward promised, his voice level with no hint of humor. \u201cHe missed you.\u201d My eyes narrowed in doubt. If that was the case, then why was Edward tensed as if for a battle? My bag was small, but he insisted on carrying it into the house. Charlie held the door open for us. \u201cWelcome home, kid!\u201d Charlie shouted like he really meant it. \u201cHow was Jacksonville?\u201d \u201cMoist. And buggy.\u201d \u201cSo Ren\u00e9e didn\u2019t sell you on the University of Florida?\u201d \u201cShe tried. But I\u2019d rather drink water than inhale it.\u201d Charlie\u2019s eyes flickered unwillingly to Edward. \u201cDid you have a nice time?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d Edward answered in a serene voice. \u201cRen\u00e9e was very hospitable.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s . . . um, good. Glad you had fun.\u201d Charlie turned away from Edward and pulled me in for an unexpected hug. \u201cImpressive,\u201d I whispered in his ear. He rumbled a laugh. \u201cI really missed you, Bells. The food around here sucks when you\u2019re gone.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll get on it,\u201d I said as he let me go. \u201cWould you call Jacob first? He\u2019s been bugging me every five minutes since six o\u2019clock this morning. I promised I\u2019d have you call him before you even unpacked.\u201d I didn\u2019t have to look at Edward to feel that he was too still, too cold beside me. So this was the cause of his tension. \u201cJacob wants to talk to me?\u201d \u201cPretty bad, I\u2019d say. He wouldn\u2019t tell me what it was about \u2014 just said it was important.\u201d The phone rang then, shrill and demanding. \u201cThat\u2019s him again, I\u2019d bet my next paycheck,\u201d Charlie muttered. \u201cI got it.\u201d I hurried to the kitchen. Edward followed after me while Charlie disappeared into the living room. I grabbed the phone mid-ring, and twisted around so that I was facing the wall. \u201cHello?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re back,\u201d Jacob said. His familiar husky voice sent a wave of wistfulness through me. A thousand memories spun in my head, tangling together \u2014 a rocky beach strewn with driftwood trees, a garage made of plastic sheds, warm sodas in a paper bag, a tiny room with one too-small shabby loveseat. The laughter in his deep-set black eyes, the feverish heat of his big hand around mine, the flash of his white teeth against his dark skin, his face stretching into the wide smile that had always been like a key to a secret door where only kindred spirits could enter. It felt sort of like homesickness, this longing for the place and person who had sheltered me through my darkest night. I cleared the lump from my throat. \u201cYes,\u201d I answered. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call me?\u201d Jacob demanded. His angry tone instantly got my back up. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve been in the house for exactly four seconds and your call interrupted Charlie telling me that you\u2019d called.\u201d \u201cOh. Sorry.\u201d \u201cSure. Now, why are you harassing Charlie?\u201d \u201cI need to talk to you.\u201d \u201cYeah, I figured out that part all by myself. Go ahead.\u201d There was a short pause. \u201cYou going to school tomorrow?\u201d I frowned to myself, unable to make sense of this question. \u201cOf course I am. Why wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d \u201cI dunno. Just curious.\u201d Another pause. \u201cSo what did you want to talk about, Jake?\u201d He hesitated. \u201cNothing really, I guess. I . . . wanted to hear your voice.\u201d \u201cYeah, I know. I\u2019m so glad you called me, Jake. I . . .\u201d But I didn\u2019t know what more to say. I wanted to tell him I was on my way to La Push right now. And I couldn\u2019t tell him that. \u201cI have to go,\u201d he said abruptly. \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you soon, okay?\u201d \u201cBut Jake \u2014\u201d He was already gone. I listened to the dial tone with disbelief. \u201cThat was short,\u201d I muttered. \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d Edward asked. His voice was low and careful. I turned slowly to face him. His expression was perfectly smooth \u2014 impossible to read. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I wonder what that was about.\u201d It didn\u2019t make sense that Jacob had been hounding Charlie all day just to ask me if I was going to school. And if he\u2019d wanted to hear my voice, then why did he hang up so quickly? \u201cYour guess is probably better than mine,\u201d Edward said, the hint of a smile tugging at the corner of his mouth. \u201cMmm,\u201d I murmured. That was true. I knew Jake inside and out. It shouldn\u2019t be that complicated to figure out his motivations. With my thoughts miles away \u2014 about fifteen miles away, up the road to La Push \u2014 I started combing through the fridge, assembling ingredients for Charlie\u2019s dinner. Edward leaned against the counter, and I was distantly aware that his eyes were on my face, but too preoccupied to worry about what he saw there. The school thing seemed like the key to me. That was the only real question Jake had asked. And he had to be after an answer to something, or he wouldn\u2019t have been bugging Charlie so persistently. Why would my attendance record matter to him, though? I tried to think about it in a logical way. So, if I hadn\u2019t been going to school tomorrow, what would be the problem with that, from Jacob\u2019s perspective? Charlie had given me a little grief about missing a day of school so close to finals, but I\u2019d convinced him that one Friday wasn\u2019t going to derail my studies. Jake would hardly care about that. My brain refused to come up with any brilliant insights. Maybe I was missing some vital piece of information. What could have changed in the past three days that was so important that Jacob would break his long streak of refusing to answer my phone calls and contact me? What difference could three days make? I froze in the middle of the kitchen. The package of icy hamburger in my hands slipped through my numb fingers. It took me a slow second to miss the thud it should have made against the floor. Edward had caught it and thrown it onto the counter. His arms were already around me, his lips at my ear. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I shook my head, dazed. Three days could change everything. Hadn\u2019t I just been thinking about how impossible college was? How I couldn\u2019t be anywhere near people after I\u2019d gone through the painful three-day conversion that would set me free from mortality, so that I could spend eternity with Edward? The conversion that would make me forever a prisoner to my own thirst. . . . Had Charlie told Billy that I\u2019d vanished for three days? Had Billy jumped to conclusions? Had Jacob really been asking me if I was still human? Making sure that the werewolves\u2019 treaty was unbroken \u2014 that none of the Cullens had dared to bite a human . . . bite, not kill . . . ? But did he honestly think I would come home to Charlie if that was the case? Edward shook me. \u201cBella?\u201d he asked, truly anxious now. \u201cI think . . . I think he was checking,\u201d I mumbled. \u201cChecking to make sure. That I\u2019m human, I mean.\u201d Edward stiffened, and a low hiss sounded in my ear. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to leave,\u201d I whispered. \u201cBefore. So that it doesn\u2019t break the treaty. We won\u2019t ever be able to come back.\u201d His arms tightened around me. \u201cI know.\u201d \u201cAhem.\u201d Charlie cleared his voice loudly behind us. I jumped, and then pulled free of Edward\u2019s arms, my face getting hot. Edward leaned back against the counter. His eyes were tight. I could see worry in them, and anger. \u00a0\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to make dinner, I can call for a pizza,\u201d Charlie hinted. \u201cNo, that\u2019s okay, I\u2019m already started.\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d Charlie said. He propped himself against the doorframe, folding his arms. I sighed and got to work, trying to ignore my audience. \u201cIf I asked you to do something, would you trust me?\u201d Edward asked, an edge to his soft voice. We were almost to school. Edward had been relaxed and joking just a moment ago, and now suddenly his hands were clenched tight on the steering wheel, his knuckles straining in an effort not to snap it into pieces. I stared at his anxious expression \u2014 his eyes were far away, like he was listening to distant voices. My pulse sped in response to his stress, but I answered carefully. \u201cThat depends.\u201d We pulled into the school lot. \u201cI was afraid you would say that.\u201d \u201cWhat do you want me to do, Edward?\u201d \u201cI want you to stay in the car.\u201d He pulled into his usual spot and turned the engine off as he spoke. \u201cI want you to wait here until I come back for you.\u201d \u201cBut . . .why ?\u201d That was when I saw him. He would have been hard to miss, towering over the students the way he did, even if he hadn\u2019t been leaning against his black motorcycle, parked illegally on the sidewalk. \u201cOh.\u201d Jacob\u2019s face was a calm mask that I recognized well. It was the face he used when he was determined to keep his emotions in check, to keep himself under control. It made him look like Sam, the oldest of the wolves, the leader of the Quileute pack. But Jacob could never quite manage the perfect serenity Sam always exuded. I\u2019d forgotten how much this face bothered me. Though I\u2019d gotten to know Sam pretty well before the Cullens had come back \u2014 to like him, even \u2014 I\u2019d never been able to completely shake the resentment I felt when Jacob mimicked Sam\u2019s expression. It was a stranger\u2019s face. He wasn\u2019t my Jacob when he wore it. \u201cYou jumped to the wrong conclusion last night,\u201d Edward murmured. \u201cHe asked about school because he knew that I would be where you were. He was looking for a safe place to talk to me. A place with witnesses.\u201d So I\u2019d misinterpreted Jacob\u2019s motives last night. Missing information, that was the problem. Information like why in the world Jacob would want to talk to Edward. \u201cI\u2019m not staying in the car,\u201d I said. Edward groaned quietly. \u201cOf course not. Well, let\u2019s get this over with.\u201d Jacob\u2019s face hardened as we walked toward him, hand in hand. I noticed other faces, too \u2014 the faces of my classmates. I noticed how their eyes widened as they took in all six foot seven inches of Jacob\u2019s long body, muscled up the way no normal sixteen-and-a-half-year-old ever had been. I saw those eyes rake over his tight black t-shirt \u2014 short-sleeved, though the day was unseasonably cool \u2014 his ragged, grease-smeared jeans, and the glossy black bike he leaned against. Their eyes didn\u2019t linger on his face \u2014 something about his expression had them glancing quickly away. And I noticed the wide berth everyone gave him, the bubble of space that no one dared to encroach on. With a sense of astonishment, I realized that Jacob looked dangerous to them. How odd. Edward stopped a few yards away from Jacob, and I could tell that he was uncomfortable having me so close to a werewolf. He drew his hand back slightly, pulling me halfway behind his body. \u201cYou could have called us,\u201d Edward said in a steel-hard voice. \u201cSorry,\u201d Jacob answered, his face twisting into a sneer. \u201cI don\u2019t have any leeches on my speed dial.\u201d \u201cYou could have reached me at Bella\u2019s house, of course.\u201d Jacob\u2019s jaw flexed, and his brows pulled together. He didn\u2019t answer. \u201cThis is hardly the place, Jacob. Could we discuss this later?\u201d \u201cSure, sure. I\u2019ll stop by your crypt after school.\u201d Jacob snorted. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with now?\u201d Edward looked around pointedly, his eyes resting on the witnesses who were just barely out of hearing range. A few people were hesitating on the sidewalk, their eyes bright with expectation. Like they were hoping a fight might break out to alleviate the tedium of another Monday morning. I saw Tyler Crowley nudge Austin Marks, and they both paused on their way to class. \u201cI already know what you came to say,\u201d Edward reminded Jacob in voice so low that I could barely make it out. \u201cMessage delivered. Consider us warned.\u201d Edward glanced down at me for a fleeting second with worried eyes. \u201cWarned?\u201d I asked blankly. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell her?\u201d Jacob asked, his eyes widening with disbelief. \u201cWhat, were you afraid she\u2019d take our side?\u201d \u201cPlease drop it, Jacob,\u201d Edward said in an even voice. \u201cWhy?\u201d Jacob challenged. I frowned in confusion. \u201cWhat don\u2019t I know? Edward?\u201d Edward just glared at Jacob as if he hadn\u2019t heard me. \u201cJake?\u201d Jacob raised his eyebrow at me. \u201cHe didn\u2019t tell you that his big . . .brother crossed the line Saturday night?\u201d he asked, his tone thickly layered with sarcasm. Then his eyes flickered back to Edward. \u201cPaul was totally justified in \u2014\u201d \u201cIt was no-man\u2019s land!\u201d Edward hissed. \u201cWas not!\u201d Jacob was fuming visibly. His hands trembled. He shook his head and sucked in two deep lungfuls of air. \u201cEmmett and Paul?\u201d I whispered. Paul was Jacob\u2019s most volatile pack brother. He was the one who\u2019d lost control that day in the woods \u2014 the memory of the snarling gray wolf was suddenly vivid in my head. \u201cWhat happened? Were they fighting?\u201d My voice strained higher in panic. \u201cWhy? Did Paul get hurt?\u201d \u201cNo one fought,\u201d Edward said quietly, only to me. \u201cNo one got hurt. Don\u2019t be anxious.\u201d Jacob was staring at us with incredulous eyes. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell her anything at all, did you? Is that why you took her away? So she wouldn\u2019t know that \u2014?\u201d \u201cLeave now.\u201d Edward cut him off mid-sentence, and his face was abruptly frightening \u2014 truly frightening. For a second, he looked like . . . like a vampire . He glared at Jacob with vicious, unveiled loathing. Jacob raised his eyebrows, but made no other move. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you told her?\u201d They faced each other in silence for a long moment. More students gathered behind Tyler and Austin. I saw Mike next to Ben \u2014 Mike had one hand on Ben\u2019s shoulder, like he was holding him in place. In the dead silence, all the details suddenly fell into place for me with a burst of intuition. Something Edward didn\u2019t want me to know. Something that Jacob wouldn\u2019t have kept from me. Something that had the Cullens and the wolves both in the woods, moving in hazardous proximity to each other. Something that would cause Edward to insist that I fly across the country. Something that Alice had seen in a vision last week \u2014 a vision Edward had lied to me about. Something I\u2019d been waiting for anyway. Something I knew would happen again, as much as I might wish it never would. It was never going to end, was it? I heard the quick gasp, gasp, gasp, gasp of the air dragging through my lips, but I couldn\u2019t stop it. It looked like the school was shaking, like there was an earthquake, but I knew it was my own trembling that caused the illusion. \u201cShe came back for me,\u201d I choked out. Victoria was never going to give up till I was dead. She would keep repeating the same pattern \u2014 feint and run, feint and run \u2014 until she found a hole through my defenders. Maybe I\u2019d get lucky. Maybe the Volturi would come for me first \u2014 they\u2019d kill me quicker, at least. Edward held me tight to his side, angling his body so that he was still between me and Jacob, and stroked my face with anxious hands. \u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he whispered to me. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll never let her get close to you, it\u2019s fine.\u201d Then he glared at Jacob. \u201cDoes that answer your question, mongrel?\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t think Bella has a right to know?\u201d Jacob challenged. \u201cIt\u2019s her life.\u201d Edward kept his voice muted; even Tyler, edging forward by inches, would be unable to hear. \u201cWhy should she be frightened when she was never in danger?\u201d \u201cBetter frightened than lied to.\u201d I tried to pull myself together, but my eyes were swimming in moisture. I could see it behind my lids \u2014 I could see Victoria\u2019s face, her lips pulled back over her teeth, her crimson eyes glowing with the obsession of her vendetta; she held Edward responsible for the demise of her love, James. She wouldn\u2019t stop until his love was taken from him, too. Edward wiped the tears from my cheek with his fingertips. \u201cDo you really think hurting her is better than protecting her?\u201d he murmured. \u201cShe\u2019s tougher than you think,\u201d Jacob said. \u201cAnd she\u2019s been through worse.\u201d Abruptly, Jacob\u2019s expression shifted, and he was staring at Edward with an odd, speculative expression. His eyes narrowed like he was trying to do a difficult math problem in his head. I felt Edward cringe. I glanced up at him, and his face was contorted in what could only be pain. For one ghastly moment, I was reminded of our afternoon in Italy, in the macabre tower room of the Volturi, where Jane had tortured Edward with her malignant gift, burning him with her thoughts alone. . . . The memory snapped me out of my near hysteria and put everything in perspective. Because I\u2019d rather Victoria killed me a hundred times over than watch Edward suffer that way again. \u201cThat\u2019s funny,\u201d Jacob said, laughing as he watched Edward\u2019s face. Edward winced, but smoothed his expression with a little effort. He couldn\u2019t quite hide the agony in his eyes. I glanced, wide-eyed, from Edward\u2019s grimace to Jacob\u2019s sneer. \u201cWhat are you doing to him?\u201d I demanded. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, Bella,\u201d Edward told me quietly. \u201cJacob just has a good memory, that\u2019s all.\u201d Jacob grinned, and Edward winced again. \u201cStop it! Whatever you\u2019re doing.\u201d \u201cSure, if you want.\u201d Jacob shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s his own fault if he doesn\u2019t like the things I remember, though.\u201d I glared at him, and he smiled back impishly \u2014 like a kid caught doing something he knows he shouldn\u2019t by someone who he knows won\u2019t punish him. \u201cThe principal\u2019s on his way to discourage loitering on school property,\u201d Edward murmured to me. \u201cLet\u2019s get to English, Bella, so you\u2019re not involved.\u201d \u201cOverprotective, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Jacob said, talking just to me. \u201cA little trouble makes life fun. Let me guess, you\u2019re not allowed to have fun, are you?\u201d Edward glowered, and his lips pulled back from his teeth ever so slightly. \u201cShut up, Jake,\u201d I said. Jacob laughed. \u201cThat sounds like a no . Hey, if you ever feel like having a life again, you could come see me. I\u2019ve still got your motorcycle in my garage.\u201d \u1eea  This news distracted me. \u201cYou were supposed to sell that. You promised Charlie you would.\u201d If I hadn\u2019t begged on Jake\u2019s behalf \u2014 after all, he\u2019d put weeks of labor into both motorcycles, and he deserved some kind of payback \u2014 Charlie would have thrown my bike in a Dumpster. And possibly set that Dumpster on fire. \u201cYeah, right. Like I would do that. It belongs to you, not me. Anyway, I\u2019ll hold on to it until you want it back.\u201d A tiny hint of the smile I remembered was suddenly playing around the edges of his lips. \u201cJake . . .\u201d He leaned forward, his face earnest now, the bitter sarcasm fading. \u201cI think I might have been wrong before, you know, about not being able to be friends. Maybe we could manage it, on my side of the line.\u00a0 Come see me.\u201d I was vividly conscious of Edward, his arms still wrapped protectively around me, motionless as a stone. I shot a look at his face \u2014 it was calm, patient. \u201cI, er, don\u2019t know about that, Jake.\u201d Jacob dropped the antagonistic fa\u00e7ade completely. It was like he\u2019d forgotten Edward was there, or at least he was determined to act that way. \u201cI miss you every day, Bella. It\u2019s not the same without you.\u201d \u201cI know and I\u2019m sorry, Jake, I just . . .\u201d He shook his head, and sighed. \u201cI know. Doesn\u2019t matter, right? I guess I\u2019ll survive or something. Who needs friends?\u201d He grimaced, trying to cover the pain with a thin attempt at bravado. Jacob\u2019s suffering had always triggered my protective side. It was not entirely rational \u2014 Jacob was hardly in need of any physical protection I could offer. But my arms, pinned beneath Edward\u2019s, yearned to reach out to him. To wrap around his big, warm waist in a silent promise of acceptance and comfort. Edward\u2019s shielding arms had become restraints. \u201cOkay, get to class,\u201d a stern voice sounded behind us. \u201cMove along, Mr. Crowley.\u201d \u201cGet to school, Jake,\u201d I whispered, anxious as soon as I recognized the principal\u2019s voice. Jacob went to the Quileute school, but he might still get in trouble for trespassing or the equivalent. Edward released me, taking just my hand and pulling me behind his body again. Mr. Greene pushed through the circle of spectators, his brows pressing down like ominous storm clouds over his small eyes. \u201cI mean it,\u201d he was threatening. \u201cDetention for anyone who\u2019s still standing here when I turn around again.\u201d The audience melted away before he was finished with his sentence. \u201cAh, Mr. Cullen. Do we have a problem here?\u201d \u201cNot at all, Mr. Greene. We were just on our way to class.\u201d \u201cExcellent. I don\u2019t seem to recognize your friend.\u201d Mr. Greene turned his glower on Jacob. \u201cAre you a new student here?\u201d Mr. Greene\u2019s eyes scrutinized Jacob, and I could see that he\u2019d come to the same conclusion everyone else had: dangerous. A troublemaker. \u201cNope,\u201d Jacob answered, half a smirk on his broad lips. \u201cThen I suggest you remove yourself from school property at once, young man, before I call the police.\u201d Jacob\u2019s little smirk became a full-blown grin, and I knew he was picturing Charlie showing up to arrest him. This grin was too bitter, too full of mocking to satisfy me. This wasn\u2019t the smile I\u2019d been waiting to see. Jacob said, \u201cYes, sir,\u201d and snapped a military salute before he climbed on his bike and kicked it to a start right there on the sidewalk. The engine snarled and then the tires squealed as he spun it sharply around. In a matter of seconds, Jacob raced out of sight. Mr. Greene gnashed his teeth together while he watched the performance. \u201cMr. Cullen, I expect you to ask your friend to refrain from trespassing again.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s no friend of mine, Mr. Greene, but I\u2019ll pass along the warning.\u201d Mr. Greene pursed his lips. Edward\u2019s perfect grades and spotless record were clearly a factor in Mr. Greene\u2019s assessment of the incident. \u201cI see. If you\u2019re worried about any trouble, I\u2019d be happy to \u2014\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to worry about, Mr. Greene. There won\u2019t be any trouble.\u201d \u201cI hope that\u2019s correct. Well, then. On to class. You, too, Miss Swan.\u201d Edward nodded, and pulled me quickly along toward the English building. \u201cDo you feel well enough to go to class?\u201d he whispered when we were past the principal. \u201cYes,\u201d I whispered back, not quite sure if this was a lie. Whether I felt well or not was hardly the most important consideration. I needed to talk to Edward right away, and English class wasn\u2019t the ideal place for the conversation I had in mind. But with Mr. Greene right behind us, there weren\u2019t a lot of other options. We got to class a little late and took our seats quickly. Mr. Berty was reciting a Frost poem. He ignored our entrance, refusing to let us break his rhythm. I yanked a blank page out of my notebook and started writing, my handwriting more illegible than normal thanks to my agitation. What happened? Tell me everything . And screw the protecting me crap, please. I shoved the note at Edward. He sighed, and then began writing. It took him less time than me, though he wrote an entire paragraph in his own personal calligraphy before he slipped the paper back. Alice saw that Victoria was coming back. I took you out of town merely as a precaution \u2014 there was never a chance that she would have gotten anywhere close to you. Emmett and Jasper very nearly had her, but Victoria seems to have some instinct for evasion. She escaped right down the Quileute boundary line as if she were reading it from a map. It didn\u2019t help that Alice\u2019s abilities were nullified by the Quileutes\u2019 involvement. To be fair, the Quileutes might have had her, too, if we hadn\u2019t gotten in the way. The big gray one thought Emmett was over the line, and he got defensive. Of course Rosalie reacted to that, and everyone left the chase to protect their companions. Carlisle and Jasper got things calmed down before it got out of hand. But by then, Victoria had slipped away. That\u2019s everything.  I frowned at the letters on the page. All of them had been in on it \u2014 Emmett, Jasper, Alice, Rosalie, and Carlisle. Maybe even Esme, though he hadn\u2019t mentioned her. And then Paul and the rest of the Quileute pack. It might so easily have turned into a fight, pitting my future family and my old friends against each other. Any one of them could have been hurt. I imagined the wolves would be in the most danger, but picturing tiny Alice next to one of the huge werewolves, fighting . . . I shuddered. Carefully, I scrubbed out the entire paragraph with my eraser and then I wrote over the top:\u00a0  What about Charlie? She could have been after him. Edward was shaking his head before I finished, obviously going to downplay any danger on Charlie\u2019s behalf. He held a hand out, but I ignored that and started again. You can\u2019t know that she wasn\u2019t thinking that, because you weren\u2019t here. Florida was a bad idea. He took the paper from underneath my hand. I wasn\u2019t about to send you off alone. With your luck, not even the black box would survive. That wasn\u2019t what I\u2019d meant at all; I hadn\u2019t thought of going without him. I\u2019d meant that we should have stayed here together. But I was sidetracked by his response, and a little miffed. Like I couldn\u2019t fly cross country without bringing the plane down. Very funny. So let\u2019s say my bad luck did crash the plane. What exactly were you going to do about it? Why is the plane crashing? He was trying to hide a smile now. The pilots are passed out drunk. Easy. I\u2019d fly the plane. Of course. I pursed my lips and tried again. Both engines have exploded and we\u2019re falling in a death spiral toward the earth. I\u2019d wait till we were close enough to the ground, get a good grip on you, kick out the wall, and jump. Then I\u2019d run you back to the scene of the accident, and we\u2019d stumble around like the two luckiest survivors in history. I stared at him wordlessly. \u201cWhat?\u201d he whispered. I shook my head in awe. \u201cNothing,\u201d I mouthed. I scrubbed out the disconcerting conversation and wrote one more line. You will tell me next time. I knew there would be a next time. The pattern would continue until someone lost. Edward stared into my eyes for a long moment. I wondered what my face looked like \u2014 it felt cold, so the blood hadn\u2019t returned to my cheeks. My eyelashes were still wet. He sighed and then nodded once. Thanks. The paper disappeared from under my hand. I looked up, blinking in surprise, just as Mr. Berty came down the aisle. \u201cIs that something you\u2019d like to share there, Mr. Cullen?\u201d Edward looked up innocently and held out the sheet of paper on top of his folder. \u201cMy notes?\u201d he asked, sounding confused. Mr. Berty scanned the notes \u2014 no doubt a perfect transcription of his lecture \u2014 and then walked away frowning. It was later, in Calculus \u2014 my one class without Edward \u2014 that I heard the gossip. \u201cMy money\u2019s on the big Indian,\u201d someone was saying. I peeked up to see that Tyler, Mike, Austin, and Ben had their heads bent together, deep in conversation. \u201cYeah,\u201d Mike whispered. \u201cDid you see the size of that Jacob kid? I think he could take Cullen down.\u201d Mike sounded pleased by the idea. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Ben disagreed. \u201cThere\u2019s something about Edward. He\u2019s always so . . . confident. I have a feeling he can take care of himself.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m with Ben,\u201d Tyler agreed. \u201cBesides, if that other kid messed Edward up, you know those big brothers of his would get involved.\u201d \u201cHave you been down to La Push lately?\u201d Mike asked. \u201cLauren and I went to the beach a couple of weeks ago, and believe me, Jacob\u2019s friends are all just as big as he is.\u201d \u201cHuh,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cToo bad it didn\u2019t turn into anything. Guess we\u2019ll never know how it would have turned out.\u201d \u201cIt didn\u2019t look over to me,\u201d Austin said. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll get to see.\u201d Mike grinned. \u201cAnyone in the mood for a bet?\u201d \u201cTen on Jacob,\u201d Austin said at once. \u201cTen on Cullen,\u201d Tyler chimed in. \u201cTen on Edward,\u201d Ben agreed. \u201cJacob,\u201d Mike said. \u201cHey, do you guys know what it was about?\u201d Austin wondered. \u201cThat might affect the odds.\u201d \u201cI can guess,\u201d Mike said, and then he shot a glance at me at the same time that Ben and Tyler did. From their expressions, none of them had realized I was in easy hearing distance. They all looked away quickly, shuffling the papers on their desks. \u201cI still say Jacob,\u201d Mike muttered under his breath.",
