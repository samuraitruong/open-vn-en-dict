            "en": "Van Gaal: Inter deserved to win    Louis van Gaal conceded Bayern Munich were \"not good enough\" to impose their own game on Inter Milan in the Champions League final. Bayern's dreams of an unprecedented trophy treble were crushed in the Bernabeu as Diego Milito scored a goal in each half to earn Inter a 2-0 win. Though the German champions dominated possession in Madrid, bar a golden chance for Thomas Muller moments after half-time they struggled to find a way through Inter's stubborn defence. Van Gaal believes there was little to choose between the two teams, but acknowledged that Inter deserved a first European Cup success in 45 years. \"We were not good enough to impose our game,\" said Van Gaal. \"Inter only reacted, but they still won deservedly. \"The timing of the goals was decisive. The players learned today that it comes down to small details. \"I still have the feeling that we could have won. There were no great difference. \"We attacked, Inter defended, but you have to be in great shape to beat Inter and we were not today. I still think Inter merited the win.\" Bayern keeper Hans-Jorg Butt echoed Van Gaal's sentiments, saying: \"They deserved to win. They defended very well. \"We never found our game and could not get past their defence. They have great strikers.\" Captain Mark van Bommel believes Muller's opportunity, when the youngster shot straight at Julio <em>Cesar</em>, was a key moment in the game. Van Bommel commented: \"Not the better, but the more effective team won. \"Had Muller scored, it may have been different. These are decisive moments. But no reproaches, Muller has scored so many goals this season.\"",
