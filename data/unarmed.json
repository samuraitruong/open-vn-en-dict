A statement given to the New York Times newspaper said the family wanted to know why the al-Qaeda leader had not been captured alive. Relatives who survived the 2 May raid in Pakistan should be freed, it said. Another statement appeared on a jihadist website saying the burial of Bin Laden at sea \"demeans and humiliates his family\". Osama Bin Laden was shot dead by US special forces during a raid on his home in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad. The statement printed by the New York Times was attributed to Bin Laden's fourth son, Omar Bin Laden, who has repeatedly distanced himself from his father's ideology. The statement said that in absence of a body or photographic evidence, the family were not convinced he was dead. But if he was dead, it said, they were questioning \"why an <em>unarmed</em> man was not arrested and tried in a court of law so that truth is revealed to the people of the world\".  Humiliation  They argue Bin Laden's killing had broken international law and that figures such as former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic had been given the chance to stand trial. \"We maintain that arbitrary killing is not a solution to political problems and crime's adjudication as justice must be seen to be done.\" The family said they were demanding a enquiry into why Bin Laden was \"summarily executed without a court of law\" and demanded the release of his three wives and several children, who are believed to be in Pakistani custody. The statement also said the US decision to bury Bin Laden's corpse at sea had deprived the family of performing religious rites. A slightly different version of the report was published on a jihadist websites, said the SITE Intelligence Group.  It said US President Barack Obama was \"legally responsible\" for clarifying \"the fate of our father\" and that the sea burial \"demeans and humiliates his family and his supporters\". US President Barack Obama has urged Pakistan to investigate how the al-Qaeda leader could live in the garrison city of Abbottabad undetected and to find out if any officials knew of his whereabouts. Pakistan's PM Yousuf Raza Gilani has insisted that allegations of Pakistani complicity and incompetence are \"absurd\".",

            "en": "US President Barack Obama is visiting Ground Zero, the site of the 9/11 attacks in New York, four days after US forces killed al-Qaeda head Osama Bin Laden in Pakistan. Bin Laden was believed to be the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks in 2001. Mr Obama laid a wreath in memory of the nearly 3,000 victims and spoke to relatives at the site. He earlier told New York firefighters: \"When we say we will never forget, we mean what we say.\" The visit comes a day after the US president said graphic photographs of Bin Laden's dead body would not be made public.  The al-Qaeda leader was killed by US special forces in northern Pakistan on Monday. His body was then buried at sea from a US aircraft carrier. The Pakistani military on Thursday admitted \"shortcomings\" for failing to locate Bin Laden and has said it will launch an investigation.  But it also warned it would review co-operation with the US if there were any more unilateral raids such as the one that killed Bin Laden.  Moment of reflection  Mr Obama's first stop in New York was a fire station in midtown Manhattan. He told firefighters: \"We are going to make sure that the perpetrators of that horrible act will see justice.\" Mr Obama met families of the victims at the site of Ground Zero, where he laid a wreath in red, white and blue.  He made no public comments at the scene. The BBC's Barbara Plett, in New York, says the Obama administration is very sensitive to accusations that the president is politicising his visit. Thousands of people gathered at Ground Zero on Sunday night, waving flags and climbing street signs, as the news emerged that Bin Laden had been killed.  On Monday, Mr Obama said he had made it his top national security priority to find Bin Laden.  Ground Zero is now a building site, with construction scheduled for completion in 2013. As well as several office towers, the area will also house the National September 11 Memorial & Museum, which comprises a museum, waterfalls and a park. Mr Obama has decided not to publish photos of Bin Laden's body, saying the images could pose a national security risk. \"It is important for us to make sure that very graphic photos of somebody who was shot in the head are not floating around as an incitement to additional violence, as a propaganda tool. That's not who we are,\" Mr Obama said.  Our correspondent says there are mixed feelings in New York about the decision not to publish the pictures. While some want proof that it was Bin Laden who was killed, for others, the photos would reopen painful memories. Courier killed?  There are reports that among the information gathered from Bin Laden's compound were suggestions that al-Qaeda was considering attacking US trains on the 10th anniversary of the strikes of 11 September 2001.\\  According to a Homeland Security intelligence warning seen by the Associated Press, from February 2010 the group considered tampering with an unspecified railway track so that a train would fall off at a valley or bridge.  Meanwhile, White House officials have again changed their account of the raid on Bin Laden's compound.  They told respected media outlets, including the New York Times, that only one individual - a courier for Bin Laden - fired at US special forces. He was killed at the start of the raid.  The al-Qaeda leader was elsewhere in compound and <em>unarmed</em> when killed.  As recently as Tuesday, the president's spokesman had spoken of a \"highly volatile\" fire-fight, lasting throughout the 40-minute operation. And the White House had given the impression that an armed Osama Bin Laden had been killed in a shoot-out. Critics have raised concerns about the legality of the operation, after the US revised its account to acknowledge Bin Laden was <em>unarmed</em> when shot dead. But the US has said Bin Laden was a lawful military target, whose killing was \"an act of national self-defence\". Anger in Pakistan  In Pakistan, there are continuing recriminations over the failure to arrest or locate Bin Laden. A senior Pakistani military official said one of Bin Laden's wives told investigators she had been living in the same room for five years, along with her husband. On Thursday, the head of Pakistan's diplomatic service, Salman Bashir, again dismissed allegations his country's secret services had links to al-Qaeda, and said the investigation into the presence of Bin Laden in Abbottabad would reveal what failures there were. Pakistan's army has long been seen as the most effective institution in an unstable country. However, Pakistani public opinion has been critical of the perceived violation of national sovereignty by the US raid.  Referring to the raid, Chief of Army Staff Gen Ashfaq Kayani was quoted by the Reuters news agency as saying: \"Any similar action violating the sovereignty of Pakistan will warrant a review on the level of military/intelligence cooperation with the United States.\"  The BBC's Syed Shoaib Hasan, in Rawalpindi, said Pakistan's forces again denied all prior knowledge of the raid and Bin Laden's whereabouts. However, he says there were some contradictions: the military claimed Pakistan contributed information leading to the capture of Bin Laden by providing details of phone calls made from Pakistan to Saudi Arabia. The calls - from a Saudi man - concerned financial transactions. The last one was traced to Bin Laden's compound, the military said.  However, our correspondent in Rawalpindi says the military did not explain why, after this call, the compound was not raided or investigated.",

            "en": "President Barack Obama has decided that photos of the dead Osama Bin Laden should not be released. US officials had been discussing whether to publish pictures of Bin Laden's body to counter conspiracy theories that he did not die. But Mr Obama believed the images could inflame sensitivities, saying: \"We don't trot out this stuff as trophies.\" The al-Qaeda leader was shot dead in a raid on Monday by US special forces in northern Pakistan. The BBC's Paul Adams in Washington says that President Obama has clearly decided that releasing the photos is not worth the risk. Computer files  Mr Obama revealed his decision during an interview with CBS television's 60 Minutes programme. White House spokesman Jay Carney said at a briefing that Mr Obama believed it was important to make sure that photographs were not \"floating around as incitement or as a propaganda tool\". Mr Carney said the administration had been monitoring world reaction and there was no doubt that al-Qaeda believed Bin Laden was dead. \"There are going to be some folks who deny it. The fact of the matter is, you won't see Bin Laden walking on this Earth again,\" Mr Obama said. \"It is important for us to make sure that very graphic photos of somebody who was shot in the head are not floating around as an incitement to additional violence,\" he added. \"I think that, given the graphic nature of these photos, it would create some national security risk.\" Mr Obama's decision prompted a mixed reaction from US politicians, some of whom were shown the photos. Steny Hoyer, the number two Democrat in the House of Representatives, said he shared the president's view. \"In my opinion there's no end served by releasing a picture of someone who has been killed,\" he said, quoted by CNN. But senior Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said the decision was a mistake. \"I know Bin Laden is dead,\" he said. \"But the best way to protect and defend our interests overseas is to prove that fact to the rest of the world. I'm afraid the decision made today by President Obama will unnecessarily prolong this debate.\" The US president's decision contradicted a statement made a day earlier by CIA director Leon Panetta, who said the photos would be released at some stage. More names The decision came as US officials began to comb through computer hard-drives, mobile phones and USB sticks found during the US Navy Seals raid on the compound in Abbottabad where Bin Laden was hiding. US Attorney General Eric Holder said Washington expected to add more names to its terrorism watch-list as a result of data seized from the compound. Two telephone numbers and 500 euros ($745; \u00a3450) were also found stitched into Bin Laden's clothing, there in case he needed to make a quick getaway. Critics have raised concerns about the legality of the operation, after the US revised its account to acknowledge Bin Laden was <em>unarmed</em> when shot dead. But Mr Holder said Bin Laden was a lawful military target, whose killing was \"an act of national self-defence\". He told lawmakers in Congress: \"Let me make something very clear: The operation in which Osama Bin Laden was killed was lawful. \"It was a kill-or-capture mission. He made no attempt to surrender.\" \u00a0Two of Bin Laden's couriers and one woman also died in Monday's assault, while one of the al-Qaeda leader's wives was injured. The 54-year-old Bin Laden - American's most wanted man - was buried at sea from a US aircraft carrier, say US officials. Mr Obama, who watched the raid from the White House on monitors, saw his approval rating jump 11 points to 57% in a New York Times/CBS News poll on Wednesday. He plans to visit the World Trade Center site in New York on Thursday to remember victims of the 11 September attacks, of which Bin Laden was said to have been the mastermind. The compound where the operation took place is just a few hundred metres from the Pakistan Military Academy. In unusually frank remarks, CIA director Leon Panetta told Time magazine: \"It was decided that any effort to work with the Pakistanis could jeopardise the mission. They might alert the targets.\" Pakistan rejected the US suggestions it could not have been trusted in advance. Some US lawmakers are calling for billions of dollars in aid for Pakistan to be reduced or stopped altogether.",
