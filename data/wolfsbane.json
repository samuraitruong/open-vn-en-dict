            "en": "VANQUISHING A WEREWOLF: Silver bullets may stop a werewolf in Hollywood, but there's no evidence of this belief prior to the 20th century. It was commonly believed that rye and mistletoe would stop a werewolf in its tracks, but not kill it. Others believed that if one's house was situated under a mountain ash, it would be safe. <em>Wolfsbane</em> was also believed to ward off werewolves. In medieval Europe, alleged werewolves were commonly cured through medical or surgical means, or through exorcism. Others believed that repeating the werewolf's Christian name three times, or scolding it, would destroy the curse.",
