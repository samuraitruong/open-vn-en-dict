            "en": "Obama chooses Chicago schools ch WASHINGTON -- President-elect Barack Obama has chosen Chicago schools chief Arne <em>Duncan</em> to serve as education secretary, people with knowledge of the decision said Monday. Obama planned to announce his choice Tuesday morning. These individuals confirmed Duncan's selection Monday on condition of anonymity because Obama had not made the decision public. <em>Duncan</em> has run the country's third-biggest school district for the past seven years. He has focused on improving struggling schools, closing those that fail. Obama highlighted this work by choosing for the announcement a turnaround story for <em>Duncan</em> -- Dodge Renaissance Academy, a school <em>Duncan</em> closed and then reopened. The two had visited the school together three years ago, although they share more than an interest in education: <em>Duncan</em> has played pickup basketball with Obama since the 1990s. In fact, <em>Duncan</em> co-captained the Harvard basketball team and played professionally in Australia before his career in education. <em>Duncan</em> ran an education nonprofit on Chicago's South Side before working in Chicago Public Schools under former chief Paul Vallas, now the schools chief in New Orleans.  Obama's choice has been anticipated, and argued about, by education groups anxious to see what Obama will do to fix the country's ailing schools. Obama managed throughout his campaign to avoid taking sides in the contentious debate between reform advocates and teachers' unions over the direction of education and the fate of President Bush's No Child Left Behind accountability law. Duncan's selection may satisfy both factions. Reform advocates wanted a big-city school superintendent who, like <em>Duncan</em>, has sought accountability for schools and teachers. And teachers' unions, an influential segment of the party base, wanted an advocate for their members; they have said they believe <em>Duncan</em> is willing to work with them. \"Arne <em>Duncan</em> actually reaches out and tries to do things in a collaborative way,\" Randi Weingarten, head of the 1.4 million-member American Federation of Teachers, told The Associated Press earlier this month. <em>Duncan</em> deliberately straddled the factions earlier this year when he signed competing manifestos from each side of the debate. Sen. Edward Kennedy, chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which must confirm the education nomination, said <em>Duncan</em> was a consensus candidate. \"Arne has been a pragmatic and effective leader of Chicago's schools,\" Kennedy, D-Mass., said in a statement. \"He's brought people together to address difficult challenges and expand opportunities so that every child can succeed.\" House Education and Labor Committee Chairman George Miller called <em>Duncan</em> \"a very good choice for school reform and our schoolchildren.\" \"He is an experienced and accomplished leader who is open to new ideas for improving our schools,\" Miller, D-Calif., said in a statement. In the education debate, the competing sides break down over the degree to which teachers and schools should be held accountable for how kids are learning, and the role test scores should play in making that determination. At the heart of the dispute: No Child Left Behind, the law that has grown as unpopular as George W. Bush, the outgoing president who championed it. The reform group agrees with the law's general principle of penalties for schools if test scores fail to improve, although nearly everyone agrees the law has problems that need fixing. The union coalition says test scores aren't the only measure, and that factors far beyond the classroom affect how well kids learn.",

            "en": "Manchester United is to sell off a significant stake in the club in Singapore to partly pay off its gross debts of \u00a3515m, the BBC has learnt. \u00a0 BBC sports editor David Bond says it is understood the club has now lodged a listing application with the Singapore Stock Exchange.  \u00a0 Our correspondent says it could raise between \u00a3400m and \u00a3600m for the club. \u00a0 It is understood the club wants to complete the listing by the end of the year. \u00a0 The owners, the Glazer family, removed the Old Trafford club from the London stock market following their successful takeover in 2005. \u00a0 A partial share sale, of between 25% and 30%, would also mean that no outside person could take control of the club.  \u00a0 At the same time, it would provide the Glazers with much needed cash that would help pay off some of the debt that was taken on to finance the takeover.  \u00a0 As well as the debt issue, analysts have seen a Singapore listing as an aggressive move by the club to create an even stronger presence in Asia. \u00a0 United has more than 300 million fans around the world and more than 190 million of those are in Asia.  \u00a0 The region has become a growth area for the club and other Premier League teams. \u00a0 David Bond said that the flotation would also be an opportunity to see what value the stock market puts on Manchester United, with an overall valuation of the club of anything up to \u00a31.7bn. \u00a0 'Poisoned pill'  \u00a0 The Manchester United Supporters Trust, which opposes the Glazer family's ownership of the club, was suspicious about the flotation. \u00a0 \"The share sale will be in the Glazers' interests - to pay down their debt - not the club's,\" said its chief executive <em>Duncan</em> Drasdo. \u00a0 The Trust wants to see Manchester United owned by its fans, and is concerned that the Singapore listing could provide a \"poisoned pill\" to such hopes. \u00a0 \"By reducing the Glazers' personal debt we will continue to be saddled with these absentee landlords,\" Mr Drasdo added. \u00a0 'Complexity'  \u00a0 Despite the club's hopes for a listing by the end of the year, according to the Singapore Stock Exchange (SGX) website, \"depending on the complexity of the companies, the listing process may vary between four months to two years\". \u00a0 And the SGX also says that any business seeking a listing will have to appoint a Singapore-based financial institution to be its sponsor and lead manager for the listing. \u00a0 In March, Manchester United's parent company said it made a loss of \u00a3108.9m in 2009-10. Red Football Joint Venture is the Glazer family parent company that owns the Old Trafford club. \u00a0 Its loss for the year to the end of July 2010 included one-off costs from setting up a \u00a3526m bond scheme last January to replace outstanding debts of \u00a3509m.  \u00a0 There was also a drop in player sale income compared with the previous summer when Cristiano Ronaldo was sold. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0",
