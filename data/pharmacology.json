            "en": "No answers, no arrests yet in death of Yale student           NEW HAVEN, Connecticut (CNN)\u00a0 -- New Haven Police meticulously sifted through evidence Tuesday in their search for the killer of Yale student Annie Le, whose body was found Sunday in a basement wall of a medical research building off campus. A senior police official told CNN investigators have interviewed more than 200 people in the case but have not issued an arrest warrant nor have they identified a \"person of interest.\" The official also disputed Yale University President Richard Levin, who had indicated that the suspect pool would be a \"limited number\" of people who had been in the basement the day Le disappeared. \"We know everyone that was in the basement ... and we passed that on to police,\" Levin said. \"There is an abundance of evidence.\" But the police official, whom CNN is not naming because of the sensitive nature of the ongoing investigation, said investigators believe dozens of people could have had access to that area of the building. Le, 24, disappeared September 8. She was last seen on surveillance video as she entered the four-story lab at 10 Amistad Street, about 10 blocks from the main campus.  After going over hours of tapes, authorities said they had not found images of her leaving the building. The police official said that investigators were unlikely to make any arrest until DNA evidence is returned from analysis and that the probe could take days or weeks. Police have not released information on what DNA evidence may have been found, although investigators said earlier that bloody clothing was found hidden above tiles in a drop ceiling in another part of the building. Authorities have not described the clothes that were found, nor said to whom they might have belonged.  Teams of investigators at a Connecticut State Police lab worked through the weekend processing and examining the bloodstained clothes. But Thomas Kaplan, editor in chief of the Yale Daily News, said a Yale police official told the paper that the clothes were not what Le was wearing when she entered the building. On Sunday, New Haven Police spokesman Joe Avery said that Le's killing was not a random act but would not elaborate.  Meanwhile, a home in Middletown, Connecticut -- believed to be the home of a Yale technician -- was the scene of a large police presence Tuesday.  Police, however, would not say whether their presence at the home was related to their investigation of Le's death. Le, a graduate student in Yale's <em>pharmacology</em> program, was to have been married Sunday on New York's Long Island to Jonathan Widawsky, a graduate student at Columbia University. Her friend Vanessa Flores said Le was overjoyed about getting married. \"She was just so excited about this wedding and everything from, you know, her flowers to her wedding dress and just certain details about it,\" Flores told HLN's Nancy Grace. \"We talked about this back in 2008.  She was already thinking about the weather, whether June, July was going to be too hot, August, so September, would it be nice?\"  Le was from Placerville, California, and seemed to have been well aware of the risks of crime in a university town.  In February, she compared crime and safety at Yale with other Ivy League schools for a piece for B magazine, published by the medical school. Among the tips she offered: Keep a minimum amount on your person. When she walked over to the research building on September 8, she left her purse, credit cards and cell phone in her office.",

            "en": "Annie Le murder cops in hunt for 'person of interest,' lab tech Raymond Clark        Cops are on the hunt for Yale lab technician Raymond Clark III who has been identified as a person of interest in the Annie Le murder, sources said Tuesday. Clark, 24, works as an animal tech in the lab where Le was found dead on Sunday. Police found the 24-year-old <em>pharmacology</em> student's body stuffed in a wall in the lab on Sunday - what would have been her wedding day. Police are looking for Clark, who was not home Tuesday as swarms of cops descended on his apartment about 20 miles from Yale's campus. Clark did not show up for work - and neither did his sister, brother-in-law or fiance, all of whom work for Yale, the Yale Daily News reports. Police zeroed in on the lab tech several days ago, after he failed lie detector tests and had scratch marks on his chest that suggest he was in a struggle. Cops and FBI agents interviewed Clark several times. At one point he stopped answering questions and asked for a lawyer, the New Haven Register reported. New Haven Police spokesman Joe Avery had said Tuesday morning he hoped an arrest would be made by 1 p.m., but later changed course, saying, \"As of right, now we have nobody in custody and there is no anticipated arrest as of today.\" Police set up road blocks along Route 15 in the nearby town of Hamden. They stopped cars to look at passenger's faces. Neighbors say they saw Clark and his girlfriend, Jennifer Hromadka, leaving with suitcases on Sunday around the time cops found Le's body. \"I saw them leaving this weekend with travel bags like they were in a hurry,\" said a 35-year-old neighbor who lives in the same Middletown apartment building She and another neighbor said the couple climbed in the back seat of a Ford that had two adults in the front. \"I thought they were going on vacation,\" the neighbor said. A woman who knew Clark when he lived in New Haven last year said he \"looked like he could snap\" at any moment, screamed at children and was \"very controlling\" of his girlfriend. \"Something was wrong in his eyes. He looked disturbed.\", said Anne Marie Goodwin, 40.  \"Ray was very controlling of his girlfriend,\" she said. \"He would never let her talk to anyone. I would hear a lot of yelling up stairs.\" Clark lives with his girlfriend and the couple share a MySpace page. Hromadka writes extensively about her \"wonderful boyfriend Ray.\" \"I love hanging out with Ray's family (he has a great one) and playing with [his sister] Denise and [her husband] Shawn's Adorable kids, Caleb and Brielle.\" In May, 2008, she blogged about a rumor that Clark was cheating on her with a girl in his Yale lab. \"My boyfriend, Ray, if you don't know him, has no interest in any of the other girls at YARC as anything more than friends,\" she wrote, referring to the Yale Animal Resource Center. \"He is a bit naive, doesn't always use the best judgement, definitely is not the best judge of character but, he is a good guy,\" she wrote. \"He has a big heart and tries to see the best in people ALL THE TIME! even when everyone else is telling him that the person is a psycho or that the person can't be trusted. \"He thinks everyone deserves a second chance and has a hard time hurting peoples feelings\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 Her most recent entry, written on Friday, says: \"Who are you to judge the life I live? I  know I'm not perfect and I don't live to be, but before you start pointing fingers at somebody make sure your hands are clean!!\u00e2\u20ac\u009d",
