He found his way into a job at Abbott Reference Laboratories in California, and became director of the company's blood plasma testing and manufacturing division. In 1980 he founded a company called Rare Antibody Antigen Supply and began to acquire plasma centers in the U.S. He started to collaborate with the Shanghai Blood Center in China in 1987. That led him to found Shanghai RAAS Blood Products in 1992, which supplies albumin, immunoglobulin and other blood-derived products. It trades on the Shenzhen stock exchange. He is vice chairman of Shanghai RAAS, and owns about 35% of the Shenzhen-listed company. He lives in Westlake Village in southern California. In 2014 he bought a <em>winery</em> and vineyards from the Mondavi Family Estate in Napa Valley, and now operates the Kieu Hoang <em>Winery</em>.
