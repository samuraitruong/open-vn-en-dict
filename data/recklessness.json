            "en": "7 REPETITION        7 REPETITION I wasn't sure what the hell i was doing here. Was I trying to push myself back into the zombie stupor? Had I turned masochistic \u2014 developed a taste for torture? I should have gone straight down to La Push I felt much, much healthier around Jacob. This was not a healthy thing to do. But I continued to drive slowly down the overgrown lane, twisting through the trees that arched over me like a green, living tunnel. My hands were shaking, so I tightened my grip on the steering wheel. I knew that part of the reason I did this was the nightmare, now that I was really awake, the nothingness of the dream gnawed on my nerves, a dog worrying a bone. There was something to search for. Unattainable and impossible, uncaring and\u00a0\u00a0 distracted\u2026 but he was out there, somewhere. I had to believe that. The other part was the strange sense of repetition I'd felt at school today, the coincidence of the date. The feeling that I was starting over\u2014perhaps the way my first day would have gone if I'd really been the most unusual person in the cafeteria that afternoon. The words ran through my head, tonelessly, like I was reading them rather than hearing them spoken: It will be as if I'd never existed. I was lying to myself by splitting my reason for coming here into just two parts. I didn't want to admit the strongest motivation. Because it was mentally unsound. The truth was that I wanted to hear his voice again, like I had in the strange delusion Friday night. For that brief moment, when his voice came from some other part of me than my conscious memory, when his voice was perfect and honey smooth rather than the pale echo my memories usually produced, I was able to remember without pain. It hadn't lasted; the pain had caught up with me, as I was sure it would for this fool's errand. But those precious moments when I could hear him again were an irresistible lure. I had to find some way to repeat the experience\u2026 or maybe the better word was episode. I was hoping that d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu was the key. So I was going to his home, a place I hadn't been since my ill-fated birthday party, so many months ago. The thick, almost jungle-like growth crawled slowly past my windows. The drive wound on and on. I started to go faster, getting edgy. How long had I been driving? Shouldn't I have reached the house yet? The lane was so overgrown that it did not look familiar. What if I couldn't find it? I shivered. What if there was no tangible proof at all? Then there was the break in the trees that I was looking for, only it was not so\u00a0 pronounced as before. The flora here did not wait long to reclaim any land that was left unguarded. The tall ferns had infiltrated the meadow around the house, crowding against the trunks of the cedars, even the wide porch. It was like the lawn had been flooded\u2014waist-high\u2014with green, feathery waves. And the house was there, but it was not the same. Though nothing had changed on the outside, the emptiness screamed from the blank windows. It was creepy. For the first time since I'd seen the beautiful house, it looked like a fitting haunt for vampires. I hit the brakes, looking away. I was afraid to go farther. But nothing happened. No voice in my head. So I left the engine running and jumped out into the fern sea. Maybe, like Friday night, if I walked forward\u2026 I approached the barren, vacant face slowly, my truck rumbling out a comforting roar behind me. I stopped when I got to the porch stairs, because there was nothing here. No lingering sense of their presence\u2026 of his presence. The house was solidly here, but it meant little. Its concrete reality would not counteract the nothingness of the nightmares. I didn't go any closer. I didn't want to look in the windows. I wasn't sure which would be harder to see. If the rooms were bare, echoing empty from floor to ceiling, that would certainly hurt. Like my grandmother's funeral, when my mother had insisted that I stay outside during the viewing. She had said that I didn't need to see Gran that way, to remember her that way, rather than alive. But wouldn't it be worse if there were no change? If the couches sat just as I'd last seen them, the paintings on the walls\u2014worse still, the piano on its low platform? It would be second only to the house disappearing all together, to see that there was no physical possession that tied them in anyway. That everything remained, untouched and forgotten, behind them. Just like me. I turned my back on the gaping emptiness and hurried to my truck. I nearly ran. I was anxious to be gone, to get back to the human world. I felt hideously empty, and I wanted to see Jacob. Maybe I was developing a new kind of sickness, another addiction, like the numbness before. I didn't care. I pushed my truck as fast as it would go as I barreled toward my fix. Jacob was waiting for me. My chest seemed to relax as soon as I saw him, making it easier to breathe. \"Hey, Bella,\" he called. I smiled in relief. \"Hey, Jacob,\" I waved at Billy, who was looking out the window. \"Let's get to work,\" Jacob said in a low but eager voice. I was somehow able to laugh. \"You seriously aren't sick of me yet?\" I wondered. He must be starting to ask himself how desperate I was for company. Jacob led the way around the house to his garage. \"Nope. Not yet.\" \"Please let me know when I start getting on your nerves. I don't want to be a pain.\" \"Okay.\" He laughed, a throaty sound. \"I wouldn't hold your breath for that, though.\" When I walked into the garage, I was shocked to see the red bike standing up, looking like a motorcycle rather than a pile of jagged metal. \"Jake, you're amazing,\" I breathed. He laughed again. \"I get obsessive when I have a project.\" He shrugged. \"If I had any brains I'd drag it out a little bit.\" \"Why?\" He looked down, pausing for so long that I wondered if he hadn't heard my question. Finally, he asked me, \"Bella, if I told you that I couldn't fix these bikes, what would you say?\" I didn't answer right away, either, and he glanced up to check my expression. \"I would say\u2026 that's too bad, but I'll bet we could figure out something else to do. If we got really desperate, we could even do homework.\" Jacob smiled, and his shoulders relaxed. He sat down next to the bike and picked up a wrench. \"So you think you'll still come over when I'm done, then?\" \"Is that what you meant?\" I shook my head. \"I guess I am taking advantage of your very underpriced mechanical skills. But as long as you let me come over, I'll be here.\" \"Hoping to see Quil again?\" he teased. \"You caught me.\" He chuckled. \"You really like spending time with me?\" he asked, marveling. \"Very, very much. And I'll prove it. I have to work tomorrow, but Wednesday we'll do something nonmechanical.\" \"Like what?\" \"I have no idea. We can go to my place so you won't be tempted to be obsessive. You could bring your schoolwork\u2014you have to be getting behind, because I know I am.\" \"Homework might be a good idea.\" He made a face, and I wondered how much he was leaving undone to be with me. \"Yes,\" I agreed. \"We'll have to start being responsible occasionally, or Billy and Charlie aren't going to be so easygoing about this.\" I made a gesture indicating the two of us as a single entity. He liked that\u2014he beamed. \"Homework once a week?\" he proposed. \"Maybe we'd better go with twice,\" I suggested, thinking of the pile I'd just been assigned today. He sighed a heavy sigh. Then he reached over his toolbox to a paper grocery sack. He pulled out two cans of soda, cracking one open and handing it to me. He opened the second, and held it up ceremoniously. \"Here's to responsibility,\" he toasted. \"Twice a week.\" \"And <em>recklessness</em> every day in between,\" I emphasized. He grinned and touched his can to mine. I got home later than I'd planned and found Charlie had ordered a pizza rather than wait for me. He wouldn't let me apologize. \"I don't mind,\" he assured me. \"You deserve a break from all the cooking, anyway.\" I knew he was just relieved that I was still acting like a normal person, and he was not about to rock the boat. I checked my e-mail before I started on my homework, and there was a long one from Renee. She gushed over every detail I'd provided her with, so I sent back another exhaustive description of my day. Everything but the motorcycles. Even happy-go-lucky Renee was likely to be alarmed by that. School Tuesday had its ups and downs. Angela and Mike seemed ready to welcome me back with open arms\u2014to kindly overlook my few months of aberrant behavior. Jess was more resistant. I wondered if she needed a formal written apology for the Port Angeles incident. Mike was animated and chatty at work. It was like he'd stored up the semester's worth of talk, and it was all spilling out now. I found that I was able to smile and laugh with him, though it wasn't as effortless as it was with Jacob. It seemed harmless enough, until quitting time. Mike put the closed sign in the window while I folded my vest and shoved it under the counter. \"This was fun tonight,\" Mike said happily. \"Yeah,\" I agreed, though I'd much rather have spent the afternoon in the garage. \"It's too bad that you had to leave the movie early last week.\" I was a little confused by his train of thought. I shrugged. \"I'm just a wimp, I guess.\" \"What I mean is, you should go to a better movie, something you'd enjoy,\" he explained. \"Oh,\" I muttered, still confused. \"Like maybe this Friday. With me. We could go see something that isn't scary at all.\" I bit my lip. I didn't want to screw things up with Mike, not when he was one of the only people ready to forgive me for being crazy. But this, again, felt far too familiar. Like the last year had never happened. I wished I had Jess as an excuse this time. \"Like a date?\" I asked. Honesty was probably the best policy at this point. Get it over with. He processed the tone of my voice \"If you want. But it doesn't have to be like that.\" \"I don't date,\" I said slowly, realizing how true that was. That whole world seemed impossibly distant. \"Just as friends?\" he suggested. His clear blue eyes were not as eager now. I hoped he really meant that we could be friends anyway. \"That would be fun. But I actually have plans already this Friday, so maybe next week?\" \"What are you doing?\" he asked, less casually than I think he wanted to sound. \"Homework. I have a\u2026 study session planned with a friend.\" \"Oh. Okay. Maybe next week.\" He walked me to my car, less exuberant than before. It reminded me so clearly of my first months in Forks. I'd come full circle, and now everything felt like an echo\u2014an empty echo, devoid of the interest it used to have. The next night, Charlie didn't seem the smallest bit surprised to find Jacob and me sprawled across the living room floor with our books scattered around us, so I guessed that he and Billy were talking behind our backs. \"Hey, kids,\" he said, his eyes straying to the kitchen. The smell of the lasagna I'd spent the afternoon making\u2014while Jacob watched and occasionally sampled\u2014wafted down the hall; I was being good, trying to atone for all the pizza. Jacob stayed for dinner, and took a plate home for Billy. He grudgingly added another year to my negotiable age for being a good cook. Friday was the garage, and Saturday, after my shift at Newton's, was homework again. Charlie felt secure enough in my sanity to spend the day fishing with Harry. When he got back, we were all done\u2014feeling very sensible and mature about it, too\u2014and watching Monster Garage on the Discovery Channel. \"I probably ought to go.\" Jacob sighed. \"It's later than I thought.\" \"Okay, fine,\" I grumbled. \"I'll take you home.\" He laughed at my unwilling expression\u2014it seemed to please him. \"Tomorrow, back to work,\" I said as soon as we were safe in the truck. \"What time do you want me to come up?\" There was an unexplained excitement in his answering smile. \"I'll call you first, okay?\" \"Sure.\" I frowned to myself, wondering what was up. His smile widened. I cleaned the house the next morning\u2014waiting for Jacob to call and trying to shake off the Litest nightmare. The scenery had changed. Last night I'd wandered in a wide sea of ferns interspersed with huge hemlock trees. There was nothing else there, and I was lost, wandering aimless and alone, searching for nothing. I wanted to kick myself for the stupid field trip last week. I shoved the dream out of my conscious mind, hoping it would stay locked up somewhere and not escape again. Charlie was outside washing the cruiser, so when the phone rang, I dropped the toilet brush and ran downstairs to answer it. \"Hello?\" I asked breathlessly. \"Bella,\" Jacob said, a strange, formal tone to his voice. \"Hey, Jake.\" \"I believe that\u2026 we have a date\" he said, his tone thick with implications. It took me a second before I got it. \"They're done? I can't believe it!\" What perfect timing. I needed something to distract me from nightmares and nothingness. \"Yeah, they run and everything.\" \"Jacob, you are absolutely, without a doubt, the most talented and wonderful person I know. You get ten years for this one.\" \"Cool! I'm middle-aged now.\" I laughed. \"I'm on my way up!\" I threw the cleaning supplies under the bathroom counter and grabbed my jacket. \"Headed to see Jake,\" Charlie said when I ran past him. It wasn't really a question. \"Yep,\" I replied as I jumped in my truck. \"I'll be at the station later,\" Charlie called after me. \"Okay,\" I yelled back, turning the key. Charlie said something else, but I couldn't hear him clearly over the roar of the engine. It sounded sort of like, \"Where's the fire?\" I parked my truck off to the side of the Blacks' house, close to the trees, to make it easier for us to sneak the bikes out. When I got out, a splash of color caught my eye\u2014two shiny motorcycles, one red, one black, were hidden under a spruce, invisible from the house. Jacob was prepared. There was a piece of blue ribbon tied in a small bow around each of the handlebars. I was laughing at that when Jacob ran out of the house. \"Ready?\" he asked in a low voice, his eyes sparkling. I glanced over his shoulder, and there was no sign of Billy. \"Yeah,\" I said, but I didn't feel quite as excited as before; I was trying to imagine myself actually on the motorcycle. Jacob loaded the bikes into the bed of the truck with ease, laying them carefully on their sides so they didn't show. \"Let's go,\" he said, his voice higher than usual with excitement. \"I know the perfect spot\u2014no one will catch us there.\" We drove south out of town. The dirt road wove in and out of the forest\u2014sometimes there was nothing but trees, and then there would suddenly be a breathtaking glimpse of the Pacific Ocean, reaching to the horizon, dark gray under the clouds. We were above the shore, on top of the cliffs that bordered the beach here and the view seemed to stretch on forever. I was driving slowly, so that I could safely stare out across the ocean now and then, as the road wound closer to the sea cliffs. Jacob was talking about finishing the bikes, but his descriptions were getting technical, so I wasn't paying close attention. That was when I noticed four figures standing on a rocky ledge, much too close to the precipice. I couldn't tell from the distance how old they were, but I assumed they were men. Despite the chill in the air today, they seemed to be wearing only shorts. As I watched, the tallest person stepped closer to the brink. I slowed automatically, my foot hesitating over the brake pedal. And then he threw himself off the edge. \"No!\" I shouted, stomping down on the brake. \"What's wrong?\" Jacob shouted back, alarmed.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \"That guy\u2014he just jumped off the cliff! Why didn't they stop him? We've got to call an ambulance!\" I threw open my door and started to get out, which made no sense at all. The fastest way to a phone was to drive back to Billy's. But I couldn't believe what I'd just seen. Maybe, subconsciously, I hoped I would see something different without the glass of the windshield in the way. Jacob laughed, and I spun to stare at him wildly. How could he be so calloused, so cold-blooded? \"They're just cliff diving, Bella. Recreation. La Push doesn't have a mall, you know.\" He was teasing, but there was a strange note of irritation in his voice. \"Cliff diving?\" I repeated, dazed. I stared in disbelief as a second figure stepped to the edge, paused, and then very gracefully leaped into space. He fell for what seemed like an eternity to me, finally cutting smoothly into the dark gray waves below. \"Wow. It's so high.\" I slid back into my seat, still staring wide-eyed at the two remaining divers. \"It must be a hundred feet.\" \"Well, yeah, most of us jump from lower down, that rock that juts out from the cliff about halfway.\" He pointed out his window. The place he indicated did seem much more reasonable. \"Those guys are insane. Probably showing off how tough they are. I mean, really, it's freezing today. That water can't feel good.\" He made a disgruntled face, as if the stunt personally offended him. It surprised me a little. I would have thought Jacob was nearly impossible to upset. \"You jump off the cliff?\" I hadn't missed the \"us.\" \"Sure, sure.\" He shrugged and grinned. \"It's fun. A little scary, kind of a rush.\" I looked back at the cliffs, where the third figure was pacing the edge. I'd never witnessed anything so reckless in all my life. My eyes widened, and I smiled. \"Jake, you have to take me cliff diving.\" He frowned back at me, his face disapproving. \"Bella, you just wanted to call an ambulance for Sam,\" he reminded me. I was surprised that he could tell who it was from this distance. \"I want to try,\" I insisted, start ing to get out of the car again. Jacob grabbed my wrist. \"Not today, all right? Can we at least wait for a warmer day?\" \"Okay, fine,\" I agreed. With the door open, the glacial breeze was raising goose bumps on my arm. \"But I want to go soon.\" \"Soon.\" He rolled his eyes. \"Sometimes you're a little strange, Bella. Do you know that?\" I sighed. \"Yes.\" \"And we're not jumping off the top.\" I watched, fascinated, as the third boy made a running start and flung himself farther into the empty air than the other two. He twisted and cart wheeled through space as he fell, like he was skydiving. He looked absolutely free\u2014 unthinking and utterly irresponsible. \"Fine,\" I agreed. \"Not the first time, anyway.\" Now Jacob sighed. \"Are we going to try out the bikes or not?\" he demanded. \"Okay, okay,\" I said, tearing my eyes away from the last person waiting on the cliff. I put my seat belt back on and closed the door. The engine was still running, roaring as it idled. We started down the road again. \"So who were those guys\u2014the crazy ones?\" I wondered. He made a disgusted sound in the back of his throat. \"The La Push gang.\" \"You have a gang?\" I asked. I realized that I sounded impressed. He laughed once at my reaction. \"Not like that. I swear, they're like hall monitors gone bad. They don't start fights, they keep the peace.\" He snorted. \"There was this guy from up somewhere by the Makah rez, big guy too, scary-looking. Well, word got around that he was selling meth to kids, and Sam Uley and his disciples ran him off our land. They're all about our land, and tribe pride\u2026 it's getting ridiculous. The worst part is that the council takes them seriously. Embry said that the council actually meets with Sam.\" He shook his head, face full of resentment. \"Embry also heard from Leah Clearwater that they call themselves 'protectors' or something like that.\" Jacob's hands were clenched into fists, as if he'd like to hit something. I'd never seen this side of him.  I was surprised to hear Sam Uley's name. I didn't want it to bring back the images from my nightmare, so I made a quick observation to distract myself. \"You don't like them very much.\" \"Does it show?\" he asked sarcastically. \"Well\u2026 It doesn't sound like they're doing anything bad.\" I tried to soothe him, to make him cheerful again. \"Just sort of annoyingly goody-two-shoes for a gang.\" \u201cYeah. Annoying is a good word. They're always showing off\u2014like the cliff thing. They act like\u2026 like, I don't know. Like tough guys. I was hanging out at the store with Embry and Quil once, last semester, and Sam came by with his followers, Jared and Paul. Quil said something, you know how he's got a big mouth, and it pissed Paul off. His eyes got all dark, and he sort of smiled\u2014no, he showed his teeth but he didn't smile\u2014and it was like he was so mad he was shaking or something. But Sam put his hand against Paul's chest and shook his head. Paul looked at him for a minute and calmed down. Honestly, it was like Sam was holding him back\u2014like Paul was going to tear us up if Sam didn't stop him.\" He groaned. \"Like a bad western. You know, Sam's a pretty big guy, he's twenty. But Paul's just sixteen, too, shorter than me and not as beefy as Quil. I think any one of us could take him.\" \"Tough guys,\" I agreed. I could see it in my head as he described it, and it reminded me of something\u2026 a trio of tall, dark men standing very still and close together in my father's living room. The picture was sideways, because my head was lying against the couch while Dr. Gerandy and Charlie leaned over me\u2026 Had that been Sam's gang? I spoke quickly again to divert myself from the bleak memories. \"Isn't Sam a little too old for this kind of thing?\" \"Yeah. He was supposed to go to college, but he stayed. And no one gave him any crap about it, either.\u00a0 The whole council pitched a fit when my sister turned down a partial scholarship and got married. But, oh no, Sam Uley can do no wrong.\" His face was set in unfamiliar lines of outrage\u2014outrage and something else I didn't recognize at first. \"It all sounds really annoying and\u2026 strange. But I don't get why you're taking it so personally.\" I peeked over at his face, hoping I hadn't offended him. He was suddenly calm, staring out the side window. \"You just missed the turn,\" he said in an even voice. I executed a very wide U-turn, nearly hitting a tree as my circle ran the truck halfway off the road. \"Thanks for the heads-up,\" I muttered as I started up the side road. \"Sorry, I wasn't paying attention.\" It was quiet for a brief minute. \"You can stop anywhere along here,\" he said softly. I pulled over and cut the engine. My ears rang in the silence that followed. We both got out, and Jacob headed around to the back to get the bikes. I tried to read his expression. Something more was bothering him. I'd hit a nerve. He smiled halfheartedly as he pushed the red bike to my side. \"Happy late birthday. Are you ready for this?\" \"I think so.\" The bike suddenly looked intimidating, frightening, as I realized I would soon be astride it. \"We'll take it slow,\" he promised. I gingerly leaned the motorcycle against the truck's fender while he went to get his. \"Jake\u2026\"I hesitated as he came back around the truck. \"Yeah?\" \"What's really bothering you? About the Sam thing, I mean? Is there something else?\" I watched his face. He grimaced, but he didn't seem angry. He looked at the dirt and kicked his shoe against the front tire of his bike again and again, like he was keeping time. He sighed. \"It's just\u2026 the way they treat me. It creeps me out.\" The words started to rush out now. \"You know, the council is supposed to be made up of equals, but if there was a leader, it would be my dad. I've never been able to figure out why people treat him the way they do. Why his opinion counts the most. It's got something to do with his father and his father's father. My great-grandpa, Ephraim Black, was sort of the last chief we had, and they still listen to Billy, maybe because of that.\u201d  \"But I'm just like everyone else. Nobody treats me special\u2026 until now.\" That caught me off guard. \"Sam treats you special?\" \"Yeah,\" he agreed, looking up at me with troubled eyes. \"He looks at me like he's waiting for something\u2026 like I'm going to join his stupid gang someday. He pays more attention to me than any of the other guys. I hate it.\" \"You don't have to join anything.\" My voice was angry. This was really upsetting Jacob, and that infuriated me. Who did these \"protectors\" think they were? \"Yeah.\" His foot kept up its rhythm against the tire. \"What?\" I could tell there was more.  He frowned, his eyebrows pulling up in a way that looked sad and worried rather than angry. \"It's Embry. He's been avoiding me lately.\" The thoughts didn't seem connected, but I wondered if I was to blame for the problems with his friend. \"You've been hanging out with me a lot,\" I reminded him, feeling selfish. I'd been monopolizing him. \"No, that's not it. It's not just me\u2014it's Quil, too, and everyone. Embry missed a week of school, but he was never home when we tried to see him. And when he came back, he looked\u2026 he looked freaked out. Terrified. Quil and I both tried to get him to tell us what was wrong, but he wouldn't talk to either one of us.\" I stared at Jacob, biting my lip anxiously\u2014he was really frightened. But he didn't look at me. He watched his own foot kicking the rubber as if it belonged to someone else. The tempo increased. \"Then this week, out of nowhere, Embry's hanging out with Sam and the rest of them. He was out on the cliffs today.\" His voice was low and tense. He finally looked at me. \"Bella, they bugged him even more than they bother me. He didn't want anything to do with them. And now Embry's following Sam around like he's joined a cult. \"And that's the way it was with Paul. Just exactly the same. He wasn't friends with Sam at all. Then he stopped coming to school for a few weeks, and, when he came back, suddenly Sam owned him. I don't know what it means. I can't figure it out, and I feel like I have to, because Embry's my friend and\u2026 Sam's looking at me funny.. and\u2026\" He trailed off. \"Have you talked to Billy about this?\" I asked. His horror was spreading to me. I had chills running on the back of my neck. Now there was anger on his face. \"Yes,\" he snorted. \"That was helpful.\" \"What did he say?\" Jacob's expression was sarcastic, and when he spoke, his voice mocked the deep tones of his father's voice. \"It's nothing you need to worry about now, Jacob. In a few years, if you don't\u2026 well, I'll explain later.\" And then his voice was his own. \"What am I supposed to get from that? Is he trying to say it's some stupid puberty, coming-of-age thing? This is something else. Something wrong.\" He was biting his lower lip and clenching his hands. He looked like he was about to cry. I threw my arms around him instinctively, wrapping them around his waist and pressing my face against his chest. He was so big, I felt like I was a child hugging a grown-up. \"Oh, Jake, it'll be okay!\" I promised. \"If it gets worse you can come live with me and Charlie. Don't be scared, we'll think of something!\" He was frozen for a second, and then his long arms wrapped hesitantly around me. \"Thanks, Bella.\" His voice was huskier than usual. We stood like that for a moment, and it didn't upset me; in fact, I felt comforted by the contact. This didn't feel anything like the last time someone had embraced me this way. This was friendship. And Jacob was very warm. It was strange for me, being this close\u2014emotionally rather than physically, though the physical was strange for me, too\u2014to another human being. It wasn't my usual style. I didn't normally relate to people so easily, on such a basic level. Not human beings. \"If this is how you're going to react, I'll freak out more often.\" Jacob's voice was light, normal again, and his laughter rumbled against my ear. His fingers touched my hair, soft and tentative. Well, it was friendship for me. I pulled away quickly, laughing with him, but determined to put things back in perspective at once. \"It's hard to believe I'm two years older than you,\" I said, emphasizing the word older. \"You make me feel like a dwarf.\" Standing this close to him, I really had to crane my neck to see his face. \"You're forgetting I'm in my forties, of course.\" \"Oh, that's right.\" He patted my head. \"You're like a little doll,\" he teased. \"A porcelain doll.\" I rolled my eyes, taking another step away. \"Let's not start with the albino cracks.\" \"Seriously, Bella, are you sure you're not?\" He stretched his russet arm out next to mine. The difference wasn't flattering. \"I've never seen anyone paler than you\u2026 well, except for\u2014\" He broke off, and I looked away, trying to not understand what he had been about to say. \"So are we going to ride or what?\" \"Let's do it,\" I agreed, more enthusiastic than I would have been half a minute ago. His unfinished sentence reminded me of why I was here.",

            "en": "5          5. CHEATER \"BELLA, WHY DON'T YOU TAKE OFF,\" MIKE SUGGESTED, his eyes focused off to the side, not really looking at me. I wondered how long that had been going on without me noticing. It was a slow afternoon at Newton's. At the moment there were only two patrons in the store, dedicated backpackers from the sound of their conversation. Mike had spent the last hour going through the pros and cons of two brands of lightweight packs with them. But they'd taken a break from serious pricing to indulge in trying to one - up each other with their latest tales from the trail. Their distraction had given Mike a chance to escape. \"I don't mind staying,\" I said. I still hadn't been able to sink back into my protective shell of numbness, and everything seemed oddly close and loud today, like I'd taken cotton out of my ears. I tried to tune out the laughing hikers without success. \"I'm telling you,\" said the thickset man with the orange beard that didn't match his dark brown hair. \"I've seen grizzlies pretty close up in Yellowstone, but they had nothing on this brute.\" His hair was matted, and his clothes looked like they'd been on his back for more than a few days. Fresh from the mountains. \"Not a chance. Black bears don't get that big. The grizzlies you saw were probably cubs.\" The second man was tall and lean, his face tanned and wind-whipped into an impressive leathery crust. \"Seriously, Bella, as soon as these two give up, I'm closing the place down,\" Mike murmured. \"If you want me to go\u2026\" I shrugged. \u00a0\"On all fours it was taller than you,\" the bearded man insisted while I gathered my things together. \"Big as a house and pitch-black. I'm going to report it to the ranger here. People ought to be warned\u2014this wasn't up on the mountain, mind you\u2014this was only a few miles from the trailhead.\" Leather-face laughed and rolled his eyes. \"Let me guess\u2014you were on your way in? Hadn't eaten real food or slept off the ground in a week, right?\" \"Hey, uh, Mike, right?\" the bearded man called, looking toward us. \"See you Monday,\" I mumbled. \"Yes, sir,\" Mike replied, turning away. \"Say, have there been any warnings around here recently\u2014about black bears?\" \"No, sir. But it's always good to keep your distance and store your food correctly. Have you seen the new bear-safe canisters? They only weigh two pounds\u2026\" The doors slid open to let me out into the rain. I hunched over inside my jacket as I\u00a0 dashed for my truck. The rain hammering against my hood sounded unusually loud, too, but soon the roar of the engine drowned out everything else. I didn't want to go back to Charlie's empty house. Last night had been particularly brutal, and I had no desire to revisit the scene of the suffering. Even after the pain had subsided enough for me to sleep, it wasn't over. Like I'd told Jessica after the movie, there was never any doubt that I would have nightmares. I always had nightmares now, every night. Not nightmares really, not in the plural,\u00a0 because it was always the same nightmare. You'd think I'd get bored after so many months, grow immune to it. But the dream never failed to horrify me, and only ended when I woke myself with screaming. Charlie didn't come in to see what was wrong anymore, to make sure there was no intruder strangling me or something like that\u2014he was used to it now. My nightmare probably wouldn't even frighten someone else. Nothing jumped out and screamed, \"Boo!\" There were no zombies, no ghosts, no psychopaths. There was nothing, really. Only nothing. Just the endless maze of moss-covered trees, so quiet that the silence was an uncomfortable pressure against my eardrums. It was dark, like dusk on a cloudy day, with only enough light to see that there was nothing to see. I hurried through the gloom without a path, always searching, searching, searching, getting more frantic as the time stretched on, trying to move faster, though the speed made me clumsy\u2026 Then there would come the point in my dream\u2014and I could feel it coming now, but could never seem to wake myself up before it hit\u2014when I couldn't remember what it was that I was searching for. When I realized that there was nothing to search for, and nothing to find.  That there never had been anything more than just this empty, dreary wood, and there never would be anything more for me\u2026 nothing but nothing\u2026 That was usually about when the screaming started. I wasn't paying attention to where I was driving\u2014just wandering through empty, wet side roads as I avoided the ways that would take me home\u2014because I didn't have anywhere to go.  I wished I could feel numb again, but I couldn't remember how I'd managed it before. The nightmare was nagging at my mind and making me think about things that would cause me pain. I didn't want to remember the forest. Even as I shuddered away from the images, I felt my eyes fill with tears and the aching begin around the edges of the hole in my chest. I took one hand from the steering wheel and wrapped it around my torso to hold it in one piece. It will be as if I'd never existed. The words ran through my head, lacking the perfect clarity of my hallucination last night. They were just words, soundless, like print on a page. Just words, but they ripped the hole wide open, and I stomped on the brake, knowing I should not drive while this incapacitated. I curled over, pressing my face against the steering wheel and trying to breathe without lungs. S\u1ebd nh\u01b0 th\u1ec3 t\u00f4i ch\u01b0a h\u1ec1 t\u1ed3n t\u1ea1i tr\u00ean \u0111\u1eddi n\u00e0y I wondered how long this could last. Maybe someday, years from now\u2014if the pain would just decrease to the point where I could bear it\u2014I would be able to look back on those few short months that would always be the best of my life. And, if it were possible that the pain would ever soften enough to allow me to do that, I was sure that I would feel grateful for as much time as he'd given me. More than I'd asked for, more than I'd deserved. Maybe someday I'd be able to see it that way. But what if this hole never got any better? If the raw edges never healed? If the damage was permanent and irreversible? I held myself tightly together. As if he'd never existed, I thought in despair. What a stupid and impossible promise to make! He could steal my pictures and reclaim his gifts, but that didn't put things back the way they'd been before I'd met him. The physical evidence was the most insignificant part of the equation. I was changed, my insides altered almost past the point of recognition. Even my outsides looked different\u2014my face sallow, white except for the purple circles the nightmares had left under my eyes. My eyes were dark enough against my pallid skin that\u2014if I were beautiful, and seen from a distance\u2014I might even pass for a vampire now. But I was not beautiful, and I probably looked closer to a zombie. Nh\u01b0 th\u1ec3 anh ch\u01b0a t\u1eebng t\u1ed3n t\u1ea1i tr\u00ean \u0111\u1eddi n\u00e0y As if he'd never existed? That was insanity. It was a promise that he could never keep, a promise that was broken as soon as he'd made it. I thumped my head against the steering wheel, trying to distract myself from the sharper pain. It made me feel silly for ever worrying about keeping my promise. Where was the logic in sticking to an agreement that had already been violated by the other party? Who cared if I was reckless and stupid? There was no reason to avoid <em>recklessness</em>, no reason why I shouldn't get to be stupid. I laughed humorlessly to myself, still gasping for air. Reckless in Forks\u2014now there was a hopeless proposition. The dark humor distracted me, and the distraction eased the pain. My breath came easier, and I was able to lean back against the seat. Though it was cold today, my forehead was damp with sweat. I concentrated on my hopeless proposition to keep from sliding back into the excruciating memories. To be reckless in Forks would take a lot of creativity\u2014maybe more than I had. But I wished I could find some way\u2026 I might feel better if I weren't holding fast, all alone, to a broken pact. If I were an oath-breaker, too. But how could I cheat on my side of the deal, here in this harmless little town? Of course, Forks hadn't always been so harmless, but now it was exactly what it had always appeared to be. It was dull, it was safe. I stared out the windshield for a long moment, my thoughts moving sluggishly\u2014I couldn't seem to make those thoughts go anywhere. I cut the engine, which was groaning in a pitiful way after idling for so long, and stepped out into the drizzle. The cold rain dripped through my hair and then trickled across my cheeks like freshwater tears. It helped to clear my head. I blinked the water from my eyes, staring blankly across the road. After a minute of staring, I recognized where I was. I'd parked in the middle of the north lane of Russell Avenue. I was standing in front of the Cheneys' house\u2014my truck was blocking their driveway\u2014and across the road lived the Markses. I knew I needed to move my truck, and that I ought to go home. It was wrong to wander the way I had, distracted and impaired, a menace on the roads of Forks. Besides, someone would notice me soon enough, and report me to Charlie. As I took a deep breath in preparation to move, a sign in the Markses' yard caught my eye\u2014it was just a big piece of cardboard leaning against their mailbox post, with black letters scrawled in caps across it. Sometimes, kismet happens. Coincidence? Or was it meant to be? I didn't know, but it seemed kind of silly to think that it was somehow fated, that the dilapidated motorcycles rusting in the Markses' front yard beside the hand-printed FOR SALE, AS IS sign were serving some higher purpose by existing there, right where I needed them to be. So maybe it wasn't kismet. Maybe there were just all kinds of ways to be reckless, and I only now had my eyes open to them. Reckless and stupid. Those were Charlie's two very favorite words to apply to motorcycles. Charlie's job didn't get a lot of action compared to cops in bigger towns, but he did get called in on traffic accidents. With the long, wet stretches of freeway twisting and turning through the forest, blind corner after blind corner, there was no shortage of that kind of action. But even with all the huge log-haulers barreling around the turns, mostly people walked away. The exceptions to that rule were often on motorcycles, and Charlie had seen one too many victims, almost always kids, smeared on the highway. He'd made me promise before I was ten that I would never accept a ride on a motorcycle. Even at that age, I didn't have to think twice before promising. Who would want to ride a motorcycle here? It would be like taking a sixty-mile-per-hour bath. So many promises I kept\u2026 It clicked together for me then. I wanted to be stupid and reckless, and I wanted to break promises. Why stop at one? That's as far as I thought it through. I sloshed through the rain to the Markses' front door and rang the bell. One of the Marks boys opened the door, the younger one, the freshman. I couldn't remember his name. His sandy hair only came up to my shoulder. He had no trouble remembering my name. \"Bella Swan?\" he asked in surprise. \"How much do you want for the bike?\" I panted, jerking my thumb over my shoulder toward the sales display. \"Are you serious?\" he demanded. \"Of course I am.\" \"They don't work.\" I sighed impatiently\u2014this was something I'd already inferred from the sign. \"How much?\" \"If you really want one, just take it. My mom made my dad move them down to the road so they'd get picked up with the garbage.\" I glanced at the bikes again and saw that they were resting on a pile of yard clippings and dead branches. \"Are you positive about that?\" \"Sure, you want to ask her?\" It was probably better not to involve adults who might mention this to Charlie. \"No, I believe you.\" \"You want me to help you?\" he offered. \"They're not light.\" \"Okay, thanks. I only need one, though.\" \"Might as well take both,\" the boy said. \"Maybe you could scavenge some parts.\" He followed me out into the downpour and helped me load both of the heavy bikes into the back of my truck. He seemed eager to be rid of them, so I didn't argue. \"What are you going to do with them, anyway?\" he asked. \"They haven't worked in years.\" \"I kind of guessed that,\" I said, shrugging. My spur-of-the-moment whim hadn't come with a plan intact. \"Maybe I'll take them to Dowling's.\" He snorted. \"Dowling would charge more to fix them than they'd be worth running.\" I couldn't argue with that. John Dowling had earned a reputation for his pricing; no one went to him except in an emergency. Most people preferred to make the drive up to Port Angeles, if their car was able. I'd been very lucky on that front\u2014I'd been worried, when Charlie first gifted me my ancient truck, that I wouldn't be able to afford to keep it running. But I'd never had a single problem with it, other than the screaming-loud engine and the fifty-five-mile-per-hour maximum speed limit. Jacob Black had kept it in great shape when it had belonged to his father, Billy\u2026 Inspiration hit like a bolt of lightning\u2014not unreasonable, considering the storm. \"You know what? That's okay. I know someone who builds cars.\" \"Oh. That's good.\" He smiled in relief. He waved as I pulled away, still smiling. Friendly kid. I drove quickly and purposefully now, in a hurry to get home before there was the slightest chance of Charlie appearing, even in the highly unlikely event that he might knock off early. I dashed through the house to the phone, keys still in hand. \"Chief Swan, please,\" I said when the deputy answered. \"It's Bella.\" \"Oh, hey, Bella,\" Deputy Steve said affably. \"I'll go get him.\" I waited. \"What's wrong, Bella?\" Charlie demanded as soon as he picked up the phone. \"Can't I call you at work without there being an emergency?\" He was quiet for a minute. \"You never have before. Is there an emergency?\" \"No. I just wanted directions to the Blacks' place\u2014I'm not sure I can remember the way. I want to visit Jacob. I haven't seen him in months.\" When Charlie spoke again, his voice was much happier. \"That's a great idea, Bells. Do you have a pen?\" The directions he gave me were very simple. I assured him that I would be back for dinner, though he tried to tell me not to hurry. He wanted to join me in La Push, and I wasn't having that. So it was with a deadline that I drove too quickly through the storm-darkened streets out of town. I hoped I could get Jacob alone. Billy would probably tell on me if he knew what I was up to. While I drove, I worried a little bit about Billy's reaction to seeing me. He would be too pleased. In Billy's mind, no doubt, this had all worked out better than he had dared to hope. His pleasure and relief would only remind me of the one I couldn't bear to be reminded of. Not again today, I pleaded silently. I was spent. The Blacks' house was vaguely familiar, a small wooden place with narrow windows, the dull red paint making it resemble a tiny barn. Jacob's head peered out of the window before I could even get out of the truck. No doubt the familiar roar of the engine had tipped him off to my approach. Jacob had been very grateful when Charlie bought Billy's truck for me, saving Jacob from having to drive it when he came of age. I liked my truck very much, but Jacob seemed to consider the speed restrictions a shortcoming. He met me halfway to the house. \"Bella!\" His excited grin stretched wide across his face, the bright teeth standing in vivid contrast to the deep russet color of his skin. I'd never seen his hair out of its usual ponytail before. It fell like black satin curtains on either side of his broad face. Jacob had grown into some of his potential in the last eight months. He'd passed that point where the soft muscles of childhood hardened into the solid, lanky build of a teenager; the tendons and veins had become prominent under the red-brown skin of his arms, his hands. His face was still sweet like I remembered it, though it had hardened, too\u2014the planes of his cheekbones sharper, his jaw squared off, all childish roundness gone. \"Hey, Jacob!\" I felt an unfamiliar surge of enthusiasm at his smile. I realized that I was pleased to see him. This knowledge surprised me. I smiled back, and something clicked silently into place, like two corresponding puzzle pieces. I'd forgotten how much I really liked Jacob Black. He stopped a few feet away from me, and I stared up at him in surprise, leaning my head back though the rain pelted my face. \"You grew again!\" I accused in amazement. He laughed, his smile widening impossibly. \"Six five,\" he announced with self-satisfaction. His voice was deeper, but it had the husky tone I remembered. \"Is it ever going to stop?\" I shook my head in disbelief. \"You're huge.\" \"Still a beanpole, though.\" He grimaced. \"Come inside! You're getting all wet.\" He led the way, twisting his hair in his big hands as he walked. He pulled a rubber band from his hip pocket and wound it around the bundle. \"Hey, Dad,\" he called as he ducked to get through the front door. \"Look who stopped by.\" Billy was in the tiny square living room, a book in his hands. He set the book in his lap and wheeled himself forward when he saw me. \"Well, what do you know! It's good to see you, Bella.\" We shook hands. Mine was lost in his wide grasp. \"What brings you out here? Everything okay with Charlie?\" \"Yes, absolutely. I just wanted to see Jacob\u2014I haven't seen him in forever.\" Jacob's eyes brightened at my words. He was smiling so big it looked like it would hurt his cheeks.  \"Can you stay for dinner?\" Billy was eager, too. \"No, I've got to feed Charlie, you know.\" \"I'll call him now,\" Billy suggested. \"He's always invited.\" I laughed to hide my discomfort. \"It's not like you'll never see me again. I promise I'll be back again soon\u2014so much you'll get sick of me.\" After all, if Jacob could fix the bike, someone had to teach me how to ride it. Billy chuckled in response. \"Okay, maybe next time.\" \"So, Bella, what do you want to do?\" Jacob asked. \"Whatever. What were you doing before I interrupted?\" I was strangely comfortable here. It was familiar, but only distantly. There were no painful reminders of the recent past. Jacob hesitated. \"I was just heading out to work on my car, but we can do something else\u2026\" \"No, that's perfect!\" I interrupted. \"I'd love to see your car.\" \"Okay,\" he said, not convinced. \"It's out back, in the garage.\" Even better, I thought to myself. I waved at Billy. \"See you later.\" A thick stand of trees and shrubbery concealed his garage from the house. The garage\u00a0\u00a0 was no more than a couple of big preformed sheds that had been bolted together with their interior walls knocked out.  Under this shelter, raised on cinder blocks, was what looked to me like a completed automobile. I recognized the symbol on the grille, at least. \"What kind of Volkswagen is that?\" I asked. \"It's an old Rabbit\u20141986, a classic.\" \"How's it going?\" \"Almost finished,\" he said cheerfully. And then his voice dropped into a lower key. \"My dad made good on his promise last spring.\" \"Ah,\" I said. He seemed to understand my reluctance to open the subject. I tried not to remember last May at the prom. Jacob had been bribed by his father with money and car parts to deliver a message there. Billy wanted me to stay a safe distance from the most important person in my life. It turned out that his concern was, in the end, unnecessary. I was all too safe now. But I was going to see what I could do to change that. \"Jacob, what do you know about motorcycles?\" I asked. He shrugged. \"Some. My friend Embry has a dirt bike. We work on it together sometimes. Why?\" \"Well\u2026\" I pursed my lips as I considered. I wasn't sure if he could keep his mouth shut, but I didn't have many other options. \"I recently acquired a couple of bikes, and they're not in the greatest condition. I wonder if you could get them running?\" \"Cool.\" He seemed truly pleased by the challenge. His face glowed. \"I'll give it a try.\" I held up one finger in warning. \"The thing is,\" I explained, \"Charlie doesn't approve of motorcycles. \u00a0Honestly, he'd probably bust a vein in his forehead if he knew about this. So you can't tell Billy.\" \"Sure, sure.\" Jacob smiled. \"I understand.\" \"I'll pay you,\" I continued. This offended him. \"No. I want to help. You can't pay me.\" \"Well\u2026 how about a trade, then?\" I was making this up as I went, but it seemed reasonable enough. \"I only need one bike\u2014and I'll need lessons, too. So how about this? I'll give you the other bike, and then you can teach me.\" \"Swee-eet.\" He made the word into two syllables. \"Wait a sec\u2014are you legal yet? When's your birthday?\" \"You missed it,\" he teased, narrowing his eyes in mock resentment. \"I'm sixteen.\" \"Not that your age ever stopped you before,\" I muttered. \"Sorry about your birthday.\" \"Don't worry about it. I missed yours. What are you, forty?\" I sniffed. \"Close.\" \"We'll have a joint party to make up for it.\" \"Sounds like a date.\" His eyes sparkled at the word. I needed to reign in the enthusiasm before I gave him the wrong idea\u2014it was just that it had been a long time since I'd felt so light and buoyant. The rarity of the feeling made it more difficult to manage. \"Maybe when the bikes are finished\u2014our present to ourselves,\" I added. \"Deal. When will you bring them down?\" I bit my lip, embarrassed. \"They're in my truck now,\" I admitted. \"Great.\" He seemed to mean it. \"Will Billy see if we bring them around?\" He winked at me. \"We'll be sneaky.\" We eased around from the east, sticking to the trees when we were in view of the windows, affecting a casual-looking stroll, just in case. Jacob unloaded the bikes swiftly from the truck bed, wheeling them one by one into the shrubbery where I hid. It looked too easy for him\u2014I'd remembered the bikes being much, much heavier than that. \"These aren't half bad,\" Jacob appraised as we pushed them through the cover of the trees. \"This one here will actually be worth something when I'm done\u2014it's an old Harley Sprint.\" \"That one's yours, then.\" \"Are you sure?\" \"Absolutely.\" \"These are going to take some cash, though,\" he said, frowning down at the blackened metal. \"We'll have to save up for parts first.\" \"We nothing,\" I disagreed. \"If you're doing this for free, I'll pay for the parts.\" \"I don't know\u2026\" he muttered. \"I've got some money saved. College fund, you know.\" College, schmollege, I thought to myself. It wasn't like I'd saved up enough to go anywhere special\u2014and besides, I had no desire to leave Forks anyway. What difference would it make if I skimmed a little bit off the top? Jacob just nodded. This all made perfect sense to him. As we skulked back to the makeshift garage, I contemplated my luck. Only a teenage boy would agree to this: deceiving both our parents while repairing dangerous vehicles using money meant for my college education. He didn't see anything wrong with that picture. Jacob was a gift from the gods.",
