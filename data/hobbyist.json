Bending glass tubing over a flame in a high school chemistry class piqued his interest and unknowingly a lifetime obsession and career began. After several years as a <em>hobbyist</em>, Scott made the acquaintance of Skip Horton and later Buzz Williams. With their guidance and tutoring, glass became Scott\u2019s livelihood and ruling passion. For the next four years, Scott led a dual existence as a flame worker and furnace worker. In 1994, Scott took a class at the Pilchuck School of Glass with the world famous Robert Mickleson. This was truly a turning point.",
