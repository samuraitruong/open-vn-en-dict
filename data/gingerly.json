            "en": "7 REPETITION        7 REPETITION I wasn't sure what the hell i was doing here. Was I trying to push myself back into the zombie stupor? Had I turned masochistic \u2014 developed a taste for torture? I should have gone straight down to La Push I felt much, much healthier around Jacob. This was not a healthy thing to do. But I continued to drive slowly down the overgrown lane, twisting through the trees that arched over me like a green, living tunnel. My hands were shaking, so I tightened my grip on the steering wheel. I knew that part of the reason I did this was the nightmare, now that I was really awake, the nothingness of the dream gnawed on my nerves, a dog worrying a bone. There was something to search for. Unattainable and impossible, uncaring and\u00a0\u00a0 distracted\u2026 but he was out there, somewhere. I had to believe that. The other part was the strange sense of repetition I'd felt at school today, the coincidence of the date. The feeling that I was starting over\u2014perhaps the way my first day would have gone if I'd really been the most unusual person in the cafeteria that afternoon. The words ran through my head, tonelessly, like I was reading them rather than hearing them spoken: It will be as if I'd never existed. I was lying to myself by splitting my reason for coming here into just two parts. I didn't want to admit the strongest motivation. Because it was mentally unsound. The truth was that I wanted to hear his voice again, like I had in the strange delusion Friday night. For that brief moment, when his voice came from some other part of me than my conscious memory, when his voice was perfect and honey smooth rather than the pale echo my memories usually produced, I was able to remember without pain. It hadn't lasted; the pain had caught up with me, as I was sure it would for this fool's errand. But those precious moments when I could hear him again were an irresistible lure. I had to find some way to repeat the experience\u2026 or maybe the better word was episode. I was hoping that d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu was the key. So I was going to his home, a place I hadn't been since my ill-fated birthday party, so many months ago. The thick, almost jungle-like growth crawled slowly past my windows. The drive wound on and on. I started to go faster, getting edgy. How long had I been driving? Shouldn't I have reached the house yet? The lane was so overgrown that it did not look familiar. What if I couldn't find it? I shivered. What if there was no tangible proof at all? Then there was the break in the trees that I was looking for, only it was not so\u00a0 pronounced as before. The flora here did not wait long to reclaim any land that was left unguarded. The tall ferns had infiltrated the meadow around the house, crowding against the trunks of the cedars, even the wide porch. It was like the lawn had been flooded\u2014waist-high\u2014with green, feathery waves. And the house was there, but it was not the same. Though nothing had changed on the outside, the emptiness screamed from the blank windows. It was creepy. For the first time since I'd seen the beautiful house, it looked like a fitting haunt for vampires. I hit the brakes, looking away. I was afraid to go farther. But nothing happened. No voice in my head. So I left the engine running and jumped out into the fern sea. Maybe, like Friday night, if I walked forward\u2026 I approached the barren, vacant face slowly, my truck rumbling out a comforting roar behind me. I stopped when I got to the porch stairs, because there was nothing here. No lingering sense of their presence\u2026 of his presence. The house was solidly here, but it meant little. Its concrete reality would not counteract the nothingness of the nightmares. I didn't go any closer. I didn't want to look in the windows. I wasn't sure which would be harder to see. If the rooms were bare, echoing empty from floor to ceiling, that would certainly hurt. Like my grandmother's funeral, when my mother had insisted that I stay outside during the viewing. She had said that I didn't need to see Gran that way, to remember her that way, rather than alive. But wouldn't it be worse if there were no change? If the couches sat just as I'd last seen them, the paintings on the walls\u2014worse still, the piano on its low platform? It would be second only to the house disappearing all together, to see that there was no physical possession that tied them in anyway. That everything remained, untouched and forgotten, behind them. Just like me. I turned my back on the gaping emptiness and hurried to my truck. I nearly ran. I was anxious to be gone, to get back to the human world. I felt hideously empty, and I wanted to see Jacob. Maybe I was developing a new kind of sickness, another addiction, like the numbness before. I didn't care. I pushed my truck as fast as it would go as I barreled toward my fix. Jacob was waiting for me. My chest seemed to relax as soon as I saw him, making it easier to breathe. \"Hey, Bella,\" he called. I smiled in relief. \"Hey, Jacob,\" I waved at Billy, who was looking out the window. \"Let's get to work,\" Jacob said in a low but eager voice. I was somehow able to laugh. \"You seriously aren't sick of me yet?\" I wondered. He must be starting to ask himself how desperate I was for company. Jacob led the way around the house to his garage. \"Nope. Not yet.\" \"Please let me know when I start getting on your nerves. I don't want to be a pain.\" \"Okay.\" He laughed, a throaty sound. \"I wouldn't hold your breath for that, though.\" When I walked into the garage, I was shocked to see the red bike standing up, looking like a motorcycle rather than a pile of jagged metal. \"Jake, you're amazing,\" I breathed. He laughed again. \"I get obsessive when I have a project.\" He shrugged. \"If I had any brains I'd drag it out a little bit.\" \"Why?\" He looked down, pausing for so long that I wondered if he hadn't heard my question. Finally, he asked me, \"Bella, if I told you that I couldn't fix these bikes, what would you say?\" I didn't answer right away, either, and he glanced up to check my expression. \"I would say\u2026 that's too bad, but I'll bet we could figure out something else to do. If we got really desperate, we could even do homework.\" Jacob smiled, and his shoulders relaxed. He sat down next to the bike and picked up a wrench. \"So you think you'll still come over when I'm done, then?\" \"Is that what you meant?\" I shook my head. \"I guess I am taking advantage of your very underpriced mechanical skills. But as long as you let me come over, I'll be here.\" \"Hoping to see Quil again?\" he teased. \"You caught me.\" He chuckled. \"You really like spending time with me?\" he asked, marveling. \"Very, very much. And I'll prove it. I have to work tomorrow, but Wednesday we'll do something nonmechanical.\" \"Like what?\" \"I have no idea. We can go to my place so you won't be tempted to be obsessive. You could bring your schoolwork\u2014you have to be getting behind, because I know I am.\" \"Homework might be a good idea.\" He made a face, and I wondered how much he was leaving undone to be with me. \"Yes,\" I agreed. \"We'll have to start being responsible occasionally, or Billy and Charlie aren't going to be so easygoing about this.\" I made a gesture indicating the two of us as a single entity. He liked that\u2014he beamed. \"Homework once a week?\" he proposed. \"Maybe we'd better go with twice,\" I suggested, thinking of the pile I'd just been assigned today. He sighed a heavy sigh. Then he reached over his toolbox to a paper grocery sack. He pulled out two cans of soda, cracking one open and handing it to me. He opened the second, and held it up ceremoniously. \"Here's to responsibility,\" he toasted. \"Twice a week.\" \"And recklessness every day in between,\" I emphasized. He grinned and touched his can to mine. I got home later than I'd planned and found Charlie had ordered a pizza rather than wait for me. He wouldn't let me apologize. \"I don't mind,\" he assured me. \"You deserve a break from all the cooking, anyway.\" I knew he was just relieved that I was still acting like a normal person, and he was not about to rock the boat. I checked my e-mail before I started on my homework, and there was a long one from Renee. She gushed over every detail I'd provided her with, so I sent back another exhaustive description of my day. Everything but the motorcycles. Even happy-go-lucky Renee was likely to be alarmed by that. School Tuesday had its ups and downs. Angela and Mike seemed ready to welcome me back with open arms\u2014to kindly overlook my few months of aberrant behavior. Jess was more resistant. I wondered if she needed a formal written apology for the Port Angeles incident. Mike was animated and chatty at work. It was like he'd stored up the semester's worth of talk, and it was all spilling out now. I found that I was able to smile and laugh with him, though it wasn't as effortless as it was with Jacob. It seemed harmless enough, until quitting time. Mike put the closed sign in the window while I folded my vest and shoved it under the counter. \"This was fun tonight,\" Mike said happily. \"Yeah,\" I agreed, though I'd much rather have spent the afternoon in the garage. \"It's too bad that you had to leave the movie early last week.\" I was a little confused by his train of thought. I shrugged. \"I'm just a wimp, I guess.\" \"What I mean is, you should go to a better movie, something you'd enjoy,\" he explained. \"Oh,\" I muttered, still confused. \"Like maybe this Friday. With me. We could go see something that isn't scary at all.\" I bit my lip. I didn't want to screw things up with Mike, not when he was one of the only people ready to forgive me for being crazy. But this, again, felt far too familiar. Like the last year had never happened. I wished I had Jess as an excuse this time. \"Like a date?\" I asked. Honesty was probably the best policy at this point. Get it over with. He processed the tone of my voice \"If you want. But it doesn't have to be like that.\" \"I don't date,\" I said slowly, realizing how true that was. That whole world seemed impossibly distant. \"Just as friends?\" he suggested. His clear blue eyes were not as eager now. I hoped he really meant that we could be friends anyway. \"That would be fun. But I actually have plans already this Friday, so maybe next week?\" \"What are you doing?\" he asked, less casually than I think he wanted to sound. \"Homework. I have a\u2026 study session planned with a friend.\" \"Oh. Okay. Maybe next week.\" He walked me to my car, less exuberant than before. It reminded me so clearly of my first months in Forks. I'd come full circle, and now everything felt like an echo\u2014an empty echo, devoid of the interest it used to have. The next night, Charlie didn't seem the smallest bit surprised to find Jacob and me sprawled across the living room floor with our books scattered around us, so I guessed that he and Billy were talking behind our backs. \"Hey, kids,\" he said, his eyes straying to the kitchen. The smell of the lasagna I'd spent the afternoon making\u2014while Jacob watched and occasionally sampled\u2014wafted down the hall; I was being good, trying to atone for all the pizza. Jacob stayed for dinner, and took a plate home for Billy. He grudgingly added another year to my negotiable age for being a good cook. Friday was the garage, and Saturday, after my shift at Newton's, was homework again. Charlie felt secure enough in my sanity to spend the day fishing with Harry. When he got back, we were all done\u2014feeling very sensible and mature about it, too\u2014and watching Monster Garage on the Discovery Channel. \"I probably ought to go.\" Jacob sighed. \"It's later than I thought.\" \"Okay, fine,\" I grumbled. \"I'll take you home.\" He laughed at my unwilling expression\u2014it seemed to please him. \"Tomorrow, back to work,\" I said as soon as we were safe in the truck. \"What time do you want me to come up?\" There was an unexplained excitement in his answering smile. \"I'll call you first, okay?\" \"Sure.\" I frowned to myself, wondering what was up. His smile widened. I cleaned the house the next morning\u2014waiting for Jacob to call and trying to shake off the Litest nightmare. The scenery had changed. Last night I'd wandered in a wide sea of ferns interspersed with huge hemlock trees. There was nothing else there, and I was lost, wandering aimless and alone, searching for nothing. I wanted to kick myself for the stupid field trip last week. I shoved the dream out of my conscious mind, hoping it would stay locked up somewhere and not escape again. Charlie was outside washing the cruiser, so when the phone rang, I dropped the toilet brush and ran downstairs to answer it. \"Hello?\" I asked breathlessly. \"Bella,\" Jacob said, a strange, formal tone to his voice. \"Hey, Jake.\" \"I believe that\u2026 we have a date\" he said, his tone thick with implications. It took me a second before I got it. \"They're done? I can't believe it!\" What perfect timing. I needed something to distract me from nightmares and nothingness. \"Yeah, they run and everything.\" \"Jacob, you are absolutely, without a doubt, the most talented and wonderful person I know. You get ten years for this one.\" \"Cool! I'm middle-aged now.\" I laughed. \"I'm on my way up!\" I threw the cleaning supplies under the bathroom counter and grabbed my jacket. \"Headed to see Jake,\" Charlie said when I ran past him. It wasn't really a question. \"Yep,\" I replied as I jumped in my truck. \"I'll be at the station later,\" Charlie called after me. \"Okay,\" I yelled back, turning the key. Charlie said something else, but I couldn't hear him clearly over the roar of the engine. It sounded sort of like, \"Where's the fire?\" I parked my truck off to the side of the Blacks' house, close to the trees, to make it easier for us to sneak the bikes out. When I got out, a splash of color caught my eye\u2014two shiny motorcycles, one red, one black, were hidden under a spruce, invisible from the house. Jacob was prepared. There was a piece of blue ribbon tied in a small bow around each of the handlebars. I was laughing at that when Jacob ran out of the house. \"Ready?\" he asked in a low voice, his eyes sparkling. I glanced over his shoulder, and there was no sign of Billy. \"Yeah,\" I said, but I didn't feel quite as excited as before; I was trying to imagine myself actually on the motorcycle. Jacob loaded the bikes into the bed of the truck with ease, laying them carefully on their sides so they didn't show. \"Let's go,\" he said, his voice higher than usual with excitement. \"I know the perfect spot\u2014no one will catch us there.\" We drove south out of town. The dirt road wove in and out of the forest\u2014sometimes there was nothing but trees, and then there would suddenly be a breathtaking glimpse of the Pacific Ocean, reaching to the horizon, dark gray under the clouds. We were above the shore, on top of the cliffs that bordered the beach here and the view seemed to stretch on forever. I was driving slowly, so that I could safely stare out across the ocean now and then, as the road wound closer to the sea cliffs. Jacob was talking about finishing the bikes, but his descriptions were getting technical, so I wasn't paying close attention. That was when I noticed four figures standing on a rocky ledge, much too close to the precipice. I couldn't tell from the distance how old they were, but I assumed they were men. Despite the chill in the air today, they seemed to be wearing only shorts. As I watched, the tallest person stepped closer to the brink. I slowed automatically, my foot hesitating over the brake pedal. And then he threw himself off the edge. \"No!\" I shouted, stomping down on the brake. \"What's wrong?\" Jacob shouted back, alarmed.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \"That guy\u2014he just jumped off the cliff! Why didn't they stop him? We've got to call an ambulance!\" I threw open my door and started to get out, which made no sense at all. The fastest way to a phone was to drive back to Billy's. But I couldn't believe what I'd just seen. Maybe, subconsciously, I hoped I would see something different without the glass of the windshield in the way. Jacob laughed, and I spun to stare at him wildly. How could he be so calloused, so cold-blooded? \"They're just cliff diving, Bella. Recreation. La Push doesn't have a mall, you know.\" He was teasing, but there was a strange note of irritation in his voice. \"Cliff diving?\" I repeated, dazed. I stared in disbelief as a second figure stepped to the edge, paused, and then very gracefully leaped into space. He fell for what seemed like an eternity to me, finally cutting smoothly into the dark gray waves below. \"Wow. It's so high.\" I slid back into my seat, still staring wide-eyed at the two remaining divers. \"It must be a hundred feet.\" \"Well, yeah, most of us jump from lower down, that rock that juts out from the cliff about halfway.\" He pointed out his window. The place he indicated did seem much more reasonable. \"Those guys are insane. Probably showing off how tough they are. I mean, really, it's freezing today. That water can't feel good.\" He made a disgruntled face, as if the stunt personally offended him. It surprised me a little. I would have thought Jacob was nearly impossible to upset. \"You jump off the cliff?\" I hadn't missed the \"us.\" \"Sure, sure.\" He shrugged and grinned. \"It's fun. A little scary, kind of a rush.\" I looked back at the cliffs, where the third figure was pacing the edge. I'd never witnessed anything so reckless in all my life. My eyes widened, and I smiled. \"Jake, you have to take me cliff diving.\" He frowned back at me, his face disapproving. \"Bella, you just wanted to call an ambulance for Sam,\" he reminded me. I was surprised that he could tell who it was from this distance. \"I want to try,\" I insisted, start ing to get out of the car again. Jacob grabbed my wrist. \"Not today, all right? Can we at least wait for a warmer day?\" \"Okay, fine,\" I agreed. With the door open, the glacial breeze was raising goose bumps on my arm. \"But I want to go soon.\" \"Soon.\" He rolled his eyes. \"Sometimes you're a little strange, Bella. Do you know that?\" I sighed. \"Yes.\" \"And we're not jumping off the top.\" I watched, fascinated, as the third boy made a running start and flung himself farther into the empty air than the other two. He twisted and cart wheeled through space as he fell, like he was skydiving. He looked absolutely free\u2014 unthinking and utterly irresponsible. \"Fine,\" I agreed. \"Not the first time, anyway.\" Now Jacob sighed. \"Are we going to try out the bikes or not?\" he demanded. \"Okay, okay,\" I said, tearing my eyes away from the last person waiting on the cliff. I put my seat belt back on and closed the door. The engine was still running, roaring as it idled. We started down the road again. \"So who were those guys\u2014the crazy ones?\" I wondered. He made a disgusted sound in the back of his throat. \"The La Push gang.\" \"You have a gang?\" I asked. I realized that I sounded impressed. He laughed once at my reaction. \"Not like that. I swear, they're like hall monitors gone bad. They don't start fights, they keep the peace.\" He snorted. \"There was this guy from up somewhere by the Makah rez, big guy too, scary-looking. Well, word got around that he was selling meth to kids, and Sam Uley and his disciples ran him off our land. They're all about our land, and tribe pride\u2026 it's getting ridiculous. The worst part is that the council takes them seriously. Embry said that the council actually meets with Sam.\" He shook his head, face full of resentment. \"Embry also heard from Leah Clearwater that they call themselves 'protectors' or something like that.\" Jacob's hands were clenched into fists, as if he'd like to hit something. I'd never seen this side of him.  I was surprised to hear Sam Uley's name. I didn't want it to bring back the images from my nightmare, so I made a quick observation to distract myself. \"You don't like them very much.\" \"Does it show?\" he asked sarcastically. \"Well\u2026 It doesn't sound like they're doing anything bad.\" I tried to soothe him, to make him cheerful again. \"Just sort of annoyingly goody-two-shoes for a gang.\" \u201cYeah. Annoying is a good word. They're always showing off\u2014like the cliff thing. They act like\u2026 like, I don't know. Like tough guys. I was hanging out at the store with Embry and Quil once, last semester, and Sam came by with his followers, Jared and Paul. Quil said something, you know how he's got a big mouth, and it pissed Paul off. His eyes got all dark, and he sort of smiled\u2014no, he showed his teeth but he didn't smile\u2014and it was like he was so mad he was shaking or something. But Sam put his hand against Paul's chest and shook his head. Paul looked at him for a minute and calmed down. Honestly, it was like Sam was holding him back\u2014like Paul was going to tear us up if Sam didn't stop him.\" He groaned. \"Like a bad western. You know, Sam's a pretty big guy, he's twenty. But Paul's just sixteen, too, shorter than me and not as beefy as Quil. I think any one of us could take him.\" \"Tough guys,\" I agreed. I could see it in my head as he described it, and it reminded me of something\u2026 a trio of tall, dark men standing very still and close together in my father's living room. The picture was sideways, because my head was lying against the couch while Dr. Gerandy and Charlie leaned over me\u2026 Had that been Sam's gang? I spoke quickly again to divert myself from the bleak memories. \"Isn't Sam a little too old for this kind of thing?\" \"Yeah. He was supposed to go to college, but he stayed. And no one gave him any crap about it, either.\u00a0 The whole council pitched a fit when my sister turned down a partial scholarship and got married. But, oh no, Sam Uley can do no wrong.\" His face was set in unfamiliar lines of outrage\u2014outrage and something else I didn't recognize at first. \"It all sounds really annoying and\u2026 strange. But I don't get why you're taking it so personally.\" I peeked over at his face, hoping I hadn't offended him. He was suddenly calm, staring out the side window. \"You just missed the turn,\" he said in an even voice. I executed a very wide U-turn, nearly hitting a tree as my circle ran the truck halfway off the road. \"Thanks for the heads-up,\" I muttered as I started up the side road. \"Sorry, I wasn't paying attention.\" It was quiet for a brief minute. \"You can stop anywhere along here,\" he said softly. I pulled over and cut the engine. My ears rang in the silence that followed. We both got out, and Jacob headed around to the back to get the bikes. I tried to read his expression. Something more was bothering him. I'd hit a nerve. He smiled halfheartedly as he pushed the red bike to my side. \"Happy late birthday. Are you ready for this?\" \"I think so.\" The bike suddenly looked intimidating, frightening, as I realized I would soon be astride it. \"We'll take it slow,\" he promised. I <em>gingerly</em> leaned the motorcycle against the truck's fender while he went to get his. \"Jake\u2026\"I hesitated as he came back around the truck. \"Yeah?\" \"What's really bothering you? About the Sam thing, I mean? Is there something else?\" I watched his face. He grimaced, but he didn't seem angry. He looked at the dirt and kicked his shoe against the front tire of his bike again and again, like he was keeping time. He sighed. \"It's just\u2026 the way they treat me. It creeps me out.\" The words started to rush out now. \"You know, the council is supposed to be made up of equals, but if there was a leader, it would be my dad. I've never been able to figure out why people treat him the way they do. Why his opinion counts the most. It's got something to do with his father and his father's father. My great-grandpa, Ephraim Black, was sort of the last chief we had, and they still listen to Billy, maybe because of that.\u201d  \"But I'm just like everyone else. Nobody treats me special\u2026 until now.\" That caught me off guard. \"Sam treats you special?\" \"Yeah,\" he agreed, looking up at me with troubled eyes. \"He looks at me like he's waiting for something\u2026 like I'm going to join his stupid gang someday. He pays more attention to me than any of the other guys. I hate it.\" \"You don't have to join anything.\" My voice was angry. This was really upsetting Jacob, and that infuriated me. Who did these \"protectors\" think they were? \"Yeah.\" His foot kept up its rhythm against the tire. \"What?\" I could tell there was more.  He frowned, his eyebrows pulling up in a way that looked sad and worried rather than angry. \"It's Embry. He's been avoiding me lately.\" The thoughts didn't seem connected, but I wondered if I was to blame for the problems with his friend. \"You've been hanging out with me a lot,\" I reminded him, feeling selfish. I'd been monopolizing him. \"No, that's not it. It's not just me\u2014it's Quil, too, and everyone. Embry missed a week of school, but he was never home when we tried to see him. And when he came back, he looked\u2026 he looked freaked out. Terrified. Quil and I both tried to get him to tell us what was wrong, but he wouldn't talk to either one of us.\" I stared at Jacob, biting my lip anxiously\u2014he was really frightened. But he didn't look at me. He watched his own foot kicking the rubber as if it belonged to someone else. The tempo increased. \"Then this week, out of nowhere, Embry's hanging out with Sam and the rest of them. He was out on the cliffs today.\" His voice was low and tense. He finally looked at me. \"Bella, they bugged him even more than they bother me. He didn't want anything to do with them. And now Embry's following Sam around like he's joined a cult. \"And that's the way it was with Paul. Just exactly the same. He wasn't friends with Sam at all. Then he stopped coming to school for a few weeks, and, when he came back, suddenly Sam owned him. I don't know what it means. I can't figure it out, and I feel like I have to, because Embry's my friend and\u2026 Sam's looking at me funny.. and\u2026\" He trailed off. \"Have you talked to Billy about this?\" I asked. His horror was spreading to me. I had chills running on the back of my neck. Now there was anger on his face. \"Yes,\" he snorted. \"That was helpful.\" \"What did he say?\" Jacob's expression was sarcastic, and when he spoke, his voice mocked the deep tones of his father's voice. \"It's nothing you need to worry about now, Jacob. In a few years, if you don't\u2026 well, I'll explain later.\" And then his voice was his own. \"What am I supposed to get from that? Is he trying to say it's some stupid puberty, coming-of-age thing? This is something else. Something wrong.\" He was biting his lower lip and clenching his hands. He looked like he was about to cry. I threw my arms around him instinctively, wrapping them around his waist and pressing my face against his chest. He was so big, I felt like I was a child hugging a grown-up. \"Oh, Jake, it'll be okay!\" I promised. \"If it gets worse you can come live with me and Charlie. Don't be scared, we'll think of something!\" He was frozen for a second, and then his long arms wrapped hesitantly around me. \"Thanks, Bella.\" His voice was huskier than usual. We stood like that for a moment, and it didn't upset me; in fact, I felt comforted by the contact. This didn't feel anything like the last time someone had embraced me this way. This was friendship. And Jacob was very warm. It was strange for me, being this close\u2014emotionally rather than physically, though the physical was strange for me, too\u2014to another human being. It wasn't my usual style. I didn't normally relate to people so easily, on such a basic level. Not human beings. \"If this is how you're going to react, I'll freak out more often.\" Jacob's voice was light, normal again, and his laughter rumbled against my ear. His fingers touched my hair, soft and tentative. Well, it was friendship for me. I pulled away quickly, laughing with him, but determined to put things back in perspective at once. \"It's hard to believe I'm two years older than you,\" I said, emphasizing the word older. \"You make me feel like a dwarf.\" Standing this close to him, I really had to crane my neck to see his face. \"You're forgetting I'm in my forties, of course.\" \"Oh, that's right.\" He patted my head. \"You're like a little doll,\" he teased. \"A porcelain doll.\" I rolled my eyes, taking another step away. \"Let's not start with the albino cracks.\" \"Seriously, Bella, are you sure you're not?\" He stretched his russet arm out next to mine. The difference wasn't flattering. \"I've never seen anyone paler than you\u2026 well, except for\u2014\" He broke off, and I looked away, trying to not understand what he had been about to say. \"So are we going to ride or what?\" \"Let's do it,\" I agreed, more enthusiastic than I would have been half a minute ago. His unfinished sentence reminded me of why I was here.",

            "en": "Father was in the army all through the war\u2014the first war, I mean-so, up to the age of five, I never saw much of him, and what I saw did not worry me. Sometimes I woke and there was a big figure in khaki peering down at me in the candlelight. Sometimes in the early morning I heard the slamming of the front door and the clatter of nailed boots down the cobbles of the lane. These were Father\u2019s exits and entrances. Like Santa Claus he came and went mysteriously. In fact, I rather liked his visits, though it was an uncomfortable squeeze between Mother and him when I got into the big bed in the early morning. He smoked, which gave him a pleasant musty smell, and shaved, an operation of astounding interest. Each time he left a trail of souvenirs\u2014model tanks and Gurkha knives with handles made of bullet cases, and German helmets and cap badges and buttonsticks, and all sorts of military equipment\u2014carefully stored away in a long box on top of the wardrobe, in case they ever came in handy. There was a bit of the magpie about Father; he expected everything to come in handy. When his back was turned, Mother let me get a chair and rummage through his treasures. She didn\u2019t seem to think so highly of them as he did. The war was the most peaceful period of my life. The window of my attic faced southeast. My mother had curtained it, but that had small effect. I always woke with the first light and, with all the responsibilities of the previous day melted, feeling myself rather like the sun, ready to illuminate and rejoice. Life never seemed so simple and clear and full of possibilities as then. I put my feet out from under the clothes\u2014I called them Mrs. Left and Mrs. Right\u2014and invented dramatic situations for them in which they discussed the problems of the day. At least Mrs. Right did; she was very demonstrative, but I had not the same control of Mrs. Left, so she mostly contented herself with nodding agreement. They discussed what Mother and I should do during the day, what Santa Claus should give a fellow for Christmas, and what steps should be taken to brighten the home. There was that little matter of the baby, for instance. Mother and I could never agree about that. Ours was the only house in the terrace without a new baby, and Mother said we couldn\u2019t afford one till Father came back from the war because they cost seventeen and six. That showed how simple she was. The Geneys up the road had a baby, and everyone knew they couldn\u2019t afford seventeen and six. It was probably a cheap baby, and Mother wanted something really good, but I felt she was too exclusive. The Geneys\u2019 baby would have done us fine. Having settled my plans for the day, I got up, put a chair under the attic window, and lifted the frame high enough to stick out my head. The window overlooked the front gardens of the terrace behind ours, and beyond these it looked over a deep valley to the tall, red-brick houses terraced up the opposite hillside, which were all still in shadow, while those at our side of the valley were all lit up, though with long strange shadows that made them seem unfamiliar; rigid and painted. After that I went into Mother\u2019s room and climbed into the big bed. She woke and I began to tell her of my schemes. By this time, though I never seem to have noticed it, I was petrified in my nightshirt, and I thawed as I talked until, the last frost melted, I fell asleep beside her and woke again only when I heard her below in the kitchen, making the breakfast. After breakfast we went into town; heard Mass at St. Augustine\u2019s and said a prayer for Father, and did the shopping. If the afternoon is fine we either went for a walk in the country or a visit to Mother\u2019s great friend in the convent, Mother St. Dominic. Mother had them all praying for father, and every night, going to bed, I asked God to send him back safe from the war to us. Little, indeed, did I know what I was praying for! One morning, I got into the big bed, and there, sure enough, was Father in his usual Santa Claus manner, but later, instead of uniform, he put on his best blue suit, and Mother was as pleased as anything. I saw nothing to be pleased about, because, out of uniform, Father was altogether less interesting, but she only beamed, and explained that our prayers had been answered, and off we went to Mass to thank God for having brought Father safely home. The irony of it! That very day when he came in to dinner he took off his boots and put on his slippers, donned the dirty old cap he wore about the house to save him from colds, crossed his legs, and began to talk gravely to Mother, who looked anxious. Naturally, I disliked her looking anxious, because it destroyed her good looks, so I interrupted him. \u00a0\u201cJust a moment, Larry!\u201d she said gently. This was only what she said when we had boring visitors, so I attached no importance to it and went on talking. \u00a0\u201cDo be quiet, Larry!\u201d she said impatiently. \u201cDon\u2019t you hear me talking to Daddy?\u201d This was the first time I had heard those ominous words, \u201ctalking to Daddy,\u201d and I couldn\u2019t help feeling that if this was how God answers prayers, he couldn\u2019t listen to them very attentively. \u00a0\u201cWhy are you talking to Daddy?\u201d I asked with as great show of indifference as I could muster. \u00a0\u201cBecause Daddy and I have business to discuss. Now, don\u2019t interrupt again!\u201d In the afternoon, at Mother\u2019s request, Father took me for a walk. This time we went into town instead of out the country, and I thought at first, in my usual optimistic way, that it might be an improvement. It was nothing of the sort. Father and I had quite different notions of a walk in town. He had no proper interest in trams, ships, and horses, and the only thing that seemed to divert him was talking to fellows as old as himself. When I wanted to stop he simply went on, dragging me behind him by the hand; when he wanted to stop I had no alternative but to do the same. I noticed that it seemed to be a sign that he wanted to stop for a long time whenever he leaned against a wall. The second time I saw him do it I got wild. He seemed to be settling himself forever. I pulled him by the coat and trousers, but, unlike Mother who, if you were too persistent, got into a wax and said: \u201cLarry if you don\u2019t behave yourself, I\u2019ll give you a good slap,\u201d Father had an extraordinary capacity for amiable inattention. I sized him up and wondered would I cry, but he seemed to be too remote to be annoyed even by that. Really, it was like going for a walk with a mountain! He either ignored the wrenching and pummeling entirely, or else glanced down with a grin of amusement from his peak. I had never met anyone so absorbed in himself as he seemed. At teatime, \u201ctalking to Daddy\u201d began again, complicated this time by the fact that he had an evening paper, and every few minutes he put it down and told Mother something new out of it. I felt this was foul play. Man for man, I was prepared to compete with him any time for Mother\u2019s attention, but when he had it all made up for him by other people it left me no chance. Several times I tried to change the subject without success. \u00a0\u201cYou must be quiet while Daddy is reading, Larry,\u201d Mother said impatiently. It was clear that she either genuinely liked talking to Father better than talking to me, or else he had some terrible hold on her which made her afraid to admit the truth. \u201cMummy,\u201d I said that night when she was tucking me up, \u201cdo you think that if I prayed hard God would send Daddy back to war?\u201d She seemed to think about that for a moment. \u201cNo, dear,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cI don\u2019t think he would. \u201c \u00a0\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t he, Mummy?\u201d \u201cBecause there isn\u2019t a war any longer, dear. \u201c \u00a0\u201cBut, Mummy, couldn\u2019t God make another war, if He liked?\u201d \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t like to, dear. It\u2019s not God who makes wars, but bad people. \u201c \u00a0\u201cOh!\u201d I said. I was disappointed about that. I began to think that God wasn\u2019t quite what he was cracked up to be. Next morning I woke at my usual hour, feeling like a bottle of champagne. I put out my feet and invented a long conversation in which Mrs. Right talked of the trouble she had with her own father till she put him in the Home. I didn\u2019t quite know what the Home was but it sounded the right place for Father. Then I got my chair and stuck my head out of the attic window. Dawn was just breaking, with a guilty air that made me feel I had caught it in the act. My head bursting with stories and schemes, I stumbled in next door, and in the half-darkness scrambled into the big bed. There was no room at Mother\u2019s side so I had to get between her and Father. For the time being I had forgotten about him, and for several minutes I sat bolt upright, racking my brains to know what I could do with him. He was taking up more than his fair share of the bed, and I couldn\u2019t get comfortable, so I gave him several kicks that made him grunt and stretch. He made room all right, though. Mother waked and felt for me. I settled back comfortably in the warmth of the bed with my thumb in my mouth. \u201cMummy!\u201d I hummed, loudly and contentedly. \u201cSssh! dear,\u201d she whispered. \u201cDon\u2019t wake Daddy!\u201d This was a new development, which threatened to be more serious than \u201ctalking to Daddy. \u201d Life without my early-morning conferences was unthinkable. \u201cWhy?\u201d I asked severely. \u00a0\u201cBecause poor Daddy is tired. \u201c This seemed to me a quite inadequate reason, and I was sickened by the sentimentality of her \u201cpoor Daddy. \u201d I never liked that sort of gush; it always struck me as insincere. \u201cOh!\u201d I said lightly. Then in my most winning tone: \u201cDo you know where I want to go with you today, Mummy?\u201d \u00a0\u201cNo, dear,\u201d she sighed. \u201cI want to go down the Glen and fish for thornybacks with my new net, and then I want to go out to the Fox and Hounds, and\u2014\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t-wake-Daddy!\u201d she hissed angrily, clapping her hand across my mouth. But it was too late. He was awake, or nearly so. He grunted and reached for the matches. Then he stared incredulously at his watch. \u201cLike a cup of tea, dear?\u201d asked Mother in a meek, hushed voice I had never heard her use before. It sounded almost as though she were afraid. \u201cTea?\u201d he exclaimed indignantly. \u201cDo you know what the time is?\u201d \u00a0\u201cAnd after that I want to go up the Rathcooney Road,\u201d I said loudly, afraid I\u2019d forget something in all those interruptions. \u201cGo to sleep at once, Larry!\u201d she said sharply. I began to snivel. I couldn\u2019t concentrate, the way that pair went on, and smothering my early-morning schemes was like burying a family from the cradle. Father said nothing, but lit his pipe and sucked it, looking out into the shadows without minding Mother or me. I knew he was mad. Every time I made a remark Mother hushed me irritably. I was mortified. I felt it wasn\u2019t fair; there was even something sinister in it. Every time I had pointed out to her the waste of making up two beds when we could both sleep in one, she had told me it was healthier like that, and now here was this man, this stranger, sleeping with her without the least regard for her health! He got up early and made tea, but though he brought Mother a cup he brought none for me. \u00a0\u201cMummy,\u201d I shouted, \u201cI want a cup of tea, too. \u201c \u201cYes, dear,\u201d she said patiently. \u201cYou can drink from Mummy\u2019s saucer. \u201c That settled it. Either Father or I would have to leave the house. I didn\u2019t want to drink from Mother\u2019s saucer; I wanted to be treated as an equal in my own home, so, just to spite her, I drank it all and left none for her. She took that quietly, too. But that night while she was putting me to bed she said gently: \u00a0\u201cLarry, I want you to promise me something. \u201c \u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked. \u201cNot to come in and disturb poor Daddy in the morning. Promise?\u201d \u00a0\u201cPoor Daddy\u201d again! I was becoming suspicious of everything involving that quite impossible man. \u201cWhy?\u201d I asked. \u201cBecause poor Daddy is worried and tired and he doesn\u2019t sleep well. \u201c \u00a0\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he, Mummy?\u201d \u201cWell, you know, don\u2019t you, that while he was at the war Mummy got the pennies from the Post Office?\u201d \u201cFrom Miss MacCarthy?\u201d \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s right. But now, you see, Miss MacCarthy hasn\u2019t anymore pennies, so Daddy must go out and find us some. You know what would happen if he couldn\u2019t?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I said, \u201ctell us. \u201c \u201cWell, I think we might have to go out and beg for them like the poor old woman on Fridays. We wouldn\u2019t like that, would we?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I agreed. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t. \u201c \u00a0\u201cSo you\u2019ll promise not to come in and wake him?\u201d \u201cPromise. \u201c Mind you, I meant that. I knew pennies were a serious matter, and I was all against having to go out and beg like the old woman on Fridays. Mother laid out all my toys in a complete ring round the bed so that, whatever way I got out, I was bound to fall over one of them. When I woke I remembered my promise all right. I got up and sat on the floor and played\u2014for hours, it seemed to me. Then I got my chair and looked out the attic window for more hours. I wished it was time for Father to wake; I wished someone would make me a cup of tea. I didn\u2019t feel in the least like the sun; instead, I was bored and so very, very cold! I simply longed for the warmth and depth of the big featherbed. At last I could stand it no longer. I went into the next room. As there was still no room at Mother\u2019s side I climbed over her and she woke with a start. \u201cLarry,\u201d she whispered, gripping my arms very tightly, \u201cwhat did you promise?\u201d \u201cBut I did, Mummy,\u201d I wailed, caught in the very act. \u201cI was quiet for ever so long. \u201c \u00a0\u201cOh, dear, and you\u2019re perished!\u201d she said sadly, feeling me all over. \u201cNow if I let you stay will you promise not to talk?\u201d \u201cBut I want to talk, Mummy,\u201d I wailed. \u201cThat has nothing to do with it,\u201d she said with a firmness that was new to me. \u201cDaddy wants to sleep. Now, do you understand that?\u201d I understood it only too well. I wanted to talk, he wanted to sleep\u2014whose house was it, anyway? \u201cMummy,\u201d I said with equal firmness, \u201cI think it would be healthier for Daddy to sleep in his own bed. \u201c That seemed to stagger her, because she said nothing for a while. \u00a0\u201cNow, once for all,\u201d she went on, \u201cyou\u2019re to be perfectly quiet or go back to your own bed. Which is it to be?\u201d The injustice of it got me down. I had convicted her out of her own mouth of inconsistency and unreasonableness, and she hadn\u2019t even attempted to reply. Full of spite, I gave Father a kick, which she didn\u2019t notice but which made him grunt and open his eyes in alarm. \u00a0\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d he asked in a panic-stricken voice, not looking at Mother but at the door, as if he saw someone there. \u201cIt\u2019s early yet,\u201d she replied soothingly. \u201cIt\u2019s only the child. Go to sleep again. Now, Larry,\u201d she added, getting out of bed, \u201cyou\u2019ve wakened Daddy and you must go back. \u201c This time, for all her quiet air, I knew she meant it, and knew that my principal rights and privileges were as good as lost unless I asserted them at once. As she lifted me, I gave a screech, enough to wake the dead, not to mind Father. He groaned. \u201cThat damn child! Doesn\u2019t he ever sleep?\u201d \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s only a habit, dear,\u201d she said quietly, though I could see she was vexed. \u201cWell, it\u2019s time he got out of it,\u201d shouted Father, beginning to heave in the bed. He suddenly gathered all the bedclothes about him, turned to the wall, and then looked back over his shoulder with nothing showing only two small, spiteful, dark eyes. The man looked very wicked. To open the bedroom door, Mother had to let me down, and I broke free and dashed for the farthest corner, screeching. Father sat bolt upright in bed. \u201cShut up, you little puppy!\u201d he said in a choking voice. I was so astonished that I stopped screeching. Never, never had anyone spoken to me in that tone before. I looked at him incredulously and saw his face convulsed with rage. It was only then that I fully realized how God had codded me, listening to my prayers for the safe return of this monster. \u00a0\u201cShut up, you!\u201d I bawled, beside myself. \u201cWhat\u2019s that you said?\u201d shouted Father, making a wild leap out of the bed. \u201cMick, Mick!\u201d cried Mother. \u201cDon\u2019t you see the child isn\u2019t used to you?\u201d \u00a0\u201cI see he\u2019s better fed than taught,\u201d snarled Father, waving his arms wildly. \u201cHe wants his bottom smacked. \u201c All his previous shouting was as nothing to these obscene words referring to my person. They really made my blood boil. \u201cSmack your own!\u201d I screamed hysterically. \u201cSmack your own! Shut up! Shut up!\u201d At this he lost his patience and let fly at me. He did it with the lack of conviction you\u2019d expect of a man under Mother\u2019s horrified eyes, and it ended up as a mere tap, but the sheer indignity of being struck at all by a stranger, a total stranger who had cajoled his way back from the war into our big bed as a result of my innocent intercession, made me completely dotty. I shrieked and shrieked, and danced in my bare feet, and Father, looking awkward and hairy in nothing but a short gray army shirt, glared down at me like a mountain out for murder. I think it must have been then that I realized he was jealous too. And there stood Mother in her nightdress, looking as if her heart was broken between us. I hoped she felt as she looked. It seemed to me that she deserved it all. From that morning out my life was a hell. Father and I were enemies, open and avowed. We conducted a series of skirmishes against one another, he trying to steal my time with Mother and I his. When she was sitting on my bed, telling me a story, he took to looking for some pair of old boots which he alleged he had left behind him at the beginning of the war. While he talked to Mother I played loudly with my toys to show my total lack of concern. He created a terrible scene one evening when he came in from work and found me at his box, playing with his regimental badges, Gurkha knives and button-sticks. Mother got up and took the box from me. \u00a0\u201cYou mustn\u2019t play with Daddy\u2019s toys unless he lets you, Larry,\u201d she said severely. \u201cDaddy doesn\u2019t play with yours. \u201c For some reason Father looked at her as if she had struck him and then turned away with a scowl. \u201cThose are not toys,\u201d he growled, taking down the box again to see had I lifted anything. \u201cSome of those curios are very rare and valuable. \u201c But as time went on I saw more and more how he managed to alienate Mother and me. What made it worse was that I couldn\u2019t grasp his method or see what attraction he had for Mother. In every possible way he was less winning than I. He had a common accent and made noises at his tea. I thought for a while that it might be the newspapers she was interested in, so I made up bits of news of my own to read to her. Then I thought it might be the smoking, which I personally thought attractive, and took his pipes and went round the house dribbling into them till he caught me. I even made noises at my tea, but Mother only told me I was disgusting. It all seemed to hinge round that unhealthy habit of sleeping together, so I made a point of dropping into their bedroom and nosing around, talking to myself, so that they wouldn\u2019t know I was watching them, but they were never up to anything that I could see. In the end it beat me. It seemed to depend on being grown-up and giving people rings, and I realized I\u2019d have to wait. But at the same time I wanted him to see that I was only waiting, not giving up the fight. One evening when he was being particularly obnoxious, chattering away well above my head, I let him have it. \u201cMummy,\u201d I said, \u201cdo you know what I\u2019m going to do when I grow up?\u201d \u201cNo, dear,\u201d she replied. \u201cWhat?\u201d \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m going to marry you,\u201d I said quietly. Father gave a great guffaw out of him, but he didn\u2019t take me in. I knew it must be only pretense. And Mother, in spite of everything, was pleased. I felt she was probably relieved to know that one day Father\u2019s hold on her would be broken. \u00a0\u201cWon\u2019t that be nice?\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cIt\u2019ll be very nice,\u201d I said confidently. \u201cBecause we\u2019re going to have lots and lots of babies. \u201c \u201cThat\u2019s right, dear,\u201d she said placidly. \u201cI think we\u2019ll have one soon, and then you\u2019ll have plenty of company. \u201c I was no end pleased about that because it showed that in spite of the way she gave in to Father she still considered my wishes. Besides, it would put the Geneys in their place. It didn\u2019t turn out like that, though. To begin with, she was very preoccupied\u2014I supposed about where she would get the seventeen and six\u2014and though Father took to staying out late in the evenings it did me no particular good. She stopped taking me for walks, became as touchy as blazes, and smacked me for nothing at all. Sometimes I wished I\u2019d never mentioned the confounded baby\u2014I seemed to have a genius for bringing calamity on myself. And calamity it was! Sonny arrived in the most appalling hullabaloo\u2014even that much he couldn\u2019t do without a fuss\u2014and from the first moment I disliked him. He was a difficult child\u2014so far as I was concerned he was always difficult\u2014and demanded far too much attention. Mother was simply silly about him, and couldn\u2019t see when he was only showing off. As company he was worse than useless. He slept all day, and I had to go round the house on tiptoe to avoid waking him. It wasn\u2019t any longer a question of not waking Father. The slogan now was \u201cDon\u2019t-wake-Sonny! I couldn\u2019t understand why the child wouldn\u2019t sleep at the proper time, so whenever Mother\u2019s back was turned I woke him. Sometimes to keep him awake I pinched him as well. Mother caught me at it one day and gave me a most unmerciful flaking. One evening, when Father was coming in from work, I was playing trains in the front garden. I let on not to notice him; instead I pretended to be talking to myself, and said in a loud voice: \u201cIf another bloody baby comes into this house, I\u2019m going out. \u201c Father stopped dead and looked at me over his shoulder. \u201cWhat\u2019s that you said?\u201d he asked sternly. I was only talking to myself,\u201d I replied, trying to conceal my panic. \u201cIt\u2019s private. \u201c He turned and went in without a word. Mind you, I intended it as a solemn warning, but its effect was quite different. Father started being quite nice to me. I could understand that, of course. Mother was quite sickening about Sonny. Even at mealtimes she\u2019d get up and gawk at him in the cradle with an idiotic smile, and tell Father to do the same. He was always polite about it, but he looked so puzzled you could see he didn\u2019t know what she was talking about. He complained of the way Sonny cried at night, but she only got cross and said that Sonny never cried except when there was something up with him\u2014which was a flaming lie, because Sonny never had anything up with him, and only cried for attention. It was really painful to see how simple-minded she was. Father wasn\u2019t attractive, but he had a fine intelligence. He saw through Sonny, and now he knew that I saw through him as well. One night I woke with a start. There was someone beside me in bed. For one wild moment I felt sure it must be Mother, having come to her senses and left Father for good, but then I heard Sonny in convulsions in the next room, and Mother saying: \u201cThere! There! There!\u201d and I knew it wasn\u2019t she. It was Father. He was lying beside me, wide awake, breathing hard and apparently as mad as hell. After a while it came to me what he was mad about. It was his turn now. After turning me out of the big bed, he had been turned out himself. Mother had no consideration now for anyone but that poisonous pup, Sonny. I couldn\u2019t help feeling sorry for Father. I had been through it all myself, and even at that age I was magnanimous. I began to stroke him down and say: \u201cThere! There!\u201d He wasn\u2019t exactly responsive. \u00a0\u201cAren\u2019t you asleep either?\u201d he snarled. \u201cAh, come on and put your arm around us, can\u2019t you?\u201d I said, and he did, in a sort of way. <em>Gingerly</em>, I suppose, is how you\u2019d describe it. He was very bony but better than nothing. At Christmas he went out of his way to buy me a really nice model railway.",

            "en": "5          5. BLOOD TYPE I made my way to English in a daze. I didn't even realize when I first walked in that class had already started. \"Thank you for joining us, Miss Swan,\" Mr. Mason said in a disparaging tone. I flushed and hurried to my seat. It wasn't till class ended that I realized Mike wasn't sitting in his usual seat next to me. I felt a twinge of guilt. But he and Eric both met me at the door as usual, so I figured I wasn't totally unforgiven. Mike seemed to become more himself as we walked, gaining enthusiasm as he talked about the weather report for this weekend. The rain was supposed to take a minor break, and so maybe his beach trip would be possible. I tried to sound eager, to make up for disappointing him yesterday. It was hard; rain or no rain, it would still only be in the high forties, if we were lucky. The rest of the morning passed in a blur. It was difficult to believe that I hadn't just imagined what Edward had said, and the way his eyes had looked. Maybe it was just a very convincing dream that I'd confused with reality. That seemed more probable than that I really appealed to him on any level. So I was impatient and frightened as Jessica and I entered the cafeteria. I wanted to see his face, to see if he'd gone back to the cold, indifferent person I'd known for the last several weeks. Or if, by some miracle, I'd really heard what I thought I'd heard this morning. Jessica babbled on and on about her dance plans \u2014 Lauren and Angela had asked the other boys and they were all going together \u2014 completely unaware of my inattention. Disappointment flooded through me as my eyes unerringly focused on his table. The other four were there, but he was absent. Had he gone home? I followed the still-babbling Jessica through the line, crushed. I'd lost my appetite \u2014 I bought nothing but a bottle of lemonade. I just wanted to go sit down and sulk. \"Edward Cullen is staring at you again,\" Jessica said, finally breaking through my abstraction with his name. \"I wonder why he's sitting alone today.\" My head snapped up. I followed her gaze to see Edward, smiling crookedly, staring at me from an empty table across the cafeteria from where he usually sat. Once he'd caught my eye, he raised one hand and motioned with his index finger for me to join him. As I stared in disbelief, he winked. \"Does he mean you?\" Jessica asked with insulting astonishment in her voice. \"Maybe he needs help with his Biology homework,\" I muttered for her benefit. \"Um, I'd better go see what he wants.\" I could feel her staring after me as I walked away. When I reached his table, I stood behind the chair across from him, unsure. \"Why don't you sit with me today?\" he asked, smiling. I sat down automatically, watching him with caution. He was still smiling. It was hard to believe that someone so beautiful could be real. I was afraid that he might disappear in a sudden puff of smoke, and I would wake up. He seemed to be waiting for me to say something. \"This is different,\" I finally managed. \"Well\u2026\" He paused, and then the rest of the words followed in a rush. \"I decided as long as I was going to hell, I might as well do it thoroughly.\" I waited for him to say something that made sense. The seconds ticked by. \"You know I don't have any idea what you mean,\" I eventually pointed out. \"I know.\" He smiled again, and then he changed the subject. \"I think your friends are angry with me for stealing you.\" \"They'll survive.\" I could feel their stares boring into my back. \"I may not give you back, though,\" he said with a wicked glint in his eyes. I gulped. He laughed. \"You look worried.\" \"No,\" I said, but, ridiculously, my voice broke. \"Surprised, actually\u2026 what brought all this on?\" \"I told you \u2014 I got tired of trying to stay away from you. So I'm giving up.\" He was still smiling, but his ocher eyes were serious. \"Giving up?\" I repeated in confusion. \"Yes \u2014 giving up trying to be good. I'm just going to do what I want now, and let the chips fall where they may.\" His smile faded as he explained, and a hard edge crept into his voice. \"You lost me again.\" The breathtaking crooked smile reappeared. \"I always say too much when I'm talking to you \u2014 that's one of the problems.\" \"Don't worry \u2014 I don't understand any of it,\" I said wryly. \"I'm counting on that.\" \"So, in plain English, are we friends now?\" \"Friends\u2026\" he mused, dubious. \"Or not,\" I muttered. He grinned. \"Well, we can try, I suppose. But I'm warning you now that I'm not a good friend for you.\" Behind his smile, the warning was real.  \"You say that a lot,\" I noted, trying to ignore the sudden trembling in my stomach and keep my voice even. \"Yes, because you're not listening to me. I'm still waiting for you to believe it. If you're smart, you'll avoid me.\" \"I think you've made your opinion on the subject of my intellect clear, too.\" My eyes narrowed. He smiled apologetically. \"So, as long as I'm being\u2026 not smart, we'll try to be friends?\" I struggled to sum up the confusing exchange. \"That sounds about right.\" I looked down at my hands wrapped around the lemonade bottle, not sure what to do now. \"What are you thinking?\" he asked curiously. I looked up into his deep gold eyes, became befuddled, and, as usual, blurted out the truth. \"I'm trying to figure out what you are.\" His jaw tightened, but he kept his smile in place with some effort. \"Are you having any luck with that?\" he asked in an offhand tone. \"Not too much,\" I admitted. He chuckled. \"What are your theories?\" I blushed. I had been vacillating during the last month between Bruce Wayne and Peter Parker. There was no way I was going to own up to that. \"Won't you tell me?\" he asked, tilting his head to one side with a shockingly tempting smile. I shook my head. \"Too embarrassing.\" \"That's really frustrating, you know,\" he complained. \"No,\" I disagreed quickly, my eyes narrowing, \"I can't imagine why that would be frustrating at all \u2014 just because someone refuses to tell you what they're thinking, even if all the while they're making cryptic little remarks specifically designed to keep you up at night wondering what they could possibly mean\u2026 now, why would that be frustrating?\" He grimaced. \"Or better,\" I continued, the pent-up annoyance flowing freely now, \"say that person also did a wide range of bizarre things \u2014 from saving your life under impossible circumstances one day to treating you like a pariah the next, and he never explained any of that, either, even after he promised. That, also, would be very non-frustrating.\" \"You've got a bit of a temper, don't you?\" \"I don't like double standards.\" We stared at each other, unsmiling. He glanced over my shoulder, and then, unexpectedly, he snickered. \"What?\" \"Your boyfriend seems to think I'm being unpleasant to you \u2014 he's debating whether or not to come break up our fight.\" He snickered again. \"I don't know who you're talking about,\" I said frostily. \"But I'm sure you're wrong, anyway.\" \"I'm not. I told you, most people are easy to read.\" \"Except me, of course.\" \"Yes. Except for you.\" His mood shifted suddenly; his eyes turned brooding. \"I wonder why that is.\" I had to look away from the intensity of his stare. I concentrated on unscrewing the lid of my lemonade. I took a swig, staring at the table without seeing it. \"Aren't you hungry?\" he asked, distracted. \"No.\" I didn't feel like mentioning that my stomach was already full \u2014 of butterflies. \"You?\" I looked at the empty table in front of him. \"No, I'm not hungry.\" I didn't understand his expression \u2014 it looked like he was enjoying some private joke. \"Can you do me a favor?\" I asked after a second of hesitation. He was suddenly wary. \"That depends on what you want.\" \"It's not much,\" I assured him. He waited, guarded but curious. \"I just wondered\u2026 if you could warn me beforehand the next time you decide to ignore me for my own good. Just so I'm prepared.\" I looked at the lemonade bottle as I spoke, tracing the circle of the opening with my pinkie finger. \"That sounds fair.\" He was pressing his lips together to keep from laughing when I looked up. \"Thanks.\" \"Then can I have one answer in return?\" he demanded. \"One.\" \"Tell me one theory.\" Whoops. \"Not that one.\" \"You didn't qualify, you just promised one answer,\" he reminded me. \"And you've broken promises yourself,\" I reminded him back. \"Just one theory \u2014 I won't laugh.\" \"Yes, you will.\" I was positive about that. He looked down, and then glanced up at me through his long black lashes, his ocher eyes scorching. \"Please?\" he breathed, leaning toward me. I blinked, my mind going blank. Holy crow, how did he do that? \"Er, what?\" I asked, dazed. \"Please tell me just one little theory.\" His eyes still smoldered at me. \"Um, well, bitten by a radioactive spider?\" Was he a hypnotist, too? Or was I just a hopeless pushover? \"That's not very creative,\" he scoffed. \"I'm sorry, that's all I've got,\" I said, miffed. \"You're not even close,\" he teased. \"No spiders?\" \"Nope.\" \"And no radioactivity?\" \"None.\" \"Dang,\" I sighed. \"Kryptonite doesn't bother me, either,\" he chuckled. \"You're not supposed to laugh, remember?\" He struggled to compose his face. \"I'll figure it out eventually,\" I warned him. \"I wish you wouldn't try.\" He was serious again. \"Because\u2026 ?\" \"What if I'm not a superhero? What if I'm the bad guy?\" He smiled playfully, but his eyes were impenetrable. \"Oh,\" I said, as several things he'd hinted fell suddenly into place. \"I see.\" \"Do you?\" His face was abruptly severe, as if he were afraid that he'd accidentally said too much. \"You're dangerous?\" I guessed, my pulse quickening as I intuitively realized the truth of my own words. He was dangerous. He'd been trying to tell me that all along. He just looked at me, eyes full of some emotion I couldn't comprehend. \"But not bad,\" I whispered, shaking my head. \"No, I don't believe that you're bad.\" \"You're wrong.\" His voice was almost inaudible. He looked down, stealing my bottle lid and then spinning it on its side between his fingers. I stared at him, wondering why I didn't feel afraid. He meant what he was saying \u2014 that was obvious. But I just felt anxious, on edge\u2026 and, more than anything else, fascinated. The same way I always felt when I was near him. The silence lasted until I noticed that the cafeteria was almost empty. I jumped to my feet. \"We're going to be late.\" \"I'm not going to class today,\" he said, twirling the lid so fast it was just a blur. \"Why not?\" \"It's healthy to ditch class now and then.\" He smiled up at me, but his eyes were still troubled. \"Well, I'm going,\" I told him. I was far too big a coward to risk getting caught. He turned his attention back to his makeshift top. \"I'll see you later, then.\" I hesitated, torn, but then the first bell sent me hurrying out the door \u2014 with a last glance confirming that he hadn't moved a centimeter. As I half-ran to class, my head was spinning faster than the bottle cap. So few questions had been answered in comparison to how many new questions had been raised. At least the rain had stopped. I was lucky; Mr. Banner wasn't in the room yet when I arrived. I settled quickly into my seat, aware that both Mike and Angela were staring at me. Mike looked resentful; Angela looked surprised, and slightly awed. Mr. Banner came in the room then, calling the class to order. He was juggling a few small cardboard boxes in his arms. He put them down on Mike's table, telling him to start passing them around the class. \"Okay, guys, I want you all to take one piece from each box,\" he said as he produced a pair of rubber gloves from the pocket of his lab jacket and pulled them on. The sharp sound as the gloves snapped into place against his wrists seemed ominous to me. \"The first should be an indicator card,\" he went on, grabbing a white card with four squares marked on it and displaying it. \"The second is a four-pronged applicator \u2014\" he held up something that looked like a nearly toothless hair pick \"\u2014 and the third is a sterile micro-lancet.\" He held up a small piece of blue plastic and split it open. The barb was invisible from this distance, but my stomach flipped. \"I'll be coming around with a dropper of water to prepare your cards, so please don't start until I get to you.\" He began at Mike's table again, carefully putting one drop of water in each of the four squares. \"Then I want you to carefully prick your finger with the lancet\u2026\" He grabbed Mike's hand and jabbed the spike into the tip of Mike's middle finger. Oh no. Clammy moisture broke out across my forehead. \"Put a small drop of blood on each of the prongs.\" He demonstrated, squeezing Mike's finger till the blood flowed. I swallowed convulsively, my stomach heaving. \"And then apply it to the card,\" he finished, holding up the dripping red card for us to see. I closed my eyes, trying to hear through the ringing\u00a0 in my ears. \"The Red Cross is having a blood drive in Port Angeles next weekend, so I thought you should all know your blood type.\" He sounded proud of himself. \"Those of you who aren't eighteen yet will need a parent's permission \u2014 I have slips at my desk.\" He continued through the room with his water drops. I put my cheek against the cool black tabletop and tried to hold on to my consciousness. All around me I could hear squeals, complaints, and giggles as my classmates skewered their fingers. I breathed slowly in and out through my mouth. \"Bella, are you all right?\" Mr. Banner asked. His voice was close to my head, and it sounded alarmed. \"I already know my blood type, Mr. Banner,\" I said in a weak voice. I was afraid to raise my head. \"Are you feeling faint?\" \"Yes, sir,\" I muttered, internally kicking myself for not ditching when I had the chance. \"Can someone take Bella to the nurse, please?\" he called. I didn't have to look up to know that it would be Mike who volunteered.  \"Can you walk?\" Mr. Banner asked. \"Yes,\" I whispered. Just let me get out of here, I thought. I'll crawl. Mike seemed eager as he put his arm around my waist and pulled my arm over his shoulder. I leaned against him heavily on the way out of the classroom. Mike towed me slowly across campus. When we were around the edge of the cafeteria, out of sight of building four in case Mr. Banner was watching, I stopped. \"Just let me sit for a minute, please?\" I begged. He helped me sit on the edge of the walk. \"And whatever you do, keep your hand in your pocket,\" I warned. I was still so dizzy. I slumped over on my side, putting my cheek against the freezing, damp cement of the sidewalk, closing my eyes. That seemed to help a little. \"Wow, you're green, Bella,\" Mike said nervously. \"Bella?\" a different voice called from the distance. No! Please let me be imagining that horribly familiar voice. \"What's wrong \u2014 is she hurt?\" His voice was closer now, and he sounded upset. I wasn't imagining it. I squeezed my eyes shut, hoping to die. Or, at the very least, not to throw up. Mike seemed stressed. \"I think she's fainted. I don't know what happened, she didn't even stick her finger.\" \"Bella.\" Edward's voice was right beside me, relieved now. \"Can you hear me?\" \"No,\" I groaned. \"Go away.\" He chuckled. \"I was taking her to the nurse,\" Mike explained in a defensive tone, \"but she wouldn't go any farther.\" \"I'll take her,\" Edward said. I could hear the smile still in his voice. \"You can go back to class.\" \"No,\" Mike protested. \"I'm supposed to do it.\" Suddenly the sidewalk disappeared from beneath me. My eyes flew open in shock. Edward had scooped me up in his arms, as easily as if I weighed ten pounds instead of a hundred and ten. \"Put me down!\" Please, please let me not vomit on him. He was walking before I was finished talking. \"Hey!\" Mike called, already ten paces behind us. Edward ignored him. \"You look awful,\" he told me, grinning. \"Put me back on the sidewalk,\" I moaned. The rocking movement of his walk was not helping. He held me away from his body, <em>gingerly</em>, supporting all my weight with just his arms \u2014 it didn't seem to bother him.  \"So you faint at the sight of blood?\" he asked. This seemed to entertain him. I didn't answer. I closed my eyes again and fought the nausea with all my strength, clamping my lips together. \"And not even your own blood,\" he continued, enjoying himself.  I don't know how he opened the door while carrying me, but it was suddenly warm, so I knew we were inside. \"Oh my,\" I heard a female voice gasp. \"She fainted in Biology,\" Edward explained. I opened my eyes. I was in the office, and Edward was striding past the front counter toward the nurse's door. Ms. Cope, the redheaded front office receptionist, ran ahead of him to hold it open. The grandmotherly nurse looked up from a novel, astonished, as Edward swung me into the room and placed me gently on the crackly paper that covered the brown vinyl mattress on the one cot. Then he moved to stand against the wall as far across the narrow room as possible. His eyes were bright, excited. \"She's just a little faint,\" he reassured the startled nurse. \"They're blood typing in Biology.\" The nurse nodded sagely. \"There's always one.\" He muffled a snicker. \"Just lie down for a minute, honey; it'll pass.\" \"I know,\" I sighed. The nausea was already fading. \"Does this happen a lot?\" she asked. \"Sometimes,\" I admitted. Edward coughed to hide another laugh. \"You can go back to class now,\" she told him. \"I'm supposed to stay with her.\" He said this with such assured authority that \u2014 even though she pursed her lips \u2014 the nurse didn't argue it further. \"I'll go get you some ice for your forehead, dear,\" she said to me, and then bustled out of the room. \"You were right,\" I moaned, letting my eyes close. \"I usually am \u2014 but about what in particular this time?\" \"Ditching is healthy.\" I practiced breathing evenly. \"You scared me for a minute there,\" he admitted after a pause. His tone made it sound like he was confessing a humiliating weakness. \"I thought Newton was dragging your dead body off to bury it in the woods.\" \"Ha ha.\" I still had my eyes closed, but I was feeling more normal every minute. \"Honestly \u2014 I've seen corpses with better color. I was concerned that I might have to avenge your murder.\" \"Poor Mike. I'll bet he's mad.\" \"He absolutely loathes me,\" Edward said cheerfully. \"You can't know that,\" I argued, but then I wondered suddenly if he could. \"I saw his face \u2014 I could tell.\" \"How did you see me? I thought you were ditching.\" I was almost fine now, though the queasiness would probably pass faster if I'd eaten something for lunch. On the other hand, maybe it was lucky my stomach was empty. \"I was in my car, listening to a CD.\" Such a normal response \u2014 it surprised me. I heard the door and opened my eyes to see the nurse with a cold compress in her hand. \"Here you go, dear.\" She laid it across my forehead. \"You're looking better,\" she added. \"I think I'm fine,\" I said, sitting up. Just a little ringing in my ears, no spinning. The mint green walls stayed where they should. I could see she was about to make me lie back down, but the door opened just then, and Ms. Cope stuck her head in. \"We've got another one,\" she warned. I hopped down to free up the cot for the next invalid. I handed the compress back to the nurse. \"Here, I don't need this.\" And then Mike staggered through the door, now supporting a sallow-looking Lee Stephens, another boy in our Biology class. Edward and I drew back against the wall to give them room. \"Oh no,\" Edward muttered. \"Go out to the office, Bella.\" I looked up at him, bewildered. \"Trust me \u2014 go.\" I spun and caught the door before it closed, darting out of the infirmary. I could feel Edward right behind me. \"You actually listened to me.\" He was stunned. \"I smelled the blood,\" I said, wrinkling my nose. Lee wasn't sick from watching other people, like me. \"People can't smell blood,\" he contradicted. \"Well, I can \u2014 that's what makes me sick. It smells like rust\u2026 and salt.\" He was staring at me with an unfathomable expression. \"What?\" I asked. \"It's nothing.\" Mike came through the door then, glancing from me to Edward. The look he gave Edward confirmed what Edward had said about loathing. He looked back at me, his eyes glum. \"You look better,\" he accused. \"Just keep your hand in your pocket,\" I warned him again. \"It's not bleeding anymore,\" he muttered. \"Are you going back to class?\" \"Are you kidding? I'd just have to turn around and come back.\" \"Yeah, I guess\u2026 So are you going this weekend? To the beach?\" While he spoke, he flashed another glare toward Edward, who was standing against the cluttered counter, motionless as a sculpture, staring off into space. I tried to sound as friendly as possible. \"Sure, I said I was in.\" \"We're meeting at my dad's store, at ten.\" His eyes flickered to Edward again, wondering if he was giving out too much information. His body language made it clear that it wasn't an open invitation. \"I'll be there,\" I promised. \"I'll see you in Gym, then,\" he said, moving uncertainly toward the door.  \"See you,\" I replied. He looked at me once more, his round face slightly pouting, and then as he walked slowly through the door, his shoulders slumped. A swell of sympathy washed over me. I pondered seeing his disappointed face again\u2026 in Gym.  \"Gym,\" I groaned. \"I can take care of that.\" I hadn't noticed Edward moving to my side, but he spoke now in my ear. \"Go sit down and look pale,\" he muttered. That wasn't a challenge; I was always pale, and my recent swoon had left a light sheen of sweat on my face. I sat in one of the creaky folding chairs and rested my head against the wall with my eyes closed. Fainting spells always exhausted me. I heard Edward speaking softly at the counter. \"Ms. Cope?\" \"Yes?\" I hadn't heard her return to her desk. \"Bella has Gym next hour, and I don't think she feels well enough. Actually, I was thinking I should take her home now. Do you think you could excuse her from class?\" His voice was like melting honey. I could imagine how much more overwhelming his eyes would be. \"Do you need to be excused, too, Edward?\" Ms. Cope fluttered. Why couldn't I do that? \"No, I have Mrs. Goff, she won't mind.\" \"Okay, it's all taken care of. You feel better, Bella,\" she called to me. I nodded weakly, hamming it up just a bit. \"Can you walk, or do you want me to carry you again?\" With his back to the receptionist, his expression became sarcastic. \"I'll walk.\" I stood carefully, and I was still fine. He held the door for me, his smile polite but his eyes mocking. I walked out into the cold, fine mist that had just begun to fall. It felt nice \u2014 the first time I'd enjoyed the constant moisture falling out of the sky \u2014 as it washed my face clean of the sticky perspiration. \"Thanks,\" I said as he followed me out. \"It's almost worth getting sick to miss Gym.\" \"Anytime.\" He was staring straight forward, squinting into the rain. \"So are you going? This Saturday, I mean?\" I was hoping he would, though it seemed unlikely. I couldn't picture him loading up to carpool with the rest of the kids from school; he didn't belong in the same world. But just hoping that he might gave me the first twinge of enthusiasm I'd felt for the outing. \"Where are you all going, exactly?\" He was still looking ahead, expressionless. \"Down to La Push, to First Beach.\" I studied his face, trying to read it. His eyes seemed to narrow infinitesimally. He glanced down at me from the corner of his eye, smiling wryly. \"I really don't think I was invited.\" I sighed. \"I just invited you.\" \"Let's you and I not push poor Mike any further this week. We don't want him to snap.\" His eyes danced; he was enjoying the idea more than he should. \"Mike-schmike.\" I muttered, preoccupied by the way he'd said \"you and I.\" I liked it more than I should.  We were near the parking lot now. I veered left, toward my truck. Something caught my jacket, yanking me back. \"Where do you think you're going?\" he asked, outraged. He was gripping a fistful of my jacket in one hand. I was confused. \"I'm going home.\" \"Didn't you hear me promise to take you safely home? Do you think I'm going to let you drive in your condition?\" His voice was still indignant. \"What condition? And what about my truck?\" I complained.  \"I'll have Alice drop it off after school.\" He was towing me toward his car now, pulling me by my jacket. It was all I could do to keep from falling backward. He'd probably just drag me along anyway if I did. \"Let go!\" I insisted. He ignored me. I staggered along sideways across the wet sidewalk until we reached the Volvo. Then he finally freed me \u2014 I stumbled against the passenger door. \"You are so pushy!\" I grumbled. \"It's open,\" was all he responded. He got in the driver's side. \"I am perfectly capable of driving myself home!\" I stood by the car, fuming. It was raining harder now, and I'd never put my hood up, so my hair was dripping down my back. He lowered the automatic window and leaned toward me across the seat. \"Get in, Bella.\" I didn't answer. I was mentally calculating my chances of reaching the truck before he could catch me. I had to admit, they weren't good. \"I'll just drag you back,\" he threatened, guessing my plan. I tried to maintain what dignity I could as I got into his car. I wasn't very successful \u2014 I looked like a half-drowned cat and my boots squeaked. \"This is completely unnecessary,\" I said stiffly. He didn't answer. He fiddled with the controls, turning the heater up and the music down. As he pulled out of the parking lot, I was preparing to give him the silent treatment \u2014 my face in full pout mode \u2014 but then I recognized the music playing, and my curiosity got the better of my intentions. \"Clair de Lune?\" I asked, surprised. \"You know Debussy?\" He sounded surprised, too. \"Not well,\" I admitted. \"My mother plays a lot of classical music around the house \u2014 I only know my favorites.\" \"It's one of my favorites, too.\" He stared out through the rain, lost in thought. I listened to the music, relaxing against the light gray leather seat. It was impossible not to respond to the familiar, soothing melody. The rain blurred everything outside the window into gray and green smudges. I began to realize we were driving very fast; the car moved so steadily, so evenly, though, I didn't feel the speed. Only the town flashing by gave it away. \"What is your mother like?\" he asked me suddenly. I glanced over to see him studying me with curious eyes. \"She looks a lot like me, but she's prettier,\" I said. He raised his eyebrows. \"I have too much Charlie in me. She's more outgoing than I am, and braver. She's irresponsible and slightly eccentric, and she's a very unpredictable cook. She's my best friend.\" I stopped. Talking about her was making me depressed. \"How old are you, Bella?\" His voice sounded frustrated for some reason I couldn't imagine. He'd stopped the car, and I realized we were at Charlie's house already. The rain was so heavy that I could barely see the house at all. It was like the car was submerged under a river. \"I'm seventeen,\" I responded, a little confused. \"You don't seem seventeen.\" His tone was reproachful; it made me laugh. \"What?\" he asked, curious again. \"My mom always says I was born thirty-five years old and that I get more middle-aged every year.\" I laughed, and then sighed. \"Well, someone has to be the adult.\" I paused for a second. \"You don't seem much like a junior in high school yourself,\" I noted. He made a face and changed the subject. \"So why did your mother marry Phil?\" I was surprised he would remember the name; I'd mentioned it just once, almost two months ago. It took me a moment to answer. \"My mother\u2026 she's very young for her age. I think Phil makes her feel even younger. At any rate, she's crazy about him.\" I shook my head. The attraction was a mystery to me. \"Do you approve?\" he asked. \"Does it matter?\" I countered. \"I want her to be happy\u2026 and he is who she wants.\" \"That's very generous\u2026 I wonder,\" he mused. \"What?\" \"Would she extend the same courtesy to you, do you think? No matter who your choice was?\" He was suddenly intent, his eyes searching mine. \"I-I think so,\" I stuttered. \"But she's the parent, after all. It's a little bit different.\" \"No one too scary then,\" he teased. I grinned in response. \"What do you mean by scary? Multiple facial piercings and extensive tattoos?\" \"That's one definition, I suppose.\" \"What's your definition?\" But he ignored my question and asked me another. \"Do you think that I could be scary?\" He raised one eyebrow, and the faint trace of a smile lightened his face. I thought for a moment, wondering whether the truth or a lie would go over better. I decided to go with the truth. \"Hmmm\u2026 I think you could be, if you wanted to.\" \"Are you frightened of me now?\" The smile vanished, and his heavenly face was suddenly serious. \"No.\" But I answered too quickly. The smile returned. \"So, now are you going to tell me about your family?\" I asked to distract him. \"It's got to be a much more interesting story than mine.\" He was instantly cautious. \"What do you want to know?\" \"The Cullens adopted you?\" I verified. \"Yes.\" I hesitated for a moment. \"What happened to your parents?\" \"They died many years ago.\" His tone was matter-of-fact. \"I'm sorry,\" I mumbled. \"I don't really remember them that clearly. Carlisle and Esme have been my parents for a long time now.\" \"And you love them.\" It wasn't a question. It was obvious in the way he spoke of them. \"Yes.\" He smiled. \"I couldn't imagine two better people.\" \"You're very lucky.\" \"I know I am.\" \"And your brother and sister?\" He glanced at the clock on the dashboard. \"My brother and sister, and Jasper and Rosalie for that matter, are going to be quite upset if they have to stand in the rain waiting for me.\" \"Oh, sorry, I guess you have to go.\" I didn't want to get out of the car. \"And you probably want your truck back before Chief Swan gets home, so you don't have to tell him about the Biology incident.\" He grinned at me. \"I'm sure he's already heard. There are no secrets in Forks.\" I sighed. He laughed, and there was an edge to his laughter. \"Have fun at the beach\u2026 good weather for sunbathing.\" He glanced out at the sheeting rain. \"Won't I see you tomorrow?\" \"No. Emmett and I are starting the weekend early.\" \"What are you going to do?\" A friend could ask that, right? I hoped the disappointment wasn't too apparent in my voice. \"We're going to be hiking in the Goat Rocks Wilderness, just south of Rainier.\" I remembered Charlie had said the Cullens went camping frequently. \"Oh, well, have fun.\" I tried to sound enthusiastic. I don't think I fooled him, though. A smile was playing around the edges of his lips. \"Will you do something for me this weekend?\" He turned to look me straight in the face, utilizing the full power of his burning gold eyes. I nodded helplessly. \"Don't be offended, but you seem to be one of those people who just attract accidents like a magnet. So\u2026 try not to fall into the ocean or get run over or anything, all right?\" He smiled crookedly. The helplessness had faded as he spoke. I glared at him.  \"I'll see what I can do,\" I snapped as I jumped out into the rain. I slammed the door behind me with excessive force. He was still smiling as he drove away.",
