            "en": "No answers, no arrests yet in death of Yale student           NEW HAVEN, Connecticut (CNN)\u00a0 -- New Haven Police meticulously sifted through evidence Tuesday in their search for the killer of Yale student Annie Le, whose body was found Sunday in a basement wall of a medical research building off campus. A senior police official told CNN investigators have interviewed more than 200 people in the case but have not issued an arrest warrant nor have they identified a \"person of interest.\" The official also disputed Yale University President Richard <em>Levin</em>, who had indicated that the suspect pool would be a \"limited number\" of people who had been in the basement the day Le disappeared. \"We know everyone that was in the basement ... and we passed that on to police,\" <em>Levin</em> said. \"There is an abundance of evidence.\" But the police official, whom CNN is not naming because of the sensitive nature of the ongoing investigation, said investigators believe dozens of people could have had access to that area of the building. Le, 24, disappeared September 8. She was last seen on surveillance video as she entered the four-story lab at 10 Amistad Street, about 10 blocks from the main campus.  After going over hours of tapes, authorities said they had not found images of her leaving the building. The police official said that investigators were unlikely to make any arrest until DNA evidence is returned from analysis and that the probe could take days or weeks. Police have not released information on what DNA evidence may have been found, although investigators said earlier that bloody clothing was found hidden above tiles in a drop ceiling in another part of the building. Authorities have not described the clothes that were found, nor said to whom they might have belonged.  Teams of investigators at a Connecticut State Police lab worked through the weekend processing and examining the bloodstained clothes. But Thomas Kaplan, editor in chief of the Yale Daily News, said a Yale police official told the paper that the clothes were not what Le was wearing when she entered the building. On Sunday, New Haven Police spokesman Joe Avery said that Le's killing was not a random act but would not elaborate.  Meanwhile, a home in Middletown, Connecticut -- believed to be the home of a Yale technician -- was the scene of a large police presence Tuesday.  Police, however, would not say whether their presence at the home was related to their investigation of Le's death. Le, a graduate student in Yale's pharmacology program, was to have been married Sunday on New York's Long Island to Jonathan Widawsky, a graduate student at Columbia University. Her friend Vanessa Flores said Le was overjoyed about getting married. \"She was just so excited about this wedding and everything from, you know, her flowers to her wedding dress and just certain details about it,\" Flores told HLN's Nancy Grace. \"We talked about this back in 2008.  She was already thinking about the weather, whether June, July was going to be too hot, August, so September, would it be nice?\"  Le was from Placerville, California, and seemed to have been well aware of the risks of crime in a university town.  In February, she compared crime and safety at Yale with other Ivy League schools for a piece for B magazine, published by the medical school. Among the tips she offered: Keep a minimum amount on your person. When she walked over to the research building on September 8, she left her purse, credit cards and cell phone in her office.",

            "en": "Many obstacles to a final Middle East peace deal      \n \n8 October 2010 Last updated at 01:47 GMT  Heavy US reliance on private security in Afghanistan has helped to line the pockets of the Taliban, a US Senate report says. The study by the Senate Armed Services Committee says this is because contractors often fail to vet local recruits and end up hiring warlords.  The report demands \"immediate and aggressive steps\" to improve the vetting and oversight process. Some 26,000 private security personnel, mostly Afghans, operate in Afghanistan. Nine out of 10 of them work for the US government. Private security firms in Afghanistan provide guards for everything from diplomatic missions and aid agencies to supply convoys.  In August, Afghan President Hamid Karzai gave private security companies four months to end operations in Afghanistan. 'Mr White'  \"All too often our reliance on private security contractors in Afghanistan has empowered warlords, powerbrokers operating outside Afghan government control,\" Democratic Senator Carl <em>Levin</em>, chairman of the Senate committee, said. \"These contractors threaten the security of our troops and risk the success of our mission,\" he added.  The report paints a disturbing picture of how some of those hired have little training or experience in firing weapons, while other contractors are warlords with known links to the Taliban, the BBC's Steve Kingstone in Washington says. The document gives several notorious examples, including a man the Americans have nicknamed Mr White - after a character in the violent film Reservoir Dogs. He is said to have funded the Taliban and to have hosted a meeting with a senior commander responsible for a wave of roadside bombs targeting Nato troops. The report also says that - by funding warlords with their own private militias - the US is undermining its declared aim of creating a more stable Afghanistan. It warns that the growth of a lucrative private security industry has drawn new recruits away from the Afghan police and army, where salaries are lower. The study follows July's Congressional inquiry, which said that trucking contractors paid tens of millions of dollars a year to local warlords for convoy protection.  In recent months, US forces in Afghanistan have pledged to increase their oversight of security contractors and set up task forces to track the money spent among sub-contractors. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-11498443",
