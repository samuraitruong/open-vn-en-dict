Jacob was still full of himself for engineering my escape. \u201cDo you think they\u2019ll come looking for you?\u201d he asked, sounding hopeful. \u201cNo.\u201d I was certain about that. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be furious with me tonight, though.\u201d He picked up a rock and chucked it into the waves. \u201cDon\u2019t go back, then,\u201d he suggested again. \u00a0\u201cCharlie would love that,\u201d I said sarcastically. \u201cI bet he wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d I didn\u2019t answer. Jacob was probably right, and that made me grind my teeth together. Charlie\u2019s blatant preference for my Quileute friends was so unfair. I wondered if he would feel the same if he knew the choice was really between vampires and werewolves. \u201cSo what\u2019s the latest pack scandal?\u201d I asked lightly. Jacob skidded to a halt, and he stared down at me with shocked eyes. \u201cWhat? That was a joke.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d He looked away. I waited for him to start walking again, but he seemed lost in thought.  \u201cIs there a scandal?\u201d I wondered. Jacob chuckled once. \u201cI forget what it\u2019s like, not having everyone know everything all the time. Having a quiet, private place inside my head.\u201d We walked along the stony beach quietly for a few minutes. \u00a0\u201cSo what is it?\u201d I finally asked. \u201cThat everyone in your head already knows?\u201d He hesitated for a moment, as if he weren\u2019t sure how much he was going to tell me. Then he sighed and said, \u201cQuil imprinted. That\u2019s three now. The rest of us are starting to get worried. Maybe it\u2019s more common than the stories say. . . .\u201d He frowned, and then turned to stare at me. He gazed into my eyes without speaking, his eyebrows furrowed in concentration. \u201cWhat are you staring at?\u201d I asked, feeling self-conscious. He sighed. \u201cNothing.\u201d Jacob started walking again. Without seeming to think about it, he reached out and took my hand. We paced silently across the rocks. I thought of how we must look walking hand and hand down the beach \u2014 like a couple, certainly \u2014 and wondered if I should object. But this was the way it had always been with Jacob. . . . No reason to get worked up about it now. \u201cWhy is Quil\u2019s imprinting such a scandal?\u201d I asked when it didn\u2019t look like he was going to go on. \u201cIs it because he\u2019s the newest one?\u201d  \u201cThat doesn\u2019t have anything to do with it.\u201d \u201cThen what\u2019s the problem?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s another one of those legend things. I wonder when we\u2019re going to stop being surprised that they\u2019re all true?\u201d he muttered to himself. \u00a0\u201cAre you going to tell me? Or do I have to guess?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d never get it right. See, Quil hasn\u2019t been hanging out with us, you know, until just recently. So he hadn\u2019t been around Emily\u2019s place much.\u201d \u201cQuil imprinted on Emily, too?\u201d I gasped. \u201cNo! I told you not to guess. Emily had her two nieces down for a visit . . . and Quil met Claire.\u201d He didn\u2019t continue. I thought about that for a moment. \u201cEmily doesn\u2019t want her niece with a werewolf? That\u2019s a little hypocritical,\u201d I said. But I could understand why she of all people might feel that way. I thought again of the long scars that marred her face and extended all the way down her right arm. Sam had lost control just once when he was standing too close to her. Once was all it took. . . . I\u2019d seen the pain in Sam\u2019s eyes when he looked at what he\u2019d done to Emily. I could understand why Emily might want to protect her niece from that. \u00a0\u201cWould you please stop guessing? You\u2019re way off. Emily doesn\u2019t mind that part, it\u2019s just, well, a little early.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean early?\u201d Jacob appraised me with narrowed eyes. \u201cTry not to be judgmental, okay?\u201d I nodded cautiously. \u201cClaire is two,\u201d Jacob told me. Rain started to fall. I blinked furiously as the drops pelted my face. Jacob waited in silence. He wore no jacket, as usual; the rain left a spatter of dark spots on his black T-shirt, and dripped through his shaggy hair. His face was expressionless as he watched mine. \u201cQuil . . . imprinted . . . with a two-year-old?\u201d I was finally able to ask. \u201cIt happens.\u201d Jacob shrugged. He bent to grab another rock and sent it flying out into the bay. \u201cOr so the stories say.\u201d \u201cBut she\u2019s a baby,\u201d I protested. He looked at me with dark amusement. \u201cQuil\u2019s not getting any older,\u201d he reminded me, a bit of acid in his tone. \u201cHe\u2019ll just have to be patient for a few decades.\u201d \u201cI . . . don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d I was trying my hardest not to be critical, but, in truth, I was horrified. Until now, nothing about the werewolves had bothered me since the day I\u2019d found out they weren\u2019t committing the murders I\u2019d suspected them of. \u201cYou\u2019re making judgments,\u201d he accused. \u201cI can see it on your face.\u201d \u201cSorry,\u201d I muttered. \u201cBut it sounds really creepy.\u201d \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not like that; you\u2019ve got it all wrong,\u201d Jacob defended his friend, suddenly vehement. \u201cI\u2019ve seen what it\u2019s like, through his eyes. There\u2019s nothing romantic about it at all, not for Quil, not now.\u201d He took a deep breath, frustrated. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard to describe. It\u2019s not like love at first sight, really. It\u2019s more like . . .gravity moves. When you see her, suddenly it\u2019s not the earth holding you here anymore. She does. And nothing matters more than her. And you would do anything for her, be anything for her. . . . You become whatever she needs you to be, whether that\u2019s a protector, or a lover, or a friend, or a brother.   \u201cQuil will be the best, kindest big brother any kid ever had. There isn\u2019t a toddler on the planet that will be more carefully looked after than that little girl will be. And then, when she\u2019s older and needs a friend, he\u2019ll be more understanding, trustworthy, and reliable than anyone else she knows. And then, when she\u2019s grown up, they\u2019ll be as happy as Emily and Sam.\u201d A strange, bitter edge sharpened his tone at the very end, when he spoke of Sam. \u00a0\u201cDoesn\u2019t Claire get a choice here?\u201d \u201cOf course. But why wouldn\u2019t she choose him, in the end? He\u2019ll be her perfect match. Like he was designed for her alone.\u201d We walked in silence for a moment, till I paused to toss a rock toward the ocean. It fell to the beach several meters short. Jacob laughed at me. \u201cWe can\u2019t all be freakishly strong,\u201d I muttered. He sighed. \u201cWhen do you think it will happen for you?\u201d I asked quietly. His answer was flat and immediate. \u201cNever.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not something you can control, is it?\u201d He was silent for a few minutes. Unconsciously, we both walked slower, barely moving at all. \u201cIt\u2019s not supposed to be,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut you have to see her \u2014 the one that\u2019s supposedly meant for you.\u201d \u201cAnd you think that if you haven\u2019t seen her yet, then she\u2019s not out there?\u201d I asked skeptically. \u201cJacob, you haven\u2019t really seen much of the world \u2014 less than me, even.\u201d \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t,\u201d he said in a low voice. He looked at my face with suddenly piercing eyes. \u201cBut I\u2019ll never see anyone else, Bella. I only see you. Even when I close my eyes and try to see something else. Ask Quil or Embry. It drives them all crazy.\u201d I dropped my eyes to the rocks. We weren\u2019t walking anymore. The only sound was of the waves beating against the shore. I couldn\u2019t hear the rain over their roar. \u201cMaybe I\u2019d better go home,\u201d I whispered. \u201cNo!\u201d he protested, surprised by this conclusion. I looked up at him again, and his eyes were anxious now. \u201cYou have the whole day off, right? The bloodsucker won\u2019t be home yet.\u201d I glared at him. \u201cNo offense intended,\u201d he said quickly. \u201cYes, I have the whole day. But, Jake . . .\u201d He held up his hands. \u201cSorry,\u201d he apologized. \u201cI won\u2019t be like that anymore. I\u2019ll just be Jacob.\u201d I sighed. \u201cBut if that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking . . .\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me,\u201d he insisted, smiling with deliberate cheer, too brightly. \u201cI know what I\u2019m doing. Just tell me if I\u2019m upsetting you.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. . . .\u201d \u201cC\u2019mon, Bella. Let\u2019s go back to the house and get our bikes. You\u2019ve got to ride a motorcycle regularly to keep it in tune.\u201d  \u201cI really don\u2019t think I\u2019m allowed.\u201d \u201cBy who? Charlie or the blood \u2014 or him?\u201d \u201cBoth.\u201d Jacob grinned my grin, and he was suddenly the Jacob I missed the most, sunny and warm. I couldn\u2019t help grinning back. The rain softened, turned to mist. \u201cI won\u2019t tell anyone,\u201d he promised. \u201cExcept every one of your friends.\u201d He shook his head soberly and raised his right hand. \u201cI promise not to think about it.\u201d I laughed. \u201cIf I get hurt, it was because I tripped.\u201d \u201cWhatever you say.\u201d We rode our motorcycles on the back roads around La Push until the rain made them too muddy and Jacob insisted that he was going to pass out if he didn\u2019t eat soon. Billy greeted me easily when we got to the house, as if my sudden reappearance meant nothing more complicated than that I\u2019d wanted to spend the day with my friend. After we ate the sandwiches Jacob made, we went out to the garage and I helped him clean up the bikes. I hadn\u2019t been here in months \u2014 since Edward had returned \u2014 but there was no sense of import to it. It was just another afternoon in the garage.  \u201cThis is nice,\u201d I commented when he pulled the warm sodas from the grocery bag. \u201cI\u2019ve missed this place.\u201d He smiled, looking around at the plastic sheds bolted together over our heads. \u201cYeah, I can understand that. All the splendor of the Taj Mahal, without the inconvenience and expense of traveling to India.\u201d \u201cTo Washington\u2019s little Taj Mahal,\u201d I toasted, holding up my can. He touched his can to mine.  \u201cDo you remember last Valentine\u2019s Day? I think that was the last time you were here \u2014 the last time when things were still . . . normal, I mean.\u201d I laughed. \u201cOf course I remember. I traded a lifetime of servitude for a box of conversation hearts. That\u2019s not something I\u2019m likely to forget.\u201d He laughed with me. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Hmm, servitude. I\u2019ll have to think of something good.\u201d Then he sighed. \u201cIt feels like it was years ago. Another era. A happier one.\u201d I couldn\u2019t agree with him. This was my happy era now. But I was surprised to realize how many things I missed from my own personal dark ages. I stared through the opening at the murky forest. The rain had picked up again, but it was warm in the little garage, sitting next to Jacob. He was as good as a furnace. His fingers brushed my hand. \u201cThings have really changed.\u201d \u00a0\u201cYeah,\u201d I said, and then I reached out and patted the back tire of my bike. \u201cCharlie used to like me. I hope Billy doesn\u2019t say anything about today. . . .\u201d I bit my lip. \u201cHe won\u2019t. He doesn\u2019t get worked up about things the way Charlie does. Hey, I never did apologize officially for that stupid move with the bike. I\u2019m real sorry about ratting you out to Charlie. I wish I hadn\u2019t.\u201d I rolled my eyes. \u201cMe, too.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m really, really sorry.\u201d He looked at me hopefully, his wet, tangled black hair sticking up in every direction around his pleading face. \u201cOh, fine! You\u2019re forgiven.\u201d \u201cThanks, Bells!\u201d We grinned at each other for a second, and then his face clouded over. \u201cYou know that day, when I brought the bike over . . . I\u2019ve been wanting to ask you something,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cBut also . . . not wanting to.\u201d I held very still \u2014 a reaction to stress. It was a habit I\u2019d picked up from Edward. \u201cWere you just being stubborn because you were mad at me, or were you really serious?\u201d he whispered. \u00a0\u201cAbout what?\u201d I whispered back, though I was sure I knew what he meant. He glared at me. \u201cYou know. When you said it was none of my business . . . if \u2014 if he bit you.\u201d He cringed visibly at the end. \u201cJake . . .\u201d My throat felt swollen. I couldn\u2019t finish. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. \u201cWere you serious?\u201d He was trembling just slightly. His eyes stayed closed.  \u201cYes,\u201d I whispered. Jacob inhaled, slow and deep. \u201cI guess I knew that.\u201d I stared at his face, waiting for his eyes to open. \u201cYou know what this will mean?\u201d He demanded suddenly. \u201cYou do understand that, don\u2019t you? What will happen if they break the treaty?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll leave first,\u201d I said in a small voice. His eyes flashed open, their black depths full of anger and pain. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a geographic limit to the treaty, Bella. Our great-grandfathers only agreed to keep the peace because the Cullens swore that they were different, that humans weren\u2019t in danger from them. They promised they would never kill or change anyone ever again. If they go back on their word, the treaty is meaningless, and they are no different than any other vampires. Once that\u2019s established, when we find them again \u2014\u201d.  \u00a0\u201cBut, Jake, didn\u2019t you break the treaty already?\u201d I asked, grasping at straws. \u201cWasn\u2019t part of it that you not tell people about the vampires? And you told me. So isn\u2019t the treaty sort of moot, anyhow?\u201d Jacob didn\u2019t like the reminder; the pain in his eyes hardened into animosity. \u201cYeah, I broke the treaty \u2014 back before I believed any of it. And I\u2019m sure they were informed of that.\u201d He glared sourly at my forehead, not meeting my shamed gaze. \u201cBut it\u2019s not like that gives them a freebie or anything. There\u2019s no fault for a fault. They have only one option if they object to what I did. The same option we\u2019ll have when they break the treaty: to attack. To start the war.\u201d He made it sound so inevitable. I shuddered. \u201cJake, it doesn\u2019t have to be that way.\u201d His teeth ground together. \u201cIt is that way.\u201d The silence after his declaration felt very loud. \u201cWill you never forgive me, Jacob?\u201d I whispered. As soon as I said the words, I wished I hadn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t want to hear his answer. \u201cYou won\u2019t be Bella anymore,\u201d he told me. \u201cMy friend won\u2019t exist. There\u2019ll be no one to forgive.\u201d \u201cThat sounds like a no, \u201d I whispered. We faced each other for an endless moment. \u201cIs this goodbye then, Jake?\u201d He blinked rapidly, his fierce expression melting in surprise. \u201cWhy? We still have a few years. Can\u2019t we be friends until we\u2019re out of time?\u201d \u201cYears? No, Jake, not years.\u201d I shook my head, and laughed once without humor. \u201cWeeks is more accurate.\u201d I was not expecting his reaction. He was suddenly on his feet, and there was a loud pop as the soda can exploded in his hand. Soda flew everywhere, soaking me, like it was spraying from a hose. \u201cJake!\u201d I started to complain, but I fell silent when I realized that his whole body was quivering with anger. He glared at me wildly, a growling sound building in his chest. I froze in place, too shocked to remember how to move. The shaking rolled through him, getting faster, until it looked like he was vibrating. His shape blurred. . . . And then Jacob gritted his teeth together, and the growling stopped. He squeezed his eyes tight in concentration; the quivering slowed until only his hands were shaking.  \u201cWeeks,\u201d Jacob said in a flat monotone. I couldn\u2019t respond; I was still frozen. He opened his eyes. They were beyond fury now. \u201cHe\u2019s going to change you into a filthy bloodsucker in just a few weeks!\u201d Jacob hissed through his teeth. Too stunned to take offense at his words, I just nodded mutely. His face turned green under the russet skin.  \u201cOf course, Jake,\u201d I whispered after a long minute of silence. \u201cHe\u2019s seventeen, Jacob. And I get closer to nineteen every day. Besides, what\u2019s the point in waiting? He\u2019s all I want. What else can I do?\u201d I\u2019d meant that as a rhetorical question. His words cracked like snaps of a whip. \u201cAnything. Anything else. You\u2019d be better off dead. I\u2019d rather you were.\u201d I recoiled like he\u2019d slapped me. It hurt worse than if he had. And then, as the pain shot through me, my own temper burst into flame. \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll get lucky,\u201d I said bleakly, lurching to my feet. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll get hit by a truck on my way back.\u201d I grabbed my motorcycle and pushed it out into the rain. He didn\u2019t move as I passed him. As soon as I was on the small, muddy path, I climbed on and kicked the bike to life. The rear tire spit a fountain of mud toward the garage, and I hoped that it hit him. I got absolutely soaked as I sped across the slick highway toward the Cullens\u2019 house. The wind felt like it was freezing the rain against my skin, and my teeth were chattering before I was halfway there. Motorcycles were too impractical for Washington. I would sell the stupid thing first chance I got. I walked the bike into the Cullens\u2019 cavernous garage and was unsurprised to find Alice waiting for me, perched lightly on the hood of her Porsche. Alice stroked the glossy yellow paint. \u00a0\u201cI haven\u2019t even had a chance to drive it.\u201d She sighed. \u201cSorry,\u201d I spit through my rattling teeth. \u201cYou look like you could use a hot shower,\u201d she said, offhand, as she sprang lightly to her feet. \u201cYep.\u201d She pursed her lips, taking in my expression carefully. \u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d \u201cNope.\u201d She nodded in assent, but her eyes were raging with curiosity. \u201cDo you want to go to Olympia tonight?\u201d \u201cNot really. Can\u2019t I go home?\u201d She grimaced. \u201cNever mind, Alice,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll stay if it makes things easier for you.\u201d \u201cThanks,\u201d she sighed in relief. I went to bed early that night, curling up on his sofa again. It was still dark when I woke. I was groggy, but I knew it wasn\u2019t near morning yet. My eyes closed, and I stretched, rolling over. It took me a second before I realized that the movement should have dumped me onto the floor. And that I was much too comfortable. I rolled back over, trying to see. It was darker than last night \u2014 the clouds were too thick for the moon to shine through. \u201cSorry,\u201d he murmured so softly that his voice was part of the darkness. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to wake you.\u201d I tensed, waiting for the fury \u2014 both his and mine \u2014 but it was only quiet and calm in the darkness of his room. I could almost taste the sweetness of reunion in the air, a separate fragrance from the perfume of his breath; the emptiness when we were apart left its own bitter aftertaste, something I didn\u2019t consciously notice until it was removed. There was no friction in the space between us. The stillness was peaceful \u2014 not like the calm before the tempest, but like a clear night untouched by even the dream of a storm. And I didn\u2019t care that I was supposed to be angry with him. I didn\u2019t care that I was supposed to be angry with everyone. I reached out for him, found his hands in the darkness, and pulled myself closer to him. His arms encircled me, cradling me to his chest. My lips searched, hunting along his throat, to his chin, till I finally found his lips. Edward kissed me softly for a moment, and then he chuckled. \u201cI was all braced for the wrath that was going to put grizzlies to shame, and this is what I get? I should infuriate you more often.\u201d \u00a0\u201cGive me a minute to work up to it,\u201d I teased, kissing him again. \u201cI\u2019ll wait as long as you want,\u201d he whispered against my lips. His fingers knotted in my hair. My breath was becoming uneven. \u201cMaybe in the morning.\u201d \u201cWhatever you prefer.\u201d \u201cWelcome home,\u201d I said while his cold lips pressed under my jaw. \u201cI\u2019m glad you came back.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a very good thing.\u201d \u201cMmm,\u201d I agreed, tightening my arms around his neck. His hand curved around my elbow, moving slowly down my arm, across my ribs and over my waist, tracing along my hip and down my leg, around my knee. He paused there, his hand curling around my calf. He pulled my leg up suddenly, hitching it around his hip. I stopped breathing. This wasn\u2019t the kind of thing he usually allowed. Despite his cold hands, I felt suddenly warm. His lips moved in the hollow at the base of my throat. \u201cNot to bring on the ire prematurely,\u201d he whispered, \u201cbut do you mind telling me what it is about this bed that you object to?\u201d Before I could answer, before I could even concentrate enough to make sense of his words, he rolled to the side, pulling me on top of him. He held my face in his hands, angling it up so that his mouth could reach my throat. My breathing was too loud \u2014 it was almost embarrassing, but I couldn\u2019t care quite enough to be ashamed. \u201cThe bed?\u201d he asked again. \u201cI think it\u2019s nice.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s unnecessary,\u201d I managed to gasp. He pulled my face back to his, and my lips shaped themselves around his. Slowly this time, he rolled till he hovered over me. He held himself carefully so that I felt none of his weight, but I could feel the cool marble of his body press against mine. My heart was hammering so loudly that it was hard to hear his quiet laughter. \u201cThat\u2019s debatable,\u201d he disagreed. \u201cThis would be difficult on a couch.\u201d Cold as ice, his tongue lightly traced the shape of my lips. My head was spinning \u2014 the air was coming too fast and shallow.  \u201cDid you change your mind?\u201d I asked breathlessly. Maybe he\u2019d <em>rethought</em> all his careful rules. Maybe there was more significance to this bed than I\u2019d originally guessed. My heart pounded almost painfully as I waited for his answer. Edward sighed, rolling back so that we were on our sides again. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous, Bella,\u201d he said, disapproval strong in his voice \u2014 clearly, he understood what I meant. \u201cI was just trying to illustrate the benefits of the bed you don\u2019t seem to like. Don\u2019t get carried away.\u201d \u201cToo late,\u201d I muttered. \u201cAnd I like the bed,\u201d I added. \u00a0\u201cGood.\u201d I could hear the smile in his voice as he kissed my forehead. \u201cI do, too.\u201d \u201cBut I still think it\u2019s unnecessary,\u201d I continued. \u201cIf we\u2019re not going to get carried away, what\u2019s the point?\u201d He sighed again. \u201cFor the hundredth time, Bella \u2014 it\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d \u201cI like danger,\u201d I insisted. \u201cI know.\u201d There was a sour edge to his voice, and I realized that he would have seen the motorcycle in the garage. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s dangerous,\u201d I said quickly, before he could move to a new topic of discussion. \u201cI\u2019m going to spontaneously combust one of these days \u2014 and you\u2019ll have no one but yourself to blame.\u201d He started to push me away. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I objected, clinging to him. \u201cProtecting you from combustion. If this too much for you. . . .\u201d \u201cI can handle it,\u201d I insisted. He let me worm myself back into the circle of his arms. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I gave you the wrong impression,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to make you unhappy. That wasn\u2019t nice.\u201d \u201cActually, it was very, very nice.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cAren\u2019t you tired? I should let you sleep.\u201d \u201cNo, I\u2019m not. I don\u2019t mind if you want to give me the wrong impression again.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s probably a bad idea. You\u2019re not the only one who gets carried away.\u201d \u201cYes, I am,\u201d I grumbled. He chuckled. \u201cYou have no idea, Bella. It doesn\u2019t help that you are so eager to undermine my self-control, either.\u201d  \u201cI\u2019m not going to apologize for that.\u201d \u201cCan I apologize?\u201d \u201cFor what?\u201d \u201cYou were angry with me, remember?\u201d \u201cOh, that.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was wrong. It\u2019s much easier to have the proper perspective when I have you safely here.\u201d His arms tightened around me. \u201cI go a little berserk when I try to leave you. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll go so far again. It\u2019s not worth it.\u201d I smiled. \u201cDidn\u2019t you find any mountain lions?\u201d \u201cYes, I did, actually. Still not worth the anxiety. I\u2019m sorry I had Alice hold you hostage, though. That was a bad idea.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d I agreed. \u201cI won\u2019t do it again.\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d I said easily. He was already forgiven. \u201cBut slumber parties do have their advantages. . . .\u201d I curled myself closer to him, pressing my lips into the indentation over his collarbone. \u201cYou can hold me hostage any time you want.\u201d \u201cMmm,\u201d he sighed. \u201cI may take you up on that.\u201d \u201cSo is it my turn now?\u201d \u201cYour turn?\u201d his voice was confused. \u201cTo apologize.\u201d \u201cWhat do you have to apologize for?\u201d \u201cAren\u2019t you mad at me?\u201d I asked blankly. \u201cNo.\u201d It sounded like he really meant it. I felt my eyebrows pull together. \u201cDidn\u2019t you see Alice when you got home?\u201d \u201cYes \u2014 why?\u201d \u201cAre you going to take her Porsche back?\u201d \u201cOf course not. It was a gift.\u201d I wished I could see his expression. His voice sounded as if I\u2019d insulted him. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to know what I did?\u201d I asked, starting to be puzzled by his apparent lack of concern. I felt him shrug. \u201cI\u2019m always interested in everything you do \u2014 but you don\u2019t have to tell me unless you want to.\u201d \u201cBut I went to La Push.\u201d \u201cI know.\u201d \u201cAnd I ditched school.\u201d \u201cSo did I.\u201d I stared toward the sound of his voice, tracing his features with my fingers, trying to understand his mood. \u201cWhere did all this tolerance come from?\u201d I demanded. He sighed. \u201cI decided that you were right. My problem before was more about my . . . prejudice against werewolves than anything else. I\u2019m going to try to be more reasonable and trust your judgment. If you say it\u2019s safe, then I\u2019ll believe you.\u201d \u201cWow.\u201d  \u201cAnd . . . most importantly . . . I\u2019m not willing to let this drive a wedge between us.\u201d I rested my head against his chest and closed my eyes, totally content. \u201cSo,\u201d he murmured in a casual tone. \u201cDid you make plans to go back to La Push again soon?\u201d I didn\u2019t answer. His question brought back the memory of Jacob\u2019s words, and my throat was suddenly tight. He misread my silence and the tension in my body. \u201cJust so that I can make my own plans,\u201d he explained quickly. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to feel like you have to hurry back because I\u2019m sitting around waiting for you.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I said in a voice that sounded strange to me. \u201cI don\u2019t have plans go back.\u201d \u201cOh. You don\u2019t have to do that for me.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m welcome anymore,\u201d I whispered.  \u201cDid you run over someone\u2019s cat?\u201d he asked lightly. I knew he didn\u2019t want to force the story out of me, but I could hear the curiosity burning behind his words. \u201cNo.\u201d I took a deep breath, and then mumbled quickly through the explanation. \u201cI thought Jacob would have realized . . . I didn\u2019t think it would surprise him.\u201d Edward waited while I hesitated. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t expecting . . . that it was so soon.\u201d \u201cAh,\u201d Edward said quietly. \u201cHe said he\u2019d rather see me dead.\u201d My voice broke on the last word. Edward was too still for a moment, controlling whatever reaction he didn\u2019t want me to see. Then he crushed me gently to his chest. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d \u201cI thought you\u2019d be glad,\u201d I whispered. \u201cGlad over something that\u2019s hurt you?\u201d he murmured into my hair. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, Bella.\u201d I sighed and relaxed, fitting myself to the stone shape of him. But he was motionless again, tense. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d \u201cYou can tell me.\u201d He paused for a minute. \u201cIt might make you angry.\u201d \u201cI still want to know.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI could quite literally kill him for saying that to you. I want to.\u201d I laughed halfheartedly. \u201cI guess it\u2019s a good thing you\u2019ve got so much self-control.\u201d \u201cI could slip.\u201d His tone was thoughtful. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to have a lapse in control, I can think of a better place for it.\u201d I reached for his face, trying to pull myself up to kiss him. His arms held me tighter, restraining. He sighed. \u201cMust I always be the responsible one?\u201d I grinned in the darkness. \u201cNo. Let me be in charge of responsibility for a few minutes . . . or hours.\u201d \u201cGoodnight, Bella.\u201d \u201cWait \u2014 there was something else I wanted to ask you about.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cI was talking to Rosalie last night. . . .\u201d His body tensed again. \u201cYes. She was thinking about that when I got in. She gave you quite a lot to consider, didn\u2019t she?\u201d His voice was anxious, and I realized that he thought I wanted to talk about the reasons Rosalie\u2019d given me for staying human. But I was interested in something much more pressing. \u201cShe told me a little bit . . . about the time your family lived in Denali.\u201d There was a short pause; this beginning took him by surprise. \u201cYes?\u201d \u201cShe mentioned something about a bunch of female vampires . . . and you.\u201d He didn\u2019t answer, though I waited for a long moment.  \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I said, after the silence had grown uncomfortable. \u201cShe told me you didn\u2019t . . . show any preference. But I was just wondering, you know, if any of them had. Shown a preference for you, I mean.\u201d Again he said nothing. \u201cWhich one?\u201d I asked, trying to keep my voice casual, and not quite managing. \u201cOr was there more than one?\u201d No answer. I wished I could see his face, so I could try to guess what this silence meant. \u201cAlice will tell me,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll go ask her right now.\u201d His arms tightened; I was unable to squirm even an inch away. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s late,\u201d he said. His voice had a little edge to it that was something new. Sort of nervous, maybe a little embarrassed. \u201cBesides, I think Alice stepped out. . . .\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s bad,\u201d I guessed. \u201cIt\u2019s really bad, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I started to panic, my heart accelerating as I imagined the gorgeous immortal rival I\u2019d never realized I had. \u201cCalm down, Bella,\u201d he said, kissing the tip of my nose. \u201cYou\u2019re being absurd.\u201d \u201cAm I? Then why won\u2019t you tell me?\u201d  \u201cBecause there\u2019s nothing to tell. You\u2019re blowing this wildly out of proportion.\u201d \u201cWhich one?\u201d I insisted. He sighed. \u201cTanya expressed a little interest. I let her know, in a very courteous, gentlemanly fashion, that I did not return that interest. End of story.\u201d I kept my voice as even as possible. \u201cTell me something \u2014 what does Tanya look like?\u201d \u201cJust like the rest of us \u2014 white skin, gold eyes,\u201d he answered too quickly. \u201cAnd, of course, extraordinarily beautiful.\u201d I felt him shrug.  \u201cI suppose, to human eyes,\u201d he said, indifferent. \u201cYou know what, though?\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d My voice was petulant. He put his lips right to my ear; his cold breath tickled. \u201cI prefer brunettes.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s a blonde. That figures.\u201d \u201cStrawberry blonde \u2014 not at all my type.\u201d I thought about that for a while, trying to concentrate as his lips moved slowly along my cheek, down my throat, and back up again. He made the circuit three times before I spoke. \u201cI guess that\u2019s okay, then,\u201d I decided. \u201cHmm,\u201d he whispered against my skin. \u201cYou\u2019re quite adorable when you\u2019re jealous. It\u2019s surprisingly enjoyable.\u201d I scowled into the darkness. \u201cIt\u2019s late,\u201d he said again, murmuring, almost crooning now, his voice smoother than silk. \u201cSleep, my Bella. Dream happy dreams. You are the only one who has ever touched my heart. It will always be yours. Sleep, my only love.\u201d He started to hum my lullaby, and I knew it was only a matter of time till I succumbed, so I closed my eyes and snuggled closer into his chest.",
