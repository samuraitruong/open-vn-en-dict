Unions say over 20 million jobs have been lost across Europe since the economic downturn began.  Workers from across Europe took to the streets of Brussels on Wednesday in protest against European austerity measures. Police say most of the protesters marched on the headquarters of the European Union.  Union leaders hoped up to 100,000 people from 30 different countries would join the protest. One of the demonstrators, Evelain Foncis, says people on low salaries shouldn't have to prop up the country - that should be the banks' responsibility. Millions of people in Europe have lost their jobs since the global financial downturn and European governments are <em>reigning</em> in public spending in a bid to combat major deficits. Even as workers protested in Brussels on Wednesday, the European Union Commission proposed sanctions against EU countries that fail to bring down their national deficits. Belgium wasn't the only European country hit by protests Wednesday.  In Spain, unions, representing hundreds of thousands of workers, launched the country's first general strike in eight years.  Some strikers reportedly scuffled with police and bags of garbage were left uncollected on the streets; protesters stopped trucks from delivering basic groceries and airlines were forced to cancel some flights. The strikes were called in protest against a number of austerity measures including wage cuts for civil servants and a labor market reform that would have made it cheaper for companies to fire workers. Director of the General Workers' Union in Spain Robert Tormamira said in the past three years two million jobs have been destroyed. Elsewhere in Europe, Greek transport workers and hospital doctors walked off the job. General Secretary of the Greek General Confederation of Labor Vangelis Bouzoulas said the people of Europe are protesting against high prices and increased unemployment. He said they are asking for better times and more work.  The Greek government has implemented strict austerity measures that have led to a series of strikes and protests. European countries handed Greece more than $100 billion in rescue loans earlier this year in order to save its economy.  Protests also took place Wednesday in a number of other European countries, including Poland, Portugal, Ireland, and Italy.",

            "en": "World Cup Play Begins         Play has begun at the 2010 World Cup - the first ever World Cup to be held on the continent of Africa. \u00a0 About 90,000 fans mostly dressed in South Africa's team colors of yellow and green, packed into the newly refurbished Soccer City stadium in Johannesburg on Friday. They watched host South Africa battle Mexico to a 1-1 draw in the first game of the 32-nation, month-long tournament. \u00a0France and Uruguay play in the second game of the day. Later in the day, France and Uruguay played to a scoreless draw at a packed stadium in Cape Town. Earlier a spectacular opening ceremony featured singers and dancers in colorful costumes and body paint. South Africa's President Jacob Zuma and his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderon, sat side-by-side overlooking the festivities, each wearing their home team's scarf.  Television cameras also showed South African Nobel laureate and retired Archbishop Desmond Tutu wearing a team jersey and dancing in the stands. He was joined in the stands by U.S. Vice President Joe Biden who is representing the United States at the tournament. The excitement was tempered, though, by the absence of former president Nelson Mandela, who canceled a planned appearance after his great-granddaughter was killed in a car crash on her way home from Thursday's World Cup kickoff concert. In remarks before the start of the game, President Zuma said the 91-year-old Mr. Mandela had wanted to attend but could not because of the unexpected death of his 13-year-old great-granddaughter, Zenani. \u00a0 Mr. Zuma also lauded the tournament as the first ever hosted by an African nation, calling it \"the African World Cup.\" The World Cup is being played in 10 stadiums across South Africa, including Soccer City and Ellis Park in Johannesburg. \u00a0 In addition to an automatic qualification for the host team, five African countries qualified for this year's World Cup - Ivory Coast, Ghana, Cameroon, Nigeria and Algeria. Italy enters the World Cup as defending champion, but Spain, the <em>reigning</em> European champion, and five-time former world champion Brazil are considered the early favorites in South Africa. The first World Cup football tournament was played in 1930 in Montevideo with host nation Uruguay defeating Argentina for the championship.",
