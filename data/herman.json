In South Carolina on Thursday, five men were expected to debate the US economy, the budget and healthcare, and to take shots at President Barack Obama. But only ex-Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty is seen as a credible candidate for the Republicans in 2012. While Mr Obama is seen as vulnerable, the field is slow to take shape. The debate - hosted by the South Carolina Republican Party and broadcast on Fox News - includes Mr Pawlenty, former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson, former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum, Congressman Ron Paul and former pizza restaurant magnate <em>Herman</em> Cain. Tea Party role A string of well-known potential contenders are sitting out the debate. They include former Alaska Governor and 2008 vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney. Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House of Representatives, is also not attending, and none of Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels, Congresswoman Michele Bachmann, real estate magnate and reality television star Donald Trump and former Ambassador to China Jon Huntsman will take to the stage. Mr Obama's poll numbers indicate he is vulnerable, due in large part to the poor state of the US economy. But a host of factors have left leading Republicans shy of jumping into the campaign, analysts say.  They include the uncertain role of the populist Tea Party, the consolidation of power among hard-right conservative Republicans and the perceived weakness of would-be front-runner Mr Romney. Mr Obama's fund-raising prowess is also seen as a factor dissuading potential opponents. By contrast, in May 2007 - when both Republican and Democratic nominations were open - a South Carolina Republican debate included two sitting senators, four former governors, three US congressmen, and a former New York City mayor. The first balloting of the 2012 primary campaign will be the Iowa caucus on 6 February 2012. Meanwhile, the Associated Press, America's most wide-reaching news agency, has said it is boycotting Thursday's debate to protest against the Fox News channel's restrictions on coverage by its photographers",

European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said there was \"a real will of the member states to do what is necessary\". His comments came at the end of the first day of an EU summit in Brussels. The Greek parliament has to pass fresh austerity measures next week before the country can gain vital bail-out funds. Greece's government is proposing additional spending cuts worth 28bn euros (\u00a325bn) over five years. If these are passed then Greece will get its next 12bn-euro instalment from the current 110bn euro bail-out package from fellow eurozone countries and the International Monetary Fund. Without this money Greece will default on its next loan payments due in mid-July. However, many economists think it will be difficult for Greece to avoid default at some time in the future. No plan B Also speaking at the end of the first day in Brussels, European Council President <em>Herman</em> Van Rompuy said the EU was moving to make it easier for Greece to access European Union development funds to help boost its economy. Earlier on Thursday, Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker urged Athens to meet its commitments under the bail-out programme. \"All conditions must be met,\" said Mr Juncker, who also chairs the groups of eurozone finance ministers. \"You can't let anyone believe there is a Plan B. If Greece does what it has to do, we will do what we have to do.\" Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou said his government was committed to pushing the austerity plans - which are deeply unpopular with the Greek people - through parliament next week. \"Greece is committed, strongly committed, to continue a very important programme for major changes, radical changes, to make our economy viable,\" he said.",
