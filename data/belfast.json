The researchers say the discovery has the potential to transform cancer from a terminal illness to a chronic condition.  The award-winning discovery is the work of Professor Chris Shaw and colleagues at Queen's University <em>Belfast</em>, in Northern Ireland.   Shaw is Professor in Drug Discovery at Queen's School of Pharmacy, where he specializes in finding and classifying naturally occurring, biologically active agents, most notably those found in the venom of amphibians all over the world.\n \nIn this latest discovery, Shaw and colleagues identified two mini-proteins or \"peptides\" (typically shorter than proteins but made from similar building blocks, amino acids) secreted on the skin of the Waxy Monkey Frog and the Giant Firebellied Toad that have the potential to stimulate or switch off \"angiogenesis\", the process of growing new blood vessels.  The peptide they found in skin of the Waxy Monkey Frog can switch off angiogenesis and the peptide they found in the skin of the Giant Firebellied Toad does the opposite: it can switch on angiogenesis.  As a cancer tumor grows and needs more oxygen and nutrients, it gets to a point where it has to develop its own blood supply, or it can't grow any bigger. So the idea is that a peptide that switches off angiogenesis could be incorporated into cancer drugs so the tumors either starve or stop growing.\n \nIn a statement to the press, Shaw explained the potential of such a compound:\n \n\"Stopping the blood vessels from growing will make the tumour less likely to spread and may eventually kill it. This has the potential to transform cancer from a terminal illness into a chronic condition.\"  On the other hand, a peptide that can switch on angiogenesis is also useful. For instance, in diseases or conditions where blood vessels need to repair quickly, such as in helping wounds to heal, in organ transplants, diabetic ulcers, and where strokes or heart conditions have left blood vessels damaged.  Angiogenesis has been a prime target for new drugs for over four decades, said Shaw, who said the reason he and his team look to the natural world for such compounds is because despite billions of investment by scientists and drug companies, man-made drugs that can effectively target and control the growth of blood vessels have yet to appear.  \"We are absolutely convinced that the natural world holds the solutions to many of our problems, we just need to pose the right questions to find them,\" said Shaw.\n \n\"It would be a great shame to have something in nature that is potentially the wonder drug to treat cancer and not aim to do everything in our power to make it work,\" he added.\n \nShaw's team members are very careful when they handle the frogs, so as not to harm them. They gently extract the secretions, and then release the frogs back into the wild.  Other studies have also shown that amphibians synthesize and secrete a range of chemicals with antimicrobial properties.  Earlier this year, scientists Ren Lai and colleagues from China reported in the Journal of Proteome Research that they found 79 different antimicrobial peptides, including 59 that were totally new to science, in the brains of two types of toad. Some of the peptides were so powerful they could cripple or kill strains of staph bacteria, E. coli, and some types of fungus that infect humans.

            "en": "Ovarian cancer   \n Ovarian cancer is hard to spot - and as a result it is often advanced by the time diagnosis is made. \nIt is less common than lung or breast cancer, but on average, fewer than a third of patients are alive five years after they are first diagnosed, so the death toll is high.  However, if it is caught early, the chances of cure are higher - and methods of screening women for early signs of the disease are being evaluated.  Women whose fertility is at risk from chemotherapy can now take the step of freezing eggs for future use in these circumstances.  In addition, the ovary is responsible for the production of key sex hormones, and the effect of surgery can be to prematurely bring on the menopause.  Professor Patrick Johnston, an expert in ovarian cancer based at Queen's University in <em>Belfast</em>, said: \"It's a significant problem for the female population in the UK.  \"One of the major problems with ovarian cancer is that it's insidious - it's a difficult tumour to diagnose - which is one of the reasons why the majority of patients are diagnosed at later stages rather than earlier stages.\"  Symptoms Women with ovarian cancer in its early stages rarely have more than the most subtle symptoms.  They may feel swollen or bloated - or suffer a generalised discomfort in the lower abdomen. But these are all symptoms that could easily be caused by something minor. There could be a loss of appetite or weight loss.  It is only as a tumour grows and spreads that the symptoms become more pronounced.  It may press on neighbouring organs, such as the bowel or bladder, causing either constipation or frequent urination.  There can also be a build-up of fluid in the abdominal cavity, and around the lungs, causing shortness of breath.  It is infrequent that an obvious symptom such as bleeding from the vagina is present.  A doctor examining for the signs of ovarian cancer will carry out a full pelvic examination, feeling for the presence of a pronounced tumour.  Other tests include:   Ultrasound CT scan barium enema - the patient is given a mildly radioactive enema then a series of x-rays. The barium helps the radiologist highlight the exact shape of the bowel and rectum, which may show up problems  There may also be a CT scan carried out to look for signs of cancer.  In addition, blood tests may show up the presence of a substance produced by ovarian cancer cells but not by healthy ones.  However, the only way to confirm the presence of ovarian cancer is by performing a biopsy operation to take a tissue sample.  This is normally done by inserting a needle or tube into the abdominal cavity to take a tiny sample of tumour tissue.  Causes Scientists do not yet know what causes ovarian cancer, although there are some clues to its origin.  If a woman has a close relative who has had the disease, the risk of her developing the disease increases.  Some of these women may currently be offered screening tests, such as blood tests or ultrasound, to try to catch the disease early.  Women who have never had a child also run an increased risk of ovarian cancer. Most ovarian cancers happen in women over the age of 50 - the risk increases for older women.  In addition, women who have previously suffered from breast cancer are twice as likely to get ovarian cancer in the future.  Treatment Surgery is almost always the first treatment a woman with ovarian cancer undergoes.  This normally involves removal of the ovaries, the womb and the fallopian tubes, which link the two.  Usually both ovaries are removed, unless the patient has only a slow growing cancer in one, and wants her fertility to be preserved.  The surgeon cannot always be sure that all the cancerous cells have been removed, so chemotherapy is almost always given as well, to kill any which remain in the body.  The recommended chemotherapy used at first involves a drug containing platinum (usually carboplatin) used alone or in combination with another drug called paclitaxel (Taxol) . Chemotherapy can be given after surgery, or beforehand in selected cases.  Radiotherapy is also occasionally used to kill cancer cells in the pelvic area.  Many factors increase or reduce the woman's chance of beating ovarian cancer.  The main one is the spread of the disease - if caught early, as with many cancers, it is much more treatable, particularly if only one part of one ovary is involved. If the cancer involves a whole ovary, both ovaries, or has spread to involve other tissues, the chances of cure fall.  Also important is the type of ovarian cancer - some affect the cells which line the womb, whereas some affect the cells which produce eggs. Both have different cure rates.  The woman's age and general state of health can affect her ability to cope with surgery, chemotherapy and other treatments.",

            "en": "The History of Titanic Disaster          The Ship of Dreams The Royal Mail Ship TITANIC was the last grand dream of the Gilded Age. It was designed to be the greatest achievement of an era of prosperity, confidence and propriety. Although no one knew it, the world was about to change drastically. Radio had been invented in 1901. The Wright Brothers' first successful flight was in 1903. The old presumptions about class, morals, and gender-roles were about to be shattered. If the concept of Titanic was the climax of the age, then perhaps its sinking was the curtain that marked the end of the old drama, and the start of a new one. The Plan of Titanic The intensely competitive transatlantic steamship business had seen recent major advances in ship design, size and speed. White Star Line, one of the leaders, determined to focus on size and elegance rather than pure speed. In 1907, White Star Line's managing director J. Bruce Ismay and Lord James Pirrie, a partner in Harland & Wolff (White Star Line's ship-builder since its founding in 1869) conceived of three magnificent steam ships which would set a new standard for comfort, elegance, and safety. The first two were to be named Olympic and Titanic, the latter name chosen by Ismay to convey a sense of overwhelming size and strength. It took a year to design the two ships. Construction of Olympic started in December, 1908, followed by Titanic in March 1909. The <em>Belfast</em> shipyards of Harland & Wolff had to be re-designed to accommodate the immense projects while White Star's pier in New York had to be lengthened to enable the ships to dock. During the two years it took to complete Titanic's hull, the press was primed with publicity about the ship's magnificence, making Titanic virtually a legend before her launch. The \"launch\" of the completed steel in May, 1911, was a heavily publicized spectacle. Tickets were sold to benefit a local children's hospital. She was then taken for \"fitting out\" which involved the construction of the ship's many facilities and systems, her elaborate woodwork and fine decor. As the date of her maiden voyage approached, the completed Olympic suffered a collision and required extensive repairs, increasing the workload at Harland & Wolff, which was already struggling to complete Titanic on schedule. Titanic's maiden voyage was delayed from March 20 to April 10. The Ship Titanic was 883 feet long (1/6 of a mile), 92 feet wide and weighed 46,328 tons. She was 104 feet tall from keel to bridge, almost 35 feet of which were below the waterline... even so, she stood taller above the water than most urban buildings of the time. There were three real smoke-stacks; a fourth, dummy stack was added largely to increase the impression of her gargantuan size and power and to vent smoke from her numerous kitchens and galleys. She was the largest movable object ever made by man. The ship's immense size and complexity is illustrated by an incident recalled by Second Officer Lightoller. There was a gangway door on the starboard side aft \"large enough to drive a horse and cart through.\" Yet three officers who joined the ship during her preparations spent a whole day simply trying to find their way to it. Moreover, she was designed to be a marvel of modern safety technology. She had a double-hull of 1-inch thick steel plates and a system of 16 water-tight compartments, sealed by massive doors which could be instantly triggered by a single electric switch on the bridge, or even automatically by electric water-sensors. The press began to call her \"unsinkable.\" Her accommodations were the most modern and luxurious on any ocean, and included electric light and heat in every room, electric elevators, a swimming pool, a squash court, a Turkish Bath, a gymnasium with a mechanical horse and mechanical camel to keep riders fit, and staterooms and first class facilities to rival the best hotels on the Continent. First class passengers would glide down a six-story, glass-domed grand staircase to enjoy haute cuisine in the sumptuous first class dining saloon that filled the width of the ship on D Deck. For those who desired a more intimate atmosphere, Titanic also offered a stately \u00e0 la carte restaurant, the chic Palm Court and Verandah restaurant, and the festive Cafe Parisien. She offered two musical ensembles of the best musicians on the Atlantic, many of them lured from rival liners. There were two libraries, first- and second-class. Even the third class (steerage) cabins were more luxurious than the first class cabins on some lesser steamships, and boasted amenities (like indoor toilet facilities) that some of Titanic's emigrant passengers had not enjoyed in their own homes. The original design called for 32 lifeboats. However, White Star management felt that the boat-deck would look cluttered, and reduced the number to 20, for a total life-boat capacity of 1178. This actually exceeded the regulations of the time, even though Titanic was capable of carrying over 3500 people (passengers and crew). The Voyage of Titanic The maiden voyage lured the \"very best people:\" British nobility, American industrialists, the very cream of New York and Philadelphia society. It also attracted many poor emigrants, hoping to start a new life in America or Canada. The journey began at Southampton on Wednesday April 10, 1912 at Noon. By sundown, Titanic had stopped in Cherbourg, France to pick up additional passengers. That evening she sailed for Queenstown, Ireland, and at 1:30 PM on Thursday, April 11, she headed out into the Atlantic. The seasoned transatlantic passengers were deeply impressed by the new ship. She was so massive that they barely felt the movement of the sea at all. Her huge, powerful engines produced almost none of the annoying vibration common on other steamers, and their noise was barely perceptible. And she achieved this extraordinary level of comfort while traveling at 22 knots, not the fastest boat on the route, but certainly one of the top five. Weather was pleasant and clear, and the water temperature was about 55 degrees. The winter of 1912 had been unusually mild, and unprecedented amounts of ice had broken loose from the arctic regions. Titanic was equipped with Marconi's new wireless telegraph system and her two Marconi operators kept the wireless room running 24 hours a day. On Sunday, April 14, the fifth day at sea, Titanic received five different ice-warnings, but the captain was not overly concerned. The ship steamed ahead at 22 knots, and the line's Managing Director J. Bruce Ismay relished the idea of arriving in New York a day ahead of schedule. The New Disaster was born On the night of April 14, wireless operator Phillips was very busy sending chatty passenger's messages to Cape Race, Newfoundland, whence they could be relayed inland to friends and relatives. He received a sixth ice-warning that night, but didn't realize how close Titanic was to the position of the warning, and put that message under a paperweight at his elbow. It never reached Captain Smith or the officer on the bridge. By all accounts, the night was uncommonly clear and dark, moonless but faintly glowing with an incredible sky full of stars. The stars were so bright that one officer mistook the planet Jupiter (then rising just above the horizon) for a steamship light. The sea was, likewise, unusually calm and flat, \"like glass\" said many survivors. The lack of waves made it even more difficult to spot icebergs, since there was no telltale white water breaking at the edges of the bergs. At 11:40, a lookout in the crow's nest spotted an iceberg dead ahead. He notified the bridge and First Officer Murdoch ordered the ship turned hard to port. He signaled the engine room to reverse direction, full astern. The ship turned slightly, but it was much too large, moving much too fast, and the iceberg was much too close. 37 seconds later, the greatest maritime disaster in history began. During that night of heroism, terror and tragedy, 705 lives were saved, 1502 lives were lost, and many legends were born.",
