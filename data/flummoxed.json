Nobody quite knows how it managed to get in there (alcohol may have been involved) but despite its obvious disadvantage, the fish was still able to control the movements of the equally hapless jellyfish. Unsurprisingly, Sam says he\u2019s never seen anything quite like this during his five years as a photographer. And neither have we. But we have now.
