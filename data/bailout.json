            "en": "The Greek parliament has given its final approval to the latest package of austerity measures. All but one of the deputies from the ruling Pasok party voted in favour of the law. The approval comes despite two days of violent protests against its provisions, which include cutting public sector wages and raising taxes. One man has died as battles erupted at a large rally outside the Greek parliament in Athens. The dead man was identified by Greek media as a middle-aged trade unionist. \"The demonstrator died of a heart attack,\" Deputy Citizens Protection Minister Manolis Othonas told Reuters. \"He was not hurt in the incidents.\"  The country is in the grip of a 48-hour general strike in protest at the cuts. The government's bill is needed to secure EU and IMF <em>bailout</em> loans. The member of the ruling socialist party who voted against it, Louka Katseli, has been expelled from the party by Prime Minister George Papandreou. Civil servants, shopkeepers, dock workers, taxi drivers, doctors, lawyers, teachers, construction workers and others were all due to take part in the strike, which began on Wednesday. An estimated 50,000 protesters gathered on Syntagma Square, in front of parliament, on Thursday. The bill includes plans for further cuts to pensions and salaries and temporary lay-offs of 30,000 public sector workers. With Greece unable to borrow on international bond markets to finance its debt, the EU and IMF have stepped in with two <em>bailout</em> packages. Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos described the choice as between a \"difficult situation and a catastrophe\". \"We have to explain to all these indignant people who see their lives changing that what the country is experiencing is not the worst stage of the crisis,\" he said. \"It is an anguished and necessary effort to avoid the ultimate, deepest and harshest level of the crisis.\" There are fears that if the Greek government defaults on its debts, it will set off a chain reaction that could engulf banks and other highly indebted eurozone nations. But the government is struggling to convince lenders that it is cutting effectively enough. Greece says it needs the next 8bn euros ($11bn; \u00a37bn) of the first <em>bailout</em> agreed to last year or it will soon be unable to pay its bills. The details of the second rescue plan have yet to be finalised. Banks have agreed to take a 21% loss, or \"haircut\", on their loans to Greece but there is growing pressure for them to accept higher losses. European leaders and global finance chiefs are trying to work out a broader plan to tackle the eurozone's debt crisis ahead of a weekend summit in Brussels. But they have now had to concede that they will not reach agreement on Sunday and have called another summit for next week to approve a deal.",

            "en": "IMF Chief says Eurozone Needs Comprehensive Solution to Debt Crisis      European officials are giving Greece more time to repay its $110-billion loan, even as worries grow that there might not be enough money available to rescue other financially troubled countries. The European Union insists the nearly one-trillion-dollar <em>bailout</em> fund it established with the International Monetary Fund is more than adequate, but conceded that earlier stress tests to determine how well Europe's biggest banks could handle the crisis were not tough enough. Meanwhile, the head of the IMF expressed confidence that the worst is over, but urged European leaders to find new solutions. Even as European officials sought to calm financial markets, protesters in Ireland were busy denouncing higher taxes in the government's tough new budget. In Greece, pensioners complain austerity measures have driven many of them into poverty Many Europeans worry that other high debt countries could be next. Yet, the EU's top monetary official, Ollie Rehn, remains confident. He says Europe has the necessary tools to deal with future crises - so long as high debt nations move forward with their own austerity measures. \"The recovery is taking hold and it is progressing, but at the same time it is essential that we contain the financial bush fires so that they will not turn into a Europe-wide forest fire,\" said Rehn. The EU says no additional funds are needed, but it will require a new round of stress tests to make sure European banks are sound. For its part, the International Monetary Fund wants European leaders to implement bold new measures. \"Europe has to provide, the euro zone has to provide, a comprehensive solution to this problem,\" said Strauss-Kahn. \"The piecemeal approach, one country after the other one, is not a good one.\" Strauss-Kahn met with Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou on Tuesday to discuss an extension of Greece's repayment deadline. He said the situation in Europe remains serious, but he was confident about Greece and the future of the 16-nation euro zone. \"There is still a lot to do,\" he said. \"And what is in front may be even more important than what has been done.\" European bond markets remained tense on Tuesday after EU leaders resisted calls to increase the size of Europe's <em>bailout</em> mechanism. Investors are worried the fund would be inadequate to rescue larger European economies such as Spain.",

            "en": "France, Germany Show Solidarity on Greek Economy        The leaders of France and Germany signaled Friday they want to find a quick solution to the economic crisis in Greece. In Greece, the prime minister reshuffled his Cabinet and replaced his finance minister. Speaking in Berlin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy said the stability of Europe's single currency, the euro, is their top priority.  Greece, a nation in the eurozone and part of the single currency, is in major debt. It needs a multi-billion-dollar loan from its euro neighbors in order to avoid defaulting on that debt. France and Germany had been at odds over whether private holders of Greek bonds should be involved in a Greek rescue package.  But on Friday, Merkel said the two countries were on the same page. She said that private investors should participate only on a voluntary basis. She added that mandatory participation does not have a legal basis.  Analysts say this is a softening of Germany's position, which they say had been leaning towards forcing losses on private creditors.  President Sarkozy said Friday that France and Germany are committed to defending the euro. He added that their program has to be put in place quickly.  It is a sign that European countries may be moving closer to a deal to help Greece out of its immediate financial straits.  But Mark Weisbrot, co-director of the U.S.-based research group the Center for Economic and Policy Research, says a <em>bailout</em> in its current form is not going to help Greece in the long run. \"Greece needs to get out from under a big part of that debt, a big part,\" said Weisbrot. \"Because otherwise, if you have a settlement and there is just a restructuring that allows some payments to be made later and none of the principles to be reduced, for example, then you're just going to end up in the same situation a year or two down the road.\" The European Union and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have made tough austerity measures a condition of any <em>bailout</em>.  Those measures are adding to social unrest in Greece and putting major political pressure on the leading Socialist party. On Friday, a new finance minister was appointed amid a reshuffle of the Cabinet.  And on Wednesday, tens of thousands of people turned out in the streets to protest against tax hikes and spending cuts.  Weisbrot says austerity is not the key to improving Greece's economic situation, and, in his opinion, Greek citizens are right to battle the policy.  \"I think what they're doing right now is important,\" Weisbrot added. \"They're in the streets and that's where the only pressure is coming from. And I think they should demand that their government not accept any terms that doesn't get the economy growing immediately.\" The IMF said Friday that sovereign debt troubles in Greece and other eurozone countries are putting the global economic recovery at risk.  Speaking in San Paulo, Brazil, the IMF's research director, Olivier Blanchard, said policymakers have to act now to make the financial system more robust.",

President Obama says the new regulations on major financial firms will protect consumers and prevent the abuses that many analysts say led to the global economic recession. \"Reform will also rein in the abuse and excess that nearly brought down our financial system,\" said President Obama. \"It will finally bring transparency to the kinds of complex and risky transactions that helped trigger the financial crisis.\" The new laws are the broadest reform of the U.S. financial industry since the Great Depression of 1930s. \u00a0Before he signed it, the president said the overhaul will have global implications. \"That is why we all stand to gain from these reforms,\" said Mr. Obama. \"We all win when investors around the world have confidence in our markets.\" The law will allow the government to take over failing financial institutions, if they are so big that their collapse would damage the U.S. economy.\u00a0 The government would then sell the properties to ensure that taxpayers do not bear the cost of the failure. Banks will be required to keep more money on hand to cover potential losses from bad investments. And complex transactions called derivatives will be more tightly regulated. Opposition Republicans in Congress are criticizing the overhaul as unnecessary government intrusion into private business. High-ranking Republican Representative Mike Pence says the reform amounts to a \"permanent <em>bailout</em> of Wall Street\" and he called for its repeal. The top Senate Republican, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, says it will make America's unemployment problem worse. \"Job-stifling taxes, regulations, government intrusion - these appear to be the three pillars of every Democratic legislative effort,\" said Mitch McConnell. \"They are also the three things lawmakers can do that are guaranteed to kill more jobs.\" President Obama thanked the few Republicans who joined his fellow Democrats to vote for the bill.\u00a0 He called those who did not, \"a partisan minority determined to block change.\" Many of the biggest banks that were bailed out during the financial crisis have repaid their loans and are reporting profits. Peter Cardillo, chief market economist with the New York-based financial firm Avalon Partners, says the reforms might cut into those profits, at least initially. \"In certain cases, probably it will change the way Wall Street does business,\" said Peter Cardillo. \"And that means, perhaps, giving up some business.\u00a0 And that means lower earnings for some of the major [financial] houses on Wall Street.\" Mr. Obama signed the bill in Washington's Ronald Reagan building, named for a president who championed business deregulation.",

            "en": "China's War for Ore         \nBusiness is being reshaped around the world.\n China was miffed by the outcome of what we last year called the corporate \"deal of the century.\" But shareholder interests prevailed. How often will that be said in the future? Politics, that ugly dynamic when mixed with business, was already back in play last week as Rio Tinto, an Australian mining giant at the heart of the controversy, saw four of its Chinese executives arrested in Shanghai on spying charges. China says the busts are not retribution for the cancelled deal between Rio and a state-owned company, which received angry press in China. Instead, the arrests supposedly arise from skullduggery by Rio officials during fraught annual ore-price negotiations with mainland steelmakers. But the distinction may be irrelevant. Ore has become a major neuralgic concern for China. It sees its dependence on imported supply as strategically risky. It fears that its massive attempts to \"stimulate\" domestic job growth are being drained off as fatter profits for Australian mining companies. When the intrigue is unraveled, moreover, don't be surprised if the arrests are partly aimed at corralling the mainland's own restive steelmakers, many of whom have not cooperated in Beijing's ore strategy but have been striking their own spot market deals at higher prices. But let's step back. Rio has been wrongfooted over and over lately amid the zigzagging of the world's monetary conditions, whose chaos is now disastrously reshaping business-government relations globally (think the Obama administration's ownership of most of the Detroit auto industry). When China was booming, Rio played coy in the face of a merger bid from fellow miner BHP Billiton 18 months ago, acknowledging the \"industrial logic\" of the deal but insisting the offering price was \"several ballparks\" short of fair value. Oops. With the collapse of Lehman and the global meltdown, ore prices plummeted and BHP withdrew its bid. Suddenly, Rio needed its own debt <em>bailout</em> and turned to a company on the cash-rich mainland, state-owned Chinalco. Beijing was doubly pleased by the $19.5 billion Chinalco deal. Not only was China getting ownership of Australian ore assets at a bargain price, but the deal also killed off any chance of a BHP merger, seen on the mainland as an Aussie plot to gouge China. Oops. The Chinalco proposal ran into a buzzsaw of nationalist opposition in Australia. And while a government review board dragged its feet, the delay allowed Ben Bernanke to rev up the monetary engine and China to launch its own massive stimulus. Ore prices recovered. A BHP joint venture was back on the table. In a jilting worthy of a Judy Blume novel, Rio last month dumped its Chinese savior and leapt into bed with its erstwhile Australian suitor. Now the Chinese naturally see dirty politics at work, but the deal was actually scuttled by Rio's shareholders, who rightly saw more upside in BHP's offer. Yet it's also true the Chinalco bid would likely eventually have been torpedoed by the Australian government. Polls were running strongly against selling the country's mineral patrimony to a company ultimately controlled by the Chinese Communist Party. Australia Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, who prides himself on being an old China hand, must have been overjoyed when this icky chalice was taken from his lips by Rio's shareholders Yet the politics have only turned ickier since the Rio arrests. And Beijing has other cards up its sleeve. It can take its opposition to the BHP-Rio deal to Europe's trustbusters, who voiced qualms about their earlier proposed tie-up. China also can make use of its own new anti-monopoly law, which has already been used to punish the U.S. for blocking an oil deal. Earlier this year, Chinese regulators nixed Coca-Cola's purchase of a local juicemaker on \"competition\" grounds that antitrust lawyers considered ludicrous. More disturbing, China has upped its ore purchases in recent weeks even as mainland growth seems to be slowing, suggesting an effort to lay in a stockpile for a longer showdown against Rio-BHP. If the Rio arrests mark the beginning of a Chinese war to remake the global ore market more to China's liking, Beijing might want to think again. Its clumsy attempt to make computer makers instruments of Internet censorship was not exactly confidence-inspiring. Ensuring nobody wants to do a business deal with China for fear of being charged with a death penalty crime hardly improves the case. Then there's the epic civil disorder in Xinjiang. The final casualty may be China's overblown reputation for macroeconomic competence, on which so many hopes for global recovery depend. There are already signs its stimulus efforts are running off the rails. The world might appreciate a signal right now that China's government actually knows what it's doing.

            "en": "In recent months, some doomsayers have predicted there will be another market crash in 2011, and that Wall Street's \"con game\" will be once again exposed. As the years have passed, it has become more apparent that we're incapable of learning from our mistakes, as evidenced by the subprime credit meltdown that was foretold well-before it occurred. Economics, like sociology, is a fascinating study with complex twists and turns, many of which have been repeated throughout history. The following gloomy days in Wall Street history are stark reminders of its instability \u2014 and even our gullibility.\n \u00a0\n \nMarch 14, 1907: Real estate speculation and attempted company takeovers after the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 contributed to the crash 1907, in which the Dow suffered a loss of more than eight percent, closing at 76.23. Because many people were borrowing for speculation and a large portion of the real estate in the quake-ravaged region was insured by companies in the U.K., interest rates increased dramatically. Those rates, along with uncharacteristically high real estate prices, slowed investments on capital goods. The resulting instability fed the Panic of 1907.\n \u00a0\n \nOctober 24, 1929: An event that will forever live in infamy, the Stock Market Crash of 1929 dealt a crushing blow to the U.S. economy. Most notably, it signified the beginning of the Great Depression, which lasted all the way until World War II. The onset of the ordeal occurred on Black Thursday, when share prices on the New York Stock Exchange plummeted. In a mass panic, $5 billion vanished as almost 13 million shares were traded, more than three times the normal volume. A brief rally at the end of the day, led by Richard Whitney, head of the New York Stock Exchange, boosted confidence slightly, but ultimately failed to halt a full-blown meltdown.\n \u00a0\n \nOctober 28, 1929: Following a better Friday, investors returned on Monday to experience another rapid deterioration. They attempted to flee the market while they could, but for many it was too late. By the end of the day, trading volumes almost reached 9.25 million and the Dow fell 13 percent (38 points), a record loss. The confidence that was established at the end of the previous week was gone, and the stage was set for the most unforgettable day of 1929.\n \u00a0\n \nOctober 29, 1929: Black Tuesday is when the crisis reached its apex. In just a matter of a few hours, the financial gains of the previous year were eliminated, and consumer confidence tumbled. Everyone was selling and nobody was buying, causing the ticker to lag behind by almost two hours. An astonishing 16 million shares were traded on the day, a record that stood for 40 years, and the Dow closed with a 12 percent loss (30 points). The hoards of people who had previously borrowed to participate in the bull market were forced to sell their belongings in an effort to pay back their debts. Banks and businesses closes, and many American citizens would be left destitute without their jobs or any financial assistance.\n\n\nJuly 8, 1932: Almost three years after the dark days of October 1929, the Dow's long and steady decline hit its lowest point, closing at 42.22, an 89 percent decrease from its peak. Although it wasn't a one day catastrophe like the aforementioned events, it serves as a benchmark in history. Not only did it squelch any remnants of consumer confidence, but it also helped Franklin Roosevelt win the upcoming presidential election, enabling him to implement his New Deal initiatives, which some credit with eventually ending the Depression.\n \u00a0\n \nOctober 19, 1987: One widely agreed upon conclusion hasn't been reached regarding the events that led to Black Monday, when the Dow dropped by its largest margin in history at the time, more than 22 percent (508 points). The worldwide crash included drops of 45.5 percent in Hong Kong, 41.8 percent in Australia, 31 percent in Spain and 26.5 in the U.K., a sequence of events that spread westward. In addition to turmoil in international markets, economists have attributed it to the faltering dollar, market psychology and program trading, the latter of which was predicted by Congressman Edward J. Markey before the crash. Fortunately, the market swiftly stabilized afterward, improving by 15 percent above the closing number on Black Monday at the end of the month.\n \u00a0\n \nSeptember 17, 2001: The September 11th attacks impacted different aspects of our lives \u2014 security, defense, freedom and, of course, the economy. When the market reopened after a four-day closure following the attacks, stocks plunged to three-year lows, decreasing more than seven percent. Boeing and United Technologies, an aviation parts supplier, suffered the biggest losses. At that point, it was the biggest one-day and one-week point losses in the history of the Dow, which had previously been unaffected by the ongoing recession.\n \u00a0\n \nFebruary 27, 2007: Overshadowed by the events of the following year, the 2007 crash was quickly forgotten by those who weren't directly affected by it. Even still, it stands as one of the largest drops point-wise in the history of the Dow. Investors sold en masse amid worries of economic growth in the U.S. and worldwide, plummeting Chinese stocks and an apparent assignation attempt on Vice President Cheney by the Taliban in Afghanistan. Fears of a major selloff had been looming for months after the Dow had reached record highs during an eight-month rally.\n \u00a0\n \nSeptember 15, 2008: With more than $600 billion in assets, the demise of Lehman Brothers, the fourth largest investment bank in the U.S., had major repercussions on the economic health of the nation. The largest bankruptcy in the history of the country, along with the sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America to avoid financial crisis, resulted in a 504-point drop in the Dow, and helped set forth the panic of the following weeks. The struggling AIG, formerly the 18th-largest public company in the world, was spared thanks to assistance from the government, which, among other things, immediately provided an $85 billion credit facility.\n \u00a0\n \nSeptember 29, 2008: It was a catastrophe that defined a generation on Wall Street. After the House of Representatives failed to pass Bush's $700 million <em>bailout</em> plan for the ailing financial institutions, more than $1.2 trillion was gone from the U.S. stock market, the biggest decrease in the history of the Dow Jones. The biggest drop, 400 points, came in just 10 minutes, not long after it became evident the bill was going to fail.\n \u00a0 \u00a0",

            "en": "France in shock as IMF chief charged with sex assault          (Reuters) - IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn was charged on Sunday with trying to rape a New York hotel maid in a scandal that appeared to wreck his hopes of becoming France's next president. The sexual assault charges throw the IMF into a leadership crisis just as it is trying to help ease an escalating euro zone debt crisis, and they turn France's presidential election campaign upside down when polls had made Strauss-Kahn a clear front runner. The charismatic 62-year-old, who led the International Monetary Fund through the 2007-09 global financial meltdown and has been central in galvanizing Europe to tackle its debt woes, for long had the reputation of a womanizer. But the charges he faces are in another realm. A maid, 32, said he emerged naked from the bathroom and sexually assaulted her inside his $3,000-a-night suite at the Sofitel hotel in New York's Times Square on Saturday afternoon. He was there on private business, the IMF said. Strauss-Kahn was expected to go before a state court later on Sunday. His lawyer said he will plead not guilty. Police say he fled the hotel after the alleged assault and a few hours later they pulled him out of his first-class seat on an Air France plane 10 minutes before it was to take off for Paris. He was charged with a criminal sexual act, unlawful imprisonment and attempted rape, moving him from luxurious hotel suite and a glittering public career to scandal and a bare holding cell in New York's tough Harlem neighborhood in the space of a few hours. The contrast could barely have been more dramatic. At the Sofitel, Strauss-Kahn's suite had a conference room, living room, foyer, spacious marble bathroom and a bedroom with a sumptuous king-sized bed and feather and down duvet.  Police say Strauss-Kahn does not have diplomatic immunity from the charges, which if proven could carry a prison sentence of 15-20 years. They have collected DNA evidence from the hotel suite, The New York Times reported. Strauss-Kahn has hired New York lawyer Benjamin Brafman, a seasoned defense attorney famed for striking deals or winning not-guilty verdicts for pop stars and a football player. The IMF chief's wife, well-known French television personality Anne Sinclair, jumped to her husband's defense. \"I do not believe for a single second the accusations leveled against my husband,\" she said in a statement. IMF CRISIS, ELECTION 'THUNDERBOLT' The IMF tried to fill its leadership vacuum by naming its No. 2 official, John Lipsky, as acting managing director. But the charges against Strauss-Kahn are a huge embarrassment for an institution that oversees the global economic system and has authorized hundreds of billions of dollars of lending to troubled countries as well as playing a major role in the euro-zone debt crisis. The allegations immediately threw France's presidential race wide open. He had not yet declared his candidacy but Strauss-Kahn was widely expected to run for the Socialist Party and early opinion polls showed him with a big lead over the conservative incumbent, Nicolas Sarkozy, who is seeking a second term at the election next April. \"The news we received from New York last night struck like a thunderbolt,\" said Socialist leader Martine Aubry, appealing for party unity. France's government as well as Strauss-Kahn's political allies and rivals called for caution and respect for the presumption of innocence, but his presidential ambitions appeared to be dead in the water unless the case against him quickly unravels and he is shown to be innocent. \"All this is completely astounding, immensely troubling and distressing. If the facts prove true ... it's something degrading for all women. It's terrible for the image of France,\" said Francois Bayrou, a centrist opponent. Far-right leader Marine Le Pen said her rival's presidential hopes had been crushed. Christine Boutin, president of the Christian Democrat Party, suggested Strauss-Kahn may have been set up. \"I think it's very likely a trap was set for Dominique Strauss-Kahn and he fell into it,\" she told France's BFM television. \"It's a political bomb for domestic politics.\" French voters are famously tolerant of political leaders' extra-marital affairs but the allegations against Strauss-Kahn are entirely different, and much more serious. If they are proven, Strauss-Kahn's fall from power in a scandal would be one of the most dramatic of any high-profile international figure in decades. Many politicians have fallen after being caught in extra-marital affairs and others have survived them, including former presidents John F. Kennedy and Bill Clinton as well as former French President Francois Mitterrand. But rarely have senior figures faced brutal assault charges like those filed against Strauss-Kahn. With Strauss-Kahn in the dock, the IMF also now faces many questions of its own, because his character had been questioned before. In 2008, Strauss-Kahn apologized for \"an error of judgment\" after an affair with a female IMF economist who was his subordinate. The Fund's board of member countries warned him against further improper conduct, but cleared him of harassment and abuse of power and kept him in his job. It will now face new scrutiny over whether that response was too weak, especially as there have been persistent rumors about Strauss-Kahn making sexual advances to women. PIVOTAL IN EUROPE'S DEBT WOES An economics professor and former French finance minister, Strauss-Kahn took over the IMF in November 2007 for a five-year term, and won praise for helping galvanize leaders to inject billions of dollars into the world economy during the global financial crisis. He introduced sweeping changes to ensure vulnerable countries swamped by the crisis had access to emergency loans, and others to give major emerging market countries such as China, India and Brazil greater voting powers in the IMF. Witty, multi-lingual, a skilled public speaker and sharp back-room negotiator, Strauss-Kahn also weighed into thornier issues by urging China to let its currency rise in a dispute with the United States. A crisis of leadership at the Fund now will especially worry European nations given Strauss-Kahn's pivotal role in brokering bailouts for Iceland, Hungary, Greece, Ireland and Portugal. \"The chances are the successor won't be a European, and will want to rebalance the IMF's priorities away from its massive commitment in Europe,\" said Jean Pisani-Ferry, director of the Bruegel economic think-tank. Strauss-Kahn had been due to meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Sunday and join euro zone finance ministers on Monday to discuss the bloc's debt crisis and how to handle Greece, which is struggling to meet the terms of a 110 billion euro European Union/IMF <em>bailout</em> last year. \"This might definitely cause some delays in the short term,\" a Greek official told Reuters on condition of anonymity. Strauss-Kahn's lawyers moved quickly to cast doubts on the allegations against him. \"We must wait until things settle and see if it's true or a provocation,\" said one of his France-based lawyers, Leon Lef Forster. \"We must be especially careful not to get into a media circus and we must wait until things are clear.\" Brafman, his U.S. lawyer, previously defended pop star Michael Jackson against child molestation charges as well as other celebrities in trouble. The maid who accused Strauss-Kahn told police he attacked her when she went in to clean his suite. \"She told detectives he came out of the bathroom naked, ran down a hallway to the foyer where she was, pulled her into a bedroom and began to sexually assault her, according to her account,\" New York police spokesman Paul Browne said. \"She pulled away from him and he dragged her down a hallway into the bathroom where he engaged in a criminal sexual act, according to her account to detectives. He tried to lock her into the hotel room.\" The woman, who has not been named, was treated in hospital for minor injuries, Browne said. She has worked at the hotel for three years and the property's manager said on Sunday she has been a \"completely satisfactory\" employee in her work and her behavior. Under New York state law, attempted rape and criminal sexual act both carry a potential sentence of 15-20 years. Unlawful imprisonment carries a potential sentence of three to five years.",
