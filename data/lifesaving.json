Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a virus that destroys the body's CD4 immune cells, which help fight disease. With the right medications, you can have HIV for years or decades without HIV progressing to AIDS. AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) is diagnosed when you have HIV as well as certain opportunistic infections or your CD4 cell count drops below 200. It's difficult to get HIV from casual contact Fact. You can't catch or spread HIV from hugging someone, using the same towel, or sharing the same glass. It's very rare to get HIV from a blood transfusion -- the U.S. blood supply is carefully tested. However, you can spread the disease from having unprotected sex, sharing needles, or getting a tattoo from unsterilized equipment. You have just a few years to live Myth. Everyone with HIV experiences it differently. Some people may develop AIDS within a few months as the virus quickly weakens their immune system. Many others can live for decades with HIV and have a normal life expectancy. You can help prevent HIV from progressing to AIDS by seeing your doctor regularly and following your doctor's recommendations. You'll know you have HIV because of your symptoms Myth. Some people don't show any signs of HIV for years after being infected. Many can have some symptoms within 10 days to a few weeks after infection. These first symptoms are similar to the flu or mononucleosis and may include fever, fatigue, rash, and sore throat. They usually disappear after a few weeks and you may not have symptoms again for several years. The only way to tell you have HIV is to get tested. HIV can be cured Myth. There is no cure for HIV, but treatment can keep virus levels low and help maintain your immune system. Some drugs interfere with proteins HIV needs to copy itself; others block the virus from entering or inserting its genetic material into your immune cells. Your doctor will consider your general health, the health of your immune system, and the amount of virus in your body to decide when to start treatment. Anyone can get HIV Fact. About 56,000 people in the U.S. get HIV each year, and 18,000 people with AIDS die each year. Anyone can get HIV -- men, women, and children. Men who have sex with men make up more than half (53%) of new HIV infections each year. Women account for 27% of new infections, and children 13%. African-Americans make up almost half of all new HIV infections each year. Sex is safe when both partners have HIV Myth. Just because you and your partner both have HIV, doesn't mean you should forget about protection when you have sex. Using a condom or other latex barrier can help protect you from sexually transmitted diseases as well as other strains of HIV, which may be resistant to anti-HIV medication. Even if you are being treated and feel well you can still infect others. You can have a baby if you are HIV-positive Fact. Infected mothers can indeed pass HIV to their babies during pregnancy or delivery. However, you can lower the risk by working with your doctor and getting the appropriate care and medication. Pregnant women with HIV can take medications to treat their infection and to protect their babies against the virus. \nYou can\u2019t avoid other HIV-related infections\n Myth. Due to weakened immune systems, people with HIV can be vulnerable to infections like pneumocystis pneumonia, tuberculosis, candidiasis, cytomegalovirus, and toxoplasmosis. The best way to reduce your risk is to take your HIV medications. Some infections can be prevented with drugs. You can lessen your exposure to some germs by avoiding undercooked meat, litter boxes, and water that may be contaminated. Having HIV Means You Have AIDSMyth.

There are government programs, nonprofit groups, and some pharmaceutical companies that may help cover of the cost of HIV/AIDS drugs. But be aware: These drugs can cost $15,000 a year. Talk to your local HIV/AIDS service organization to learn about financial help.   You Have Just a Few Years to Live",

            "en": "It\u2019s Not Always Women and Children First          MONDAY, March 1 (HealthDay News) \u2014 In a life-and-death situation, how much time people have to react has a lot to do with whether they behave selfishly or selflessly, if a new critique of the infamous Titanic and Lusitania ocean liner disasters is any indication. The comparative look at who survived two of the 20th century\u2019s most infamous shipping calamities suggests that the so-called \u201ceconomic theory\u201d of human behavior \u2014 namely, that in the face of disaster, rational self-preservation trumps social norms and rules \u2014 does not always hold water.  \u201cWhat would you do?\u201d asked study co-author Benno Torgler, a professor of economics and finance at the Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia. \u201cWould you attempt to save your own life at whatever cost to others, or would you help others and put your life at stake for others? One would think that selfish and self-preserving behavior predominates. However, we provide evidence \u2026 that this is not always the case.\u201d To discern what makes threatened people tick, the researchers compared data on passenger and crew members and their reactions to the two maritime disasters. Manifests indicate that passenger composition was similar on the ships, with 62 percent to 65 percent of the passengers male. In both instances, Torgler and his team noted, the ship captains ordered their crew to save female passengers and children first \u2014 because of a scarcity of lifeboats on the Titanic and because of too little time to launch lifeboats on the Lusitania. Younger, stronger and more agile passengers would have been expected to have a better chance of surviving both sinkings, the researchers noted. That\u2019s not, however, what they found. On the Titanic, survival more closely tracked the crew\u2019s directive, which reflected accepted social norms: females 16 to 35 years of age had a much higher probability of surviving the disaster than did men of a similar age. In terms of economic class and social power, first-class passengers were found to have better survival rates than their poorer shipmates. On the Lusitania, on the other hand, both men and women aged 16 to 35 had a greater chance of survival than did younger or older passengers. And bearers of first-class passage actually were less likely to survive than third-class passengers. The researchers concluded that, on the Lusitania, a \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d pattern was in play, whereas prevailing social protocols and captain orders were enforced on the Titanic and respected by crew and passengers alike. A report on their findings is published in this week\u2019s online issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. What accounts for the differences in behavior? Torgler and his colleagues think it was mainly a question of timing. The Lusitania, they pointed out, sank just 18 minutes after it was torpedoed by a German U-boat on May 7, 1915, killing more than 1,198 people from a manifest of 1,258 passengers and 691 crew members. By contrast, the Titanic stayed afloat for two hours and 40 minutes after striking ice on the night of April 14, 1912. Although 1,512 people died in that disaster \u2014 from among 1,300 passengers and 886 crew onboard \u2014 the extra coping time afforded the Titanic\u2019s crew and passengers a sort of psychological buffer against selfishness, according to the researchers. People on the Titanic were better able to resist the powerful instinct to save oneself by using superior physical prowess to flee \u2014 a mindset that seemed to prevail on the much more quickly doomed Lusitania, the researchers said. On the Titanic, time appeared to favor adoption of respect for social norms, which favored women, while fostering a better of exchange of <em>lifesaving</em> advice that probably favored those in the upper class with the best access to such information, they said. What\u2019s more, the added time also would have allowed for the dissipation of adrenaline, which triggers a fight-or-flight reaction that, by contrast, would have been in play throughout the entire Lusitania sinking.  \u201cTime seems to be a crucial element,\u201d noted Torgler. \u201cIf people have time to interact and communicate, social norms and helping behavior emerges. Children, families with children and women in general have then a higher probability of surviving, while men have a higher willingness to surrender a seat on a lifeboat.\u201d Other factors, however, might also have influenced behavior on the two ships, the researchers acknowledged. For example, the fact that Lusitania passengers already knew of the gruesome fate of the Titanic just three years earlier could have contributed to a less restrained reaction. Differing ship structures and the fact that the Lusitania incident occurred in a wartime context also might have affected passenger thinking, they said. Yet Torgler and his colleagues suggest that, in general, their observations could help planners devise more effective disaster-reaction strategies by broadening the understanding of how people juggle survival instincts with social pressures when confronting extreme situations. For his part, Robert J. Gatchel, a professor of clinical health psychology at the University of Texas at Arlington, agreed that timing does affect behavior during a disaster, while noting that other issues of perception are almost certainly also at play.  \u201cOn the Titanic, there was clearly a predetermined perception that it was unsinkable,\u201d he remarked. \u201cThere was all the pre-travel publicity about that. So the passengers probably had a feeling that \u2018Yeah, we\u2019re evacuating the ship but it\u2019s not really going to go down, and we\u2019re doing it for a precautionary reason.\u2019 There was probably a perception that this wasn\u2019t really a disaster, at least at first. So instead of an immediate fight-or-flight response, there was a perception of control, for better or worse. And we know that that perception will reduce stress and affect behavior,\u201d Gatchel said.  \u201cOn the other hand, people on the Lusitania were no longer under the illusion that these big ships could not go down. They knew of the great publicity of the Titanic, and they didn\u2019t want to be part of another incident like that. So they lost their sense of control, which increased stress levels. And then it became a free-for-all in terms of survival of the fittest. And I\u2019m also sure just in terms of the cadence of the voice of the officers the urgency to get off was greater, if for no other reason than because another torpedo could be fired. So, I think probably general panic was not only among the passengers but among the officers themselves,\u201d Gatchel said.",
