The move increased speculation the charges against him were to be dropped. But a spokeswoman for Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance said the case is continuing and no decisions have been made. \u00a0 \u00a0 Prosecutors are coming under pressure from a coalition of women\u2019s rights groups and community leaders to continue the case against Strauss-Kahn. The woman\u2019s lawyer, Kenneth Thompson, has written to Vance asking that his office appoint a special prosecutor citing a \u201cpotential conflict of interest\u201d. \u00a0 \u00a0  Thompson says Vance is afraid to take the case to court for fear of losing such a high-profile case. \u00a0 \u00a0  Meanwhile, Monday French police questioned a French writer over her claim that Strauss-Kahn tried to rape her in 2003, in a case that could wreck his hopes of a political return. \u00a0 \u00a0  Detectives from the Paris violent crimes squad interviewed Tristane Banon, 32, who in 2007 publicly accused Strauss-Kahn of trying to force himself on her \"like a rutting <em>chimpanzee</em>\". \u00a0  \u00a0 Paris police have been asked by investigating magistrates to look into her formal complaint lodged last week. French prosecutors will then decide whether or not to charge him.\u00a0",

The journalist has degrees in mathematics and philosophy from Oxford University. After 20 years as a reporter, Bellos decided to combine his profession and his degrees. He traveled around the world - and back in time - to uncover fascinating stories of mathematical achievements and to profile people whose lives are intertwined with numbers.  Alex Bellos discovered that mathematics - which seems so absolute - is not the same everywhere around the globe.  \"While two plus two is indeed four all over the world, the approach to math is so, so different,\" Bellos says. \"I came from the U.K. where being good at math is seen as being uncool. This is not the case even in France. The French love their math. It's quite cool to be a mathematician. Mathematicians in France are seen as great intellectuals. And being good at arithmetic in India is almost seen as a badge of national pride. In Japan, which is a culture most different from mine, a million children study the abacus for fun after school. Counting is seen as fun. It's quite fun to be able to calculate and do multiplication very, very quickly.\"  Japan was one of the places Bellos visited on his year-long journey. There, he met the creator of the popular Sudoku puzzles and talked about the brain-teasing delights of mathematical games. In a town near Tokyo, he spent time with a guru of origami, the traditional Japanese art of paper folding. Origami, Bellos says, is one of the hottest areas of mathematical work today.   \"It turns out that origami is a brilliant way to understand geometry,\" he says. \"And if you start to think about paper folding, there are lots of things you can't do with the methods that have been taught in schools really since the Greeks. For instance, trisection of an angle. Just using a compass and straight-edge, you cannot construct an angle which is a third of another angle, but you can do that with origami. So it's quite interesting to think that origami in Japan, it may be a cultural thing for children, but now people study origami at the highest level in academia.\"  While in Japan, Bellos also met a math whiz who is not human.  \"I met the world's most numeric <em>chimpanzee</em>, he says. \"And it's fascinating just to see that chimpanzees can learn to count.\"  Bellos recounts his adventures in a new book, \"Here's Looking at Euclid.\" The title is a play on Humphrey Bogart's famous line, \"Here's looking at you, kid,\" from the movie \"Casablanca.\" \u00a0  The ancient Greek mathematician Euclid is known as the father of geometry. Bellos also had fun with the title of the UK edition of the book, \"Alex's Adventures in Numberland,\"\u00a0 an obvious takeoff on the British classic, \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.\"  The book is subtitled, \"A Surprising Excursion through the Astonishing World of Math.\"  In it, Bellos talks to two Ukrainian-American brothers who have built the world's biggest supercomputer in their New York apartment. He also went to Reno, Nevada to meet the man who sets the odds for more than half of the world's slot machines. While in Missouri, Bellos met with the president of the Dozenal Society of America.  \"Dozenalists are people who believe the decimal system - the system of 10 digits, zero to nine - is not very good, is not sufficient, and suggest we need to add two extra digits,\" say Bellos. \"One might say it's crazy, trying to introduce two new numbers to the number system, but mathematically it makes a perfect sense because multiplication and division become much easier if we count in twelves rather than tens.\u201d  In exploring the wonder of math, Bellos discovered numbers are not innate to humans. They were first used only about 5,000 years ago. And he found groups of people today that don't use numbers at all or very few of them.  \"In the Amazon, I spoke to a man who has been researching the tribe, the Munduruku, who have numbers up to five and that's it,\" he says. \"Actually, they maybe even have numbers up to four because they have a word for one, for two, for three-ish, for four-ish and then they use the word palm or handful for five.\"  Bellos also stopped in Germany this summer to report on the bi-annual Mental Calculation World Cup. The 10-year-old competition has several categories: addition, multiplication, square root and calendar calculation. In that last event, contestants are given a number of dates and they have to figure out which days of the week those dates fall on - all in their head. The winner of the 2010 competition is 11 years old.  \"Priyanshi Somani from India. She learned to calculate using an abacus,\" he says. \"So when she's calculating, she's moving her hands around in the air in front of her as if there is an abacus there.\"  Somani later told Bellos she imagined she was using an abacus during the competition. When asked whether she could do the mental calculations without using her hands, Somani told Bellos that she didn't think so.  Bellos embarked on his around-the-world excursion to prove that mathematics is not a dry field of learning. The stories in his book prove that it's surprising and astonishing, as surely as the square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle equals the sum of the square of its two other sides.",

            "en": "Michael Jackson   LOS ANGELES \u2013 Michael Jackson, the \"King of Pop\" who once moonwalked above the music world, died Thursday as he prepared for a comeback bid to vanquish nightmare years of sexual scandal and financial calamity. He was 50.   Jackson died at  UCLA Medical  Center after being stricken at his rented home in Holmby Hills. Paramedics tried to resuscitate him at his home for nearly three-quarters of an hour, then rushed him to the hospital, where doctors continued to work on him.  \"It is believed he suffered cardiac arrest in his home. However, the cause of his death is unknown until results of the autopsy are known,\" his brother Jermaine said. Police said they were investigating, standard procedure in high-profile cases.  Jackson's death brought a tragic end to a long, bizarre, sometimes farcical decline from his peak in the 1980s, when he was popular music's premier all-around performer, a uniter of black and white music who shattered the race barrier on MTV, dominated the charts and dazzled even more on stage.  His 1982 album \"Thriller\" \u2014 which included the blockbuster hits \"Beat It,\" \"Billie Jean\" and \"Thriller\" \u2014 is the best-selling album of all time, with an estimated 50 million copies sold worldwide.  At the time of his death,  Jackson was rehearsing hard for what was to be his greatest comeback: He was scheduled for an unprecedented 50 shows at a  London arena, with the first set for July 13.  As word of his death spread, MTV switched its programming to play videos from Jackson's heyday. Radio stations began playing marathons of his hits. Hundreds of people gathered outside the hospital. In New York's Times Square, a low groan went up in the crowd when a screen flashed that  Jackson had died, and people began relaying the news to friends by cell phone.  \"No joke. King of Pop is no more. Wow,\" Michael Harris, 36, of New York City, read from a text message a friend had sent him. \"It's like when Kennedy was assassinated. I will always remember being in Times Square when Michael Jackson died.\"  The public first knew him as a boy in the late 1960s, when he was the precocious, spinning lead singer of the Jackson 5, the singing group he formed with his four older brothers out of  Gary, Ind. Among their No. 1 hits were \"I Want You Back,\" \"ABC\" and \"I'll Be There.\"  He was perhaps the most exciting performer of his generation, known for his backward-gliding moonwalk, his feverish, crotch-grabbing dance moves and his high-pitched singing, punctuated with squeals and titters.   His single sequined glove, tight, military-style jacket and aviator sunglasses were trademarks, as was his ever-changing, surgically altered appearance.  \"For Michael to be taken away from us so suddenly at such a young age, I just don't have the words,\" said Quincy Jones, who produced \"Thriller.\" \"He was the consummate entertainer and his contributions and legacy will be felt upon the world forever. I've lost my little brother today, and part of my soul has gone with him.\"  Jackson ranked alongside Elvis Presley and the Beatles as the biggest pop sensations of all time. He united two of music's biggest names when he was briefly married to Presley's daughter, Lisa Marie, and Jackson's death immediately evoked comparisons to that of Presley himself, who died at age 42 in 1977.  As years went by,  Jackson became an increasingly freakish figure \u2014 a middle-aged man-child weirdly out of touch with grown-up life. His skin became lighter, his nose narrower, and he spoke in a breathy, girlish voice. He often wore a germ mask while traveling, kept a pet <em>chimpanzee</em> named Bubbles as one of his closest companions, and surrounded himself with children at his Neverland ranch, a storybook playland filled with toys, rides and animals. The tabloids dubbed him \"Wacko Jacko.\"  \"It seemed to me that his internal essence was at war with the norms of the world. It's as if he was trying to defy gravity,\" said Michael Levine, a Hollywood publicist who represented  Jackson in the early 1990s. He called Jackson a \"disciple of P.T. Barnum\" and said the star appeared fragile at the time but was \"much more cunning and shrewd about the industry than anyone knew.\"  Jackson caused a furor in 2002 when he playfully dangled his infant son, Prince Michael II, over a hotel balcony in Berlin while a throng of fans watched from below.  In 2005, he was cleared of charges he molested a 13-year-old cancer survivor at Neverland in 2003. He had been accused of plying the boy with alcohol and groping him, and of engaging in strange and inappropriate behavior with other children.  The case followed years of rumors about Jackson and young boys. In a TV documentary, he acknowledged sharing his bed with children, a practice he described as sweet and not at all sexual.  Despite the acquittal, the lurid allegations that came out in court took a fearsome toll on his career and image, and he fell into serious financial trouble.   Michael Joseph Jackson was born Aug. 29, 1958, in  Gary. He was 4 years old when he began singing with his brothers \u2014 Marlon, Jermaine, Jackie and Tito \u2014 in the  Jackson 5. After his early success with bubblegum soul, he struck out on his own, generating innovative, explosive, unstoppable music.   The album \"Thriller\" alone mixed the dark, serpentine bass and drums and synthesizer approach of \"Billie Jean,\" the grinding Eddie Van Halen solo on \"Beat It,\" and the hiccups and falsettos on \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'.\"   The peak may have come in 1983, when Motown celebrated its 25th anniversary with an all-star televised concert and  Jackson moonwalked off with the show, joining his brothers for a medley of old hits and then leaving them behind with a pointing, crouching, high-kicking, splay-footed, crotch-grabbing run through \"Billie Jean.\"   The audience stood and roared.  Jackson raised his fist.   By then he had cemented his place in pop culture. He got the plum Scarecrow role in the 1978 movie musical \"The Wiz,\" a pop-R&B version of \"The Wizard of Oz,\" that starred Diana Ross as Dorothy.   During production of a 1984 Pepsi commercial,  Jackson's scalp sustains burns when an explosion sets his hair on fire.   He had strong follow-up albums with 1987's \"Bad\" and 1991's \"Dangerous,\" but his career began to collapse in 1993 after he was accused of molesting a boy who often stayed at his home. The singer denied any wrongdoing, reached a settlement with the boy's family, reported to be $20 million, and criminal charges were never filed.   Jackson's expressed anger over the allegations on the 1995 album \"HIStory,\" which sold more than 2.4 million copies, but by then, the popularity of  Jackson's music was clearly waning, even as public fascination with his increasingly erratic behavior was growing.   Jackson married Lisa Marie Presley in 1994, and they divorced in 1996. Later that year,  Jackson married Deborah Rowe, a former nurse for his dermatologist. They had two children together: Michael Joseph Jackson Jr., known as Prince Michael, now 12; and Paris Michael Katherine Jackson, 11. Rowe filed for divorce in 1999.    Jackson also had a third child, Prince Michael II. Now 7,  Jackson said the boy nicknamed Blanket as a baby was his biological child born from a surrogate mother.   Cardiac arrest is an abnormal heart rhythm that stops the heart from pumping blood to the body. It can occur after a heart attack or be caused by other heart problems.   Billboard magazine editorial director Bill Werde said Jackson's star power was unmatched. \"The world just lost the biggest pop star in history, no matter how you cut it,\" Werde said. \"He's literally the king of pop.\"    Jackson's 13 No. 1 one hits on the Billboard charts put him behind only Presley, the Beatles and Mariah Carey, Werde said.   \"He was on the eve of potentially redeeming his career a little bit,\" he said. \"People might have started to think of him again in a different light.\"    (Ngu\u1ed3n: http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/us_obit_michael_jackson)",
