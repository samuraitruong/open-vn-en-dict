            "en": "What is a Fenqing      Fenqing is a Chinese word which literally means \u201cangry youth\u201d. This word has many translations in English such as cynical youth, young nationalists, hysterical youth and angry young men. I personally like to call them mob youth or ignorant angry youth. It is impossible to understand China without knowing what Fenqing is and what role they play in the society in today\u2019s China. I will try to paint a portrait of a Fenqing in this post. What a Fenqing is like? Fenqing is someone who is usually below twenty years of age, though sometimes people who are at their twenties or older can also be identified as Fenqing. Though you can find the majority of Fenqing among high school and college students, age is not the most important feature. What really matters is their outlook of China and the world. What a Fenqing doesn\u2019t know? The fact that most Fenqing are (gleefully) ignorant of many things determines their opinions and views of the world and China. A typical Fenqing does not know the answer to the following questions: What are the differences between the nation, the government and the party? Fenqing believe these three things are basically the same thing.  How large is the China\u2019s territory and what is the ranking of its land area? Fenqing were taught that China was the third largest country in the world, and they never knew it shrank a little.  What is a purpose of economic and social development? Fenqing believe everything can be readily sacrificed to achieve \u201cthe grand goal\u201d. For them, the value of human life and dignity is readily expendable for the slogans and ideologies.  How the tax money is spent? Fenqing do know or care they are in fact tax payers and has a right to know how their tax money is spent. What is Fenqing\u2019s outlook? Their ignorance and lack of social experience shaped the outlook they hold onto: U.S. is a monolith. America is bad, bad and bad because Bush is bad.  Anti-Japan and call for boycotting Japanese products while enjoying Japanese AV or cartoons.  China\u2019s stock market slumps because of the conspiracy of the imperialist western countries. The price of housing in China skyrocketed because of the hot money of the international speculators.  Western countries led by the U.S. are trying to encircle and contain China.  The Internet should be censured and any bad information, like the flies or mosquitoes outside the room, must be screened and filtered.  CNN is evil because it lied, but it is fine for CCTV to modify the information to maintain the stability of the society. What is the role of Fenqing in China? Fenqing are often spontaneous, but it is easy to fan up their blind fervency \u2014 just tell them China has been attacked. Fenqing never realized that they are manipulated and they are among the first to be expended for the \u201cgreater good\u201d. Their anger is harnessed and channeled to the designated objects, yet they are carefully guarded not to cross the line and overdo the \u201cjob\u201d. Fenqing are not patriots Over about a hundred years since 1840, China was bullied, humiliated and brutally invaded by the industrialized western powers. China is the longest continuation of a civilization, and for centuries, it was leading the world by its economic development and technological inventions. The enormous suffering and humiliation over a century deeply hurt Chinese people, and it became a national dream of China to drive out the western invaders and colonizers and stand tall in the world again with dignity and glory. Undeniably, this is the root of Chinese patriotism and nationalism. In a justified hostility toward the past western colonizers and invaders (especially Japanese), Fenqing are a group people who turn a blind eye to the domestic problems or simply attribute everything bad to the imperialists. They are conveniently absent when shoddy buildings collapsed, when farmers are displaced and the Internet is turning into a GLAN (the Great Local Area Network). Fenqing are not qualified to be called patriots for the simple reason they are ignorant of three simple political concepts I mentioned above. They are party-triots. Who produced Fenqing? When I played a movie about the war in Iraq \u2014 No End in Sight \u2013to a group of young college students, a student came up to me and said: \u201cOur teacher of Mideast history told us Saddam was a national hero of Iraq, and people lived a prosperous and a happy life under his regime.\u201d I was surprised to hear what she said, and told her what Saddam did to Kurdish population in northern Iraq and the fact that he was once supported by the U.S. government during Iran-Iraq War.  Will Fenqing remain to be Fenqing forever? No. I was a Fenqing myself several years ago (anti-Japan), but now I moved on. Fenqing can\u2019t survive very long after they are exposed to the realities and truth. Once Fenqing enter the society, see more and get busy making a living, they will change. By the way, the Internet is a catalyst to <em>quicken</em> the conversion of Fenqing. (Ngu\u1ed3n: http://www.thinkweird.info/216/what-is-a-fenqing)",

            "en": "THE LAW OF LIFE \u2013 JACK LONDON      The old Indian was sitting on the snow. It was Koskoosh, former chief of his tribe. Now, all he could do was sit and listen to the others. His eyes were old. He could not see, but his ears were wide open to every sound. \u201cAha.\u201d That was the sound of his daughter, Sit-cum-to-ha. She was beating the dogs, trying to make them stand in front of the snow sleds. He was forgotten by her, and by the others, too. They had to look for new hunting grounds. The long, snowy ride waited. The days of the northlands were growing short. The tribe could not wait for death. Koskoosh was dying. The stiff, crackling noises of frozen animal skins told him that the chief\u2019s tent was being torn down. The chief was a mighty hunter. He was his son, the son of Koskoosh. Koskoosh was being left to die. As the women worked, old Koskoosh could hear his son\u2019s voice drive them to work faster. He listened harder. It was the last time he would hear that voice. A child cried, and a woman sang softly to quiet it. The child was Koo-tee, the old man thought, a sickly child. It would die soon, and they would burn a hole in the frozen ground to bury it. They would cover its small body with stones to keep the wolves away. \u201cWell, what of it? A few years, and in the end, death. Death waited ever hungry. Death had the hungriest stomach of all.\u201d Koskoosh listened to other sounds he would hear no more: the men tying strong leather rope around the sleds to hold their belongings; the sharp sounds of leather whips, ordering the dogs to move and pull the sleds. \u201cListen to the dogs cry. How they hated the work.\u201d They were off. Sled after sled moved slowly away into the silence. They had passed out of his life. He must meet his last hour alone. \u201cBut what was that?\u201d The snow packed down hard under someone\u2019s shoes. A man stood beside him, and placed a hand gently on his old head. His son was good to do this. He remembered other old men whose sons had not done this, who had left without a goodbye. His mind traveled into the past until his son\u2019s voice brought him back. \u201cIt is well with you?\u201d his son asked. And the old man answered, \u201cIt is well.\u201d \u201cThere is wood next to you and the fire burns bright,\u201d the son said. \u201cThe morning is gray and the cold is here. It will snow soon. Even now it is snowing. Ahh, even now it is snowing. \u201cThe tribesmen hurry. Their loads are heavy and their stomachs flat from little food. The way is long and they travel fast. I go now. All is well?\u201d \u201cIt is well. I am as last year\u2019s leaf that sticks to the tree. The first breath that blows will knock me to the ground. My voice is like an old woman\u2019s. My eyes no longer show me the way my feet go. I am tired and all is well.\u201d He lowered his head to his chest and listened to the snow as his son rode away. He felt the sticks of wood next to him again. One by one, the fire would eat them. And step by step, death would cover him. When the last stick was gone, the cold would come. First, his feet would freeze. Then, his hands. The cold would travel slowly from the outside to the inside of him, and he would rest. It was easy\u2026all men must die. He felt sorrow, but he did not think of his sorrow. It was the way of life. He had lived close to the earth, and the law was not new to him. It was the law of the body. Nature was not kind to the body. She was not thoughtful of the person alone. She was interested only in the group, the race, the species. This was a deep thought for old Koskoosh. He had seen examples of it in all his life. The tree sap in early spring; the new-born green leaf, soft and fresh as skin; the fall of the yellowed, dry leaf. In this alone was all history. He placed another stick on the fire and began to remember his past. He had been a great chief, too. He had seen days of much food and laughter; fat stomachs when food was left to rot and spoil; times when they left animals alone, unkilled; days when women had many children. And he had seen days of no food and empty stomachs, days when the fish did not come, and the animals were hard to find. For seven years the animals did not come. Then, he remembered when as a small boy how he watched the wolves kill a moose. He was with his friend Zing-ha, who was killed later in the Yukon River. Ah, but the moose. Zing-ha and he had gone out to play that day. Down by the river they saw fresh steps of a big, heavy moose. \u201cHe\u2019s an old one,\u201d Zing-ha had said. \u201cHe cannot run like the others. He has fallen behind. The wolves have separated him from the others. They will never leave him.\u201d And so it was. By day and night, never stopping, biting at his nose, biting at his feet, the wolves stayed with him until the end. Zing-ha and he had felt the blood <em>quicken</em> in their bodies. The end would be a sight to see. They had followed the steps of the moose and the wolves. Each step told a different story. They could see the tragedy as it happened: here was the place the moose stopped to fight. The snow was packed down for many feet. One wolf had been caught by the heavy feet of the moose and kicked to death. Further on, they saw how the moose had struggled to escape up a hill. But the wolves had attacked from behind. The moose had fallen down and crushed two wolves. Yet, it was clear the end was near. The snow was red ahead of them. Then they heard the sounds of battle. He and Zing-ha moved closer, on their stomachs, so the wolves would not see them. They saw the end. The picture was so strong it had stayed with him all his life. His dull, blind eyes saw the end again as they had in the far off past. For long, his mind saw his past. The fire began to die out, and the cold entered his body. He placed two more sticks on it, just two more left. This would be how long he would live. It was very lonely. He placed one of the last pieces of wood on the fire. Listen, what a strange noise for wood to make in the fire. No, it wasn\u2019t wood. His body shook as he recognized the sound\u2026wolves. The cry of a wolf brought the picture of the old moose back to him again. He saw the body torn to pieces, with fresh blood running on the snow. He saw the clean bones lying gray against the frozen blood. He saw the rushing forms of the gray wolves, their shinning eyes, their long wet tongues and sharp teeth. And he saw them form a circle and move ever slowly closer and closer. A cold, wet nose touched his face. At the touch, his soul jumped forward to awaken him. His hand went to the fire and he pulled a burning stick from it. The wolf saw the fire, but was not afraid. It turned and howled into the air to his brother wolves. They answered with hunger in their throats, and came running. The old Indian listened to the hungry wolves. He heard them form a circle around him and his small fire. He waved his burning stick at them, but they did not move away. Now, one of them moved closer, slowly, as if to test the old man\u2019s strength. Another and another followed. The circle grew smaller and smaller. Not one wolf stayed behind. Why should he fight? Why cling to life? And he dropped his stick with the fire on the end of it. It fell in the snow and the light went out. The circle of wolves moved closer. Once again the old Indian saw the picture of the moose as it struggled before the end came. He dropped his head to his knees. What did it matter after all? Isn\u2019t this the law of life?",
