            "en": "Are the CIVETS group of countries the next big investment opportunity or nothing more than a convenient acronym? \u00a0 Ten years after Brazil, Russia, India and China were dubbed the BRICs, any early mover advantage for investing in them has long gone. But lovers of acronyms will be relieved to learn the latest investment theme claiming to steal a march on emerging markets also has a catchy name. \u00a0\n The CIVETS group of countries\u2014Colombia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Egypt, Turkey and South Africa\u2014are being touted as the next generation of tiger economies, even if they are named after a rather more shy and retiring <em>feline</em>. They all have large, young populations, with an average age of 27. This, or so the theory goes, means the countries that make up CIVETS will benefit from fast-rising domestic consumption. They are also all fast-growing, relatively diverse economies, which means, unlike the BRICs, they should be less heavily dependent on external demand.  \u00a0 HSBC Global Asset Management launched the first fund specifically targeting the group of countries, its GIF CIVETS fund, in May. HSBC points to rising levels of foreign direct investment across the CIVETS grouping, low levels of public debt\u2014with the exception of Turkey\u2014and sovereign credit ratings improving towards investment grade. Critics point out that CIVETS countries have nothing in common beyond their youthful populations. Furthermore, liquidity and corporate governance are patchy and political risk remains a factor, particularly in Egypt.  \u00a0 \"This sounds like a gimmick to me,\" says Darius McDermott, investment expert at Chelsea Financial Services. \"What does Egypt have in common with Vietnam? At least the BRIC countries were the four biggest emerging economies so there was some rationale for grouping them together. A general emerging markets fund would be a less risky way to get similar exposure.\" \u00a0 But early numbers suggest that while Colombia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Egypt, Turkey and South Africa make strange bedfellows, CIVETS investors could prosper. Although it was only established in 2007, the S&P CIVETS 60 index is ahead of the S&P BRIC 40 and S&P Emerging BMI over one and three years. While investing in acronyms is not always the most sensible approach, it seems the CIVETS might just pay off. \u00a0 \nColombia\n \u00a0 Colombia is emerging as an attractive destination for investors as it works to distance itself from its troubled past. Elected in 2010, President Juan Manuel Santos has continued the center-right policies of former President Alvaro Uribe, prioritizing security and attracting overseas investors.  \u00a0 Improved security measures have led to a 90% fall in kidnappings and a 46% cut in the murder rate over the last decade, which has helped per capita gross domestic product to double since 2002. Meanwhile, Colombia's sovereign debt was promoted to investment grade by all three ratings agencies this year. \u00a0 With a population of 46 million, Colombia has substantial oil, coal and natural gas deposits. Other industries include textiles, coffee, nickel and emeralds.  \u00a0 Foreign direct investment stood at $6.8 billion (\u20ac4.8 billion) in 2010, with the U.S. its principal partner. \u00a0 HSBC Global Asset Management sees potential in Bancolombia, the country's largest private bank, which has turned in a return on equity over 19% for each of the last eight years. \u00a0 \nIndonesia\n \u00a0 The world's fourth-most populous nation, Indonesia's massive domestic consumer market helped it weather the global financial crisis better than most. Turning in a GDP growth rate of 4.5% in 2009, it bounced back above the 6% mark the following year and is predicted to stay there for the next few years at least. Its sovereign debt rating has risen to one notch below investment grade in the last year. \u00a0 With the lowest unit labor costs in the Asia-Pacific region and a government ambitious to emerge as a credible manufacturing hub it is no surprise some analysts see this country of 240 million people as the next BRIC.  \u00a0 But corruption remains a problem and fund managers see exposure best achieved through local subsidiaries of multinationals. Andy Brown, investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management holds Astra International, an auto conglomerate that is majority-owned by Jardine Matheson Group. \"We expect Astra International to benefit from the strong growth in domestic consumption, particularly through the sale of motorbikes,\" says Mr. Brown. \u00a0 \nVietnam\n \u00a0 Vietnam has been one of the fastest growing economies in the world for the past 20 years, with the World Bank projecting 6% GDP growth this year rising to 7.2% in 2013. Its population of 90 million and proximity to China have led some analysts to describe it as a potential new manufacturing hub.  \u00a0 But while communist Vietnam has been moving away from a centrally planned economy for some years now, it only became a member of the World Trade Organization in 2007 and foreign investors still face significant obstacles. \"The reality is that investing in Vietnam is still a very laborious process,\" Mr. Brown says. \u00a0 Cynics suggest Vietnam is better viewed as a holiday destination than an investment opportunity and it is only included within the CIVETS to make the acronym work. Even HSBC's fund only has a 1.5% target allocation to the country. It currently holds Vietnam Dairy (Vinamilk), which it sees as well positioned to benefit from Vietnam's 10% a year growth in demand for dairy products. \u00a0 \nEgypt\n \u00a0 Revolution may have put the brakes on the Egyptian economy for the moment, but analysts expect it to regain its growth trajectory as soon as political stability returns. \u00a0 The World Bank is predicting growth of just 1% this year as a consequence of Egypt's part in the Arab Spring. That compares to 5.2% last year and pre-recession levels of 7% or more. But whenever normal business is resumed, Egypt will be in a position to capitalize on its many advantages. These include fast growing ports on the Mediterranean and Red Sea linked by the Suez Canal and its vast untapped natural gas resources. Some analysts describe it as \"the new Turkey\".  \u00a0 As with other CIVETS countries, Egypt has a big, young population\u201482 million strong and with a median age of 25. Aberdeen Asset Management sees bank NSGB, a subsidiary of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, as well positioned to take advantage of Egypt's underdeveloped domestic consumption, importing a model it runs in Eastern Europe. \"There is a structural under-penetration of people borrowing money in Egypt,\" Mr. Brown says. \u00a0 \nTurkey\n \u00a0 Located between Europe and major energy producers in the Middle East, Caspian Sea and Russia, Turkey's growth prospects look strong. The World Bank expects GDP growth of 6.1% this year, falling back to 5.3% in 2013. That said, its economy contracted 4.7% in 2009, revealing its vulnerability to external shocks. \u00a0 Turkey has relatively few natural resources of its own, but it has a diversified economy as well as major natural gas pipeline projects which make it an important energy corridor between Europe and Central Asia.  \u00a0 \"Turkey is a dynamic economy that has trading links with the European Union but without the constraints of the euro zone or EU membership,\" says Phil Poole of HSBC Global Asset Management.  \u00a0 Mr. Poole rates national air carrier Turk Hava Yollari as a good investment, while Mr. Brown prefers domestic consumption plays through fast-growing retailer BIM, which has grown from 21 to over 2,600 stores in 15 years, and Anadolu Group, which owns brewer Efes Beer Group. \u00a0 \nSouth Africa\n \u00a0 Already the most developed country on the continent by a long way, South Africa has become a diversified economy, being rich in resources like gold and platinum and also attracting manufacturing investment.  \u00a0 Rising commodity prices, renewed demand in its automotive and chemical industries and spending on the World Cup have helped South Africa back into growth after it slipped into recession during the global economic downturn.  \u00a0 Developed world-standard financial, legal and accounting institutions mean corporate governance is of as high a standard in South Africa as in any other emerging market country. They also make the country a gateway to investment into the rest of Africa. \u00a0 HSBC Global Asset Management sees long-term growth potential in mining, energy and chemical firm Sasol. South Africa's fast-growing middle class makes domestic consumption an attractive theme, says Mr. Brown. He favors Massmart, the retailer Walmart bought 51% of earlier this year.",

            "en": "18         18. THE HUNT They emerged one by one from the forest edge, ranging a dozen meters apart. The first male into the clearing fell back immediately, allowing the other male to take the front, orienting himself around the tall, dark-haired man in a manner that clearly displayed who led the pack. The third was a woman; from this distance, all I could see of her was that her hair was a startling shade of red. They closed ranks before they continued cautiously toward Edward's family, exhibiting the natural respect of a troop of predators as it encounters a larger, unfamiliar group of its own kind. As they approached, I could see how different they were from the Cullens. Their walk was catlike, a gait that seemed constantly on the edge of shifting into a crouch. They dressed in the ordinary gear of backpackers:\u00a0 jeans and casual button-down shirts in heavy, weatherproof fabrics. The clothes were frayed, though, with wear, and they were barefoot. Both men had cropped hair, but the woman's brilliant orange hair was filled with leaves and debris from the woods. Their sharp eyes carefully took in the more polished, urbane stance of Carlisle, who, flanked by Emmett and Jasper, stepped guardedly forward to meet them. Without any seeming communication between them, they each straightened into a more casual, erect bearing. The man in front was easily the most beautiful, his skin olive-toned beneath the typical pallor, his hair a glossy black. He was of a medium build, hard-muscled, of course, but nothing next to Emmett's brawn. He smiled an easy smile, exposing a flash of gleaming white teeth. The woman was wilder, her eyes shifting restlessly between the men facing her, and the loose grouping around me, her chaotic hair quivering in the slight breeze. Her posture was distinctly <em>feline</em>. The second male hovered unobtrusively behind them, slighter than the leader, his light brown hair and regular features both nondescript. His eyes, though completely still, somehow seemed the most vigilant. Their eyes were different, too. Not the gold or black I had come to expect, but a deep burgundy color that was disturbing and sinister. The dark-haired man, still smiling, stepped toward Carlisle.  \"We thought we heard a game,\" he said in a relaxed voice with the slightest of French accents. \"I'm Laurent, these are Victoria and James.\" He gestured to the vampires beside him. \"I'm Carlisle. This is my family, Emmett and Jasper, Rosalie, Esme and Alice, Edward and Bella.\" He pointed us out in groups, deliberately not calling attention to individuals. I felt a shock when he said my name. \"Do you have room for a few more players?\" Laurent asked sociably. Carlisle matched Laurent's friendly tone. \"Actually, we were just finishing up. But we'd certainly be interested another time. Are you planning to stay in the area for long?\" \"We're headed north, in fact, but we were curious to see who was in the neighborhood. We haven't run into any company in a long time.\" \"No, this region is usually empty except for us and the occasional visitor, like yourselves.\" The tense atmosphere had slowly subsided into a casual conversation; I guessed that Jasper was using his peculiar gift to control the situation. \"What's your hunting range?\" Laurent casually inquired. Carlisle ignored the assumption behind the inquiry. \"The Olympic Range here, up and down the Coast Ranges on occasion. We keep a permanent residence nearby. There's another permanent settlement like ours up near Denali.\" Laurent rocked back on his heels slightly. \"Permanent? How do you manage that?\" There was honest curiosity in his voice. \"Why don't you come back to our home with us and we can talk comfortably?\" Carlisle invited. \"It's a rather long story.\" James and Victoria exchanged a surprised look at the mention of the word \"home,\" but Laurent controlled his expression better. \"That sounds very interesting, and welcome.\" His smile was genial. \"We've been on the hunt all the way down from Ontario, and we haven't had the chance to clean up in a while.\" His eyes moved appreciatively over Carlisle's refined appearance. \"Please don't take offense, but we'd appreciate it if you'd refrain from hunting in this immediate area. We have to stay inconspicuous, you understand,\" Carlisle explained. \"Of course.\" Laurent nodded. \"We certainly won't encroach on your territory. We just ate outside of Seattle, anyway,\" he laughed. A shiver ran up my spine. \"We'll show you the way if you'd like to run with us \u2014 Emmett and Alice, you can go with Edward and Bella to get the Jeep,\" he casually added. Three things seemed to happen simultaneously while Carlisle was speaking. My hair ruffled with the light breeze, Edward stiffened, and the second male, James, suddenly whipped his head around, scrutinizing me, his nostrils flaring. A swift rigidity fell on all of them as James lurched one step forward into a crouch. Edward bared his teeth, crouching in defense, a feral snarl ripping from his throat. It was nothing like the playful sounds I'd heard from him this morning; it was the single most menacing thing I had ever heard, and chills ran from the crown of my head to the back of my heels. \"What's this?\" Laurent exclaimed in open surprise. Neither James nor Edward relaxed their aggressive poses. James feinted slightly to the side, and Edward shifted in response. \"She's with us.\" Carlisle's firm rebuff was directed toward James. Laurent seemed to catch my scent less powerfully than James, but awareness now dawned on his face. \"You brought a snack?\" he asked, his expression incredulous as he took an involuntary step forward. Edward snarled even more ferociously, harshly, his lip curling high above his glistening, bared teeth. Laurent stepped back again. \"I said she's with us,\" Carlisle corrected in a hard voice. \"But she's human,\" Laurent protested. The words were not at all aggressive, merely astounded. \"Yes.\" Emmett was very much in evidence at Carlisle's side, his eyes on James. James slowly straightened out of his crouch, but his eyes never left me, his nostrils still wide. Edward stayed tensed like a lion in front of me. When Laurent spoke, his tone was soothing \u2014 trying to defuse the sudden hostility. \"It appears we have a lot to learn about each other.\" \"Indeed.\" Carlisle's voice was still cool. \"But we'd like to accept your invitation.\" His eyes flicked toward me and back to Carlisle. \"And, of course, we will not harm the human girl. We won't hunt in your range, as I said.\" James glanced in disbelief and aggravation at Laurent and exchanged another brief look with Victoria, whose eyes still flickered edgily from face to face. Carlisle measured Laurent's open expression for a moment before he spoke. \"We'll show you the way. Jasper, Rosalie, Esme?\" he called. They gathered together, blocking me from view as they converged. Alice was instantly at my side, and Emmett fell back slowly, his eyes locked on James as he backed toward us. \"Let's go, Bella.\" Edward's voice was low and bleak. This whole time I'd been rooted in place, terrified into absolute immobility. Edward had to grip my elbow and pull sharply to break my trance. Alice and Emmett were close behind us, hiding me. I stumbled alongside Edward, still stunned with fear. I couldn't hear if the main group had left yet. Edward's impatience was almost tangible as we moved at human speed to the forest edge. Once we were into the trees, Edward slung me over his back without breaking stride. I gripped as tightly as possible as he took off, the others close on his heels. I kept my head down, but my eyes, wide with fright, wouldn't close. They plunged through the now-black forest like wraiths. The sense of exhilaration that usually seemed to possess Edward as he ran was completely absent, replaced by a fury that consumed him and drove him still faster. Even with me on his back, the others trailed behind. We reached the Jeep in an impossibly short time, and Edward barely slowed as he flung me in the backseat. \"Strap her in,\" he ordered Emmett, who slid in beside me. Alice was already in the front seat, and Edward was starting the engine. It roared to life and we swerved backward, spinning around to face the winding road. Edward was growling something too fast for me to understand, but it sounded a lot like a string of profanities. The jolting trip was much worse this time, and the darkness only made it more frightening. Emmett and Alice both glared out the side windows. We hit the main road, and though our speed increased, I could see much better where we were going. And we were headed south, away from Forks. \"Where are we going?\" I asked. No one answered. No one even looked at me. \"Dammit, Edward! Where are you taking me?\" \"We have to get you away from here \u2014 far away \u2014 now.\" He didn't look back, his eyes on the road. The speedometer read a hundred and five miles an hour. \"Turn around! You have to take me home!\" I shouted. I struggled with the stupid harness, tearing at the straps. \"Emmett,\" Edward said grimly. And Emmett secured my hands in his steely grasp. \"No! Edward! No, you can't do this.\" \"I have to, Bella, now please be quiet.\" \"I won't! You have to take me back \u2014 Charlie will call the FBI! They'll be all over your family \u2014 Carlisle and Esme! They'll have to leave, to hide forever!\" \"Calm down, Bella.\" His voice was cold. \"We've been there before.\" \"Not over me, you don't! You're not ruining everything over me!\" I struggled violently, with total futility. Alice spoke for the first time. \"Edward, pull over.\" He flashed her a hard look, and then sped up. \"Edward, let's just talk this through.\" \"You don't understand,\" he roared in frustration. I'd never heard his voice so loud; it was deafening in the confines of the Jeep. The speedometer neared one hundred and fifteen. \"He's a tracker, Alice, did you see that? He's a tracker!\" I felt Emmett stiffen next to me, and I wondered at his reaction to the word. It meant something more to the three of them than it did to me; I wanted to understand, but there was no opening for me to ask. \"Pull over, Edward.\" Alice's tone was reasonable, but there was a ring of authority in it I'd never heard before. The speedometer inched passed one-twenty. \"Do it, Edward.\" \"Listen to me, Alice. I saw his mind. Tracking is his passion, his obsession \u2014 and he wants her, Alice \u2014 her, specifically. He begins the hunt tonight.\" \"He doesn't know where \u2014\" He interrupted her. \"How long do you think it will take him to cross her scent in town? His plan was already set before the words were out of Laurent's mouth.\" I gasped, knowing where my scent would lead. \"Charlie! You can't leave him there! You can't leave him!\" I thrashed against the harness. \"She's right,\" Alice said. The car slowed slightly. \"Let's just look at our options for a minute,\" Alice coaxed. The car slowed again, more noticeably, and then suddenly we screeched to a stop on the shoulder of the highway. I flew against the harness, and then slammed back into the seat. \"There are no options,\" Edward hissed. \"I'm not leaving Charlie!\" I yelled. He ignored me completely. \"We have to take her back,\" Emmett finally spoke. \"No.\" Edward was absolute. \"He's no match for us, Edward. He won't be able to touch her.\" \"He'll wait.\" Emmett smiled. \"I can wait, too.\" \"You didn't see \u2014 you don't understand. Once he commits to a hunt, he's unshakable. We'd have to kill him.\" Emmett didn't seem upset by the idea. \"That's an option.\" \"And the female. She's with him. If it turns into a fight, the leader will go with them, too.\" \"There are enough of us.\" \"There's another option,\" Alice said quietly. Edward turned on her in fury, his voice a blistering snarl. \"There \u2014 is \u2014 no \u2014 other \u2014 option!\" Emmett and I both stared at him in shock, but Alice seemed unsurprised. The silence lasted for a long minute as Edward and Alice stared each other down. I broke it. \"Does anyone want to hear my plan?\" \"No,\" Edward growled. Alice glared at him, finally provoked. \"Listen,\" I pleaded. \"You take me back.\" \"No,\" he interrupted. I glared at him and continued. \"You take me back. I tell my dad I want to go home to Phoenix. I pack my bags. We wait till this tracker is watching, and then we run. He'll follow us and leave Charlie alone. Charlie won't call the FBI on your family. Then you can take me any damned place you want.\" They stared at me, stunned. \"It's not a bad idea, really.\" Emmett's surprise was definitely an insult. \"It might work \u2014 and we simply can't leave her father unprotected. You know that,\" Alice said. Everyone looked at Edward. \"It's too dangerous \u2014 I don't want him within a hundred miles of her.\" Emmett was supremely confident. \"Edward, he's not getting through us.\" Alice thought for a minute. \"I don't see him attacking. He'll try to wait for us to leave her alone.\" \"It won't take long for him to realize that's not going to happen.\" \"I demand that you take me home.\" I tried to sound firm. Edward pressed his fingers to his temples and squeezed his eyes shut. \"Please,\" I said in a much smaller voice. He didn't look up. When he spoke, his voice sounded worn. \"You're leaving tonight, whether the tracker sees or not. You tell Charlie that you can't stand another minute in Forks. Tell him whatever story works. Pack the first things your hands touch, and then get in your truck. I don't care what he says to you. You have fifteen minutes. Do you hear me? Fifteen minutes from the time you cross the doorstep.\" The Jeep rumbled to life, and he spun us around, the tires squealing. The needle on the speedometer started to race up the dial.  \"Emmett?\" I asked, looking pointedly at my hands. \"Oh, sorry.\" He let me loose. A few minutes passed in silence, other than the roar of the engine. Then Edward spoke again. \"This is how it's going to happen. When we get to the house, if the tracker is not there, I will walk her to the door. Then she has fifteen minutes.\" He glared at me in the rearview mirror. \"Emmett, you take the outside of the house. Alice, you get the truck. I'll be inside as long as she is. After she's out, you two can take the Jeep home and tell Carlisle.\" \"No way,\" Emmett broke in. \"I'm with you.\" \"Think it through, Emmett. I don't know how long I'll be gone.\" \"Until we know how far this is going to go, I'm with you.\" Edward sighed. \"If the tracker is there,\" he continued grimly, \"we keep driving.\" \"We're going to make it there before him,\" Alice said confidently. Edward seemed to accept that. Whatever his problem with Alice was, he didn't doubt her now. \"What are we going to do with the Jeep?\" she asked. His voice had a hard edge. \"You're driving it home.\" \"No, I'm not,\" she said calmly. The unintelligible stream of profanities started again. \"We can't all fit in my truck,\" I whispered. Edward didn't appear to hear me. \"I think you should let me go alone,\" I said even more quietly. He heard that. \"Bella, please just do this my way, just this once,\" he said between clenched teeth. \"Listen, Charlie's not an imbecile,\" I protested. \"If you're not in town tomorrow, he's going to get suspicious.\" \"That's irrelevant. We'll make sure he's safe, and that's all that matters.\" \"Then what about this tracker? He saw the way you acted tonight. He's going to think you're with me, wherever you are.\" Emmett looked at me, insultingly surprised again. \"Edward, listen to her,\" he urged. \"I think she's right.\" \"Yes, she is,\" Alice agreed. \"I can't do that.\" Edward's voice was icy. \"Emmett should stay, too,\" I continued. \"He definitely got an eyeful of Emmett.\" \"What?\" Emmett turned on me. \"You'll get a better crack at him if you stay,\" Alice agreed. Edward stared at her incredulously. \"You think I should let her go alone?\" \"Of course not,\" Alice said. \"Jasper and I will take her.\" \"I can't do that,\" Edward repeated, but this time there was a trace of defeat in his voice. The logic was working on him. I tried to be persuasive. \"Hang out here for a week \u2014\" I saw his expression in the mirror and amended \"\u2014 a few days. Let Charlie see you haven't kidnapped me, and lead this James on a wild-goose chase. Make\u00a0 sure he's completely off my trail. Then come and meet me. Take a roundabout route, of course, and then Jasper and Alice can go home.\" I could see him beginning to consider it. \"Meet you where?\" \"Phoenix.\" Of course. \"No. He'll hear that's where you're going,\" he said impatiently. \"And you'll make it look like that's a ruse, obviously. He'll know that we'll know that he's listening. He'll never believe I'm actually going where I say I am going.\" \"She's diabolical,\" Emmett chuckled. \"And if that doesn't work?\" \"There are several million people in Phoenix,\" I informed him. \"It's not that hard to find a phone book.\" \"I won't go home.\" \"Oh?\" he inquired, a dangerous note in his voice. \"I'm quite old enough to get my own place.\" \"Edward, we'll be with her,\" Alice reminded him. \"What are you going to do in Phoenix?\" he asked her scathingly. \"Stay indoors.\" \"I kind of like it.\" Emmett was thinking about cornering James, no doubt. \"Shut up, Emmett.\" \"Look, if we try to take him down while she's still around, there's a much better chance that someone will get hurt \u2014 she'll get hurt, or you will, trying to protect her. Now, if we get him alone\u2026\" He trailed off with a slow smile. I was right. The Jeep was crawling slowly along now as we drove into town. Despite my brave talk, I could feel the hairs on my arms standing up. I thought about Charlie, alone in the house, and tried to be courageous. \"Bella.\" Edward's voice was very soft. Alice and Emmett looked out their windows. \"If you let anything happen to yourself\u2014 anything at all \u2014 I'm holding you personally responsible. Do you understand that?\" \"Yes,\" I gulped. He turned to Alice. \"Can Jasper handle this?\" \"Give him some credit, Edward. He's been doing very, very well, all things considered.\" \"Can you handle this?\" he asked. And graceful little Alice pulled back her lips in a horrific grimace and let loose with a guttural snarl that had me cowering against the seat in terror. Edward smiled at her. \"But keep your opinions to yourself,\" he muttered suddenly.",

Isn\u2019t it getting any better?\u201d His warm hand curled around mine. \u201cIt\u2019s not so bad,\u201d he said, but he wouldn\u2019t meet my eyes. He walked slowly back to the driftwood bench, staring at the rainbow-colored pebbles, and pulling me along at his side. I sat back down on our tree, but he sat on the wet, rocky ground rather than next to me. I wondered if it was so that he could hide his face more easily. He kept my hand. I started babbling to fill the silence. \u201cIt\u2019s been so long since I was here. I\u2019ve probably missed a ton of things. How are Sam and Emily? And Embry? Did Quil \u2014?\u201d I broke off mid-sentence, remembering that Jacob\u2019s friend Quil had been a sensitive subject. \u201cAh, Quil,\u201d Jacob sighed. So then it must have happened \u2014 Quil must have joined the pack. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I mumbled.

Totally thrilled.\u201d This made no sense to me. All the other wolves had been so depressed at the idea of their friend sharing their fate. \u201cHuh?\u201d Jacob tilted his head back to look at me. He smiled and rolled his eyes.    \u201cQuil thinks it\u2019s the coolest thing that\u2019s ever happened to him. Part of it is finally knowing what\u2019s going on. And he\u2019s excited to have his friends back \u2014 to be part of the \u2018in crowd.\u2019\u201d Jacob snorted again. \u201cShouldn\u2019t be surprised, I guess. It\u2019s so Quil.\u201d \u201cHe likes it?\u201d \u201cHonestly . . . most of them do,\u201d Jacob admitted slowly. \u201cThere are definitely good sides to this \u2014 the speed, the freedom, the strength . . . the sense of \u2014 of family . . . . Sam and I are the only ones who ever felt really bitter. And Sam got past that a long time ago. So I\u2019m the crybaby now.\u201d Jacob laughed at himself. There were so many things I wanted to know. \u201cWhy are you and Sam different? What happened to Sam anyway? What\u2019s his problem?\u201d The questions tumbled out without room to answer them, and Jacob laughed again. \u201cThat\u2019s a long story.\u201d \u201cI told you a long story. Besides, I\u2019m not in any hurry to get back,\u201d I said, and then I grimaced as I thought of the trouble I would be in. He looked up at me swiftly, hearing the double edge in my words. \u201cWill he be mad at you?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d I admitted. \u201cHe really hates it when I do things he considers . . . risky.\u201d \u201cLike hanging out with werewolves.\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d Jacob shrugged. \u201cSo don\u2019t go back. I\u2019ll sleep on the couch.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a great idea,\u201d I grumbled. \u201cBecause then he would come looking for me.\u201d Jacob stiffened, and then smiled bleakly. \u201cWould he?\u201d \u201cIf he was afraid I was hurt or something \u2014 probably.\u201d \u201cMy idea\u2019s sounding better all the time.\u201d \u201cPlease, Jake. That really bugs me.\u201d \u00a0\u201cWhat does?\u201d \u201cThat you two are so ready to kill each other!\u201d I complained. \u201cIt makes me crazy. Why can\u2019t you both just be civilized?\u201d \u201cIs he ready to kill me?\u201d Jacob asked with a grim smile, unconcerned by my anger. \u201cNot like you seem to be!\u201d I realized I was yelling. \u201cAt least he can be a grown-up about this. He knows that hurting you would hurt me \u2014 and so he never would. You don\u2019t seem to care about that at all!\u201d \u201cYeah, right,\u201d Jacob muttered. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s quite the pacifist.\u201d \u201cUgh!\u201d I ripped my hand out of his and shoved his head away. Then I pulled my knees up to my chest and wrapped my arms tightly around them. I glared out toward the horizon, fuming. Jacob was quiet for a few minutes. Finally, he got up off the ground and sat beside me, putting his arm around my shoulders. I shook it off. \u201cSorry,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI\u2019ll try to behave myself.\u201d I didn\u2019t answer. \u201cDo you still want to hear about Sam?\u201d he offered. I shrugged. \u00a0\u201cLike I said, it\u2019s a long story. And very . . . strange. There\u2019re so many strange things about this new life. I haven\u2019t had time to tell you the half of it. And this thing with Sam \u2014 well, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll even be able to explain it right.\u201d His words pricked my curiosity in spite of my irritation. \u201cI\u2019m listening,\u201d I said stiffly. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the side of his face pull up in a smile. \u201cSam had it so much harder than the rest of us. Because he was the first, and he was alone, and he didn\u2019t have anyone to tell him what was happening. Sam\u2019s grandfather died before he was born, and his father has never been around. There was no one there to recognize the signs. The first time it happened \u2014 the first time he phased \u2014 he thought he\u2019d gone insane. It took him two weeks to calm down enough to change back. \u00a0\u201cThis was before you came to Forks, so you wouldn\u2019t remember. Sam\u2019s mother and Leah Clearwater had the forest rangers searching for him, the police. People thought there had been an accident or something. . . .\u201d \u201cLeah?\u201d I asked, surprised. Leah was Harry\u2019s daughter. Hearing her name sent an automatic surge of pity through me. Harry Clearwater, Charlie\u2019s life-long friend, had died of a heart attack this past spring. His voice changed, became heavier. \u201cYeah. Leah and Sam were high school sweethearts. They started dating when she was just a freshman. She was frantic when he disappeared.\u201d \u201cBut he and Emily \u2014\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll get to that \u2014 it\u2019s part of the story,\u201d he said. He inhaled slowly, and then exhaled in a gust. I supposed it was silly for me to imagine that Sam had never loved anyone before Emily. Most people fall in and out of love many times in their lives. It was just that I\u2019d seen Sam with Emily, and I couldn\u2019t imagine him with someone else. The way he looked at her . . . well, it reminded me of a look I\u2019d seen sometimes in Edward\u2019s eyes \u2014 when he was looking at me. \u00a0\u201cSam came back,\u201d Jacob said, \u201cbut he wouldn\u2019t talk to anyone about where he\u2019d been. Rumors flew \u2014 that he was up to no good, mostly. And then Sam happened to run in to Quil\u2019s grandfather one afternoon when Old Quil Ateara came to visit Mrs. Uley. Sam shook his hand. Old Quil just about had a stroke.\u201d Jacob paused to laugh. \u201cWhy?\u201d Jacob put his hand on my cheek and pulled my face around to look at him \u2014 he was leaning toward me, his face was just a few inches away. His palm burned my skin, like he had a fever. \u00a0\u201cOh, right,\u201d I said. It was uncomfortable, having my face so close to his with his hand hot against my skin. \u201cSam was running a temperature.\u201d Jacob laughed again. \u201cSam\u2019s hand felt like he\u2019d left it sitting on a hot stovetop.\u201d He was so close, I could feel his warm breath. I reached up casually, to take his hand away and free my face, but wound my fingers through his so that I wouldn\u2019t hurt his feelings. He smiled and leaned back, undeceived by my attempt at nonchalance. \u201cSo Mr. Ateara went straight to the other elders,\u201d Jacob went on. \u201cThey were the only ones left who still knew, who remembered. Mr. Ateara, Billy, and Harry had actually seen their grandfathers make the change. When Old Quil told them, they met with Sam secretly and explained. \u201cIt was easier when he understood \u2014 when he wasn\u2019t alone anymore. They knew he wouldn\u2019t be the only one affected by the Cullens\u2019 return\u201d \u2014 he pronounced the name with unconscious bitterness \u2014 \u201cbut no one else was old enough. So Sam waited for the rest of us to join him. . . .\u201d  \u201cThe Cullens had no idea,\u201d I said in a whisper. \u201cThey didn\u2019t think that werewolves still existed here. They didn\u2019t know that coming here would change you.\u201d \u201cIt doesn\u2019t change the fact that it did.\u201d \u201cRemind me not to get on your bad side.\u201d \u201cYou think I should be as forgiving as you are? We can\u2019t all be saints and martyrs.\u201d \u201cGrow up, Jacob.\u201d \u00a0\u201cI wish I could,\u201d he murmured quietly. I stared at him, trying to make sense of his response. \u201cWhat?\u201d Jacob chuckled. \u201cOne of those many strange things I mentioned.\u201d \u201cYou . . . can\u2019t . . . grow up?\u201d I said blankly. \u201cYou\u2019re what? Not . . .aging? Is that a joke?\u201d \u201cNope.\u201d He popped his lips on the P. I felt blood flood my face. Tears \u2014 tears of rage \u2014 filled my eyes. My teeth mashed together with an audible grinding sound. \u201cBella? What did I say?\u201d I was on my feet again, my hands balled up into fists, my whole frame shaking. \u201cYou. Are. Not. Aging,\u201d I growled through my teeth. Jacob tugged my arm gently, trying to make me sit. \u201cNone of us are. What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d \u201cAm I the only one who has to get old? I get older every stinking day!\u201d I nearly shrieked, throwing my hands in the air. Some little part of me recognized that I was throwing a Charlie-esque fit, but that rational part was greatly overshadowed by the irrational part. \u201cDamn it! What kind of world is this? Where\u2019s the justice?\u201d \u201cTake it easy, Bella.\u201d \u201cShut up, Jacob. Just shut up! This is so unfair!\u201d \u201cDid you seriously just stamp your foot? I thought girls only did that on TV.\u201d I growled unimpressively. \u201cIt\u2019s not as bad as you seem to think it is. Sit down and I\u2019ll explain.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll stand.\u201d He rolled his eyes. \u201cOkay. Whatever you want. But listen, Iwill get older . . . someday.\u201d \u201cExplain.\u201d He patted the tree. I glowered for a second, but then sat; my temper had burned out as suddenly as it had flared and I\u2019d calmed down enough to realize that I was making a fool of myself. \u201cWhen we get enough control to quit . . . ,\u201d Jacob said. \u201cWhen we stop phasing for a solid length of time, we age again. It\u2019s not easy.\u201d He shook his head, abruptly doubtful. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna take a really long time to learn that kind of restraint, I think. Even Sam\u2019s not there yet. \u2019Course it doesn\u2019t help that there\u2019s a huge coven of vampires right down the road. We can\u2019t even think about quitting when the tribe needs protectors. But you shouldn\u2019t get all bent out of shape about it, anyway, because I\u2019m already older than you, physically at least.\u201d \u00a0\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d \u201cLook at me, Bells. Do I look sixteen?\u201d I glanced up and down his mammoth frame, trying to be unbiased. \u201cNot exactly, I guess.\u201d \u201cNot at all. Because we reach full growth inside of a few months when the werewolf gene gets triggered. It\u2019s one hell of a growth spurt.\u201d He made a face. \u201cPhysically, I\u2019m probably twenty-five or something. So there\u2019s no need for you to freak out about being too old for me for at least another seven years.\u201d Twenty-five or something.The idea messed with my head. But I remembered that growth spurt \u2014 I remembered watching him shoot up and fill out right before my eyes. I remembered how he would look different from one day to the next. . . . I shook my head, feeling dizzy. \u201cSo, did you want to hear about Sam, or did you want to scream at me some more for things that are out of my control?\u201d I took a deep breath. \u201cSorry. Age is a touchy subject for me. That hit a nerve.\u201d Jacob\u2019s eyes tightened, and he looked as if he were trying to decide how to word something. Since I didn\u2019t want to talk about the truly touchy stuff \u2014 my plans for the future, or treaties that might be broken by said plans, I prompted him. \u201cSo once Sam understood what was going on, once he had Billy and Harry and Mr. Ateara, you said it wasn\u2019t so hard anymore. And, like you also said, there are the cool parts. . . .\u201d I hesitated briefly. \u201cWhy does Sam hate them so much? Why does he wish I would hate them?\u201d Jacob sighed. \u201cThis is the really weird part.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a pro at weird.\u201d \u201cYeah, I know.\u201d He grinned before he continued. \u201cSo, you\u2019re right. Sam knew what was going on, and everything was almost okay. In most ways, his life was back to, well, not normal. But better.\u201d Then Jacob\u2019s expression tightened, like something painful was coming. \u201cSam couldn\u2019t tell Leah. We aren\u2019t supposed to tell anyone who doesn\u2019t have to know. And it wasn\u2019t really safe for him to be around her \u2014 but he cheated, just like I did with you. Leah was furious that he wouldn\u2019t tell her what was going on \u2014 where he\u2019d been, where he went at night, why he was always so exhausted \u2014 but they were working it out. They were trying. They really loved each other.\u201d \u201cDid she find out? Is that what happened?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cNo, that wasn\u2019t the problem. Her cousin, Emily Young, came down from the Makah reservation to visit her one weekend.\u201d I gasped. \u201cEmily is Leah\u2019s cousin?\u201d \u201cSecond cousins. They\u2019re close, though. They were like sisters when they were kids.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s . . . horrible. How could Sam . . . ?\u201d I trailed off, shaking my head. \u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t judge him just yet. Did anyone ever tell you . . . Have you ever heard of imprinting ?\u201d \u201cImprinting?\u201d I repeated the unfamiliar word. \u201cNo. What\u2019s that mean?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s one of those bizarre things we have to deal with. It doesn\u2019t happen to everyone. In fact, it\u2019s the rare exception, not the rule. Sam had heard all the stories by then, the stories we all used to think were legends. He\u2019d heard of imprinting, but he never dreamed . . .\u201d \u201cWhat is it?\u201d I prodded. Jacob\u2019s eyes strayed to the ocean. \u201cSam did love Leah. But when he saw Emily, that didn\u2019t matter anymore. Sometimes . . . we don\u2019t exactly know why . . . we find our mates that way.\u201d His eyes flashed back to me, his face reddening. \u201cI mean . . . our soul mates.\u201d \u00a0\u201cWhat way? Love at first sight?\u201d I snickered. Jacob wasn\u2019t smiling. His dark eyes were critical of my reaction. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit more powerful than that. More absolute.\u201d \u201cSorry,\u201d I muttered. \u201cYou\u2019re serious, aren\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cYeah, I am.\u201d \u201cLove at first sight? But more powerful?\u201d My voice still sounded dubious, and he could hear that. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to explain. It doesn\u2019t matter, anyway.\u201d He shrugged indifferently.  \u00a0\u201cYou wanted to know what happened to Sam to make him hate the vampires for changing him, to make him hate himself. And that\u2019s what happened. He broke Leah\u2019s heart. He went back on every promise he\u2019d ever made her. Every day he has to see the accusation in her eyes, and know that she\u2019s right.\u201d He stopped talking abruptly, as if he\u2019d said something he hadn\u2019t meant to. \u201cHow did Emily deal with this? If she was so close to Leah . . . ?\u201d Sam and Emily were utterly right together, two puzzle pieces, shaped for each other exactly. Still . . . how had Emily gotten past the fact that he\u2019d belonged to someone else? Her sister, almost. \u00a0\u201cShe was real angry, in the beginning. But it\u2019s hard to resist that level of commitment and adoration.\u201d Jacob sighed. \u201cAnd then, Sam could tell her everything. There are no rules that can bind you when you find your other half. You know how she got hurt?\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d The story in Forks was that she was mauled by a bear, but I was in on the secret. Werewolves are unstable, Edward had said.The people near them get hurt. \u201cWell, weirdly enough, that was sort of how they resolved things. Sam was so horrified, so sickened by himself, so full of hate for what he\u2019d done. . . . He would have thrown himself under a bus if it would have made her feel better. He might have anyway, just to escape what he\u2019d done. He was shattered. . . . Then, somehow, she was the one comforting him , and after that. . . .\u201d Jacob didn\u2019t finish his thought, and I sensed the story had gotten too personal to share. \u00a0\u201cPoor Emily,\u201d I whispered. \u201cPoor Sam. Poor Leah. . . .\u201d \u201cYeah, Leah got the worst end of the stick,\u201d he agreed. \u201cShe puts on a brave face. She\u2019s going to be a bridesmaid.\u201d I gazed away, toward the jagged rocks that rose from the ocean like stubby broken-off fingers on the south rim of the harbor, while I tried to make sense of it all. I could feel his eyes on my face, waiting for me to say something.   \u201cDid it happen to you?\u201d I finally asked, still looking away. \u201cThis love-at-first-sight thing?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d he answered briskly. \u201cSam and Jared are the only ones.\u201d \u201cHmm,\u201d I said, trying to sound only politely interested. I was relieved, and I tried to explain my reaction to myself. I decided I was just glad he didn\u2019t claim there was some mystical, wolfy connection between the two of us. Our relationship was confusing enough as it was. I didn\u2019t need any more of the supernatural than I already had to deal with. He was quiet, too, and the silence felt a little awkward. My intuition told me that I didn\u2019t want to hear what he was thinking.   \u00a0\u201cHow did that work out for Jared?\u201d I asked to break the silence. \u201cNo drama there. It was just a girl he\u2019d sat next to in school every day for a year and never looked at twice. And then, after he changed, he saw her again and never looked away. Kim was thrilled. She\u2019d had a huge crush on him. She\u2019d had his last name tacked on to the end of hers all over in her diary.\u201d He laughed mockingly. I frowned. \u201cDid Jared tell you that? He shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d  Jacob bit his lip. \u201cI guess I shouldn\u2019t laugh. It was funny, though.\u201d \u201cSome soul mate.\u201d He sighed. \u201cJared didn\u2019t tell us anything on purpose. I already told you this part, remember?\u201d \u201cOh, yeah. You can hear each other\u2019s thoughts, but only when you\u2019re wolves, right?\u201d \u201cRight. Just like your bloodsucker.\u201d He glowered. \u201cEdward,\u201d I corrected. \u00a0\u201cSure, sure. That\u2019s how come I know so much about how Sam felt. It\u2019s not like he would have told us all that if he\u2019d had a choice. Actually, that\u2019s something we all hate.\u201d The bitterness was abruptly harsh in his voice. \u201cIt\u2019s awful. No privacy, no secrets. Everything you\u2019re ashamed of, laid out for everyone to see.\u201d He shuddered. \u201cIt sounds horrible,\u201d I whispered. \u201cIt is sometimes helpful when we need to coordinate,\u201d he said grudgingly. \u201cOnce in a blue moon, when some bloodsucker crosses into our territory. Laurent was fun. And if the Cullens hadn\u2019t gotten in our way last Saturday . . . ugh!\u201d he groaned. \u201cWe could have had her!\u201d His fists clenched into angry balls. I flinched. As much as I worried about Jasper or Emmett getting hurt, it was nothing like the panic I felt at the idea of Jacob going up against Victoria. Emmett and Jasper were the closest thing to indestructible I could imagine. Jacob was still warm, still comparatively human. Mortal. I thought of Jacob facing Victoria, her brilliant hair blowing around her oddly <em>feline</em> face . . . and shuddered. Jacob looked up at me with a curious expression. \u201cBut isn\u2019t it like that for you all the time? Having him in your head?\u201d  \u201cOh, no. Edward\u2019s never in my head. He only wishes.\u201d Jacob\u2019s expression became confused. \u201cHe can\u2019t hear me,\u201d I explained, my voice a tiny bit smug from old habit. \u201cI\u2019m the only one like that, for him. We don\u2019t know why he can\u2019t.\u201d \u201cWeird,\u201d Jacob said. \u201cYeah.\u201d The smugness faded. \u201cIt probably means there\u2019s something wrong with my brain,\u201d I admitted. \u201cI already knew there was something wrong with your brain,\u201d Jacob muttered. \u201cThanks.\u201d The sun broke through the clouds suddenly, a surprise I hadn\u2019t been expecting, and I had to narrow my eyes against the glare off the water. Everything changed color \u2014 the waves turned from gray to blue, the trees from dull olive to brilliant jade, and the rainbow-hued pebbles glittered like jewels. We squinted for a moment, letting our eyes adjust. There were no sounds besides the hollow roar of the waves that echoed from every side of the sheltered harbor, the soft grinding of the stones against each other under the water\u2019s movement, and the cry of gulls high overhead. It was very peaceful. He settled closer to me, so that he was leaning against my arm. He was so warm. After a minute of this, I shrugged out of my rain jacket. He made a little sound of contentment in the back of his throat, and rested his cheek on the top of my head. I could feel the sun heat my skin \u2014 thought it was not quite as warm as Jacob \u2014 and I wondered idly how long it would take me to burn. Absentmindedly, I twisted my right hand to the side, and watched the sunlight glitter subtly off the scar James had left there. \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d he murmured. \u201cThe sun.\u201d \u201cMmm. It\u2019s nice.\u201d \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d I asked. He chuckled to himself. \u201cI was remembering that moronic movie you took me to. And Mike Newton puking all over everything.\u201d I laughed, too, surprised by how time had changed the memory. It used to be one of stress, of confusion. So much had changed that night. . . . And now I could laugh. It was the last night Jacob and I had had before he\u2019d learned the truth about his heritage. The last human memory. An oddly pleasant memory now. \u201cI miss that,\u201d Jacob said. \u201cThe way it used to be so easy . . . uncomplicated. I\u2019m glad I\u2019ve got a good memory.\u201d He sighed. He felt the sudden tension in my body as his words triggered a memory of my own. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked. \u201cAbout that good memory of yours . . .\u201d I pulled away from him so that I could read his face. At the moment, it was confused. \u201cDo you mind telling me what you were doing Monday morning? You were thinking something that bothered Edward.\u201d Bothered wasn\u2019t quite the word for it, but I wanted an answer, so I thought it was best not to start out too severely. Jacob\u2019s face brightened with understanding, and he laughed. \u201cI was just thinking about you. Didn\u2019t like that much, did he?\u201d \u201cMe? What about me?\u201d Jacob laughed, with a harder edge this time. \u201cI was remembering the way you looked that night Sam found you \u2014 I\u2019ve seen it in his head, and it\u2019s like I was there; that memory has always haunted Sam, you know. And then I remembered how you looked the first time you came to my place. I bet you don\u2019t even realize what a mess you were then, Bella. It was weeks before you started to look human again. And I remembered how you always used to have your arms wrapped around yourself, trying to hold yourself together. . . .\u201d Jacob winced, and then shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to remember how sad you were, and it wasn\u2019t my fault. So I figured it would be harder for him. And I thought he ought to get a look at what he\u2019d done.\u201d I smacked his shoulder. It hurt my hand. \u201cJacob Black, don\u2019t you ever do that again! Promise me you won\u2019t.\u201d \u201cNo way. I haven\u2019t had that much fun in months.\u201d \u201cSo help me, Jake \u2014\u201d \u201cOh, get a grip, Bella. When am I ever going to see him again? Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d I got to my feet, and he caught my hand as I started to walk away. I tried to tug free. \u201cI\u2019m leaving, Jacob.\u201d \u201cNo, don\u2019t go yet,\u201d he protested, his hand tightening around mine. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. And . . . okay, I won\u2019t do it again. Promise.\u201d I sighed. \u201cThanks, Jake.\u201d \u201cCome on, we\u2019ll go back to my house,\u201d he said eagerly. \u00a0\u201cActually, I think I really do need to go. Angela Weber is expecting me, and I know Alice is worried. I don\u2019t want to upset her too much.\u201d \u201cBut you just got here!\u201d \u201cIt feels that way,\u201d I agreed. I glared up at the sun, somehow already directly overhead. How had the time passed so quickly? His eyebrows pulled down over his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll see you again,\u201d he said in a hurt voice. \u201cI\u2019ll come back the next time he\u2019s away,\u201d I promised impulsively. \u201cAway?\u201d Jacob rolled his eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s a nice way to describe what he\u2019s doing. Disgusting parasites.\u201d \u201cIf you can\u2019t be nice, I won\u2019t come back at all!\u201d I threatened, trying to pull my hand free. He refused to let go. \u201cAw, don\u2019t be mad,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cKnee-jerk reaction.\u201d \u201cIf I\u2019m going to try to come back again, you\u2019re going to have to get something straight, okay?\u201d He waited. \u201cSee,\u201d I explained. \u201cI don\u2019t care who\u2019s a vampire and who\u2019s a werewolf. That\u2019s irrelevant. You are Jacob, and he is Edward, and I am Bella. And nothing else matters.\u201d His eyes narrowed slightly. \u201cBut I am a werewolf,\u201d he said unwillingly. \u201cAnd he is a vampire,\u201d he added with obvious revulsion. \u201cAnd I\u2019m a Virgo!\u201d I shouted, exasperated. He raised his eyebrows, measuring my expression with curious eyes. Finally, he shrugged. \u201cIf you can really see it that way . . .\u201d \u201cI can. I do.\u201d   \u201cOkay. Just Bella and Jacob. None of those freaky Virgos here.\u201d He smiled at me, the warm, familiar smile that I had missed so much. I felt the answering smile spread across my face. \u201cI\u2019ve really missed you, Jake,\u201d I admitted impulsively. \u201cMe, too,\u201d his smile widened. His eyes were happy and clear, free for once of the angry bitterness. \u201cMore than you know. Will you come back soon?\u201d \u201cAs soon as I can,\u201d I promised.",

            "en": "7 REPETITION         3. The truth I had the sense that i'd been asleep for a very long time\u2014my body was stiff, like i hadn't moved once through all that time, either. My mind was dazed and slow; strange, colorful dreams\u2014dreams and nightmares\u2014swirled dizzily around the inside of my head. They were so vivid. The horrible and the heavenly, all mixed together into a bizarre jumble. There was sharp impatience and fear, both part of that frustrating dream where your feet can't move fast enough\u2026 and there were plenty of monsters, red-eyed fiends that were all the more ghastly for their genteel civility. The dream was still strong\u2014i could even remember the names. But the strongest, clearest part of the dream was not the horror. It was the angel that was most clear. It was hard to let him go and wake up. This dream did not want to be shoved away into the vault of dreams I refused to revisit. I struggled with it as my mind became more alert, focusing on reality. I couldn't remember what day of the week it was, but I was sure Jacob or school or work or something was waiting for me. I inhaled deeply, wondering how to face another day. Something cold touched my forehead with the softest pressure. I squeezed my eyes more tightly shut. I was still dreaming, it seemed, and it felt \u00a0abnormally real. I was so close to waking\u2026 any second now, and it would be gone. But I realized that it felt too real, too real to be good for me. The stone arms I imagined wrapped around me were far too substantial. If I let this go any further, I'd be sorry for it later. With a resigned sigh, I wrenched back my eyelids to dispel the illusion. \"Oh!\" I gasped, and threw my fists over my eyes. Well, clearly, I'd gone too far; it must have been a mistake to let my imagination get so out of hand. Okay, so \"let\" was the wrong word. I'd forced it to get out of hand\u2014pretty much stalked my hallucinations\u2014and now my mind had snapped. It took less than half a second for me to realize that, as long as I was truly insane now, I might as well enjoy the delusions while they were pleasant. I opened my eyes again\u2014and Edward was still there, his perfect face just inches away from mine. \"Did I frighten you?\" His low voice was anxious. This was very good, as delusions went. The face, the voice, the scent, everything\u2014it was so much better than drowning. The beautiful figment of my imagination watched my changing expressions, with alarm. His irises were pitch-black, with bruise-like shadows under them. This surprised me; my hallucinatory Edwards were usually better fed. I blinked twice, desperately trying to remember the last thing that I was sure was real. Alice was part of my dream, and I wondered if she had really come back at all, or if that was just the preamble. I thought she'd returned the day I'd nearly drowned\u2026 \"Oh, crap\" I croaked. My throat was thick with sleeping. \"What's wrong, Bella?\" I frowned at him unhappily. His face was even more anxious than before. \"I'm dead, right?\" I moaned. \"I did drown. Crap, crap, crap! This is gonna kill Charlie.\" Edward frowned, too. \"You're not dead.\" \"Then why am I not waking up?\" I challenged, raising my eyebrows. \"You are awake, Bella.\" I shook my head. \"Sure, sure. That's what you want me to think. And then it will be worse when I do wake up. If I wake up, which I won't, because I'm dead. This is awful. Poor Charlie. And Renee and Jake\u2026\" I trailed off in horror at what I had done. \"I can see where you might confuse me with a nightmare.\" His short-lived smile was grim. \"But I can't imagine what you could have done to wind up in hell. Did you commit many murders while I was away?\" I grimaced. \"Obviously not. If I was in hell, you wouldn't be with me.\" He sighed. My head was getting clearer. My eyes flickered away from his face\u2014unwillingly\u2014for one second, to the dark, open window, and then back to him. I started to remember details\u2026 and I felt a faint, unfamiliar blush warm the skin over my cheekbones as I slowly realized that Edward was really, truly here with me, and I was wasting time being an idiot. \"Did all of that really happen, then?\" It was almost impossible to reassign my dream as reality. I couldn't wrap my head around the concept. \"That depends.\" Edward's smile was still hard. \"If you're referring to us nearly being massacred in Italy, then, yes.\" \"How strange,\" I mused. \"I really went to Italy. Did you know I'd never been farther east than Albuquerque?\" He rolled his eyes. \"Maybe you should go back to sleep. You're not coherent.\" \"I'm not tired anymore.\" It was all coming clear now. \"What time is it? How long have I been sleeping?\" \"It's just after one in the morning. So, about fourteen hours.\" I stretched as he spoke. I was so stiff. \"Charlie?\" I asked. Edward frowned. \"Sleeping. You should probably know that I'm breaking the rules right now. Well, not technically, since he said I was never to walk through his door again, and I came in the window\u2026 But, still, the intent was clear.\" \"Charlie banned you from the house?\" I asked, disbelief quickly melting into fury. His eyes were sad. \"Did you expect anything else?\" My eyes were mad. I was going to have a few words with my father\u2014perhaps it would be a good time to remind him that I was over the legal age of adulthood. It didn't matter so much, of course, except in principle. All too soon there would be no reason for the prohibition. I turned my thoughts to less painful avenues. \"What's the story?\" I asked, genuinely curious, but also trying desperately to keep the conversation casual, to keep a firm grip on myself, so I wouldn't scare him away with the frantic, gnawing craving that was raging inside me. \"What do you mean?\" \"What am I telling Charlie? What's my excuse for disappearing for\u2026 how long was I gone, anyway?\" I tried to count the hours in my head. \"Just three days.\" His eyes tightened, but he smiled more naturally this time. \"Actually, I was hoping you might have a good explanation. I've got nothing.\" I groaned. \"Fabulous.\" \"Well, maybe Alice will come up with something,\" he offered, trying to comfort me. And I was comforted. Who cared what I had to deal with later? Every second that he was here\u2014so close, his flawless face glowing in the dim light from the numbers on my alarm clock\u2014was precious and not to be wasted. \"So,\" I began, picking the least important\u2014though still vitally interesting\u2014question to start with. I was safely delivered home, and he might decide to leave at any moment. I had to keep him talking. Besides, this temporary heaven wasn't entirely complete without the sound of his voice. \"What have you been doing, up until three days ago?\" His face turned wary in an instant. \"Nothing terribly exciting.\" \"Of course not,\" I mumbled. \"Why are you making that face?\" \"Well\u2026\" I pursed my lips, considering. \"If you were, after all, just a dream, that's exactly the kind of thing you would say. My imagination must be used up.\" He sighed. \"If I tell you, will you finally believe that you're not having a nightmare?\" \"Nightmare!\" I repeated scornfully. He waited for my answer. \"Maybe,\" I said after a second of thought. \"If you tell me.\" \"I was\u2026 hunting.\" \"Is that the best you can do?\" I criticized. \"That definitely doesn't prove I'm awake.\" He hesitated, and then spoke slowly, choosing his words with care. \"I wasn't hunting for food\u2026 I was actually trying my hand at\u2026 tracking. I'm not very good at it.\" \"What were you tracking?\" I asked, intrigued. \"Nothing of consequence.\" His words didn't match his expression; he looked upset, uncomfortable. \"I don't understand.\" He hesitated; his face, shining with an odd green cast from the light of the clock, was torn. \"I\u2014\" He took a deep breath. \"I owe you an apology. No, of course I owe you much, \u00a0much more than that. But you have to know,\"\u2014the words began to flow so fast, the way I remembered he spoke sometimes when he was agitated, that I really had to concentrate to catch them all\u2014\"that I had no idea. I didn't realize the mess I was leaving behind. I thought it was safe for you here. So safe. I had no idea that Victoria,\"\u2014his lips curled back when he said the name\u2014\"would come back. I'll admit, when I saw her that one time, I was paying much more attention to James's thoughts. But I just didn't see that she had this kind of response in her. That she even had such a tie to him. I think I realize why now\u2014she was so sure of him, the thought of him failing never occurred to her. It was her overconfidence that clouded her feelings about him\u2014that kept me from seeing the depth of them, the bond there. \"Not that there's any excuse for what I left you to face. When I heard what you told Alice\u2014what she saw herself\u2014when I realized that you had to put your life in the hands of werewolves, immature, volatile, the worst thing out there besides Victoria herself\u2014he shuddered and the gush of words halted for a short second. \"Please know that I had no idea of any of this. I feel sick, sick to my core, even now, when I can see and feel you safe in my arms. I am the most miserable excuse for\u2014\" \"Stop,\" I interrupted him. He stared at me with agonized eyes, and I tried to find the right words\u2014the words that would free him from this imagined obligation that caused him so much pain. They were very hard words to say. I didn't know if I could get them out without breaking down. But I had to try to do it right. I didn't want to be a source of guilt and anguish in his life. He should be happy, no matter what it cost me. I'd really been hoping to put off this part of our last conversation. It was going to bring things to an end so much sooner. Drawing on all my months of practice with trying to be normal for Charlie, I kept my face smooth.  \"Edward,\" I said. His name burned my throat a little on the way out. I could feel the ghost of the hole, waiting to rip itself wide again as soon as he disappeared. I didn't quite see how I was going to survive it this time. \"This has to stop now. You can't think about things that way. You can't let this\u2026 this guilt\u2026 rule your life. You can't take responsibility for the things that happen to me here. None of it is your fault, it's just part of how life is for me. So, if I trip in front of a bus or whatever it is next time, you have to realize that it's not your job to take the blame. You can't just go running off to Italy \u00a0because you feel bad that you didn't save me. Even if I had jumped off that cliff to die, that would have been my choice, and not your fault. I know it's your\u2026 your nature to shoulder the blame for everything, but you really can't let that make you go to such extremes! It's very irresponsible\u2014think of Esme and Carlisle and\u2014\" I was on the edge of losing it. I stopped to take a deep breath, hoping to calm myself. I had to set him free. I had to make sure this never happened again. \"Isabella Marie Swan,\" he whispered, the strangest expression crossing his face. He almost looked mad. \"Do you believe that I asked the Volturi to kill me because I felt guilty?\" I could feel the blank incomprehension on my face. \"Didn't you?\" \"Feel guilty? Intensely so. More than you can comprehend.\" \"Then\u2026 what are you saying? I don't understand.\" \"Bella, I went to the Volturi because I thought you were dead,\" he said, voice soft, eyes fierce. \"Even if I'd had no hand in your death\"\u2014he shuddered as he whispered the last word\u2014\"even if it wasn't my fault, I would have gone to Italy. Obviously, I should have been more careful\u2014I should have spoken to Alice directly, rather than accepting it secondhand from Rosalie. But, really, what was I supposed to think when the boy said Charlie was at the funeral? What are the odds? \"The odds\u2026\" he muttered then, distracted. His voice was so low I wasn't sure I heard it right. \"The odds are always stacked against us. Mistake after mistake. I'll never criticize Romeo again.\" \"But I still don't understand,\" I said. \"That's my whole point. So what?\" \"Excuse me?\" \"So what if I was dead?\" He stared at me dubiously for a long moment before answering. \"Don't you remember anything I told you before?\" \"I remember everything that you told me.\" Including the words that had negated all the rest. He brushed the tip of his cool finger against my lower lip. \"Bella, you seem to be under a misapprehension.\" He closed his eyes, shaking his head back and forth with half a smile on his beautiful face. It wasn't a happy smile. \"I thought I'd explained it clearly before. Bella, I can't live in a world where you don't exist.\" \"I am\u2026\" My head swam as I looked for the appropriate word. \"Confused.\" That worked. I couldn't make sense of what he was saying. He stared deep into my eyes with his sincere, earnest gaze. \"I'm a good liar, Bella, I have to be.\" I froze, my muscles locking down as if for impact. The fault line in my chest rippled; the pain of it took my breath away. He shook my shoulder, trying to loosen my rigid pose. \"Let me finish! I'm a good liar, but still, for you to believe me so quickly.\" He winced. \"That was\u2026 excruciating.\" I waited, still frozen. \"When we were in the forest, when I was telling you goodbye\u2014\" I didn't allow myself to remember. I fought to keep myself in the present second only. \"You weren't going to let go,\" he whispered. \"I could see that. I didn't want to do it\u2014it felt like it would kill me to do it\u2014but I knew that if I couldn't convince you that I didn't love you anymore, it would just take you that much longer to get on with your life. I hoped that, if you thought I'd moved on, so would you.\" \"A clean break,\" I whispered through unmoving lips. \"Exactly. But I never imagined it would be so easy to do! I thought it would be next to impossible\u2014that you would be so sure of the truth that I would have to lie through my teeth for hours to even plant the seed of doubt in your head. I lied, and I'm so sorry\u2014sorry because I hurt you, sorry because it was a worthless effort. Sorry that I couldn't protect you from what I an. I lied to save you, and it didn't work. I'm sorry. \"But how could you believe me? After all the thousand times I've told you I love you, how could you let one word break your faith in me?\" I didn't answer. I was too shocked to form a rational response. \"I could see it in your eyes, that you honestly believed that I didn't want you anymore. The most absurd, ridiculous concept\u2014as if there were any way that I could exist without needing you!\" I was still frozen. His words were incomprehensible, because they were impossible. He shook my shoulder again, not hard, but enough that my teeth rattled a little. \"Bella,\" he sighed. \"Really, what were you thinking!\" And so I started to cry. The tears welled up and then gushed miserably down my cheeks. \"I knew it,\" I sobbed. \"I knew I was dreaming.\" \"You're impossible,\" he said, and he laughed once\u2014a hard laugh, frustrated. \"How can I put this so that you'll believe me? You're not asleep, and you're not dead. I'm here, and I love you. I have always loved you, and I will always love you. I was thinking of you, seeing your face in my mind, every second that I was away. When I told you that I didn't want you, it was the very blackest kind of blasphemy.\" I shook my head while the tears continued to ooze from the corners of my eyes. \"You don't believe me, do you?\" he whispered, his face paler than his usual pale\u2014I could see that even in the dim light. \"Why can you believe the lie, but not the truth?\" \"It never made sense for you to love me,\" I explained, my voice breaking twice. \"I always knew that.\" His eyes narrowed, his jaw tightened. \"I'll prove you're awake,\" he promised. He caught my face securely between his iron hands, ignoring my struggles when I tried to turn my head away. \"Please don't,\" I whispered. He stopped, his lips just half an inch from mine. \"Why not?\" he demanded. His breath blew into my face, making my head whirl. \"When I wake up\"\u2014He opened his mouth to protest, so I revised\u2014\"okay, forget that one\u2014when you leave again, it's going to be hard enough without this, too.\" He pulled back an inch, to stare at my face. \"Yesterday, when I would touch you, you were so\u2026 hesitant, so careful, and yet still the same. I need to know why. Is it because I'm too late? Because I've hurt you too much? Because you have moved on, as I meant for you to? That would be\u2026 quite fair. I won't contest your decision. So don't try to spare my feelings, please\u2014just tell me now whether or not you can still love me, after everything I've done to you.\u00a0 Can you?\" he whispered. \"What kind of an idiotic question is that?\" \"Just answer it. Please.\" I stared at him darkly for a long moment. \"The way I feel about you will never change. Of course I love you\u2014and there's nothing you can do about it!\" \"That's all I needed to hear.\" His mouth was on mine then, and I couldn't fight him. Not because he was so many thousand times stronger than me, but because my will crumbled into dust the second our lips met. This kiss was not quite as careful as others I remembered, which suited me just fine. If I was going to rip myself up further, I might as well get as much in trade as possible. So I kissed him back, my heart pounding out a jagged, disjointed rhythm while my breathing turned to panting and my fingers moved greedily to his face. I could feel his marble body against every line of mine, and I was so glad he hadn't listened to me\u2014there was no pain in the world that would have justified missing this. His hands memorized my face, the same way mine were tracing his, and, in the brief seconds when his lips were free, he whispered my name. When I was starting to get dizzy, he pulled away, only to lay his ear against my heart. I lay there, dazed, waiting for my gasping to slow and quiet. \"By the way,\" he said in a casual tone. \"I'm not leaving you.\" I didn't say anything, and he seemed to hear skepticism in my silence. He lifted his face to lock my gaze in his. \"I'm not going anywhere. Not without you,\" he added more seriously. \"I only left you in the first place because I wanted you to have a chance at a normal, happy, human life. I could see what I was doing to you\u2014keeping you constantly on the edge of danger, taking you away from the world you belonged in, risking your life every moment I was with you. So I had to try. I had to do something, and it seemed like leaving was the only way. If I hadn't thought you would be better off, I could have never made myself leave. I'm much too selfish. Only you could be more important than what I wanted\u2026 what I needed. What I want and need is to be with you, and I know I'll never be strong enough to leave again. I have too many excuses to stay\u2014thank heaven for that! It seems you can't be safe, no matter how many miles I put between us.\" \"Don't promise me anything,\" I whispered. If I let myself hope, and it came to nothing\u2026 that would kill me. Where all those merciless vampires had not been able to finish me off, hope would do the job. Anger glinted metallic in his black eyes. \"You think I'm lying to you now?\" \"No\u2014not lying.\" I shook my head, trying to think it through coherently. To examine the hypothesis that he did love me, while staying objective, clinical, so I wouldn't fall into the trap of hoping. \"You could mean it\u2026 now. But what about tomorrow, when you think about all the reasons you left in the first place? Or next month, when Jasper takes a snap at me?\" He flinched. I thought back over those last days of my life before he left me, tried to see them through the filter of what he was telling me now. From that perspective, imagining that he'd left me while loving me, left me for me, his brooding and cold silences took on a different meaning. \"It isn't as if you hadn't thought the first decision through, is it?\" I guessed. \"You'll end up doing what you think is right.\" \"I'm not as strong as you give me credit for,\" he said. \"Right and wrong have ceased to mean much to me; I was coming back anyway. Before Rosalie told me the news, I was already past trying to live through one week at a time, or even one day. I was fighting to make it through a single hour. It was only a matter of time before I showed up at your window and begged you to take me back. I'd be happy to beg now, if you'd like that.\" I grimaced. \"Be serious, please.\" \"Oh, I am,\" he insisted, glaring now. \"Will you please try to hear what I'm telling you? Will you let me attempt to explain what you mean to me?\" He waited, studying my face as he spoke to make sure I was really listening. \"Before you, Bella, my life was like a moonless night. Very dark, but there were stars\u2014points of light and reason\u2026 And then you shot across my sky like a meteor. Suddenly everything was on fire; there was brilliancy, there was beauty. When you were gone, when the meteor had fallen over the horizon, everything went black. Nothing had changed, but my eyes were blinded by the light. I couldn't see the stars anymore. And there was no more reason for anything.\" I wanted to believe him. But this was my life without him that he was describing, not the other way around. \"Your eyes will adjust,\" I mumbled. \"That's just the problem\u2014they can't.\" \"What about your distractions?\" He laughed without a trace of humor. \"Just part of the lie, love. There was no distraction from the\u2026 the agony. My heart hasn't beat in almost ninety years, but this was different. It was like my heart was gone\u2014like I was hollow. Like I'd left everything that was inside me here with you.\" \"That's funny,\" I muttered. He arched one perfect eyebrow. \"Funny? \" \"I meant strange\u2014I thought it was just me. Lots of pieces of me went missing, too. I haven't been able to really breathe in so long.\" I filled my lungs, luxuriating in the sensation. \"And my heart. That was definitely lost.\" He closed his eyes and laid his ear over my heart again. I let my cheek press against his hair, felt the texture of it on my skin, smelled the delicious scent of him. \"Tracking wasn't a distraction then?\" I asked, curious, and also needing to distract myself. I was very much in danger of hoping. I wouldn't be able to stop myself for long. My heart throbbed, singing in my chest. \"No.\" He sighed. \"That was never a distraction. It was an obligation.\" \"What does that mean?\" \"It means that, even though I never expected any danger from Victoria, I wasn't going to let her get away with\u2026 Well, like I said, I was horrible at it. I traced her as far as Texas, but then I followed a false lead down to Brazil\u2014and really she came here.\" He groaned. \"I wasn't even on the right continent! And all the while, worse than my worst fears\u2014\" \"You were hunting Victoria?\" I half-shrieked as soon as I could find my voice, shooting through two octaves. Charlie's distant snores stuttered, and then picked up a regular rhythm again. \"Not well,\" Edward answered, studying my outraged expression with a confused look. \"But I'll do better this time. She won't be tainting perfectly good air by breathing in and out for much longer.\" \"That is\u2026 out of the question,\" I managed to choke out. Insanity. Even if he had Emmett or Jasper help him. Even if he had Emmett and Jasper help. It was worse than my other imaginings: Jacob Black standing across a small space from Victoria's vicious and <em>feline</em> figure. I couldn't bear to picture Edward there, even though he was so much more durable than my half-human best friend.  \"It's too late for her. I might have let the other time slide, but not now, not after\u2014\" I interrupted him again, trying to sound calm. \"Didn't you just promise that you weren't going to leave?\" I asked, fighting the words as I said them, nor letting them plant themselves in my heart. \"That isn't exactly compatible with an extended tracking expedition, is it?\" He frowned. A snarl began to build low in his chest. \"I will keep my promise, Bella. But Victoria\"\u2014the snarl became more pronounced\u2014\"is going to die. Soon.\" \"Let's not be hasty,\" I said, trying to hide my panic. \"Maybe she's not coming back. Jake's pack probably scared her off. There's really no reason to go looking for her. Besides, I've got bigger problems than Victoria.\" Edward's eyes narrowed, but he nodded. \"It's true. The werewolves are a problem.\" I snorted. \"I wasn't talking about Jacob. My problems are a lot worse that a handful of adolescent wolves getting themselves into trouble.\" Edward looked as if he were about to say something, and then thought better of it. His teeth clicked together, and he spoke through them. \"Really?\" he asked. \"Then what would be your greatest problem? That would make Victoria's returning for you seem like such an inconsequential matter in comparison?\" \"How about the second greatest?\" I hedged. \"All right,\" he agreed, suspicious. I paused. I wasn't sure I could say the name. \"There are others who are coming to look for me,\" I reminded him in a subdued whisper. He sighed, but the reaction was not as strong as I would have imagined after his response to Victoria. \"The Volturi are only the second greatest?\" \"You don't seem that upset about it,\" I noted. \"Well, we have plenty of time to think it through. Time means something very different to them than it does to you, or even me. They count years the way you count days. I wouldn't be surprised if you were thirty before you crossed their minds again,\" he added lightly. Horror washed through me. Thirty. So his promises meant nothing, in the end. If I were going to turn thirty someday, then he couldn't be planning on staying long. The harsh pain of this knowledge made me realize that I'd already begun to hope, without giving myself permission to do so. \"You don't have to be afraid,\" he said, anxious as he watched the tears dew up again on the rims of my eyes. \"I won't let them hurt you.\" \"While you're here.\" Not that I cared what happened to me when he left. He took my face between his two stone hands, holding it tightly while his midnight eyes glared into mine with the gravitational force of a black hole. \"I will never leave you again.\" \"But you said thirty,\" I whispered. The tears leaked over the edge. \"What? You're going to stay, but let me get all old anyway? Right.\" His eyes softened, while his mouth went hard. \"That's exactly what I'm going to do. What choice have I?\u00a0 I cannot be without you, but I will not destroy your soul.\" \"Is this really\u2026\" I tried to keep my voice even, but this question was too hard. I remembered his face when Aro had almost begged him to consider making me immortal. The sick look there. Was this fixation with keeping me human really about my soul, or was it because he wasn't sure that he wanted me around that long? \"Yes?\" he asked, waiting for my question. I asked a different one. Almost\u2014but not quite\u2014as hard. \"But what about when I get so old that people think I'm your mother? Your \u00a0grandmother?\" My voice was pale with revulsion\u2014I could see Gran's face again in the dream mirror. His whole face was soft now. He brushed the tears from my cheek with his lips. \"That doesn't mean anything to me,\" he breathed against my skin. \"You will always be the most beautiful thing in my world.\u00a0 Of course\u2026\" He hesitated, flinching slightly. \"If you outgrew me\u2014if you wanted something more\u2014I would understand that, Bella. I promise I wouldn't stand in your way if you wanted to leave me.\" His eyes were liquid onyx and utterly sincere. He spoke as if he'd put endless amounts of thought into this asinine plan. \"You do realize that I'll die eventually, right?\" I demanded. He'd thought about this part, too. \"I'll follow after as soon as I can.\" \"That is seriously\u2026\"I looked for the right word. \"Sick.\" \"Bella, it's the only right way left\u2014\" \"Let's just back up for a minute,\" I said; feeling angry made it so much easier to be clear, decisive. \"You do remember the Volturi, right? I can't stay human forever. They'll kill me. Even if they don't think of me till I'm thirty\"\u2014I hissed the word\u2014\"do you really think they'll forget?\" \"No,\" he answered slowly, shaking his head. \"They won't forget. But\u2026\" \"But?\" He grinned while I stared at him warily. Maybe I wasn't the only crazy one. \"I have a few plans.\" \"And these plans,\" I said, my voice getting more acidic with each word. \"These plans all center around me staying human.\" My attitude hardened his expression. \"Naturally.\" His tone was brusque, his divine face arrogant. We glowered at each other for a long minute. Then I took a deep breath, squared my shoulders, I pushed his arms away so that I could sit up. \"Do you want me to leave?\" he asked, and it made my heart flutter to see that this idea hurt him, though he tried not to show it. \"No,\" I told him. \"I'm leaving.\" He watched me suspiciously as I climbed out of the bed and fumbled around in the dark room, looking for my shoes. \"May I ask where you are going.'\" he asked. \"I'm going to your house,\" I told him, still feeling around blindly. He got up and came to my side. \"Here are your shoes. How did you plan to get there?\" \"My truck.\" \"That will probably wake Charlie,\" he offered as a deterrent. I sighed. \"I know. But honestly, I'll be grounded for weeks as it is. How much more trouble can I really get in?\" \"None. He'll blame me, not you.\" \"If you have a better idea, I'm all ears.\" \"Stay here,\" he suggested, but his expression wasn't hopeful. \"No dice. But you go ahead and make yourself at home,\" I encouraged, surprised at how natural my teasing sounded, and headed for the door. He was there before me, blocking my way. I frowned, and turned for the window. It wasn't really that far to the ground, and it was mostly grass beneath\u2026 \"Okay,\" he sighed. \"I'll give you a ride.\" I shrugged. \"Either way. But you probably should be there, too.\" \"And why is that?\" \"Because you're extraordinarily opinionated, and I'm sure you'll want a chance to air your views.\" \"My views on which subject?\" He asked through his teeth. \"This isn't just about you anymore. You're not the center of the universe, you know.\" My own personal universe was, of course, a different story. \"If you're going to bring the Volturi down on us over something as stupid as leaving me human, then your family ought to have a say.\" \"A say in what?\" he asked, each word distinct. \"My mortality. I'm putting it to a vote.\"",
