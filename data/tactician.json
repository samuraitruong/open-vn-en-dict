An official statement from the CBS has now confirmed the former midfielder's departure from the role. \"After the working cycle that started in August 2006, and ended with the elimination of Brazil from the World Cup in South Africa, has come to an end, the CBF announces that the technical committee of the national squad has been released,\" the statement on the CBF official website read. \"The new technical committee will be announced by the end of July.\" Former Chelsea manager Luiz Felipe Scolari and Leonardo, who was in charge at Milan last season, are rumoured to be early candidates for the position.",

Bayern Munich coach Louis van Gaal has told the press that he believes Jose Mourinho doesn't teach his Inter squad how to play attractive football. The two sides will meet in the Champions League final on May 22. The Nerazzurri played a very defensive second-leg at the Camp Nou against Barcelona to advance to the final, sparking a wild celebration from Mourinho at the full-time whistle. \"I would not have done what Mourinho did at the Camp Nou, I wouldn't have behaved in a provocative way,\" he said in an interview with Sport Bild. Mourinho worked as Van Gaal's assistant at Barcelona early in his career. \"His analysis was good, even then you could see he understood football,\" he continued. \"But at that time he was very humble and it's great to see how he has evolved, he gradually became a personality.\" Finally, the 58-year-old commented on Mourinho's style of play, suggesting Inter have no desire to take a more attractive approach to the game. \"He trains to win, so do I, but I also choose to express good football. My way is more difficult,\" he concluded.",
