Headline pre-tax profit came in at \u00a329.7m, compared with a loss last year. \u00a0 The football club is preparing a partial flotation on the Singapore Stock Exchange to raise up to \u00a3600m. \u00a0 Last season, Manchester United won the Premier League and reached the final of the Champions League against Barcelona. \u00a0 Turnover in all three major areas of the business increased against a year earlier, with matchday revenue rising to \u00a3108.6m from \u00a3100.2m, media revenue climbing to \u00a3119.4 from \u00a3104.8m, and commercial revenue growing to \u00a3103.4m from \u00a381.4m. \u00a0 The club was bought by the US-based Glazer family for \u00a3800m in 2005. \u00a0 Critics say the family has <em>saddled</em> the club with massive debts, which led to high-profile protests by supporters' groups last season. \u00a0 The latest figures show that net debt has fallen to \u00a3308.3m, down from \u00a3376.9m a year earlier. \u00a0 Vietnam deal \u00a0 Earlier this month, and after the period covered by the latest set of accounts, the club signed two new commercial deals. \u00a0 One saw logistics company DHL becoming the club's first training kit sponsor, in a four-year deal the BBC understands is worth \u00a340m to the club. \u00a0 Manchester United also signed a deal with Vietnamese mobile phone group Beeline, with the club having an estimated 16 million fans in the South East Asian country. \u00a0 In March, Manchester United's parent company said it had made a loss of \u00a3108.9m in 2009-10. Red Football Joint Venture is the Glazer family parent company that owns the Old Trafford club. \u00a0 Its loss, for the year to the end of July 2010, included one-off costs from setting up a \u00a3526m bond scheme last January to replace outstanding debts of \u00a3509m.",
