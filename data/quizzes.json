            "en": "Studying for tests    You just heard you have a math test on Friday \u2014 the same day as your big history test and weekly quiz on Spanish verbs. Crazy! How will you get all your studying done? Don't panic. There are some secrets to good studying. If you follow them, you'll be able to take all three tests with confidence. Start studying in school Studying for tests and <em>quizzes</em> actually starts way before you even know you'll have a test. Good study techniques begin in the classroom such as note-taking. Note-taking is a way of remembering what you were taught or what you've read about. Some keys to note-taking are to write down facts that a teacher mentions or writes on the board during class. If you miss something, ask your teacher to go over facts with you after class. Other keys to good note-taking are keeping notes organized by subject and making sure they're easy to read and review. (This may mean that you need to recopy some notes at home or during a free period while the class is still fresh in your mind.) Unfortunately, most schools don't have classes that teach you how to take note. When it comes to taking good notes, it can take some experimenting to figure out what works, so don't give up. Time management When you sit down to study, think about how much time you want to devote to each topic. This will keep you from getting overwhelmed. If it's Monday, and you've got those three tests on Friday, figure out how much time you need for studying between now and then. Then figure out how long each subject will take. For example, a weekly Spanish verb test probably won't be as intense as a big history test. So you won't need to set aside as much study time for the Spanish test \u2014 and if you break it up into a short amount every night, that's even better. Another study technique is called \"chunking\" \u2014 breaking large topics down into chunks. Let's say you have a history test on World War II. Instead of thinking about studying all of World War II (which could overwhelm even a historian), try breaking your study sessions into chunks or studying the material by specific battles. When you've decided on a manageable amount of work, consider how long you need to study it. Most people can really concentrate for about 45 minutes \u2014 after that you'll probably want to take a short break. If you find yourself getting distracted and thinking about other things as you study, pull your attention back as soon as possible. Remind yourself that when your 45 minutes of studying are up, you can take a 15-minute break. How to study As you study, review your notes and any special information from your textbook. In the case of math or science problems or equations, do some practice problems. Pay special attention to anything the teacher seemed to stress in class. (This is where good note-taking comes in handy!) Many teachers tell students ahead of time what the format of an exam will be. This can help you tailor how you study. For example, if you know you're going to have multiple-choice questions on World War II, you'll know to focus on studying facts and details. On the other hand, if the exam will contain essay questions, you'll want to think about which topics are most likely to be covered. Then come up with several possible essay topics and use your notes, books, and other reference sources to figure out how you might answer questions on those topics. When trying to memorize dates, names, or other factual information, keep in mind that it usually takes a number of tries to remember something correctly (that's one reason why it's a good idea to start studying well in advance of a test). Use special memory triggers that the teacher may have suggested or ones that you invent yourself. Read things over several times if you need to, and write down any phrases or thoughts that will help you remember main ideas or concepts. Some people find it helps to teach what they're studying aloud to an imaginary student. Or work with a study partner and take turns teaching aloud. Another study technique is making flashcards that summarize some of the important facts or concepts. You can then use these to review for a test. I'll study tomorrow and other excuses It's tempting to put off studying until the last minute (also known as procrastination). Unfortunately, by the time students get to high school there's so much going on that there's usually no room for procrastination. If you're a procrastinator, one of the best ways to overcome it is by staying organized. After you've written test dates and project due dates on a calendar, it's hard to ignore them. And sitting down to organize and plan your work really highlights how much time things take. Organization makes it harder to procrastinate. Sometimes people put off studying because they feel overwhelmed by the fact that they're behind on things or they just feel really disorganized. Don't let this happen to you. Keep your notes organized, stay on top of required materials, and follow the other study tips mentioned above to stay focused and in control. Your teachers will give you plenty of notice on important tests so you have enough time to study for the type of exam you'll be taking. But what if you're feeling overwhelmed by all the stuff you have to do? Are classes or extracurricular activities limiting your time to study properly? Ask your teachers for help prioritizing. You may need to involve the people in charge of your activities \u2014 such as your coach or music or drama teacher \u2014 in working out a solution. Don't wait until the last minute to talk to your teachers, though, you'll just look like a procrastinator! And don't be afraid to ask for help. Teachers respect students who are thoughtful and interested in learning and doing well. Studying in a crowd Sometimes it can be useful to go over things with people who are studying for the same test: You can make sure that your notes are correct and that you understand the subject. Study groups are also helpful because you can work together to come up with ways to remember concepts and then test one another. For some people who are easily distracted, though, study groups spell disaster because they get off the topic. When you're with a bunch of friends or classmates, you may spend more time hanging out than actually studying. One way to ensure quiet and focus when studying with a group is to do it in the library. You'll be forced to keep things more low-key than if you're at someone's kitchen table. If you like to study alone and feel most confident doing it that way, that's great. If you think you'd like to work in a group, try it out \u2014 just be aware of the drawbacks. The payoff When you've finished studying, you should feel like you can approach the test or quiz with confidence \u2014 not necessarily that you will get 100% of the answers correct, but that you have a good understanding of the information. Don't panic if you can't remember some facts the night before the test. Even if you've spent all evening studying, the brain needs time to digest all that information. You'll be surprised by what comes back to you after sleeping.",

            "en": "Getting along with your teachers    Your algebra teacher wears clothes from 1985 and always mispronounces your name. Your English teacher loves to start classes with pop <em>quizzes</em>. It can be hard to think of these givers of grades as real people. But they eat pizza, watch movies, and enjoy sports on the weekends, just like you.  So how can you get along with your teachers? Here are some tips.  Why work on good relationships with teachers? A good relationship with a teacher today may help you in the future. You will need teachers' recommendations to apply to a college or for a job after high school. And if you're thinking about going into a career in science, who better to ask about the field than your science teacher? Teachers are often plugged into the community and may be the first to find out about local competitions, activities, or contests. They also may know about grants and scholarships. Sonia's Spanish teacher found out about a contest for exchange program scholarships in Brazil and Spain. Her teacher encouraged and guided her, and Sonia's months and months of work earned her a scholarship as an exchange student. Teachers are often asked to appoint students to student offices or they may recommend students as volunteers for special community programs. All of these activities can help you get into college or get a good job. Teachers are another group of adults in your life who can look out for you, guide you, and provide you with an adult perspective. Many are willing to answer questions, offer advice, and help with personal problems. Developing good teacher-student relationships We all have our favorite teachers \u2014 those who seem truly interested and treat us as intelligent beings. But what about teachers we don't know as well (or even don't like much)? You can do lots of things to get a good connection going with your teacher. First, do the obvious stuff: show up for class on time, with all assignments completed. Be alert, be respectful, and ask questions. Show an interest in the subject. Obviously, your teachers are really interested in their subjects or they wouldn't have decided to teach them! Showing the teacher that you care \u2014 even if you're not a math whiz or fluent in French \u2014 sends the message that you are a dedicated student.  You can also schedule a private conference during a teacher's free period. Use this time to get extra help, ask questions, inquire about a career in the subject, or talk about your progress in class. You may be surprised to learn that your teacher is a bit more relaxed one-on-one than when lecturing in front of the whole class. It is possible to do so, though. Here are some things to avoid when trying to establish a relationship with your teacher: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Not being sincere. Teachers sense when your only motivation is to get special treatment, a college reference, or a job recommendation. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Trying to be teacher's pet. Your behavior will come off as phony and your classmates may start to resent you. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Giving extravagant gifts. It's OK to offer a small token of appreciation to teachers if they've been helpful to you. But flashy, expensive items could send the wrong message, and a teacher is usually not allowed to accept anything expensive. Common teacher-student problems If you're having problems with a teacher, try to figure out why. Do you dislike the subject? Or do you like the subject but just can't warm up to the teacher? If you don't like the subject being taught, it can affect your relationship with the teacher. Some students say it helps them to think of classes that seem like chores as stepping stones toward a bigger goal, like getting a diploma or going on to college. That allows them to keep the class in perspective. Other students say they try to find the practical value in classes they don't like. You may hate math, but learning how to calculate averages and percentages can help you in everything from sports to leaving a tip. If you find a subject hard, talk to your teacher or a parent about extra tutoring. If you find it boring, talk to your teacher (or another favorite teacher, friend, or parent) about ways to see the subject in a different light. Ian constantly fell asleep in his sophomore history class because the past seemed so removed from reality. But things changed when he mentioned his struggle to his homeroom teacher. The teacher talked to Ian and found out that his great-grandfather had fought in World War II. The teacher suggested Ian use his great-grandfather's letters in his project. Not only did Ian get an A, he also learned a lot about a family member he barely remembered from childhood. What if you just don't like the teacher? People naturally just get along better with some people than with others \u2014 it's impossible to like everyone all the time. Learning to work with people you don't connect with easily is a good skill to have in life, no matter what your goals are.  Common courtesy and respect are basic requirements of any relationship. Just as teachers need to be fair and treat everyone equally, students have responsibilities too. You don't have to like your teacher or agree with what he or she says, but it is necessary to be polite. If you need to be out of school for medical or other reasons, let your teacher know. And it's your responsibility to make up the work from missed classes. Don't expect your teacher to hunt you down or take class time to fill you in. Just like personal problems can sometimes slow you down, the same is true for your teachers. Job stress, family issues, or health problems are all factors that can affect a teacher's performance, leaving him or her cranky, irritable, or unable to concentrate. Keep in mind that too much disciplinary action can show up on a student's permanent record. This means that when someone asks for your high school record, they can see the things you did \u2014 even if they happened years ago. What to do if you don't get along Before you try to get out of a class to escape a teacher you don't like, here are a few things you can try to make a difficult relationship work: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Meet with the teacher and try to communicate what you're feeling. Tell him or her what's on your mind, using statements such as, \"It embarrasses me in class when I feel like my intelligence is being put down\" or \"I can't learn in class when I feel like only a few people ever get called on to participate.\" See if you can work it out between the two of you. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Ask yourself, \"What can I learn from this teacher?\" Even if you don't worship his or her personality or lectures, focus on one part of the teacher's personality, and use it as a tool for learning. Not only will you gain more knowledge in that subject, but a closer relationship with your teacher may help you understand one another better. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Talk to students who are doing well in the class and ask them for tips and a plan of action to get along with the teacher better. Sometimes asking a classmate who is willing to share them with you is a great idea. If you're too shy to talk to other students, study their actions and behavior in the classroom and try to follow that lead. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * If you still can't get along, make an appointment with the school guidance counselor, who can offer many tips and suggestions for getting out of difficult teacher relationships. Sometimes a guidance counselor can act as a mediator between you and the teacher. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * If your relationship problems can't be solved in school, then it's time to tell your parents. Let them meet with your teacher and try to work it out. Chances are that you won't encounter physical or verbal abuse (like racist or sexist comments) in the classroom. But if a teacher has done or said anything that makes you uncomfortable, immediately report it to your parents, your guidance counselor, another teacher, the school principal, or an administrator. Teachers are there for more than just homework, and they know about more than just their subject matter. They can help you learn how to function as an adult and a lifelong learner. Undoubtedly, there will be a few teachers along the way who you'll always remember \u2014 and who might change your life forever.",
