            "en": "7 REPETITION        19. HATE WE MADE OUR FLIGHT WITH SECONDS TO SPARE, AND THEN the true torture began. The plane sat idle on the tarmac while the flight attendants strolled\u2014so casually\u2014up and down the aisle, patting the bags in the overhead compartments to make sure everything fit. The pilots leaned out of the cockpit, chatting with them as they passed. Alice's hand was hard on my shoulder, holding me in my seat while I bounced anxiously up and down. \"It's faster than running,\" she reminded me in a low voice. I just nodded in time with my bouncing. At last the plane rolled lazily from the gate, building speed with a gradual steadiness that tortured me further. I expected some kind of relief when we achieved liftoff, but my \u00a0frenzied impatience didn't lessen. Alice lifted the phone on the back of the seat in front of her before we'd stopped climbing, turning her back on the stewardess who eyed her with disapproval. Something about my expression stopped the stewardess from coming over to protest. I tried to tune out what Alice was murmuring to Jasper; I didn't want to hear the words again, but some slipped through. \"I can't be sure, I keep seeing him do different things, he keeps changing his mind\u2026 A killing spree through the city, attacking the guard, lifting a car over his head in the main square\u2026 mostly things that would expose them\u2014he knows that's the fastest way to force a reaction\u2026\" \"No, you can't.\" Alice's voice dropped till it was nearly inaudible, though I was sitting inches from her. Contrarily, I listened harder. \"Tell Emmett no\u2026 Well, go after Emmett and Rosalie and bring them back\u2026 Think about it, Jasper. If he sees any of us, what do you think he will do?\" She nodded. \"Exactly. I think Bella is the only chance\u2014if there is a chance\u2026 I'll do everything that can be done, but prepare Carlisle; the odds aren't good.\" She laughed then, and there was a catch in her voice. \"I've thought of that\u2026 Yes, I promise.\" Her voice became pleading. \"Don't follow me. I promise, Jasper. One way or another, I'll get out\u2026 And I love you.\" She hung up, and leaned back in her seat with her eyes closed. \"I hate lying to him.\" \"Tell me everything, Alice,\" I begged. \"I don't understand. Why did you tell Jasper to stop Emmett, why can't they come help us?\" \"Two reasons,\" she whispered, her eyes still closed. \"The first I told him. We could try to stop Edward ourselves\u2014if Emmett could get his hands on him, we might be able to stop him long enough to convince him you're alive. But we can't sneak up on Edward. And if he sees us coming for him, he'll just act that much faster. He'll throw a Buick through a wall or something, and the Volturi will take him down. \"That's the second reason of course, the reason I couldn't say to Jasper. Because if they're there and the Volturi kill Edward, they'll fight them. Bella.\" She opened her eyes and stared at me, beseeching. \"If there were any chance we could win\u2026 if there were a way that the four of us could save my brother by fighting for him, maybe it would be different. But we can't, and, Bella, I can't lose Jasper like that.\" I realized why her eyes begged for my understanding. She was protecting Jasper, at our expense, and maybe at Edward's, too. I understood, and I did not think badly of her. I nodded. \"Couldn't Edward hear you, though.'\" I asked. \"Wouldn't he know, as soon as he heard your thoughts, that I was alive, that there was no point to this?\" Not that there was any justification, either way. I still couldn't believe that he was capable of reacting like this. It made no sense! I remembered with painful clarity his words that day on the sofa, while we watched Romeo and Juliet kill themselves, one after the other. I wasn't going to live without you, he'd said, as if it should be such an obvious conclusion. But the words he had spoken in the forest as he'd left me had canceled all that out\u2014forcefully. \"If he were listening,\" she explained. \"But believe it or not, it's possible to lie with your thoughts. If you had died, I would still try to stop him. And I would be thinking 'she's alive, she's alive' as hard as I could.  He knows that.\" I ground my teeth in mute frustration. \"If there were any way to do this without you, Bella, I wouldn't be endangering you like this. It's very wrong of me.\" \"Don't be stupid. I'm the last thing you should be worrying about.\" I shook my head impatiently. \"Tell me what you meant, about hating to lie to Jasper.\" She smiled a grim smile. \"I promised him I would get out before they killed me, too. It's not something I can guarantee\u2014not by a long shot.\" She raised her eyebrows, as if willing me to take the danger more seriously. \"Who are these Volturi?\" I demanded in a whisper. \"What makes them so much more dangerous than Emmett, Jasper, Rosalie, and you?\" It was hard to imagine something scarier than that. She took a deep breath, and then abruptly leveled a dark glance over my shoulder. I turned in time to see the man in the aisle seat looking away as if he wasn't listening to us. He appeared to be a businessman, in a dark suit with a power tie and a laptop on his knees. While I stared at him with irritation, he opened the computer and very conspicuously put headphones on. I leaned closer to Alice. Her lips were at my ears as she breathed the story. \"I was surprised that you recognized the name,\" she said. \"That you understood so immediately what it meant\u2014when I said he was going to Italy. I thought I would have to explain. How much did Edward tell you?\" \"He just said they were an old, powerful family\u2014like royalty. That you didn't antagonize them unless you wanted to\u2026 die,\" I whispered. The last word was hard to choke out. \"You have to understand,\" she said, her voice slower, more measured now. \"We Cullens are unique in more ways than you know. It's\u2026 abnormal for so many of us to live together in peace. It's the same for Tanya's family in the north, and Carlisle speculates that abstaining makes it easier for us to be civilized, to form bonds based on love rather than survival or convenience. Even James's little coven of three was unusually large\u2014and you saw how easily Laurent left them. Our kind travel alone, or in pairs, as a general rule. Carlisle's family is the biggest in existence, as far as I know, with the one exception. The Volturi. \"There were three of them originally, Aro, Caius, and Marcus.\" \"I've seen them,\" I mumbled. \"In the picture in Carlisle's study.\" Alice nodded. \"Two females joined them over time, and the five of them make up the family. I'm not sure, but I suspect that their age is what gives them the ability to live peacefully together. They are well over three thousand years old. Or maybe it's their gifts that give them extra tolerance. Like Edward and I, Aro and Marcus are\u2026 talented.\" She continued before I could ask. \"Or maybe it's just their love of power that binds them together.\u00a0 Royalty is an apt description.\" \"But if there are only five\u2014\" \"Five that make up the family,\" she corrected. \"That doesn't include their guard.\" I took a deep breath. \"That sounds\u2026 serious.\" \"Oh, it is,\" she assured me. \"There were nine members of the guard that were permanent, the last time we heard. Others are more\u2026 transitory. It changes. And many of them are gifted as well\u2014with formidable gifts, gifts that make what I can do look like a parlor trick. The Volturi chose them for their abilities, physical or otherwise.\" I opened my mouth, and then closed it. I didn't think I wanted to know how bad the odds were.  She nodded again, as if she understood exactly what I was thinking. \"They don't get into too many confrontations. No one is stupid enough to mess with them. They stay in their city, leaving only as duty calls.\" \"Duty?\" I wondered. \"Didn't Edward tell you what they do?\" \"No,\" I said, feeling the blank expression on my face. Alice looked over my head again, toward the businessman, and put her wintry lips back to my ear. \"There's a reason he called them royalty\u2026 the ruling class. Over the millennia, they have assumed the position of enforcing our rules\u2014which actually translates to punishing transgressors. They fulfill that duty decisively.\" My eyes popped wide with shock. \"There are rules?\" I asked in a voice that was too loud. \"Shh!\" \"Shouldn't somebody have mentioned this to me earlier?\" I whispered angrily. \"I mean, I wanted to be a\u2026 to be one of you! Shouldn't somebody have explained the rules to me?\" Alice chuckled once at my reaction. \"It's not that complicated, Bella. There's only one core restriction\u2014and if you think about it, you can probably figure it out for yourself.\"  I thought about it. \"Nope, I have no idea.\" She shook her head, disappointed. \"Maybe it's too obvious. We just have to keep our existence a secret.\" \"Oh,\" I mumbled. It was obvious. \"It makes sense, and most of us don't need policing,\" she continued. \"But, after a few centuries, sometimes one of us gets bored. Or crazy. I don\u2019t know. And then the Volturi step in before it can compromise them, or the rest of us.\" \"So Edward\u2026\" \"Is planning to flout that in their own city\u2014the city they've secretly held for three thousand years, since the time of the Etruscans. They are so protective of their city that they don't allow hunting within its walls.\u00a0 Volterra is probably the safest city in the world\u2014from vampire attack at the very least.\" \"But you said they didn't leave. How do they eat?\" \"They don't leave. They bring in their food from the outside, from quite far away sometimes. It gives their guard something to do when they're not out annihilating mavericks. Or protecting Volterra from exposure\u2026\" \"From situations like this one, like Edward,\" I finished her sentence. It was amazingly easy to say his name now. I wasn't sure what the difference was. Maybe because I wasn't really planning on living much longer without seeing him. Or at all, if we were too late. It was comforting to know that I would have an easy out. \"I doubt they've ever had a situation quite like this,\" she muttered, disgusted. \"You don't get a lot of suicidal vampires.\" The sound that escaped out of my mouth was very quiet, but Alice seemed to understand that it was a cry of pain. She wrapped her thin, strong arm around my shoulders. \"We'll do what we can, Bella. It's not over yet.\" \"Not yet.\" I let her comfort me, though I knew she thought our chances were poor. \"And the Volturi will get us if we mess up.\" Alice stiffened. \"You say that like it's a good thing.\" I shrugged. \"Knock it off, Bella, or we're turning around in New York and going back to Forks.\" \"What?\" \"You know what. If we're too late for Edward, I'm going to do my damnedest to get you back to Charlie, and I don't want any trouble from you. Do you understand that?\" \"Sure, Alice.\" She pulled back slightly so that she could glare at me. \"No trouble.\" \"Scout's honor,\" I muttered. She rolled her eyes. \"Let me concentrate, now. I'm trying to see what he's planning.\" She left her arm around me, but let her head fall back against the seat and closed her eyes. She pressed her free hand to the side of her face, rubbing her fingertips against her temple. I watched her in fascination for a long time. Eventually, she became utterly motionless, her face like a stone sculpture. The minutes passed, and if I didn't know better, I would have thought she'd fallen asleep. I didn't dare interrupt her to ask what was going on. I wished there was something safe for me to think about. I couldn't allow myself to consider the horrors we were headed toward, or, more horrific yet, the chance that we might fail\u2014not if I wanted to keep from screaming aloud. I couldn't anticipate anything, either. Maybe, if I were very, very, very lucky, I would somehow be able to save Edward. But I wasn't so stupid as to think that saving him would mean that I could stay with him. I was no different, no more special than I'd been before. There would be no new reason for him to want me now. Seeing him and losing him again\u2026 I fought back against the pain. This was the price I had to pay to save his life. I would pay it.  They showed a movie, and my neighbor got headphones. Sometimes I watched the figures moving across the little screen, but I couldn't even tell if the movie was supposed to be a romance or a horror film. After an eternity, the plane began to descend toward New York City. Alice remained in her trance. I dithered, reaching out to touch her, only to pull my hand back again. This happened a dozen times before the plane touched town with a jarring impact. \"Alice,\" I finally said. \"Alice, we have to go.\" I touched her arm. Her eyes came open very slowly. She shook her head from side to side for a moment. \"Anything new?\" I asked in a low voice, conscious of the man listening on the other side of me. \"Not exactly,\" she breathed in a voice I could barely catch. \"He's getting closer. He's deciding how he's going to ask.\" We had to run for our connection, but that was good\u2014better than having to wait. As soon as the plane was in the air, Alice closed her eyes and slid back into the same stupor as before. I waited as patiently as I could. When it was dark again, I opened the window to stare out into the flat black that was no better than the window shade. I was grateful that I'd had so many months' practice with controlling my thoughts. Instead of dwelling on the terrifying possibilities that, no matter what Alice said, I did not intend to survive, I concentrated on lesser problems. Like, what I was going to say to Charlie if I got back:' That was a thorny enough problem to occupy several hours. And Jacob? He'd promised to wait for me, but did that promise still apply? Would I end up home alone in Forks, with no one at all? Maybe I didn't want to survive, no matter what happened. It felt like seconds later when Alice shook my shoulder\u2014I hadn't realized I'd fallen \u00a0asleep. \"Bella,\" she hissed, her voice a little too loud in the darkened cabin full of sleeping humans. I wasn't disoriented\u2014I hadn't been out long enough for that. \"What's wrong?\" Alice's eyes gleamed in the dim light of a reading lamp in the row behind us. \"It's not wrong.\" She smiled fiercely. \"It's right. They're deliberating, but they've decided to tell him no.\" \"The Volturi?\" I muttered, groggy. \"Of course, Bella, keep up. I can see what they're going to say.\" \"Tell me.\" An attendant tiptoed down the aisle to us. \"Can I get you ladies a pillow?\" His hushed whisper was a rebuke to our comparatively loud conversation. \"No, thank you.\" Alice beamed at up at him, her smile shockingly lovely. The attendant's expression was dazed as he turned and stumbled his way back. \"Tell me,\" I breathed almost silently. She whispered into my ear. \"They're interested in him\u2014they think his talent could be useful. They're going to offer him a place with them.\" \"What will he say?\" \"I can't see that yet, but I'll bet it's colorful.\" She grinned again. \"This is the first good news\u2014the first break. They're intrigued; they truly don't want to destroy him\u2014'wasteful,' that's the word Aro will use\u2014and that may be enough to force him to get creative. The longer he spends on his plans, the better for us.\" It wasn't enough to make me hopeful, to make me feel the relief she obviously felt. There were still so many ways that we could be too late. And if I didn't get through the walls into the Volturi city, I wouldn't be able to stop Alice from dragging me back home. \"Alice?\" \"What?\" \"I'm confused. How are you seeing this so clearly? And then other times, you see things far away\u2014things that don't happen?\" Her eyes tightened. I wondered if she guessed what I was thinking of. \"It's clear because it's immediate and close, and I'm really concentrating. The faraway things that come on their own\u2014those are just glimpses, faint maybes. Plus, I see my kind more easily than yours. Edward is even easier because I'm so attuned to him.\" \"You see me sometimes,\" I reminded her. She shook her head. \"Not as clearly.\" I sighed. \"I really wish you could have been right about me. In the beginning, when you first saw things about me, before we even met\u2026\" \"What do you mean?\" \"You saw me become one of you.\" I barely mouthed the words. She sighed. \"It was a possibility at the time.\" \"At the time,\" I repeated. \"Actually, Bella\u2026\" She hesitated, and then seemed to make a choice. \"Honestly, I think it's all gotten beyond ridiculous. I'm debating whether to just change you myself.\" I stared at her, frozen with shock. Instantly, my mind resisted her words. I couldn't afford that kind of hope if she changed her mind. \"Did I scare you?\" she wondered. \"I thought that's what you wanted.\" \"I do!\" I gasped. \"Oh, Alice, do it now! I could help you so much\u2014and I wouldn't slow you down. Bite me!\" \"Shh,\" she cautioned. The attendant was looking in our direction again. \"Try to be reasonable,\" she whispered. \"We don't have enough time. We have to get into Volterra tomorrow. You'd be writhing in pain for days.\" She made a face. \"And I don't think the other passengers would react well.\" I bit my lip. \"If you don't do it now, you'll change your mind.\" \"No.\" She frowned, her expression unhappy. \"I don't think I will. He'll be furious, but what will he be able to do about it?\" My heart beat faster. \"Nothing at all.\" She laughed quietly, and then sighed. \"You have too much faith in me, Bella. I'm not sure that I can. I'll probably just end up killing you.\" \"I'll take my chances.\" \"You are so bizarre, even for a human.\" \"Thanks.\" \"Oh well, this is purely hypothetical at this point, anyway. First we have to live through tomorrow.\" \"Good point.\" But at least I had something to hope for if we did. If Alice made good on her promise\u2014and if she didn't kill me\u2014then Edward could run after his distractions all he wanted, and I could follow. I wouldn't let him be distracted. Maybe, when I was beautiful and strong, he wouldn't want distractions. \"Go back to sleep,\" she encouraged me. \"I'll wake you up when there's something new.\" \"Right,\" I grumbled, certain that sleep was a lost cause now. Alice pulled her legs up on the seat, wrapping her arms Around them and leaning her forehead against her knees. She rocked back and forth as she concentrated. I rested my head against the seat, watching her, and the next thing I knew, she was snapping the shade closed against the faint <em>brightening</em> in the eastern sky. \"What's happening?\" I mumbled. \"They've told him no,\" she said quietly. I noticed at once that her enthusiasm was gone. My voice choked in my throat with panic. \"What's he going to do?\" \"It was chaotic at first. I was only getting flickers, he was changing plans so quickly.\" \"What kinds of plans?\" I pressed. \"There was a bad hour,\" she whispered. \"He'd decided to go hunting.\" She looked at me, seeing the comprehension in my face. \"In the city,\" she explained. \"It got very close. He changed his mind at the last minute.\" \"He wouldn't want to disappoint Carlisle,\" I mumbled. Not at the end. \"Probably,\" she agreed. \"Will there be enough time?\" As I spoke, there was a shift in the cabin pressure. I could feel the plane angling downward. \"I'm hoping so\u2014if he sticks to his latest decision, maybe.\" \"What is that?\" \"He's going to keep it simple. He's just going to walk out into the sun.\" Just walk out into the sun. That was all. It would be enough. The image of Edward in the meadow\u2014glowing, shimmering like his skin was made of a million diamond facets\u2014was burned into my memory. No human who saw that would ever forget. The Volturi couldn't possibly allow it. Not if they wanted to keep their city inconspicuous. I looked at the slight gray glow that shone through the opened windows. \"We'll be too late,\" I whispered, my throat closing in panic. She shook her head. \"Right now, he's leaning toward the melodramatic. He wants the biggest audience possible, so he'll choose the main plaza, under the clock tower. The walls are high there. He'll wait till the sun is exactly overhead.\" \"So we have till noon?\" \"If we're lucky. If he sticks with this decision.\" The pilot came on over the intercom, announcing, first in French and then in English, our imminent landing. The seat belt lights dinged and flashed. \"How far is it from Florence to Volterra?\" \"That depends on how fast you drive\u2026 Bella?\" \"Yes?\" She eyed me speculatively. \"How strongly are you opposed to grand theft auto?\" A bright yellow Porsche screamed to a stop a few feet in front of where I paced, the word TURBO scrawled in silver cursive across its back. Everyone beside me on the crowded airport sidewalk stared. \"Hurry, Bella!\" Alice shouted impatiently through the open passenger window. I ran to the door and threw myself in, feeling as though I might as well be wearing a black stocking over my head. \"Sheesh, Alice,\" I complained. \"Could you pick a more conspicuous car to steal?\" The interior was black leather, and the windows were tinted dark. It felt safer inside, like nighttime. Alice was already weaving, too fast, through the thick airport traffic\u2014sliding through tiny spaces between the cars as I cringed and fumbled for my seat belt. \"The important question,\" she corrected, \"is whether I could have stolen a faster car, and I don't think so. I got lucky.\" \"I'm sure that will be very comforting at the roadblock.\" She trilled a laugh. \"Trust me, Bella. If anyone sets up a roadblock, it will be behind us.\" She hit the gas then, as if to prove her point. I probably should have watched out the window as first the city of Florence and then the Tuscan landscape flashed past with blurring speed. This was my first trip anywhere, and maybe my last, too. But Alice's driving frightened me, despite the fact that I knew I could trust her behind the wheel. And I was too tortured with anxiety to really see the hills or the walled towns that looked like castles in the distance. \"Do you see anything more?\" \"There's something going on,\" Alice muttered. \"Some kind of festival. The streets are full of people and red flags. What's the date today?\" I wasn't entirely sure. \"The nineteenth, maybe?\" \"Well, that's ironic. It's Saint Marcus Day.\" \"Which means?\" She chuckled darkly. \"The city holds a celebration every year. As the legend goes, a Christian missionary, a Father Marcus\u2014Marcus of the Voltun, in fact\u2014drove all the vampires from Volterra fifteen hundred years ago. The story claims he was martyred in Romania, still trying to drive away the vampire scourge. Of course that's nonsense\u2014he's never left the city. But that's where some of the superstitions about things like crosses and garlic come from. Father Marcus used them so successfully. And vampires don't trouble Volterra, so they must work.\" Her smile was sardonic. \"It's become more of a celebration of the city, and recognition for the police force\u2014after all, Volterra is an amazingly safe city. The police get the credit.\" I was realizing what she meant when she'd said ironic. \"They're not going to be very happy if Edward messes things up for them on St. Marcus Day, are they?\" She shook her head, her expression grim. \"No. They'll act very quickly.\" I looked away, fighting against my teeth as they tried to break through the skin of my lower lip. Bleeding was not the best idea right now. The sun was terrifyingly high in the pale blue sky. \"He's still planning on noon?\" I checked. \"Yes. He's decided to wait. And they're waiting for him.\" \"Tell me what I have to do.\" She kept her eyes on the winding road\u2014the needle on the speedometer was touching the far right on the dial. \"You don't have to do anything. He just has to see you before he moves into the light. And he has to see you before he sees me.\" \"How are we going to work that?\" A small red car seemed to be racing backward as Alice zoomed Around it. \"I'm going to get you as close as possible, and then you're going to run in the direction I point you.\" I nodded. \"Try not to trip,\" she added. \"We don't have time for a concussion today.\" I groaned. That would be just like me\u2014ruin everything, destroy the world, in a moment of klutziness. The sun continued to climb in the sky while Alice raced against it. It was too bright:, and that had me panicking. Maybe he wouldn't feel the need to wait for noon after all. \"There,\" Alice said abruptly, pointing to the castle city atop the closest hill. I stared at it, feeling the very first hint of a new kind of fear. Every minute since yesterday morning\u2014it seemed like a week ago\u2014when Alice had spoken his name at the foot of the stairs, there had been only one fear. And yet, now, as I stared at the ancient sienna walls and towers crowning the peak of the steep hill, I felt another, more selfish kind of dread thrill through me. I supposed the city was very beautiful. It absolutely terrified me. \"Volterra,\" Alice announced in a flat, icy voice.",

            "en": "4. NATURE I WAS HAVING A BAD WEEK. I knew that essentially nothing had changed. Okay, so Victoria had not given up, but had I ever dreamed for one moment that she had? Her reappearance had only confirmed what I\u2019d already known. No reason for fresh panic. In theory. Not panicking was easier said than done. Graduation was only a few weeks away, but I wondered if it wasn\u2019t a little foolish to sit around, weak and tasty, waiting for the next disaster. It seemed too dangerous to be human \u2014 just begging for trouble. Someone like me shouldn\u2019t be human. Someone with my luck ought to be a little less helpless. But no one would listen to me. Carlisle had said, \u201cThere are seven of us, Bella. And with Alice on our side, I don\u2019t think Victoria\u2019s going to catch us off guard. I think it\u2019s important, for Charlie\u2019s sake, that we stick with the original plan.\u201d Esme had said, \u201cWe\u2019d never allow anything to happen to you, sweetheart. You know that. Please don\u2019t be anxious.\u201d And then she\u2019d kissed my forehead. Emmett had said, \u201cI\u2019m really glad Edward didn\u2019t kill you. Everything\u2019s so much more fun with you around.\u201d Rosalie had glared at him. Alice had rolled her eyes and said, \u201cI\u2019m offended. You\u2019re not honestly worried about this, are you?\u201d \u201cIf it\u2019s no big deal, then why did Edward drag me to Florida?\u201d I\u2019d demanded. \u201cHaven\u2019t you noticed yet, Bella, that Edward is just the teeniest bit prone to overreaction?\u201d Jasper had silently erased all the panic and tension in my body with his curious talent of controlling emotional atmospheres. I\u2019d felt reassured, and let them talk me out of my desperate pleading. Of course, that calm had worn off as soon as Edward and I had walked out of the room. So the consensus was that I was just supposed to forget that a deranged vampire was stalking me, intent on my death. Go about my business. I did try. And surprisingly, there were other things almost as stressful to dwell on besides my status on the endangered species list. . . . Because Edward\u2019s response had been the most frustrating of them all. \u201cThat\u2019s between you and Carlisle,\u201d he\u2019d said. \u201cOf course, you know that I\u2019m willing to make it between you and me at any time that you wish. You know my condition.\u201d And he had smiled angelically. Ugh. I did know his condition. Edward had promised that he would change me himself whenever I wanted . . . just as long as I was married to him first. Sometimes I wondered if he was only pretending that he couldn\u2019t read my mind. How else had he struck upon the one condition that I would have trouble accepting? The one condition that would slow me down. All in all, a very bad week. And today was the worst day in it. It was always a bad day when Edward was away. Alice had foreseen nothing out of the ordinary this weekend, and so I\u2019d insisted that he take the opportunity to go hunting with his brothers. I knew how it bored him to hunt the easy, nearby prey. \u201cGo have fun,\u201d I\u2019d told him. \u201cBag a few mountain lions for me.\u201d I would never admit to him how hard it was for me when he was gone \u2014 how it brought back the abandonment nightmares. If he knew that, it would make him feel horrible and he would be afraid to ever leave me, even for the most necessary reasons. It had been like that in the beginning, when he\u2019d first returned from Italy. His golden eyes had turned black and he\u2019d suffered from his thirst more than it was already necessary that he suffer. So I put on a brave face and all but kicked him out the door whenever Emmett and Jasper wanted to go. I think he saw through me, though. A little. This morning there had been a note left on my pillow: I\u2019ll be back so soon you won\u2019t have time to miss me. Look after my heart \u2014 I\u2019ve left it with you. So now I had a big empty Saturday with nothing but my morning shift at Newton\u2019s Olympic Outfitters to distract me. And, of course, the oh-so-comforting promise from Alice. \u201cI\u2019m staying close to home to hunt. I\u2019ll only be fifteen minutes away if you need me. I\u2019ll keep an eye out for trouble.\u201d Translation: don\u2019t try anything funny just because Edward is gone. Alice was certainly just as capable of crippling my truck as Edward was. I tried to look on the bright side. After work, I had plans to help Angela with her announcements, so that would be a distraction. And Charlie was in an excellent mood due to Edward\u2019s absence, so I might as well enjoy that while it lasted. Alice would spend the night with me if I was pathetic enough to ask her to. And then tomorrow, Edward would be home. I would survive. Not wanting to be ridiculously early for work, I ate my breakfast slowly, one Cheerio at a time. Then, when I\u2019d washed the dishes, I arranged the magnets on the fridge into a perfect line. Maybe I was developing obsessive-compulsive disorder. The last two magnets \u2014 round black utilitarian pieces that were my favorites because they could hold ten sheets of paper to the fridge without breaking a sweat \u2014 did not want to cooperate with my fixation. Their polarities were reversed; every time I tried to line the last one up, the other jumped out of place. For some reason \u2014 impending mania, perhaps \u2014 this really irritated me. Why couldn\u2019t they just play nice? Stupid with stubbornness, I kept shoving them together as if I was expecting them to suddenly give up. I could have flipped one over, but that felt like losing. Finally, exasperated at myself more than the magnets, I pulled them from the fridge and held them together with two hands. It took a little effort \u2014 they were strong enough to put up a fight \u2014 but I forced them to coexist side-by-side. \u201cSee,\u201d I said out loud \u2014 talking to inanimate objects, never a good sign \u2014 \u201cThat\u2019s not so horrible, is it?\u201d I stood there like an idiot for a second, not quite able to admit that I wasn\u2019t having any lasting effect against scientific principles. Then, with a sigh, I put the magnets back on the fridge, a foot apart. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to be so inflexible,\u201d I muttered. It was still too early, but I decided I\u2019d better get out of the house before the inanimate objects started talking back. When I got to Newton\u2019s, Mike was methodically dry mopping the aisles while his mom arranged a new counter display. I caught them in the middle of an argument, unaware that I had arrived. \u201cBut it\u2019s the only time that Tyler can go,\u201d Mike complained. \u201cYou said after graduation \u2014 \u201cYou\u2019re just going to have to wait,\u201d Mrs. Newton snapped. \u201cYou and Tyler can think of something else to do. You are not going to Seattle until the police stop whatever it is that is going on there. I know Beth Crowley has told Tyler the same thing, so don\u2019t act like I\u2019m the bad guy \u2014 oh, good morning, Bella,\u201d she said when she caught sight of me, <em>brightening</em> her tone quickly. \u201cYou\u2019re early.\u201d Karen Newton was the last person I\u2019d think to ask for help in an outdoor sports equipment store. Her perfectly highlighted blond hair was always smoothed into an elegant twist on the back of her neck, her fingernails were polished by professionals, as were her toenails \u2014 visible through the strappy high heels that didn\u2019t resemble anything Newton\u2019s offered on the long row of hiking boots. \u201cLight traffic,\u201d I joked as I grabbed my hideous fluorescent orange vest out from under the counter. I was surprised that Mrs. Newton was as worked up about this Seattle thing as Charlie. I\u2019d thought he was going to extremes. \u201cWell, er . . .\u201d Mrs. Newton hesitated for a moment, playing uncomfortably with a stack of flyers she was arranging by the register. I stopped with one arm in my vest. I knew that look. When I\u2019d let the Newtons know that I wouldn\u2019t be working here this summer \u2014 abandoning them in their busiest season, in effect \u2014 they\u2019d started training Katie Marshall to take my place. They couldn\u2019t really afford both of us on the payroll at the same time, so when it looked like a slow day . . . \u201cI was going to call,\u201d Mrs. Newton continued. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re expecting a ton of business today.\u00a0 Mike and I can probably handle things. I\u2019m sorry you got up and drove out. . . .\u201d On a normal day, I would be ecstatic with this turn of events. Today . . . not so much. \u201cOkay,\u201d I sighed. My shoulders slumped. What was I going to do now? \u201cThat\u2019s not fair, Mom,\u201d Mike said. \u201cIf Bella wants to work \u2014\u201d \u201cNo, it\u2019s okay, Mrs. Newton. Really, Mike. I\u2019ve got finals to study for and stuff. . . .\u201d I didn\u2019t want to be a source of familial discord when they were already arguing. \u201cThanks, Bella. Mike, you missed aisle four. Um, Bella, do you mind throwing these flyers in a Dumpster on the way out? I told the girl who left them here that I\u2019d put them on the counter, but I really don\u2019t have the room.\u201d \u201cSure, no problem.\u201d I put my vest away, and then tucked the flyers under my arm and headed out into the misty rain. The Dumpster was around the side of Newton\u2019s, next to where we employees were supposed to park. I shuffled along, kicking pebbles petulantly on my way. I was about to fling the stack of bright yellow papers into the trash when the heading printed in bold across the top caught my eye. One word in particular seized my attention. I clutched the papers in both hands as I stared at the picture beneath the caption. A lump rose in my throat. SAVE THE OLYMPIC WOLF Under the words, there was a detailed drawing of a wolf in front of a fir tree, its head thrown back in the act of baying at the moon. It was a disconcerting picture; something about the wolf\u2019s plaintive posture made him look forlorn. Like he was howling in grief. And then I was running to my truck, the flyers still locked in my grip. Fifteen minutes \u2014 that\u2019s all I had. But it should be long enough. It was only fifteen minutes to La Push, and surely I would cross the boundary line a few minutes before I hit the town. My truck roared to life without any difficulty.  Alice couldn\u2019t have seen me doing this, because I hadn\u2019t been planning it. A snap decision, that was the key! And as long as I moved fast enough, I should be able to capitalize on it. I\u2019d thrown the damp flyers in my haste and they were scattered in a bright mess across the passenger seat \u2014 a hundred bolded captions, a hundred dark howling wolves outlined against the yellow background. I barreled down the wet highway, turning the windshield wipers on high and ignoring the groan of the ancient engine. Fifty-five was the most I could coax out of my truck, and I prayed it would be enough. I had no clue where the boundary line was, but I began to feel safer as I passed the first houses outside La Push. This must be beyond where Alice was allowed to follow. I\u2019d call her when I got to Angela\u2019s this afternoon, I reasoned, so that she\u2019d know I was fine. There was no reason for her to get worked up. She didn\u2019t need to be mad at me \u2014 Edward would be angry enough for two when he got back. My truck was positively wheezing by the time it grated to a stop in front of the familiar faded red house. The lump came back to my throat as I stared at the little place that had once been my refuge. It had been so long since I\u2019d been here. Before I could cut the engine, Jacob was standing in the door, his face blank with shock. In the sudden silence when the truck-roar died, I heard him gasp. \u201cBella?\u201d \u201cHey, Jake!\u201d \u201cBella!\u201d he yelled back, and the smile I\u2019d been waiting for stretched across his face like the sun breaking free of the clouds. His teeth gleamed bright against his russet skin. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it!\u201d He ran to the truck and half-yanked me through the open door, and then we were both jumping up and down like kids. \u201cHow did you get here?\u201d \u201cI snuck out!\u201d \u201cAwesome!\u201d \u201cHey, Bella!\u201d Billy had rolled himself into the doorway to see what all the commotion was about. \u201cHey, Bil \u2014!\u201d Just then my air choked off \u2014 Jacob grabbed me up in a bear hug too tight to breathe and swung me around in a circle. \u201cWow, it\u2019s good to see you here!\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t . . . breathe,\u201d I gasped. He laughed and put me down. \u201cWelcome back, Bella,\u201d he said, grinning. And the way he said the words made it sound like welcome home . We started walking, too keyed up to sit still in the house. Jacob was practically bouncing as he moved, and I had to remind him a few times that my legs weren\u2019t ten feet long. As we walked, I felt myself settling into another version of myself, the self I had been with Jacob. A little younger, a little less responsible. Someone who might, on occasion, do something really stupid for no good reason. Our exuberance lasted through the first few topics of conversation: how we were doing, what we were up to, how long I had, and what had brought me here. When I hesitantly told him about the wolf flyer, his bellowing laugh echoed back from the trees. But then, as we ambled past the back of the store and shoved through the thick scrub that ringed the far edge of First Beach, we got to the hard parts. All too soon we had to talk about the reasons behind our long separation, and I watched as the face of my friend hardened into the bitter mask that was already too familiar. \u201cSo what\u2019s the story, anyway?\u201d Jacob asked me, kicking a piece of driftwood out of his way with too much force. It sailed over the sand and then clattered against the rocks. \u201cI mean, since the last time we . . . well, before, you know . . .\u201d He struggled for the words. He took a deep breath and tried again. \u201cWhat I\u2019m asking is . . . everything is just back to the way it was before he left? You forgave him for all of that?\u201d I took a deep breath. \u201cThere was nothing to forgive.\u201d I wanted to skip past this part, the betrayals, the accusations, but I knew that we had to talk it through before we\u2019d be able to move on to anything else. Jacob\u2019s face puckered up like he\u2019d just licked a lemon. \u201cI wish Sam had taken a picture when he found you that night last September. It would be exhibit A.\u201d \u201cNobody\u2019s on trial.\u201d \u201cMaybe somebody should be.\u201d \u201cNot even you would blame him for leaving, if you knew the reason why.\u201d He glared at me for a few seconds. \u201cOkay,\u201d he challenged acidly. \u201cAmaze me.\u201d His hostility was wearing on me \u2014 chafing against the raw; it hurt to have him angry with me. It reminded me of the bleak afternoon, long ago, when \u2014 under orders from Sam \u2014 he\u2019d told me we couldn\u2019t be friends. I took a second to compose myself. \u201cEdward left me last fall because he didn\u2019t think I should be hanging out with vampires. He thought it would be healthier for me if he left.\u201d Jacob did a double take. He had to scramble for a minute. Whatever he\u2019d been planning to say, it clearly no longer applied. I was glad he didn\u2019t know the catalyst behind Edward\u2019s decision. I could only imagine what he\u2019d think if he knew Jasper had tried to kill me. \u201cHe came back, though, didn\u2019t he?\u201d Jacob muttered. \u201cToo bad he can\u2019t stick to a decision.\u201d \u201cIf you remember,I went and got him .\u201d Jacob stared at me for a moment, and then he backed off. His face relaxed, and his voice was calmer when he spoke. \u201cThat\u2019s true. So I never did get the story. What happened?\u201d I hesitated, biting my lip. \u201cIs it a secret?\u201d His voice took on a taunting edge. \u201cAre you not allowed to tell me?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I snapped. \u201cIt\u2019s just a really long story.\u201d Jacob smiled, arrogant, and turned to walk up the beach, expecting me to follow. It was no fun being with Jacob if he was going to act like this. I trailed behind him automatically, not sure if I shouldn\u2019t turn around and leave. I was going to have to face Alice, though, when I got home. . . . I supposed I wasn\u2019t in any rush. Jacob walked to a huge, familiar piece of driftwood \u2014 an entire tree, roots and all, bleached white and beached deep in the sand; it was our tree, in a way. Jacob sat down on the natural bench, and patted the space next to him. \u201cI don\u2019t mind long stories. Is there any action?\u201d I rolled my eyes as I sat next to him. \u201cThere\u2019s some action,\u201d I allowed. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be real horror without action.\u201d \u201cHorror!\u201d I scoffed. \u201cCan you listen, or will you be interrupting me with rude comments about my friends?\u201d He pretended to lock his lips and then threw the invisible key over his shoulder. I tried not to smile, and failed. \u201cI\u2019ll have to start with the stuff you were already there for,\u201d I decided, working to organize the stories in my head before I began. Jacob raised his hand. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand much that was going on at the time.\u201d \u201cYeah, well, it gets complicated, so pay attention. You know how Alice sees things?\u201d I took his scowl \u2014 the wolves weren\u2019t thrilled that the legends of vampires possessing supernatural gifts were true \u2014 for a yes, and proceeded with the account of my race through Italy to rescue Edward. I kept it as succinct as possible \u2014 leaving out anything that wasn\u2019t essential. I tried to read Jacob\u2019s reactions, but his face was enigmatic as I explained how Alice had seen Edward plan to kill himself when he\u2019d heard that I was dead. Sometimes Jacob seemed so deep in thought, I wasn\u2019t sure if he was listening. He only interrupted one time. \u201cThe fortune-telling bloodsucker can\u2019t see us?\u201d he echoed, his face both fierce and gleeful. \u201cSeriously? That\u2019s excellent !\u201d I clenched my teeth together, and we sat in silence, his face expectant as he waited for me to continue. I glared at him until he realized his mistake. \u201cOops!\u201d he said. \u201cSorry.\u201d He locked his lips again. His response was easier to read when I got to the part about the Volturi. His teeth clenched together, goose bumps rose on his arms, and his nostrils flared. I didn\u2019t go into specifics, I just told him that Edward had talked us out of trouble, without revealing the promise we\u2019d had to make, or the visit we were anticipating. Jacob didn\u2019t need to have my nightmares. \u201cNow you know the whole story,\u201d I concluded. \u201cSo it\u2019s your turn to talk. What happened while I was with my mom this weekend?\u201d I knew Jacob would give me more details than Edward had. He wasn\u2019t afraid of scaring me. Jacob leaned forward, instantly animated. \u201cSo Embry and Quil and I were running patrol on Saturday night, just routine stuff, when out of nowhere \u2014 bam!\u201d He threw his arms out, impersonating an explosion. \u201cThere it is \u2014 a fresh trail, not fifteen minutes old. Sam wanted us to wait for him, but I didn\u2019t know you were gone, and I didn\u2019t know if your bloodsuckers were keeping an eye on you or not. So we took off after her at full speed, but she\u2019d crossed the treaty line before we caught up. We spread out along the line, hoping she\u2019d cross back over. It was frustrating, let me tell you.\u201d He wagged his head and his hair \u2014 growing out from the short crop he\u2019d adopted when he\u2019d joined the pack \u2014 flopped into his eyes. \u201cWe ended up too far south. The Cullens chased her back to our side just a few miles north of us. Would have been the perfect ambush if we\u2019d known where to wait.\u201d He shook his head, grimacing now. \u201cThat\u2019s when it got dicey. Sam and the others caught up to her before we did, but she was dancing right along the line, and the whole coven was right there on the other side. The big one, what\u2019s-his-name \u2014\u201d \u201cEmmett.\u201d \u201cYeah, him. He made a lunge for her, but that redhead is fast! He flew right behind her and almost rammed into Paul. So, Paul . . . well, you know Paul.\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cLost his focus. Can\u2019t say that I blame him \u2014 the big bloodsucker was right on top of him. He sprang \u2014 hey, don\u2019t give me that look. The vampire was on our land.\u201d I tried to compose my face so that he would go on. My nails were digging into my palms with the stress of the story, even though I knew it had turned out fine. \u201cAnyway, Paul missed, and the big one got back on his side. But by then the, er, well the, uh, blonde . . .\u201d Jacob\u2019s expression was a comical mix of disgust and unwilling admiration as he tried to come up with a word to describe Edward\u2019s sister. \u201cRosalie.\u201d \u201cWhatever. She got real territorial, so Sam and I fell back to get Paul\u2019s flanks. Then their leader and the other blond male \u2014\u201d \u201cCarlisle and Jasper.\u201d He gave me an exasperated look. \u201cYou know I don\u2019t really care. Anyway, so Carlisle spoke to Sam, trying to calm things down. Then it was weird, because everyone got really calm really fast. It was that other one you told me about, messing with our heads. But even though we knew what he was doing, we couldn\u2019t not be calm.\u201d \u201cYeah, I know how it feels.\u201d \u201cReally annoying, that\u2019s how it feels. Only you can\u2019t be annoyed until afterwards.\u201d He shook his head angrily. \u201cSo Sam and the head vamp agreed that Victoria was the priority, and we started after her again.  Carlisle gave us the line, so that we could follow the scent properly, but then she hit the cliffs just north of Makah country, right where the line hugs the coast for a few miles. She took off into the water again. The big one and the calm one wanted permission to cross the line to go after her, but of course we said no.\u201d \u201cGood. I mean, you were being stupid, but I\u2019m glad. Emmett\u2019s never cautious enough. He could have gotten hurt.\u201d Jacob snorted. \u201cSo did your vampire tell you we attacked for no reason and his totally innocent coven \u2014\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I interrupted. \u201cEdward told me the same story, just without quite as many details.\u201d \u201cHuh,\u201d Jacob said under his breath, and he bent over to pick up a rock from among the millions of pebbles at our feet. With a casual flick, he sent it flying a good hundred meters out into the bay. \u201cWell, she\u2019ll be back, I guess. We\u2019ll get another shot at her.\u201d I shuddered; of course she would be back. Would Edward really tell me next time? I wasn\u2019t sure. I\u2019d have to keep an eye on Alice, to look for the signs that the pattern was about to repeat. . . . Jacob didn\u2019t seem to notice my reaction. He was staring across the waves with a thoughtful expression on his face, his broad lips pursed. \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d I asked after a long, quiet time. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about what you told me. About when the fortune-teller saw you cliff jumping and thought you\u2019d committed suicide, and how it all got out of control. . . . Do you realize that if you had just waited for me like you were supposed to, then the bl \u2014Alice wouldn\u2019t have been able to see you jump? Nothing would have changed. We\u2019d probably be in my garage right now, like any other Saturday. There wouldn\u2019t be any vampires in Forks, and you and me . . .\u201d He trailed off, deep in thought. It was disconcerting the way he said this, like it would be a good thing to have no vampires in Forks. My heart thumped unevenly at the emptiness of the picture he painted. \u201cEdward would have come back anyway.\u201d \u201cAre you sure about that?\u201d he asked, belligerent again as soon as I spoke Edward\u2019s name. \u201cBeing apart . . . It didn\u2019t work out so well for either of us.\u201d He started to say something, something angry from his expression, but he stopped himself, took a breath, and began again. \u201cDid you know Sam is mad at you?\u201d \u201cMe?\u201d It took me a second. \u201cOh. I see. He thinks they would have stayed away if I wasn\u2019t here.\u201d \u201cNo. That\u2019s not it.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s his problem then?\u201d Jacob leaned down to scoop up another rock. He turned it over and over in his fingers; his eyes were riveted on the black stone while he spoke in a low voice. \u201cWhen Sam saw . . . how you were in the beginning, when Billy told them how Charlie worried when you didn\u2019t get better, and then when you started jumping off cliffs . . .\u201d I made a face. No one was ever going to let me forget that. Jacob\u2019s eyes flashed up to mine. \u201cHe thought you were the one person in the world with as much reason to hate the Cullens as he does. Sam feels sort of . . . betrayed that you would just let them back into your life like they never hurt you.\u201d I didn\u2019t believe for a second that Sam was the only one who felt that way. And the acid in my voice now was for both of them. \u201cYou can tell Sam to go right to \u2014\u201d \u201cLook at that,\u201d Jacob interrupted me, pointing to an eagle in the act of plummeting down toward the ocean from an incredible height. It checked itself at the last minute, only its talons breaking the surface of the waves, just for an instant. Then it flapped away, its wings straining against the load of the huge fish it had snagged. \u201cYou see it everywhere,\u201d Jacob said, his voice suddenly distant. \u201cNature taking its course \u2014 hunter and prey, the endless cycle of life and death.\u201d I didn\u2019t understand the point of the nature lecture; I guessed that he was just trying to change the subject. But then he looked down at me with dark humor in his eyes. \u201cAnd yet, you don\u2019t see the fish trying to plant a kiss on the eagle. You never see that .\u201d He grinned a mocking grin. I grinned back tightly, though the acid taste was still in my mouth. \u201cMaybe the fish was trying,\u201d I suggested. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell what a fish is thinking. Eagles are good-looking birds, you know.\u201d \u201cIs that what it comes down to?\u201d His voice was abruptly sharper. \u201cGood looks?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be stupid, Jacob.\u201d \u201cIs it the money, then?\u201d he persisted. \u201cThat\u2019s nice,\u201d I muttered, getting up from the tree. \u201cI\u2019m flattered that you think so much of me.\u201d I turned my back on him and paced away. \u201cAw, don\u2019t get mad.\u201d He was right behind me; he caught my wrist and spun me around. \u201cI\u2019m serious!\u00a0 I\u2019m trying to understand here, and I\u2019m coming up blank.\u201d His eyebrows pushed together angrily, and his eyes were black in their deep shadow. \u201cI love him . Not because he\u2019s beautiful or because he\u2019s rich !\u201d I spat the word at Jacob. \u201cI\u2019d much rather he weren\u2019t either one. It would even out the gap between us just a little bit \u2014 because he\u2019d still be the most loving and unselfish and brilliant and decent person I\u2019ve ever met. Of course I love him. How hard is that to understand?\u201d \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to understand.\u201d \u201cPlease enlighten me, then, Jacob.\u201d I let the sarcasm flow thick. \u201cWhat is a valid reason for someone to love someone else? Since apparently I\u2019m doing it wrong.\u201d \u201cI think the best place to start would be to look within your own species. That usually works.\u201d \u201cWell, that just sucks!\u201d I snapped. \u201cI guess I\u2019m stuck with Mike Newton after all.\u201d Jacob flinched back and bit his lip. I could see that my words had hurt him, but I was too mad to feel bad about that yet. He dropped my wrist and folded his arms across his chest, turning from me to glare toward the ocean. \u201cI\u2019m human,\u201d he muttered, his voice almost inaudible. \u201cYou\u2019re not as human as Mike,\u201d I continued ruthlessly. \u201cDo you still think that\u2019s the most important consideration?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not the same thing.\u201d Jacob didn\u2019t look away from the gray waves. \u201cI didn\u2019t choose this.\u201d I laughed once in disbelief. \u201cDo you think Edward did? He didn\u2019t know what was happening to him any more than you did. He didn\u2019t exactly sign up for this.\u201d Jacob was shaking his head back and forth with a small, quick movement. \u201cYou know, Jacob, you\u2019re awfully self-righteous \u2014 considering that you\u2019re a werewolf and all.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not the same,\u201d Jacob repeated, glowering at me. \u201cI don\u2019t see why not. You could be a bit more understanding about the Cullens. You have no idea how truly good they are \u2014 to the core, Jacob.\u201d He frowned more deeply. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t exist. Their existence goes against nature.\u201d I stared at him for a long moment with one eyebrow raised incredulously. It was a while before he noticed. \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cSpeaking of unnatural . . . ,\u201d I hinted. \u201cBella,\u201d he said, his voice slow and different. Aged. I realized that he sounded suddenly older than me \u2014 like a parent or a teacher. \u201cWhat I am was born in me. It\u2019s a part of who I am, who my family is, who we all are as a tribe \u2014 it\u2019s the reason why we\u2019re still here. \u201cBesides that\u201d \u2014 he looked down at me, his black eyes unreadable \u2014 \u201cI am still human.\u201d He picked up my hand and pressed it to his fever-warm chest. Through his t-shirt, I could feel the steady beating of his heart under my palm. \u201cNormal humans can\u2019t throw motorcycles around the way you can.\u201d He smiled a faint, half-smile. \u201cNormal humans run away from monsters, Bella. And I never claimed to be normal. Just human.\u201d Staying angry with Jacob was too much work. I started to smile as I pulled my hand away from his chest. \u201cYou look plenty human to me,\u201d I allowed. \u201cAt the moment.\u201d \u201cI feel human.\u201d He stared past me, his face far away. His lower lip trembled, and he bit down on it hard. \u201cOh, Jake,\u201d I whispered, reaching for his hand. This was why I was here. This was why I would take whatever reception waited for me when I got back. Because, underneath all the anger and the sarcasm, Jacob was in pain. Right now, it was very clear in his eyes. I didn\u2019t know how to help him, but I knew I had to try. It was more than that I owed him. It was because his pain hurt me, too. Jacob had become a part of me, and there was no changing that now.",

            "en": "10        10. INTERROGATIONS It was very hard, in the morning, to argue with the part of me that was sure last night was a dream. Logic wasn't on my side, or common sense. I clung to the parts I couldn't have imagined \u2014 like his smell. I was sure I could never have dreamed that up on my own. It was foggy and dark outside my window, absolutely perfect. He had no reason not to be in school today. I dressed in my heavy clothes, remembering I didn't have a jacket. Further proof that my memory was real. When I got downstairs, Charlie was gone again \u2014 I was running later than I'd realized. I swallowed a granola bar in three bites, chased it down with milk straight from the carton, and then hurried out the door. Hopefully the rain would hold off until I could find Jessica. It was unusually foggy; the air was almost smoky with it. The mist was ice cold where it clung to the exposed skin on my face and neck. I couldn't wait to get the heat going in my truck. It was such a thick fog that I was a few feet down the driveway before I realized there was a car in it: a silver car. My heart thudded, stuttered, and then picked up again in double time. I didn't see where he came from, but suddenly he was there, pulling the door open for me. \"Do you want to ride with me today?\" he asked, amused by my expression as he caught me by surprise yet again. There was uncertainty in his voice. He was really giving me a choice \u2014 I was free to refuse, and part of him hoped for that. It was a vain hope. \"Yes, thank you,\" I said, trying to keep my voice calm. As I stepped into the warm car, I noticed his tan jacket was slung over the headrest of the passenger seat. The door closed behind me, and, sooner than should be possible, he was sitting next to me, starting the car. \"I brought the jacket for you. I didn't want you to get sick or something.\" His voice was guarded. I noticed that he wore no jacket himself, just a light gray knit V-neck shirt with long sleeves. Again, the fabric clung to his perfectly muscled chest. It was a colossal tribute to his face that it kept my eyes away from his body. \"I'm not quite that delicate,\" I said, but I pulled the jacket onto my lap, pushing my arms through the too-long sleeves, curious to see if the scent could possibly be as good as I remembered. It was better. \"Aren't you?\" he contradicted in a voice so low I wasn't sure if he meant for me to hear. We drove through the fog-shrouded streets, always too fast, feeling awkward. I was, at least. Last night all the walls were down\u2026 almost all. I didn't know if we were still being as candid today. It left me tongue-tied. I waited for him to speak. He turned to smirk at me. \"What, no twenty questions today?\" \"Do my questions bother you?\" I asked, relieved. \"Not as much as your reactions do.\" He looked like he was joking, but I couldn't be sure. I frowned. \"Do I react badly?\" \"No, that's the problem. You take everything so coolly \u2014 it's unnatural.\u00a0 It makes me wonder what you're really thinking.\" \"I always tell you what I'm really thinking.\" \"You edit,\" he accused. \"Not very much.\" \"Enough to drive me insane.\" \"You don't want to hear it,\" I mumbled, almost whispered. As soon as the words were out, I regretted them. The pain in my voice was very faint; I could only hope he hadn't noticed it. He didn't respond, and I wondered if I had ruined the mood. His face was unreadable as we drove into the school parking lot. Something occurred to me belatedly. \"Where's the rest of your family?\" I asked \u2014 more than glad to be alone with him, but remembering that his car was usually full. \"They took Rosalie's car.\" He shrugged as he parked next to a glossy red convertible with the top up. \"Ostentatious, isn't it?\" \"Um, wow,\" I breathed. \"If she has that, why does she ride with you?\" \"Like I said, it's ostentatious. We try to blend in.\" \"You don't succeed.\" I laughed and shook my head as we got out of the car. I wasn't late anymore; his lunatic driving had gotten me to school in plenty of time. \"So why did Rosalie drive today if it's more conspicuous?\" \"Hadn't you noticed? I'm breaking all the rules now.\" He met me at the front of the car, staying very close to my side as we walked onto campus. I wanted to close that little distance, to reach out and touch him, but I was afraid he wouldn't like me to. \"Why do you have cars like that at all?\" I wondered aloud. \"If you're looking for privacy?\" \"An indulgence,\" he admitted with an impish smile. \"We all like to drive fast.\" \"Figures,\" I muttered under my breath. Under the shelter of the cafeteria roof's overhang, Jessica was waiting, her eyes about to bug out of their sockets. Over her arm, bless her, was my jacket. \"Hey, Jessica,\" I said when we were a few feet away. \"Thanks for remembering.\" She handed me my jacket without speaking. \"Good morning, Jessica,\" Edward said politely. It wasn't really his fault that his voice was so irresistible. Or what his eyes were capable of.  \"Er\u2026 hi.\" She shifted her wide eyes to me, trying to gather her jumbled thoughts. \"I guess I'll see you in Trig.\" She gave me a meaningful look, and I suppressed a sigh. What on earth was I going to tell her? \"Yeah, I'll see you then.\" She walked away, pausing twice to peek back over her shoulder at us. \"What are you going to tell her?\" Edward murmured. \"Hey, I thought you couldn't read my mind!\" I hissed. \"I can't,\" he said, startled. Then understanding brightened his eyes. \"However, I can read hers \u2014 she'll be waiting to ambush you in class.\" I groaned as I pulled off his jacket and handed it to him, replacing it with my own. He folded it over his arm. \"So what are you going to tell her?\" \"A little help?\" I pleaded. \"What does she want to know?\" He shook his head, grinning wickedly. \"That's not fair.\" \"No, you not sharing what you know \u2014 now that's not fair.\" He deliberated for a moment as we walked. We stopped outside the door to my first class. \"She wants to know if we're secretly dating. And she wants to know how you feel about me,\" he finally said. \"Yikes. What should I say?\" I tried to keep my expression very innocent. People were passing us on their way to class, probably staring, but I was barely aware of them. \"Hmmm.\" He paused to catch a stray lock of hair that was escaping the twist on my neck and wound it back into place. My heart spluttered hyperactively. \"I suppose you could say yes to the first\u2026 if you don't mind \u2014 it's easier than any other explanation.\" \"I don't mind,\" I said in a faint voice. \"And as for her other question\u2026 well, I'll be listening to hear the answer to that one myself.\" One side of his mouth pulled up into my favorite uneven smile. I couldn't catch my breath soon enough to respond to that remark. He turned and walked away. \"I'll see you at lunch,\" he called over his shoulder. Three people walking in the door stopped to stare at me. I hurried into class, flushed and irritated. He was such a cheater. Now I was even more worried about what I was going to say to Jessica. I sat in my usual seat, slamming my bag down in aggravation. \"Morning, Bella,\" Mike said from the seat next to me. I looked up to see an odd, almost resigned look on his face. \"How was Port Angeles?\" \"It was\u2026\" There was no honest way to sum it up. \"Great,\" I finished lamely. \"Jessica got a really cute dress.\" \"Did she say anything about Monday night?\" he asked, his eyes <em>brightening</em>. I smiled at the turn the conversation had taken. \"She said she had a really good time,\" I assured him. \"She did?\" he said eagerly. \"Most definitely.\" Mr. Mason called the class to order then, asking us to turn in our papers. English and then Government passed in a blur, while I worried about how to explain things to Jessica and agonized over whether Edward would really be listening to what I said through the medium of Jess's thoughts. How very inconvenient his little talent could be \u2014 when it wasn't saving my life. The fog had almost dissolved by the end of the second hour, but the day was still dark with low, oppressing clouds. I smiled up at the sky. Edward was right, of course. When I walked into Trig Jessica was sitting in the back row, nearly bouncing off her seat in agitation. I reluctantly went to sit by her, trying to convince myself it would be better to get it over with as soon as possible. \"Tell me everything!\" she commanded before I was in the seat. \"What do you want to know?\" I hedged. \"What happened last night?\" \"He bought me dinner, and then he drove me home.\" She glared at me, her expression stiff with skepticism. \"How did you get home so fast?\" \"He drives like a maniac. It was terrifying.\" I hoped he heard that. \"Was it like a date \u2014 did you tell him to meet you there?\" I hadn't thought of that. \"No \u2014 I was very surprised to see him there.\" Her lips puckered in disappointment at the transparent honesty in my voice. \"But he picked you up for school today?\" she probed. \"Yes \u2014 that was a surprise, too. He noticed I didn't have a jacket last night,\" I explained. \"So are you going out again?\" \"He offered to drive me to Seattle Saturday because he thinks toy truck isn't up to it \u2014 does that count?\" \"Yes.\" She nodded. \"Well, then, yes.\" \"W-o-w.\" She exaggerated the word into three syllables. \"Edward Cullen.\" \"I know,\" I agreed. \"Wow\" didn't even cover it. \"Wait!\" Her hands flew up, palms toward me like she was stopping traffic. \"Has he kissed you?\" \"No,\" I mumbled. \"It's not like that.\" She looked disappointed. I'm sure I did, too. \"Do you think Saturday\u2026 ?\" She raised her eyebrows. \"I really doubt it.\" The discontent in my voice was poorly disguised. \"What did you talk about?\" She pushed for more information in a whisper. Class had started but Mr. Varner wasn't paying close attention and we weren't the only ones still talking. \"I don't know, Jess, lots of stuff,\" I whispered back. \"We talked about the English essay a little.\" A very, very little. I think \u00a0he mentioned it in passing. \"Please, Bella,\" she begged. \"Give me some details.\" \"Well\u2026 okay, I've got one. You should have seen the waitress flirting with him \u2014 it was over the top. But he didn't pay any attention to her at all.\" Let him make what he could of that. \"That's a good sign,\" she nodded. \"Was she pretty?\" \"Very \u2014 and probably nineteen or twenty.\" \"Even better. He must like you.\" \"I think so, but it's hard to tell. He's always so cryptic,\" I threw in for his benefit, sighing. \"I don't know how you're brave enough to be alone with him,\" she breathed. \"Why?\" I was shocked, but she didn't understand my reaction. \"He's so\u2026 intimidating. I wouldn't know what to say to him.\" She made a face, probably remembering this morning or last night, when he'd turned the overwhelming force of his eyes on her. \"I do have some trouble with incoherency when I'm around him,\" I admitted. \"Oh well. He is unbelievably gorgeous.\" Jessica shrugged as if this excused any flaws. Which, in her book, it probably did. \"There's a lot more to him than that.\" \"Really? Like what?\" I wished I had let it go. Almost as much as I was hoping he'd been kidding about listening in. \"I can't explain it right\u2026 but he's even more unbelievable behind the face.\" The vampire who wanted to be good \u2014 who ran around saving people's lives so he wouldn't be a monster\u2026 I stared toward the front of the room. \"Is that possible?\" She giggled. I ignored her, trying to look like I was paying attention to Mr. Varner. \"So you like him, then?\" She wasn't about to give up. \"Yes,\" I said curtly. \"I mean, do you really like him?\" she urged. \"Yes,\" I said again, blushing. I hoped that detail wouldn't register in her thoughts. She'd had enough with the single syllable answers. \"How much do you like him?\" \"Too much,\" I whispered back. \"More than he likes me. But I don't see how I can help that.\" I sighed, one blush blending into the next. Then, thankfully, Mr. Varner called on Jessica for an answer. She didn't get a chance to start on the subject again during class, and as soon as the bell rang, I took evasive action. \"In English, Mike asked me if you said anything about Monday night,\" I told her. \"You're kidding! What did you say?!\" she gasped, completely sidetracked. \"I told him you said you had a lot of fun \u2014 he looked pleased.\" \"Tell me exactly what he said, and your exact answer!\" We spent the rest of the walk dissecting sentence structures and most of Spanish on a minute description of Mike's facial expressions. I wouldn't have helped draw it out for as long as I did if I wasn't worried about the subject returning to me. And then the bell rang for lunch. As I jumped up out of my seat, shoving my books roughly in my bag, my uplifted expression must have tipped Jessica off. \"You're not sitting with us today, are you?\" she guessed. \"I don't think so.\" I couldn't be sure that he wouldn't disappear inconveniently again. But outside the door to our Spanish class, leaning against the wall \u2014 looking more like a Greek god than anyone had a right to \u2014 Edward was waiting for me. Jessica took one look, rolled her eyes, and departed. \"See you later, Bella.\" Her voice was thick with implications. I might have to turn off the ringer on the phone. \"Hello.\" His voice was amused and irritated at the same time. He had been listening, it was obvious. \"Hi.\" I couldn't think of anything else to say, and he didn't speak \u2014 biding his time, I presumed \u2014 so it was a quiet walk to the cafeteria. Walking with Edward through the crowded lunchtime rush was a lot like my first day here; everyone stared. He led the way into the line, still not speaking, though his eyes returned to my face every few seconds, their expression speculative. It seemed to me that irritation was winning out over amusement as the dominant emotion in his face. I fidgeted nervously with the zipper on my jacket. He stepped up to the counter and filled a tray with food. \"What are you doing?\" I objected. \"You're not getting all that for me?\" He shook his head, stepping forward to buy the food. \"Half is for me, of course.\" I raised one eyebrow. He led the way to the same place we'd sat that one time before. From the other end of the long table, a group of seniors gazed at us in amazement as we sat across from each other. Edward seemed oblivious. \"Take whatever you want,\" he said, pushing the tray toward me. \"I'm curious,\" I said as I picked up an apple, turning it around in my hands, \"what would you do if someone dared you to eat food?\" \"You're always curious.\" He grimaced, shaking his head. He glared at me, holding my eyes as he lifted the slice of pizza off the tray, and deliberately bit off a mouthful, chewed quickly, and then swallowed. I watched, eyes wide. \"If someone dared you to eat dirt, you could, couldn't you?\" he asked condescendingly. I wrinkled my nose. \"I did once\u2026 on a dare,\" I admitted. \"It wasn't so bad.\" He laughed. \"I suppose I'm not surprised.\" Something over my shoulder seemed to catch his attention. \"Jessica's analyzing everything I do \u2014 she'll break it down for you later.\" He pushed the rest of the pizza toward me. The mention of Jessica brought a hint of his former irritation back to his features. I put down the apple and took a bite of the pizza, looking away, knowing he was about to start. \"So the waitress was pretty, was she?\" he asked casually. \"You really didn't notice?\" \"No. I wasn't paying attention. I had a lot on my mind.\" \"Poor girl.\" I could afford to be generous now. \"Something you said to Jessica\u2026 well, it bothers me.\" He refused to be distracted. His voice was husky, and he glanced up from under his lashes with troubled eyes. \"I'm not surprised you heard something you didn't like. You know what they say about eavesdropners,\" I reminded him. \"I warned you I would be listening.\" \"And I warned you that you didn't want to know everything I was thinking.\" \"You did,\" he agreed, but his voice was still rough. \"You aren't precisely right, though. I do want to know what you're thinking \u2014 everything. I just wish\u2026 that you wouldn't be thinking some things.\" I scowled. \"That's quite a distinction.\" \"But that's not really the point at the moment.\" \"Then what is?\" We were inclined toward each other across the table now. He had his large white hands folded under his chin; I leaned forward, my right hand cupped around my neck. I had to remind myself that we were in a crowded lunchroom, with probably many curious eyes on us. It was too easy to get wrapped up in our own private, tense little bubble. \"Do you truly believe that you care more for me than I do for you?\" he murmured, leaning closer to me as he spoke, his dark golden eyes piercing. I tried to remember how to exhale. I had to look away before it came back to me. \"You're doing it again,\" I muttered. His eyes opened wide with surprise. \"What?\" \"Dazzling me,\" I admitted, trying to concentrate as I looked back at him. \"Oh.\" He frowned. \"It's not your fault,\" I sighed. \"You can't help it.\" \"Are you going to answer the question?\" I looked down. \"Yes.\" \"Yes, you are going to answer, or yes, you really think that?\" He was irritated again. \"Yes, I really think that.\" I kept my eyes down on the table, my eyes tracing the pattern of the faux wood grains printed on the laminate. The silence dragged on. I stubbornly refused to be the first to break it this time, fighting hard against the temptation to peek at his expression. Finally he spoke, voice velvet soft. \"You're wrong.\" I glanced up to see that his eyes were gentle. \"You can't know that,\" I disagreed in a whisper. I shook my head in doubt, though my heart throbbed at his words and I wanted so badly to believe them. \"What makes you think so?\" His liquid topaz eyes were penetrating \u2014 trying futilely, I assumed, to lift the truth straight from my mind. I stared back, struggling to think clearly in spite of his face, to find some way to explain. As I searched for the words, I could see him getting impatient; frustrated by my silence, he started to scowl. I lifted my hand from my neck, and held up one finger. \"Let me think,\" I insisted. His expression cleared, now that he was satisfied that I was planning to answer. I dropped my hand to the table, moving my left hand so that my palms were pressed together. I stared at my hands, twisting and untwisting my fingers, as I finally spoke. \"Well, aside from the obvious, sometimes\u2026\" I hesitated. \"I can't be sure \u2014 I don't know how to read minds \u2014 but sometimes it seems like you're trying to say goodbye when you're saying something else.\" That was the best I could sum up the sensation of anguish that his words triggered in me at times. \"Perceptive,\" he whispered. And there was the anguish again, surfacing as he confirmed my fear. \"That's exactly why you're wrong, though,\" he began to explain, but then his eyes narrowed. \"What do you mean, 'the obvious'?\" \"Well, look at me,\" I said, unnecessarily as he was already staring. \"I'm absolutely ordinary \u2014 well, except for bad things like all the near-death experiences and being so clumsy that I'm almost disabled. And look at you.\" I waved my hand toward him and all his bewildering perfection. His brow creased angrily for a moment, then smoothed as his eyes took on a knowing look. \"You don't see yourself very clearly, you know. I'll admit you're dead-on about the bad things,\" he chuckled blackly, \"but you didn't hear what every human male in this school was thinking on your first day.\" I blinked, astonished. \"I don't believe it\u2026\" I mumbled to myself. \"Trust me just this once \u2014 you are the opposite of ordinary.\" My embarrassment was much stronger than my pleasure at the look that came into his eyes when he said this. I quickly reminded him of my original argument. \"But I'm not saying goodbye,\" I pointed out. \"Don't you see? That's what proves me right. I care the most, because if I can do it\" \u2014 he shook his head, seeming to struggle with the thought \u2014 \"if leaving is the right thing to do, then I'll hurt myself to keep from hurting you, to keep you safe.\" I glared. \"And you don't think I would do the same?\" \"You'd never have to make the choice.\" Abruptly, his unpredictable mood shifted again; a mischievous, devastating smile rearranged his features. \"Of course, keeping you safe is beginning to feel like a full-time occupation that requires my constant presence.\" \"No one has tried to do away with me today,\" I reminded him, grateful for the lighter subject. I didn't want him to talk about goodbyes anymore. If I had to, I supposed I could purposefully put myself in danger to keep him close\u2026 I banished that thought before his quick eyes read it on my face. That idea would definitely get me in trouble. \"Yet,\" he added. \"Yet,\" I agreed; I would have argued, but now I wanted him to be expecting disasters. \"I have another question for you.\" His face was still casual. \"Shoot.\" \"Do you really need to go to Seattle this Saturday, or was that just an excuse to get out of saying no to all your admirers?\" I made a face at the memory. \"You know, I haven't forgiven you for the Tyler thing yet,\" I warned him. \"It's your fault that he's deluded himself into thinking I'm going to prom with him.\" \"Oh, he would have found a chance to ask you without me \u2014 I just really wanted to watch your face,\" he chuckled, I would have been angrier if his laughter wasn't so fascinating. \"If I'd asked you, would you have turned me down?\" he asked, still laughing to himself. \"Probably not,\" I admitted. \"But I would have canceled later \u2014 faked an illness or a sprained ankle.\" He was puzzled. \"Why would you do that?\" I shook my head sadly. \"You've never seen me in Gym, I guess, but I would have thought you would understand.\" \"Are you referring to the fact that you can't walk across a flat, stable surface without finding something to trip over?\" \"Obviously.\" \"That wouldn't be a problem.\" He was very confident. \"It's all in the leading.\" He could see that I was about to protest, and he cut me off. \"But you never told me \u2014 are you resolved on going to Seattle, or do you mind if we do something different?\" As long as the \"we\" part was in, I didn't care about anything else. \"I'm open to alternatives,\" I allowed. \"But I do have a favor to ask.\" He looked wary, as he always did when I asked an open-ended question. \"What?\" \"Can I drive?\" He frowned. \"Why?\" \"Well, mostly because when I told Charlie I was going to Seattle, he specifically asked if I was going alone and, at the time, I was. If he asked again, I probably wouldn't lie, but I don't think he will ask again, and leaving my truck at home would just bring up the subject unnecessarily. And also, because your driving frightens me.\" He rolled his eyes. \"Of all the things about me that could frighten you, you worry about my driving.\" He shook his head in disgust, but then his eyes were serious again. \"Won't you want to tell your father that you're spending the day with me?\" There was an undercurrent to his question that I didn't understand. \"With Charlie, less is always more.\" I was definite about that. \"Where are we going, anyway?\" \"The weather will be nice, so I'll be staying out of the public eye\u2026 and you can stay with me, if you'd like to.\" Again, he was leaving the choice up to me. \"And you'll show me what you meant, about the sun?\" I asked, excited by the idea of unraveling another of the unknowns. \"Yes.\" He smiled, and then paused. \"But if you don't want to be\u2026 alone with me, I'd still rather you didn't go to Seattle by yourself. I shudder to think of the trouble you could find in a city that size.\" I was miffed. \"Phoenix is three times bigger than Seattle \u2014 just in population. In physical size \u2014\" \"But apparently,\" he interrupted me, \"your number wasn't up in Phoenix. So I'd rather you stayed near me.\" His eyes did that unfair smoldering thing again. I couldn't argue, with the eyes or the motivation, and it was a moot point anyway. \"As it happens, I don't mind being alone with you.\" \"I know,\" he sighed, brooding. \"You should tell Charlie, though.\" \"Why in the world would I do that?\" His eyes were suddenly fierce. \"To give me some small incentive to bring you back.\" I gulped. But, after a moment of thought, I was sure. \"I think I'll take my chances.\" He exhaled angrily, and looked away. \"Let's talk about something else,\" I suggested. \"What do you want to talk about?\" he asked. He was still annoyed. I glanced around us, making sure we were well out of anyone's hearing. As I cast my eyes around the room, I caught the eyes of his sister, Alice, staring at me. The others were looking at Edward. I looked away swiftly, back to him, and I asked the first thing that came to mind. \"Why did you go to that Goat Rocks place last weekend\u2026 to hunt? Charlie said it wasn't a good place to hike, because of bears.\" He stared at me as if I was missing something very obvious. \"Bears?\" I gasped, and he smirked. \"You know, bears are not in season,\" I added sternly, to hide my shock. \"If you read carefully, the laws only cover hunting with weapons,\" he informed me. He watched my face with enjoyment as that slowly sank in. \"Bears?\" I repeated with difficulty. \"Grizzly is Emmett's favorite.\" His voice was still offhand, but his eyes were scrutinizing my reaction. I tried to pull myself together. \"Hmmm,\" I said, taking another bite of pizza as an excuse to look down. I chewed slowly, and then took a long drink of Coke without looking up. \"So,\" I said after a moment, finally meeting his now-anxious gaze. \"What's your favorite?\" He raised an eyebrow and the corners of his mouth turned down in disapproval. \"Mountain lion.\" \"Ah,\" I said in a politely disinterested tone, looking for my soda again. \"Of course,\" he said, and his tone mirrored mine, \"we have to be careful not to impact the environment with injudicious hunting. We try to focus on areas with an overpopulation of predators \u2014 ranging as far away as we need. There's always plenty of deer and elk here, and they'll do, but where's the fun in that?\" He smiled teasingly. \"Where indeed,\" I murmured around another bite of pizza. \"Early spring is Emmett's favorite bear season \u2014 they're just coming out of hibernation, so they're more irritable.\" He smiled at some remembered joke. \"Nothing more fun than an irritated grizzly bear,\" I agreed, nodding. He snickered, shaking his head. \"Tell me what you're really thinking, please.\" \"I'm trying to picture it \u2014 but I can't,\" I admitted. \"How do you hunt a bear without weapons?\" \"Oh, we have weapons.\" He flashed his bright teeth in a brief, threatening smile. I fought back a shiver before it could expose me. \"Just not the kind they consider when writing hunting laws. If you've ever seen a bear attack on television, you should be able to visualize Emmett hunting.\" I couldn't stop the next shiver that flashed down my spine. I peeked across the cafeteria toward Emmett, grateful that he wasn't looking my way. The thick bands of muscle that wrapped his arms and torso were somehow even more menacing now. Edward followed my gaze and chuckled. I stared at him, unnerved. \"Are you like a bear, too?\" I asked in a low voice. \"More like the lion, or so they tell me,\" he said lightly. \"Perhaps our preferences are indicative.\" I tried to smile. \"Perhaps,\" I repeated. But my mind was filled with opposing images that I couldn't merge together. \"Is that something I might get to see?\" \"Absolutely not!\" His face turned even whiter than usual, and his eyes were suddenly furious. I leaned back, stunned and \u2014 though I'd never admit it to him \u2014 frightened by his reaction. He leaned back as well, folding his arms across his chest. \"Too scary for me?\" I asked when I could control my voice again. \"If that were it, I would take you out tonight,\" he said, his voice cutting. \"You need a healthy dose of fear. Nothing could be more beneficial for you.\" \"Then why?\" I pressed, trying to ignore his angry expression. He glared at me for a long minute. \"Later,\" he finally said. He was on his feet in one lithe movement. \"We're going to be late.\" I glanced around, startled to see that he was right and the cafeteria was nearly vacant. When I was with him, the time and the place were such a muddled blur that I completely lost track of both. I jumped up, grabbing my bag from the back of my chair. \"Later, then,\" I agreed. I wouldn't forget.",
