But then - in a dawn raid on a nondescript house in northern Serbia - one of the world's most wanted men was finally captured.  Ratko Mladic, the former Bosnian Serb commander indicted in 1995 by the UN War Crimes Tribunal, was seized by the Serbian security services in the town of Lazarevo. Rumours had begun to circulate late on Thursday morning among journalists. And then news that the Serbian President, Boris Tadic, had called an emergency lunchtime press conference.  The signs were all there that Gen Mladic had indeed been caught. 'Too frail'  President Tadic entered a packed hall and strode confidently to a central lectern.  \"On behalf of the Republic of Serbia, I can announce that Ratko Mladic has been arrested,\" he told assembled journalists. It was a statement that some thought might never come. The president added that he believed this would now close a chapter in Serbia's history and move towards reconciliation for the whole region. He remained tightlipped about the particulars of the arrest, saying that the security services would in the coming days release more information.  As the day wore on, Gen Mladic appeared before a court in Belgrade to begin extradition proceedings. But he was deemed too physically and psychologically frail for the hearing to continue and so it was adjourned until Friday.  His lawyer has already indicated that Gen Mladic will not recognise the legitimacy of the UN court once he's transferred there to stand trial. Protesters in Belgrade This is a hugely important moment for Serbia and for the Western <em>Balkans</em> as a whole, as it tries to lay the legacy of the 1990s Balkan wars to rest.  The capture of Ratko Mladic was a precondition for Serbia to reach its goal of European Union membership.  But it has also come at an important time: Brussels is currently deciding whether to bring Serbia one step further towards accession talks by granting it \"candidate status\" later this year; the EU's foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, spent Thursday in Belgrade discussing this.  And so, I asked President Tadic, was it merely a coincidence that Gen Mladic was arrested now?  \"Serbia has never calculated when it would capture Ratko Mladic,\" Mr Tadic replied. \"This is the result of a concerted effort by the national security council over the last three years - we were determined to arrest him at all times.\" But attention will surely now shift to how Gen Mladic managed to evade the authorities for so long and who protected him. Those involved in the support network will also face justice, the president warned. As evening fell in Belgrade, some protesters gathered in the central square - and in other parts of Serbia too.  Nationalists still see Ratko Mladic as a Serb hero and believe the UN Tribunal in the Hague has an anti-Serb bias.  But there is another large part of the Serbian population who will breathe a great sigh of relief at this extraordinary day.  They are tired of Serbia's turbulent past and say that the country has for too long been held hostage by one man.  The new generation here is keen to leave the 1990s behind to show that Serbia is a changed place and one now ready to progress towards EU membership.  For them, their only disappointment will be that the arrest of Ratko Mladic has been so long coming.",

            "en": "Special: World Cup & Politics \u2013 When Sport And Society Mix     Goal.com's Ewan Macdonald looks at how the world's biggest football tournament and politics collide. For many, perhaps most, football is an escape.  It's a chance to lose oneself in entertainment and passion for ninety minutes on a weekend; to fraternise with like-minded fans; to celebrate your local pride in style.  Yet it's undeniable that for millions worldwide, football is simply more than that.  What happens on the pitch can collide quite dramatically with other aspects of life, not least politics.  This is true of the club game, where teams founded by workers quickly found themselves exceeding the capabilities of more genteel organisations early in football's history, and where divisions ranging from the ethnic to the religious to the cultural persist to this day.  But it's in the realm of international competition that such matters really come to a fore, and nowhere is that more true than in the World Cup.  Indeed, the World Cup itself is built on a political divide of a sort.  The first edition of the competition in 1930 was hosted by Uruguay, on the quite reasonable grounds that they had won the last two world amateur titles at the Olympics.  But, feeling snubbed, European countries declined to enter.  Particularly sniffy were the constituent countries of the United Kingdom, not FIFA members, who refused to consider membership in the organization, much less the long journey abroad.  In the event four European teams were coaxed across the ocean.  France made history by scoring the first ever World Cup goal through Lucien Laurent, an amateur forward and factory worker. (That French side was intriguing for all manner of reasons: captain Alex Villaplane, for example, returned home to become an enthusiastic Nazi collaborator before being executed in 1944.)  In any case, Uruguay (who inevitably won the tournament) declined to return the favor four years later, boycotting the World Cup's arrival in Italy due to the ill-feeling from the poor European showing in their own back yard.  Three teams crossed the Atlantic; Brazil, Argentina and the United States all lost their only matches. The narrative of the colonized versus the colonizer made little sense in light of the fact that football was not yet the sport of the people - Brazil's representatives came in large part from the well-to-do and overwhelmingly white Botafogo club - but still the rivalry of Europe against the Americas came to define much of international football in its early days.  It still does so now, particularly from a South American perspective.   War And Peace   As with so much else of civil society, the World Cup stopped for World War II.  Italy's win in 1938 \u2013 in what was, incidentally, the first tournament to welcome an Asian side in the form of the Dutch East Indies - was the final kick of a FIFA ball until 1950, when tournament play resumed in Brazil.  Yet despite the fact the war had been over for five years, its repercussions were still felt.  Germany, newly partitioned, had two football associations, but neither represented the East.  One, instead, was in tiny Saarland, whose brief but exciting tenure as an international force did not culminate in qualification.  However, their last-minute acceptance showed that, for perhaps the first time, Europe was serious about competing in South America, and vice versa.  Even the Brits were tempted to come along, England winning the Home Nations Championship to take their place.  Scotland, at the time a formidable team, declined to attend despite being invited, reasoning that second place did not merit such a reward. (Fast-forward 60 years and one imagines that the Scots would feel slightly differently.) Only the withdrawal of India prevented the 1950 World Cup from being the truly global event that it promised to be.  That came later as the lucre and prestige of the Cup continued to grow.  For those hoping that greater global acceptance would bring an end to politicking, though, there was to be disappointment.  In fact as the tournament grew in stature in footballing terms, so too it became a global and social commodity.  In other words, the World Cup was a big deal, and was thus far more likely to attract off-pitch attention.  The Soviet Union, for example, qualified at the first time of asking in 1958 in a bid to flaunt more sporting muscle to the world. (This they did, brilliantly so, drawing with the much-fancied England and beating Austria.).  Meanwhile Turkey withdrew yet again after being placed, inexplicably, in the Asian qualifiers.  This gave their opponents, Israel, a bye to the next stage.  In that round neither Indonesia nor Egypt were able to take part, so Israel and Sudan - who had beaten Syria - moved on to the next and final match.  Sudan refused to play against Israel for political reasons and thus withdrew from competition altogether.  Thus there was Israel, the conqueror of Asia and Africa, alone as a World Cup entrant without playing a single game.  FIFA decided this was unacceptable, so arranged an impromptu play-off with a random European runner-up, Wales.  Wales beat the Israelis and thus qualified for their one and only World Cup. And all because Sudan wouldn't travel to Israel!  Such matters only grew in importance as the decades progressed.  In 1966 the World Cup came to England for the first time for their only victory (thus far), but did so without facing an African team, all of whom withdrew over FIFA's refusal to grant the continent an automatic place in the tournament; in 1970 Morocco became the first African team in over 30 years to play in a World Cup in a bizarre but brilliant tournament that summed up all of football's foibles \u2013 playing in the noonday sun to accommodate European television schedules, for example. As for 1982, European alliances came to the fore as West Germany and Austria contrived to play out a 1-0 win for the former in what will forever be known as the 'Shame of Gijon'.  This non-event was a fixed group match that allowed both the German language-speaking countries to progress to the next stage at the expense of Algeria thanks to a complex fixture arrangement \u2013 one again created at the behest of television \u2013 long since abandoned.  The end result was 1-0 to West Germany, as if it matters. Towards The Present Most of the political aspects we've seen so far have been negative, and mainly to do with power or victory.  For a change of pace, consider West Germany's World Cup win in 1990.  The Berlin Wall had been down for scarcely six months and as the 'Nationalelf' roared to victory in Italy, East and West were busy sealing the formal road to reunification.  In stark contrast to when the sides met in the 1978 World Cup \u2013 a tense, fraught event \u2013 in this instance the two Germanies celebrated the West's victory together.  That it helped settle some of the reunification nerves and bring a divided people together is undeniable.  It would be an exaggeration to say that reunification could not have happened without football, but it is not a stretch to say that it would not have been so quick.  A cynic might argue, west German elites may have been pleased for the win as it distracted observers from the harsh economic realities of fusion; even if this is true, it was abundantly plain that football was serving as the force for unity and good that it had all too often forgotten in the past.  The Yugoslavia team of such an era, too, had its own role to play.  Before the <em>Balkans</em> shattered in tragic fashion, the Yugoslavs were the pride of eastern Europe.  Serbs like Dragan Stojkovic lined up next to Croats such as Davor Suker and Bosnian legends including Safet Susic and Zlatko Vujovic.  Such a team, bringing the best of all cultures together, could well have gone on to be one of the best of all time - young stars such as Alen Boksic were still in their footballing infancy - but then the war came, and Yugoslavia would never again compete as a single entity in world play.  Now the Balkan states each have their own teams - still, thankfully, punching above their weight, but not as they might have done.  Indeed, football itself had its role to play in the dissolution: rivalry between future European champions Red Star Belgrade and Dinamo Zagreb months before the tournament brought ethnic strife to the forefront of peoples' minds. Four years later Andres Escobar, a Colombian defender, scored an own goal at the 1994 World Cup.  This would have been an unfortunate historical footnote for the stat buff if not for the fact that he was then shot to death upon his return home.  Why? Nobody knows for sure, but in a country such as Colombia, in which drug lords hold sway, it has been rumored that massive gambling losses in the underworld was the trigger.  The money and the power, then, that football has provided could have been a major contributing factor. (As far as the courts determined, however, Escobar was simply shot for protesting when a man in a bar ridiculed him for his own goal.)  The World Cup went truly global in 2002 with its arrival in east Asia, with Japan and South Korea becoming the first ever co-hosts.  Yet four years later an even greater moment of off-pitch drama was to follow.  In 2006 the Ivory Coast, long since wracked by civil war, saw battling factions put down arms and pick up remote controls for a ceasefire in order to support the Ivorians in their first ever crack at World Cup play.  It's easy to romanticize this incident - human rights observers noted that, while conventional war ceased, citizens were still under attack - but at the same time the role of both the sport itself and the personalities involved helped, however slightly the road to peace.   The Path Ahead Could the same be about to happen now?  For the first time ever, North and South Korea will compete at the same tournament.  The importance of what may occur in South Africa cannot be understated.  So much is at stake: the North has in recent months reacted with fury to allegations of its sinking a Southern vessel, and diplomatic relations between the two states \u2013 hardly ideal at the best of times \u2013 have reached a recent nadir.  Yet on the sporting arena the countries have a much more love-hate relationship.  True enough, the official news organ of the North essentially accused the South of poisoning their players in the lead-up to a vital qualifier last year, but in 2008 athletes from the two sides marched together at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games.  Might we see scenes of similar fraternity this year?  Meanwhile there are other countries without troubles to seek.  Chile, riven recently by a disastrous earthquake, has taken the World Cup team to their hearts in a way that even this football-crazy nation might not have done in years past.  Events as innocuous as launching the new national shirt have been greeted with intense fervour; should Chilean hero Humberto 'Chupete' Suazo fail to recover from injury in time for the opening game, the mood of the nation will take a significant downturn.  As for Greece, a country cowed and humiliated by its financial disasters and civic unrest, the World Cup is a superb chance to prove that this small population can still hold its own, much as they did in the 2004 European Championships by pulling off a massively unlikely underdog win. And that brings us to South Africa itself.  The host country has so much riding on this tournament.  FIFA do, too.  Their mission to bring the tournament to Africa is long-standing, and now it's been achieved: any organizational failing, any security breach, and problem of any kind will have detractors mobilizing in numbers (and perhaps justifiably so.)  But aside from such concerns, which amount to nickels and dimes, is the future of South Africa itself. (and Africa) Under the dreadful apartheid regime the country lived a strange, alone existence; now, the Rainbow Nation has a chance to truly prove to the world that it can fulfill its promise.  It's no exaggeration to say that the opening match of the World Cup will be, for all South Africans, the most important game of their lives.
