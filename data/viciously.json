            "en": "ECLIPSE            ECLIPSE    Fire and Ice  Some say the world will end in fire,  Some say in ice.  From what I\u2019ve tasted of desire  I hold with those who favor fire.  But if it had to perish twice,  I think I know enough of hate  To say that for destruction ice  Is also great  And would suffice.  Robert Frost    PREFACE  All our attempts at subterfuge had been in vain.  With ice in my heart, I watched him prepare to defend me. His intense concentration betrayed no hint of doubt, though he was outnumbered. I knew that we could expect no help \u2014 at this moment, his family was fighting for their lives just as surely as he was for ours.    Would I ever learn the outcome of that other fight? Find out who the winners and the losers were?  Would I live long enough for that?  The odds of that didn\u2019t look so great.  Black eyes, wild with their fierce craving for my death, watched for the moment when my protector\u2019s attention would be diverted. The moment when I would surely die.  Somewhere, far, far away in the cold forest, a wolf howled.    1. ULTIMATUM  Bella,  I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re making Charlie carry notes to Billy like we\u2019re in second grade \u2014 if I wanted to talk to you I would answer them  You made the choice here, okay? You can\u2019t have it both ways when  What part of \u201cmortal enemies\u201d is too complicated for you to  Look, I know I\u2019m being a jerk, but there\u2019s just no way around  We can\u2019t be friends when you\u2019re spending all your time with a bunch of  It just makes it worse when I think about you too much, so don\u2019t write anymore  Yeah, I miss you, too. A lot. Doesn\u2019t change anything. Sorry.  Jacob     I ran my fingers across the page, feeling the dents where he had pressed the pen to the paper so hard that it had nearly broken through. I could picture him writing this \u2014 scrawling the angry letters in his rough handwriting, slashing through line after line when the words came out wrong, maybe even snapping the pen in his too-big hand; that would explain the ink splatters. I could imagine the frustration pulling his black eyebrows together and crumpling his forehead. If I\u2019d been there, I might have laughed. Don\u2019t give yourself a brain hemorrhage, Jacob, I would have told him. Just spit it out.     Laughing was the last thing I felt like doing now as I reread the words I\u2019d already memorized. His answer to my pleading note \u2014 passed from Charlie to Billy to him, just like second grade, as he\u2019d pointed out \u2014 was no surprise. I\u2019d known the essence of what it would say before I\u2019d opened it. What was surprising was how much each crossed-out line wounded me \u2014 as if the points of the letters had cutting edges. More than that, behind each angry beginning lurked a vast pool of hurt; Jacob\u2019s pain cut me deeper than my own.     While I was pondering this, I caught the unmistakable scent of a smoking burner rising from the kitchen. In another house, the fact that someone besides myself was cooking might not be a cause for panicking. I shoved the wrinkled paper into my back pocket and ran, making it downstairs in the nick of time. The jar of spaghetti sauce Charlie\u2019d stuck in the microwave was only on its first revolution when I yanked the door open and pulled it out.     \u201cWhat did I do wrong?\u201d Charlie demanded.  \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to take the lid off first, Dad. Metal\u2019s bad for microwaves.\u201d I swiftly removed the lid as I spoke, poured half the sauce into a bowl, and then put the bowl inside the microwave and the jar back in the fridge; I fixed the time and pressed start.  Charlie watched my adjustments with pursed lips. \u201cDid I get the noodles right?\u201d  I looked in the pan on the stove \u2014 the source of the smell that had alerted me. \u201cStirring helps,\u201d I said mildly. I found a spoon and tried to de-clump the mushy hunk that was scalded to the bottom.  Charlie sighed.     \u201cSo what\u2019s all this about?\u201d I asked him.  He folded his arms across his chest and glared out the back windows into the sheeting rain. \u201cDon\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d he grumbled.  I was mystified. Charlie cooking? And what was with the surly attitude? Edward wasn\u2019t here yet; usually my dad reserved this kind of behavior for my boyfriend\u2019s benefit, doing his best to illustrate the theme of \u201cunwelcome\u201d with every word and posture. Charlie\u2019s efforts were unnecessary \u2014 Edward knew exactly what my dad was thinking without the show.      The word boyfriend had me chewing on the inside of my cheek with a familiar tension while I stirred. It wasn\u2019t the right word, not at all. I needed something more expressive of eternal commitment. . . . But words like destiny and fate sounded hokey when you used them in casual conversation.     Edward had another word in mind, and that word was the source of the tension I felt. It put my teeth on edge just to think it to myself. Fianc\u00e9e. Ugh. I shuddered away from the thought.  \u201cDid I miss something? Since when do you make dinner?\u201d I asked Charlie. The pasta lump bobbed in the boiling water as I poked it. \u201cOr try to make dinner, I should say.\u201d  Charlie shrugged. \u201cThere\u2019s no law that says I can\u2019t cook in my own house.\u201d     \u201cYou would know,\u201d I replied, grinning as I eyed the badge pinned to his leather jacket.  \u201cHa. Good one.\u201d He shrugged out of the jacket as if my glance had reminded him he still had it on, and hung it on the peg reserved for his gear. His gun belt was already slung in place \u2014 he hadn\u2019t felt the need to wear that to the station for a few weeks. There had been no more disturbing disappearances to trouble the small town of Forks, Washington, no more sightings of the giant, mysterious wolves in the ever-rainy woods. . . .      I prodded the noodles in silence, guessing that Charlie would get around to talking about whatever was bothering him in his own time. My dad was not a man of many words, and the effort he had put into trying to orchestrate a sit-down dinner with me made it clear there were an uncharacteristic number of words on his mind.  I glanced at the clock routinely - something I did every few minutes around this time. Less than a half hour to go now.    Afternoons were the hardest part of my day. Ever since my former best friend (and werewolf), Jacob Black, had informed on me about the motorcycle I\u2019d been riding on the sly \u2014 a betrayal he had devised in order to get me grounded so that I couldn\u2019t spend time with my boyfriend (and vampire), Edward Cullen \u2014 Edward had been allowed to see me only from seven till nine-thirty p.m., always inside the confines of my home and under the supervision of my dad\u2019s unfailingly crabby glare.     This was an escalation from the previous, slightly less stringent grounding that I\u2019d earned for an unexplained three-day disappearance and one episode of cliff diving.     Of course, I still saw Edward at school, because there wasn\u2019t anything Charlie could do about that. And then, Edward spent almost every night in my room, too, but Charlie wasn\u2019t precisely aware of that. Edward\u2019s ability to climb easily and silently through my second-story window was almost as useful as his ability to read Charlie\u2019s mind.     Though the afternoon was the only time I spent away from Edward, it was enough to make me restless, and the hours always dragged. Still, I endured my punishment without complaining because \u2014 for one thing \u2014 I knew I\u2019d earned it, and \u2014 for another \u2014 because I couldn\u2019t bear to hurt my dad by moving out now, when a much more permanent separation hovered, invisible to Charlie, so close on my horizon.    My dad sat down at the table with a grunt and unfolded the damp newspaper there; within seconds he was clucking his tongue in disapproval.  \u201cI don\u2019t know why you read the news, Dad. It only ticks you off.\u201d  He ignored me, grumbling at the paper in his hands. \u201cThis is why everyone wants to live in a small town! Ridiculous.\u201d  \u201cWhat have big cities done wrong now?\u201d  \u201cSeattle\u2019s making a run for murder capital of the country. Five unsolved homicides in the last two weeks. Can you imagine living like that?\u201d      \u201cI think Phoenix is actually higher up the homicide list, Dad. I have lived like that.\u201d And I\u2019d never come close to being a murder victim until after I moved to his safe little town. In fact, I was still on several hit lists. . . . The spoon shook in my hands, making the water tremble. \u201cWell, you couldn\u2019t pay me enough,\u201d Charlie said.     I gave up on saving dinner and settled for serving it; I had to use a steak knife to cut a portion of spaghetti for Charlie and then myself, while he watched with a sheepish expression. Charlie coated his helping with sauce and dug in. I disguised my own clump as well as I could and followed his example without much enthusiasm. We ate in silence for a moment. Charlie was still scanning the news, so I picked up my much-abused copy of Wuthering Heights from where I\u2019d left it this morning at breakfast, and tried to lose myself in turn-of-the-century England while I waited for him to start talking.     I was just to the part where Heathcliff returns when Charlie cleared his throat and threw the paper to the floor.  \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Charlie said. \u201cI did have a reason for doing this.\u201d He waved his fork at the gluey spread.  \u201cI wanted to talk to you.\u201d  I laid the book aside; the binding was so destroyed that it slumped flat to the table. \u201cYou could have just asked.\u201d  He nodded, his eyebrows pulling together. \u201cYeah. I\u2019ll remember that next time. I thought taking dinner off your hands would soften you up.\u201d     I laughed. \u201cIt worked \u2014 your cooking skills have me soft as a marshmallow. What do you need, Dad?\u201d  \u201cWell, it\u2019s about Jacob.\u201d  I felt my face harden. \u201cWhat about him?\u201d I asked through stiff lips.  \u201cEasy, Bells. I know you\u2019re still upset that he told on you, but it was the right thing. He was being responsible.\u201d  \u201cResponsible,\u201d I repeated scathingly, rolling my eyes. \u201cRight. So, what about Jacob?\u201d  The careless question repeated inside my head, anything but trivial.What about Jacob? What was I going to do about him? My former best friend who was now . . . what? My enemy? I cringed.    Charlie\u2019s face was suddenly wary. \u201cDon\u2019t get mad at me, okay?\u201d  \u201cMad?\u201d  \u201cWell, it\u2019s about Edward, too.\u201d  My eyes narrowed.  Charlie\u2019s voice got gruffer. \u201cI let him in the house, don\u2019t I?\u201d  \u201cYou do,\u201d I admitted. \u201cFor brief periods of time. Of course, you might let me out of the house for brief periods now and then, too,\u201d I continued \u2014 only jokingly; I knew I was on lockdown for the duration of the school year. \u201cI\u2019ve been pretty good lately.\u201d  \u201cWell, that\u2019s kind of where I was heading with this. . . .\u201d And then Charlie\u2019s face stretched into an unexpected eye-crinkling grin; for a second he looked twenty years younger.     I saw a dim glimmer of possibility in that smile, but I proceeded slowly. \u201cI\u2019m confused, Dad. Are we talking about Jacob, or Edward, or me being grounded?\u201d  The grin flashed again. \u201cSort of all three.\u201d  \u201cAnd how do they relate?\u201d I asked, cautious.  \u201cOkay.\u201d He sighed, raising his hands as if in surrender. \u201cSo I\u2019m thinking maybe you deserve a parole for good behavior. For a teenager, you\u2019re amazingly non-whiney.\u201d  My voice and eyebrows shot up. \u201cSeriously? I\u2019m free?\u201d  Where was this coming from? I\u2019d been positive I would be under house arrest until I actually moved out, and Edward hadn\u2019t picked up any wavering in Charlie\u2019s thoughts. . . .     Charlie held up one finger. \u201cConditionally.\u201d  The enthusiasm vanished. \u201cFantastic,\u201d I groaned.  \u201cBella, this is more of a request than a demand, okay? You\u2019re free. But I\u2019m hoping you\u2019ll use that freedom . . . judiciously.\u201d  \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d  He sighed again. \u201cI know you\u2019re satisfied to spend all of your time with Edward \u2014\u201d  \u201cI spend time with Alice, too,\u201d I interjected. Edward\u2019s sister had no hours of visitation; she came and went as she pleased. Charlie was putty in her capable hands.  \u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you have other friends besides the Cullens, Bella. Or you used to.\u201d     We stared at each other for a long moment.  \u201cWhen was the last time you spoke to Angela Weber?\u201d he threw at me.  \u201cFriday at lunch,\u201d I answered immediately.  Before Edward\u2019s return, my school friends had polarized into two groups. I liked to think of those groups as good vs.evil. Us and them worked, too. The good guys were Angela, her steady boyfriend Ben Cheney, and Mike Newton; these three had all very generously forgiven me for going crazy when Edward left. Lauren Mallory was the evil core of the them side, and almost everyone else, including my first friend in Forks, Jessica Stanley, seemed content to go along with her anti-Bella agenda.     With Edward back at school, the dividing line had become even more distinct.  Edward\u2019s return had taken its toll on Mike\u2019s friendship, but Angela was unswervingly loyal, and Ben followed her lead. Despite the natural aversion most humans felt toward the Cullens, Angela sat dutifully beside Alice every day at lunch. After a few weeks, Angela even looked comfortable there. It was difficult not to be charmed by the Cullens \u2014 once one gave them the chance to be charming.  \u201cOutside of school?\u201d Charlie asked, calling my attention back.     \u201cI haven\u2019t seen anyone outside of school, Dad. Grounded, remember? And Angela has a boyfriend, too. She\u2019s always with Ben.If I\u2019m really free,\u201d I added, heavy on the skepticism, \u201cmaybe we could double.\u201d  \u201cOkay. But then . . .\u201d He hesitated. \u201cYou and Jake used to be joined at the hip, and now \u2014\u201d  I cut him off. \u201cCan you get to the point, Dad? What\u2019s your condition \u2014 exactly?\u201d  \u201cI don\u2019t think you should dump all your other friends for your boyfriend, Bella,\u201d he said in a stern voice.  \u201cIt\u2019s not nice, and I think your life would be better balanced if you kept some other people in it. What happened last September . . .\u201d  I flinched.      \u201cWell,\u201d he said defensively. \u201cIf you\u2019d had more of a life outside of Edward Cullen, it might not have been like that.\u201d  \u201cIt would have been exactly like that,\u201d I muttered.  \u201cMaybe, maybe not.\u201d  \u201cThe point?\u201d I reminded him.  \u201cUse your new freedom to see your other friends, too. Keep it balanced.\u201d  I nodded slowly. \u201cBalance is good. Do I have specific time quotas to fill, though?\u201d  He made a face, but shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make this complicated. Just don\u2019t forget your friends . . .\u201d      It was a dilemma I was already struggling with. My friends. People who, for their own safety, I would never be able to see again after graduation.  So what was the better course of action? Spend time with them while I could? Or start the separation now to make it more gradual? I quailed at the idea of the second option.  \u201c. . . particularly Jacob,\u201d Charlie added before I could think things through more than that. A greater dilemma than the first. It took me a moment to find the right words. \u201cJacob might be . . . difficult.\u201d  \u201cThe Blacks are practically family, Bella,\u201d he said, stern and fatherly again. \u201cAnd Jacob has been a very, very good friend to you.\u201d  \u201cI know that.\u201d  \u201cDon\u2019t you miss him at all?\u201d Charlie asked, frustrated.    My throat suddenly felt swollen; I had to clear it twice before I answered. \u201cYes, I do miss him,\u201d I admitted, still looking down. \u201cI miss him a lot.\u201d  \u201cThen why is it difficult?\u201d It wasn\u2019t something I was at liberty to explain. It was against the rules for normal people \u2014human people like me and Charlie \u2014 to know about the clandestine world full of myths and monsters that existed secretly around us. I knew all about that world \u2014 and I was in no small amount of trouble as a result. I wasn\u2019t about to get Charlie in the same trouble. \u201cWith Jacob there is a . . . conflict,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cA conflict about the friendship thing, I mean. Friendship doesn\u2019t always seem to be enough for Jake.\u201d      I wound my excuse out of details that were true but insignificant, hardly crucial compared to the fact that Jacob\u2019s werewolf pack bitterly hated Edward\u2019s vampire family \u2014 and therefore me, too, as I fully intended to join that family. It just wasn\u2019t something I could work out with him in a note, and he wouldn\u2019t answer my calls. But my plan to deal with the werewolf in person had definitely not gone over well with the vampires.    \u201cIsn\u2019t Edward up for a little healthy competition?\u201d Charlie\u2019s voice was sarcastic now.  I leveled a dark look at him. \u201cThere\u2019s no competition.\u201d  \u201cYou\u2019re hurting Jake\u2019s feelings, avoiding him like this. He\u2019d rather be just friends than nothing.\u201d  Oh, now I was avoiding him?  \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Jake doesn\u2019t want to be friends at all.\u201d The words burned in my mouth. \u201cWhere\u2019d you get that idea, anyway?\u201d  Charlie looked embarrassed now. \u201cThe subject might have come up today with Billy. . . .\u201d  \u201cYou and Billy gossip like old women,\u201d I complained, stabbing my fork <em>viciously</em> into the congealed spaghetti on my plate.     \u201cBilly\u2019s worried about Jacob,\u201d Charlie said. \u201cJake\u2019s having a hard time right now. . . . He\u2019s depressed.\u201d  I winced, but kept my eyes on the blob.  \u201cAnd then you were always so happy after spending the day with Jake.\u201d Charlie sighed.  \u201cI\u2019m happy now,\u201d I growled fiercely through my teeth.  The contrast between my words and tone broke through the tension. Charlie burst into laughter, and I had to join in.  \u201cOkay, okay,\u201d I agreed. \u201cBalance.\u201d  \u201cAnd Jacob,\u201d he insisted.  \u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d      \u201cGood. Find that balance, Bella. And, oh, yeah, you\u2019ve got some mail,\u201d Charlie said, closing the subject with no attempt at subtlety. \u201cIt\u2019s by the stove.\u201d  I didn\u2019t move, my thoughts twisting into snarls around Jacob\u2019s name. It was most likely junk mail; I\u2019d just gotten a package from my mom yesterday and I wasn\u2019t expecting anything else.  Charlie shoved his chair away from the table and stretched as he got to his feet. He took his plate to the sink, but before he turned the water on to rinse it, he paused to toss a thick envelope at me. The letter skidded across the table and thunked into my elbow.      \u201cEr, thanks,\u201d I muttered, puzzled by his pushiness. Then I saw the return address \u2014 the letter was from the University of Alaska Southeast. \u201cThat was quick. I guess I missed the deadline on that one, too.\u201d  Charlie chuckled.  I flipped the envelope over and then glared up at him. \u201cIt\u2019s open.\u201d  \u201cI was curious.\u201d  \u201cI\u2019m shocked, Sheriff. That\u2019s a federal crime.\u201d  \u201cOh, just read it.\u201d  I pulled out the letter, and a folded schedule of courses.  \u201cCongratulations,\u201d he said before I could read anything. \u201cYour first acceptance.\u201d  \u201cThanks, Dad.\u201d     \u201cWe should talk about tuition. I\u2019ve got some money saved up \u2014\u201d  \u201cHey, hey, none of that. I\u2019m not touching your retirement, Dad. I\u2019ve got my college fund.\u201d What was left of it \u2014 and there hadn\u2019t been much to begin with.  Charlie frowned. \u201cSome of these places are pretty pricey, Bells. I want to help. You don\u2019t have to go to all the way to Alaska just because it\u2019s cheaper.\u201d     It wasn\u2019t cheaper, not at all. But it was far away, and Juneau had an average of three hundred twenty-one overcast days per year. The first was my prerequisite, the second was Edward\u2019s.  \u201cI\u2019ve got it covered. Besides, there\u2019s lots of financial aid out there. It\u2019s easy to get loans.\u201d I hoped my bluff wasn\u2019t too obvious. I hadn\u2019t actually done a lot of research on the subject.     \u201cSo . . . ,\u201d Charlie began, and then he pursed his lips and looked away.  \u201cSo what?\u201d  \u201cNothing. I was just . . .\u201d He frowned. \u201cJust wondering what . . . Edward\u2019s plans are for next year?\u201d  \u201cOh.\u201d  \u201cWell?\u201d  Three quick raps on the door saved me. Charlie rolled his eyes and I jumped up.  \u201cComing!\u201d I called while Charlie mumbled something that sounded like, \u201cGo away.\u201d I ignored him and went to let Edward in.     I wrenched the door out of my way \u2014 ridiculously eager \u2014 and there he was, my personal miracle. Time had not made me immune to the perfection of his face, and I was sure that I would never take any aspect of him for granted. My eyes traced over his pale white features: the hard square of his jaw, the softer curve of his full lips \u2014 twisted up into a smile now, the straight line of his nose, the sharp angle of his cheekbones, the smooth marble span of his forehead \u2014 partially obscured by a tangle of rain-darkened bronze hair. . . .     I saved his eyes for last, knowing that when I looked into them I was likely to lose my train of thought. They were wide, warm with liquid gold, and framed by a thick fringe of black lashes. Staring into his eyes always made me feel extraordinary \u2014 sort of like my bones were turning spongy. I was also a little lightheaded, but that could have been because I\u2019d forgotten to keep breathing. Again.  It was a face any male model in the world would trade his soul for. Of course, that might be exactly the asking price: one soul.  No. I didn\u2019t believe that. I felt guilty for even thinking it, and was glad \u2014 as I was often glad \u2014 that I was the one person whose thoughts were a mystery to Edward.     I reached for his hand, and sighed when his cold fingers found mine. His touch brought with it the strangest sense of relief \u2014 as if I\u2019d been in pain and that pain had suddenly ceased.  \u201cHey.\u201d I smiled a little at my anticlimactic greeting.  He raised our interlaced fingers to brush my cheek with the back of his hand. \u201cHow was your afternoon?\u201d  \u201cSlow.\u201d  \u201cFor me, as well.\u201d  He pulled my wrist up to his face, our hands still twisted together. His eyes closed as his nose skimmed along the skin there, and he smiled gently without opening them. Enjoying the bouquet while resisting the wine, as he\u2019d once put it.    I knew that the scent of my blood \u2014 so much sweeter to him than any other person\u2019s blood, truly like wine beside water to an alcoholic \u2014 caused him actual pain from the burning thirst it engendered. But he didn\u2019t seem to shy away from it as much as he once had. I could only dimly imagine the Herculean effort behind this simple gesture.",

            "en": "7 REPETITION          20. VOLTERRA WE BEGAN THE STEEP CLIMB, AND THE ROAD GREW CONGESTED. As we wound higher, the cars became too close together for Alice to weave insanely between them anymore. We slowed to a crawl behind a little tan Peugeot. \"Alice,\" I moaned. The clock on the dash seemed to be speeding up. \"It's the only way in,\" she tried soothe me. But her voice was too strained to comfort. The cars continued to edge forward, one car length at a time. The sun beamed down brilliantly, seeming already overhead. The cars crept one by one toward the city. As we got closer, I could see cars parked by the side of the road with people getting out to walk the test of the way. At first I thought it was just impatience\u2014something I could easily understand. But then we came around a switchback, and I could see the filled parking lot outside the city wall, the crowds of people walking through the gates. No one was being allowed to drive through. \"Alice,\" I whispered urgently. \"I know,\" she said. Her face was chiseled from ice. Now that I was looking, and we were crawling slowly enough to see, I could tell that it was very windy. The people crowding toward the gate gripped their hats and tugged their hair out of their faces. Their clothes billowed around them. I also noticed that the color red was everywhere. Red shirts, red hats, red flags dripping like long ribbons beside the gate, whipping in the wind\u2014as I watched, the brilliant crimson scarf one woman had tied around her hair was caught in a sudden gust. It twisted up into the air above her, writhing like it was alive. She reached for it, jumping in the air, but it continued to flutter higher, a patch of bloody color against the dull, ancient walls. \"Bella.\" Alice spoke quickly in a fierce, low voice. \"I can't see what the guard here will decide now\u2014if this doesn't work, you're going to have to go in alone. You're going to have to run. Just keep asking for the Palazzo dei Priori, and running in the direction they tell you. Don't get lost.\" \"Palazzo dei Priori, Palazzo dei Priori,\" I repeated the name over and over again, trying to get it down. \"Or 'the clock tower,' if they speak English. I'll go around and try to find a secluded spot somewhere behind the city where I can go over the wall.\" I nodded. \"Palazzo dei Priori.\" \"Edward will be under the clock tower, to the north of the square. There's a narrow alleyway on the right, and he'll be in the shadow there. You have to get his attention before he can move into the sun.\" I nodded furiously. Alice was near the front of the line. A man in a navy blue uniform was directing the flow of traffic, turning the cars away from the full lot. They U-turned and headed back to find a place beside the road. Then it was Alice's turn. The uniformed man motioned lazily, not paying attention. Alice accelerated, edging around him and heading for the gate. He shouted something at us, but held his ground, waving frantically to keep the next car from following our bad example. The man at the gate wore a matching uniform. As we approached him, the throngs of tourists passed, crowding the sidewalks, staring curiously at the pushy, flashy Porsche. The guard stepped into the middle of the street. Alice angled the car carefully before she came to a full stop. The sun beat against my window, and she was in shadow. She swiftly reached behind the seat and grabbed something from her bag. The guard came around the car with an irritated expression, and tapped on her window angrily.  She rolled the window down halfway, and I watched him do a double take when he saw the face behind the dark glass. \"I'm sorry, only tour buses allowed in the city today, miss,\" he said in English, with a heavy accent. He was apologetic, now, as if he wished he had better news for the strikingly beautiful woman. \"It's a private tour,\" Alice said, flashing an alluring smile. She reached her hand out of the window, into the sunlight. I froze, until I realized she was wearing an elbow-length, tan glove. She took his hand, still raised from tapping her window, and pulled it into the car. She put something into his palm, and folded his fingers around it. His face was dazed as he retrieved his hand and stared at the thick roll of money he now held. The outside bill was a thousand dollar bill. \"Is this a joke?\" he mumbled. Alice's smile was blinding. \"Only if you think it's funny.\" He looked at her, his eyes staring wide. I glanced nervously at the clock on the dash. If Edward stuck to his plan, we had only five minutes left. \"I'm in a wee bit of a hurry,\" she hinted, still smiling. The guard blinked twice, and then shoved the money inside his vest. He took a step away from the window and waved us on. None of the passing people seemed to notice the quiet exchange. Alice drove into the city, and we both sighed in relief. The street was very narrow, cobbled with the same color stones as the faded cinnamon brown buildings that darkened the street with their shade. It had the feel of an alleyway. Red flags decorated the walls, spaced only a few yards apart, flapping in the wind that whistled through the narrow lane. It was crowded, and the foot traffic slowed our progress. \"Just a little farther,\" Alice encouraged me; I was gripping the door handle, ready to throw myself into the street as soon as she spoke the word. She drove in quick spurts and sudden stops, and the people in the crowd shook their fists at us and said angry words that I was glad I couldn't understand. She turned onto a little path that couldn't have been meant for cars; shocked people had to squeeze into doorways as we scraped by. We found another street at the end. The buildings were taller here; they leaned together overhead so that no sunlight touched the pavement\u2014the thrashing red flags on either side nearly met. The crowd was thicker here than anywhere else. Alice stopped the car. I had the door open before we were at a standstill. She pointed to where the street widened into a patch of bright openness. \"There\u2014we're at the southern end of the square. Run straight across, to the right of the clock tower. I'll find a way around\u2014\" Her breath caught suddenly, and when she spoke again, her voice was a hiss. \"They're everywhere?\" I froze in place, but she pushed me out of the car. \"Forget about them. You have two minutes. Go, Bella, go!\" she shouted, climbing out of the car as she spoke. I didn't pause to watch Alice melt into the shadows. I didn't stop to close my door behind me. I shoved a heavy woman out of my way and ran flat out, head down, paying little attention to anything but the uneven stones beneath my feet. Coming out of the dark lane, I was blinded by the brilliant sunlight beating down into the principal plaza.  The wind whooshed into me, flinging my hair into my eyes and blinding me further. It was no wonder that I didn't see the wall of flesh until I'd smacked into it. There was no pathway, no crevice between the close pressed bodies. I pushed against them furiously, fighting the hands that shoved back. I heard exclamations of irritation and even pain as I battled my way through, but none were in a language I understood. The faces were a blur of anger and surprise, surrounded by the ever-present red. A blond woman scowled at me, and the red scarf coiled around her neck looked like a gruesome wound. A child, lifted on a man's shoulders to see over the crowd, grinned down at me, his lips distended over a set of plastic vampire fangs. The throng jostled around me, spinning me the wrong direction. I was glad the clock was so visible, or I'd never keep my course straight. But both hands on the clock pointed up toward the pitiless sun, and, though I shoved <em>viciously</em> against the crowd, I knew I was too late. I wasn't halfway across. I wasn't going to make it. I was stupid and slow and human, and we were all going to die because of it. I hoped Alice would get out. I hoped that she would see me from some dark shadow and know that I had failed, so she could go home to Jasper. I listened, above the angry exclamations, trying to hear the sound of discovery: the gasp, maybe the scream, as Edward came into someone's view. But there was a break in the crowd\u2014I could see a bubble of space ahead. I pushed urgently toward it, not realizing till I bruised my shins against the bricks that there was a wide, square fountain set into the center of the plaza. I was nearly crying with relief as I flung my leg over the edge and ran through the knee-deep water. It sprayed all around me as I thrashed my way across the pool. Even in the sun, the wind was glacial, and the wet made the cold actually painful. But the fountain was very wide; it let me cross the center of the square and then some in mere seconds. I didn't pause when I hit the far edge\u2014I used the low wall as a springboard, throwing myself into the crowd. They moved more readily for me now, avoiding the icy water that splattered from my dripping clothes as I ran. I glanced up at the clock again. A deep, booming chime echoed through the square. It throbbed in the stones under my feet. Children cried, covering their ears. And I started screaming as I ran. \"Edward!\" I screamed, knowing it was useless. The crowd was too loud, and my voice was breathless with exertion. But I couldn't stop screaming. The clock tolled again. I ran past a child in his mother's arms\u2014his hair was almost white in the dazzling sunlight. A circle of tall men, all wearing red blazers, called out warnings as I barreled through them. The clock tolled again. On the other side of the men in blazers, there was a break in the throng, space between the sightseers who milled aimlessly around me. My eyes searched the dark narrow passage to the right of the wide square edifice under the tower. I couldn't see the street level\u2014there were still too many people in the way. The clock tolled again. It was hard to see now. Without the crowd to break the wind, it whipped at my face and burned my eyes. I couldn't be sure if that was the reason behind my tears, or if I was crying in defeat as the clock tolled again. A little family of four stood nearest to the alley's mouth. The two girls wore crimson dresses, with matching ribbons tying their dark hair back. The father wasn't tall. It seemed like I could see something bright in the shadows, just over his shoulder. I hurtled toward them, trying to see past the stinging tears. The clock tolled, and the littlest girl clamped her hands over her ears. The older girl, just waist high on her mother, hugged her mother's leg and stared into the shadows behind them. As I watched, she tugged on her mother's elbow and pointed toward the darkness. The clock tolled, and I was so close now. I was close enough to hear her high-pitched voice. Her father stared at me in surprise as I bore down on them, rasping out Edward's name over and over again. The older girl giggled and said something to her mother, gesturing toward the shadows again impatiently. I swerved around the father\u2014he clutched the baby out of my way\u2014and sprinted for the gloomy breach behind them as the clock tolled over my head. \"Edward, no!\" I screamed, but my voice was lost in the roar of the chime. I could see him now. And I could see that he could not see me. It was really him, no hallucination this time. And I realized that my delusions were more flawed than I'd realized; they'd never done him justice. Edward stood, motionless as a statue, just a few feet from the mouth of the alley. His eyes were closed, the rings underneath them deep purple, his arms relaxed at his sides, his palms turned forward. His expression was very peaceful, like he was dreaming pleasant things. The marble skin of his chest was bare\u2014there was a small pile of white fabric at his feet. The light reflecting from the pavement of the square gleamed dimly from his skin. I'd never seen anything more beautiful\u2014even as I ran, gasping and screaming, I could appreciate that. And the last seven months meant nothing. And his words in the forest meant nothing. And it did not matter if he did not want me. I would never want anything but him, no matter how long I lived. The clock tolled, and he took a large stride toward the light. \"No!\" I screamed. \"Edward, look at me!\" He wasn't listening. He smiled very slightly. He raised his foot to take the step that would put him directly in the path of the sun. I slammed into him so hard that the force would have hurled me to the ground if his arms hadn't caught me and held me up. It knocked my breath out of me and snapped my head back. His dark eyes opened slowly as the clock tolled again. He looked down at me with quiet surprise. \"Amazing,\" he said, his exquisite voice full of wonder, slightly amused. \"Carlisle was right.\" \"Edward,\" I tried to gasp, but my voice had no sound. \"You've got to get back into the shadows. You have to move!\" He seemed bemused. His hand brushed softly against my cheek. He didn't appear to notice that I was trying to force him back. I could have been pushing against the alley walls for all the progress I was making. The clock tolled, but he didn't react. It was very strange, for I knew we were both in mortal danger. Still, in that instant, I felt well. Whole. I could feel my heart racing in my chest, the blood pulsing hot and fast through my veins again. My lungs filled deep with the sweet scent that came off his skin. It was like there had never been any hole in my chest. I was perfect\u2014not healed, but as if there had been no wound in the first place. d\u1ec5 ch\u1ecbu \"I can't believe how quick it was. I didn't feel a thing\u2014they're very good,\" he mused, closing his eyes again and pressing his lips against my hair. His voice was like honey and velvet. \"Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath, hath had no power yet upon thy beauty,\" he murmured, and I recognized the line spoken by Romeo in the tomb. The clock boomed out its final chime \"You smell just exactly the same as always,\" he went on. \"So maybe this is hell. I don't care. I'll take it.\" \"I'm not dead,\" I interrupted. \"And neither are you! Please Edward, we have to move. They can't be far away!\" I struggled in his arms, and his brow furrowed in confusion. \"What was that?\" he asked politely. \"We're not dead, not yet! But we have to get out of here before the Volturi\u2014\" Comprehension flickered on his face as I spoke. Before I could finish, he suddenly yanked me away from the edge of the shadows, spinning me effortlessly so that my back was tight against the brick wall, and his back was to me as he faced away into the alley. His arms spread wide, protectively, in front of me. I peeked under his arm to see two dark shapes detach themselves from the gloom. \"Greetings, gentlemen,\" Edward's voice was calm and pleasant, on the surface. \"I don't think I'll be requiring your services today. I would appreciate it very much, however, if you would send my thanks to your masters.\" \"Shall we take this conversation to a more appropriate venue?\" a smooth voice whispered menacingly. \"I don't believe that will be necessary.\" Edward's voice was harder now. \"I know your instructions, Felix.\u00a0 I haven't broken any rules.\" \"Felix merely meant to point out the proximity of the sun,\" the other shadow said in a soothing tone. They were both concealed within smoky gray cloaks that reached to the ground and undulated in the wind. \"Let us seek better cover.\" \"I'll be right behind you,\" Edward said dryly. \"Bella, why don't you go back to the square and enjoy the festival?\" \"No, bring the girl,\" the first shadow said, somehow injecting a leer into his whisper. \"I don't think so.\" The pretense of civility disappeared. Edward's voice was flat and icy. His weight shifted infinitesimally, and I could see that he was preparing to fight. \"No.\" I mouthed the word. \"Shh,\" he murmured, only for me. \"Felix,\" the second, more reasonable shadow cautioned. \"Not here.\" He turned to Edward. \"Aro would simply like to speak with you again, if you have decided not to force our hand after all.\" \"Certainly,\" Edward agreed. '\"But the girl goes free.\" \"I'm afraid that's not possible,\" the polite shadow said regretfully. \"We do have rules to obey.\" \"Then I'm afraid that I'll be unable to accept Aro's invitation, Demetri.\" \"That's just fine,\" Felix purred. My eyes were adjusting to the deep shade, and I could see that Felix was very big, tall and thick through the shoulders. His size reminded me of Emmett. \"Aro will be disappointed,\" Demetri sighed. \"I'm sure he'll survive the letdown,\" Edward replied. Felix and Demetri stole closer toward the mouth of the alley, spreading out slightly so they could come at Edward from two sides. They meant to force him deeper into the alley, to avoid a scene. No reflected light found access to their skin; they were safe inside their cloaks. Edward didn't move an inch. He was dooming himself by protecting me. Abruptly, Edward's head whipped around, toward the darkness of the winding alley, and Demetri and Felix did the same, in response to some sound or movement too subtle for my senses. \"Let's behave ourselves, shall we?\" a lilting voice suggested. \"There are ladies present.\" Alice tripped lightly to Edward's side, her stance casual. There was no hint of any underlying tension. She looked so tiny, so fragile. Her little arms swung like a child's. Yet Demetri and Felix both straightened up, their cloaks swirling slightly as a gust of wind funneled through the alley. Felix's face soured. Apparently, they didn't like even numbers. \"We're not alone,\" she reminded them. Demetri glanced over his shoulder. A few yards into the square, the little family, with the girls in their red dresses, was watching us. The mother was speaking urgently to her husband, her eyes on the five of us. She looked away when Demetri met her gaze. The man walked a few steps farther into the plaza, and tapped one of the red-blazered men on the shoulder. Demetri shook his head. \"Please, Edward, let's be reasonable,\" he said. \"Let's,\" Edward agreed. \"And we'll leave quietly now, with no one the wiser.\" Demetri sighed in frustration. \"At least let us discuss this more privately.\" Six men in red now joined the family as they watched us with anxious expressions. I was very conscious of Edward's protective stance in front of me\u2014sure that this was what caused their alarm. I wanted to scream to them to run. Edward's teeth came together audibly. \"No.\" Felix smiled. \"Enough.\" The voice was high, reedy, and n came from behind us. I peeked under Edward's other arm to see a small, dark shape coming toward us. By the way the edges billowed, I knew it would be another one of them. Who else? At first I thought it was a young boy. The newcomer was as tiny as Alice, with lank, pale brown hair trimmed short. The body under the cloak\u2014which was darker, almost black\u2014was slim and androgynous. But the face was too pretty for a boy. The wide-eyed, full-lipped face would make a Botticelli angel look like a gargoyle. Even allowing for the dull crimson irises. Her size was so insignificant that the reaction to her appearance confused me. Felix and Demetri relaxed immediately, stepping back from their offensive positions to blend again with the shadows of the overhanging walls. Edward dropped his arms and relaxed his position as well\u2014but in defeat. \"Jane,\" he sighed in recognition and resignation. Alice folded her arms across her chest, her expression impassive. \"Follow me,\" Jane spoke again, her childish voice a monotone. She turned her back on us and drifted silently into the dark. Felix gestured for us to go first, smirking. Alice walked after the little Jane at once. Edward wrapped his arm around my waist and pulled me along beside her. The alley angled slightly downward as it narrowed. I looked up at him with frantic questions in my eyes, but he just shook his head. Though I couldn't hear the others behind us, I was sure they were there. \"Well, Alice,\" Edward said conversationally as we walked. \"I suppose I shouldn't be surprised to see you here.\" \"It was my mistake,\" Alice answered in the same tone. \"It was my job to set it right.\" \"What happened?\" His voice was polite, as if he were barely interested. I imagined this was due to the listening ears behind us. \"It's a long story.\" Alice's eyes flickered toward me and away. \"In summary, she did jump off a cliff, but she wasn't trying to kill herself. Bella's all about the extreme sports these days.\" I flushed and turned my eyes straight ahead, looking after the dark shadow that I could no longer see. I could imagine what he was hearing in Alice's thoughts now. Near-drownings, stalking vampires, werewolf friends\u2026 \"Hm,\" Edward said curtly, and the casual tone of his voice was gone. There was a loose curve to the alley, still slanting downward, so I didn't see the squared-off dead end coming until we reached the flat, windowless, brick face. The little one called Jane was nowhere to be seen. Alice didn't hesitate, didn't break pace as she strode toward the wall. Then, with easy grace, she slid down an open hole in the street. It looked like a drain, sunk into the lowest point of the paving. I hadn't noticed it until Alice disappeared, but the grate was halfway pushed aside. The hole was small, and black. I balked. \"It's all right, Bella,\" Edward said in a low voice. \"Alice will catch you.\" I eyed the hole doubtfully. I imagine he would have gone first, if Demetri and Felix hadn't been waiting, smug and silent, behind us. I crouched down, swinging my legs into the narrow gap. \"Alice?\" I whispered, voice trembling. \"I'm right here, Bella,\" she reassured me. Her voice came from too far below to make me feel better. Edward took my wrists\u2014his hands felt like stones in winter\u2014and lowered me into the blackness. \"Ready?\" he asked. \"Drop her,\" Alice called. I closed my eyes so I couldn't see the darkness, scrunching them together in terror, clamping my mouth shut so I wouldn't scream. Edward let me fall. It was silent and short. The air whipped past me for just half a second, and then, with a huff as I exhaled, Alice's waiting arms caught me. I was going to have bruises; her arms were very hard. She stood me upright. It was dim, but not black at the bottom. The light from the hole above provided a faint glow, reflecting wetly from the stones under my feet. The light vanished for a second, and then Edward was a faint, white radiance beside me. He put his arm around me, holding me close to his side, and began to tow me swiftly forward. I wrapped both arms around his cold waist, and tripped and stumbled my way across the uneven stone surface.  The sound of the heavy grate sliding over the drain hole behind us rang with metallic finality. The dim light from the street was quickly lost in the gloom. The sound of my staggering footsteps echoed through the black space; it sounded very wide, but I couldn't be sure. There were no sounds other than my frantic heartbeat and my feet on the wet stones\u2014except for once, when an impatient sigh whispered from behind me. Edward held me tightly. He reached his free hand across his body to hold my face, too, his smooth thumb tracing across my lips. Now and then, I felt his face press into my hair. I realized that this was the only reunion we would get, and I clutched myself closer to him.  For now, it felt like he wanted me, and that was enough to offset the horror of the subterranean tunnel and the prowling vampires behind us. It was probably no more than guilt\u2014the same guilt that compelled him to come here to die when he'd believed that it was his fault that I'd killed myself. But I felt his lips press silently against my forehead, and I didn't care what the motivation was. At least I could be with him again before I died. That was better than a long life. I wished I could ask him exactly what was going to happen now. I wanted desperately to know how we were going to die\u2014as if that would somehow make it better, knowing in advance. But I couldn't speak, even in a whisper, surrounded as we were. The others could hear everything\u2014my every breath, my every heartbeat. The path beneath our feet continued to slant downward, taking us deeper into the ground, and it made me claustrophobic. Only Edward's hand, soothing against my face, kept me from screaming out loud. I couldn't tell where the light was coming from, but it slowly turned dark gray instead of black. We were in a low, arched tunnel. Long trails of ebony moisture seeped down the gray stones, like they were bleeding ink. I was shaking, and I thought it was from fear. It wasn't until my teeth started to chatter together that I realized I was cold. My clothes were still wet, and the temperature underneath the city was wintry. As was Edward's skin. He realized this at the same time I did, and let go of me, keeping only my hand. \"N-n-no,\" I chattered, throwing my arms around him. I didn't care if I froze. Who knew how long we had left? His cold hand chafed against my arm, trying to warm me with the friction. We hurried through the tunnel, or it felt like hurrying to me. My slow progress irritated someone\u2014I guessed Felix\u2014and I heard him heave a sigh now and then. At the end of the tunnel was a grate\u2014the iron bars were rusting, but thick as my arm. A small door made of thinner, interlaced bars was standing open. Edward ducked through and hurried on to a larger, brighter stone room. The grille slammed shut with a clang, followed by the snap of a lock. I was too afraid to look behind me. On the other side of the long room was a low, heavy wooden door. It was very thick\u2014as I could tell because it, too, stood open. We stepped through the door, and I glanced around me in surprise, relaxing automatically. Beside me, Edward tensed, his jaw clenched tight.",

            "en": "12         12. INTRUDER My eyes flew wide open with fright, though i was so exhausted and muddled that I was not yet positive whether I was awake or asleep. Something scratched against my window again with the same thin, high-pitched sound. Confused and clumsy with sleep, I stumbled out of my bed and to the window, blinking the lingering tears from my eyes on the way. A huge, dark shape wobbled erratically on the other side of the glass, lurching toward me like it was going to smash right through. I staggered back, terrified, my throat closing around a scream. Victoria. She'd come for me. I was dead. Not Charlie, too! I choked back the building scream. I would have to keep quiet through this. Somehow. I had to keep Charlie from coming to investigate\u2026 And then a familiar, husky voice called from the dark shape. \"Bella!\" it hissed. \"Ouch! Damn it, open the window! OUCH!\" I needed two seconds to shake off the horror before I could move, but then I hurried to the window and shoved the glass out of the way. The clouds were dimly lit from behind, enough for me to make sense of the shapes. \"What are you doing?\" I gasped. Jacob was clinging precariously to the top of the spruce that grew in the middle of Charlie's little front yard. His weight had bowed the tree toward the house and he now swung\u2014his legs dangling twenty feet above the ground\u2014not a yard away from me. The thin branches at the tip of the tree scraped against the side of the house again with a grating squeal. \"I'm trying to keep\"\u2014he huffed, shifting his weight as the treetop bounced him\u2014\"my promise!\" I blinked my wet blurry eyes, suddenly sure that I was dreaming. \"When did you ever promise to kill yourself falling out of Charlie's tree?\" He snorted, unamused, swinging his legs to improve his balance. \"Get out of the way,\" he ordered. \"What?\" He swung his legs again, backwards and forward, increasing his momentum. I realized what he was trying to do. \"No, Jake!\" But I ducked to the side, because it was too late. With a grunt, he launched himself toward my open window. Another scream built in my throat as I waited for him to fall to his death\u2014or at least maim himself against the wooden siding. To my shock, he swung agilely into my room, landing on the balls of his feet with a low thud. We both looked to the door automatically, holding our breath, waiting to see if the noise had woken Charlie. A short moment of silence passed, and then we heard the muffled sound of Charlie's snore. A wide grin spread slowly across Jacob's face; he seemed extremely pleased with himself. It wasn't the grin that I knew and loved\u2014it was a new grin, one that was a bitter mockery of his old sincerity, on the new face that belonged to Sam. That was a bit much for me. I'd cried myself to sleep over this boy. His harsh rejection had punched a painful new hole in what was left of my chest. He'd left a new nightmare behind him, like an infection in a sore\u2014the insult after the injury. And now he was here in my room, smirking at me as if none of that had passed. Worse than that, even though his arrival had been noisy and awkward, it reminded me of when Edward used to sneak in through my window at night, and the reminder picked <em>viciously</em> at the unhealed wounds.  All of this, coupled with the fact that I was dog-tired, did not put me in a friendly mood. \"Get out!\" I hissed, putting as much venom into the whisper as I could. He blinked, his face going blank with surprise. \"No,\" he protested. \"I came to apologize.\" \"I don't accept!\" I tried to shove him back out the window\u2014after all, if this was a dream, it wouldn't really hurt him. It was useless, though. I didn't budge him an inch. I dropped my hands quickly, and stepped away from him. He wasn't wearing a shirt, though the air blowing in the window was cold enough to make me shiver, and it made me uncomfortable to have my hands on his bare chest. His skin was burning hot, like his head had been the last time I'd touched him. Like he was still sick with the fever. He didn't look sick. He looked huge. He leaned over me, so big that he blacked out the window, tongue-tied by my furious reaction. Suddenly, it was just more than I could handle\u2014it felt as if all of my sleepless nights were crashing down on me en masse. I was so brutally tired that I thought I might collapse right there on the floor. I swayed unsteadily, and struggled to keep my eyes open. \"Bella?\" Jacob whispered anxiously. He caught my elbow as I swayed again, and steered me back to the bed. My legs gave out when I reached the edge, and I plopped into a limp heap on the mattress. \"Hey, are you okay?\" Jacob asked, worry creasing his forehead. I looked up at him, the tears not yet dried on my cheeks. \"Why in the world would I be okay, Jacob?\" Anguish replaced some of the bitterness in his face. \"Right,\" he agreed, and took a deep breath. \"Crap. Well\u2026 I\u2014I'm so sorry, Bella.\" The apology was sincere, no doubt about it, though there was still an angry twist to his features. \"Why did you come here? I don't want apologies from you, Jake.\" \"I know,\" he whispered. \"But I couldn't leave things the way I did this afternoon. That was horrible. I'm sorry.\" I shook my head wearily. \"I don't understand anything.\" \"I know. I want to explain\u2014\" He broke off suddenly, his mouth open, almost like something had cut off his air. Then he sucked in a deep breath. \"But I can't explain,\" he said, still angry. \"I wish I could.\" I let my head fall into my hands. My question came out muffled by my arm. \"Why?\" He was quiet for a moment. I twisted my head to the side\u2014too tired to hold it up\u2014to see his expression.  It surprised me. His eyes were squinted, his teeth clenched, his forehead wrinkled in effort. \"What's wrong?\" I asked. He exhaled heavily, and I realized he'd been holding his breath, too. \"I can't do it,\" he muttered, frustrated. \"Do what?\" He ignored my question. \"Look, Bella, haven't you ever had a secret that you couldn't tell anyone?\" He looked at me with knowing eyes, and my thoughts jumped immediately to the Cullens. I hoped my expression didn't look guilty. \"Something you felt like you had to keep from Charlie, from your mom\u2026 ?\" he pressed. \"Something you won't even talk about with me? Not even now?\" I felt my eyes tighten. I didn't answer his question, though I knew he would take that as a confirmation. \"Can you understand that I might have the same kind of\u2026 situation?\" He was struggling again, seeming to fight for the right words. \"Sometimes, loyalty gets in the way of what you want to do. Sometimes, it's not your secret to tell.\" So, I couldn't argue with that. He was exactly right\u2014I had a secret that wasn't mine to tell, yet a secret I felt bound to protect. A secret that, suddenly, he seemed to know all about. I still didn't see how it applied to him, or Sam, or Billy. What was it to them, now that the Cullens were gone? \"I don't know why you came here, Jacob, if you were just going to give me riddles instead of answers.\" \"I'm sorry,\" he whispered. \"This is so frustrating.\" We looked at each other for a long moment in the dark room, both our faces hopeless. \"The part that kills me,\" he said abruptly, \"is that you already know. I already told yon everything!\" \"What are you talking about?\" He sucked in a startled breath, and then leaned toward me, his face shifting from hopelessness to blazing intensity in a second. He stared fiercely into my eyes, and his voice was fast and eager. He spoke the words right into my face; his breath was as hot as his skin. \"I think I see a way to make this work out\u2014because you know this, Bella! I can't tell you, but if you guessed it! That would let me right off the hook!\" \"You want me to guess? Guess what?\" \"My secret! You can do it\u2014you know the answer!\" I blinked twice, trying to clear my head. I was so tired. Nothing he said made sense. He took in my blank expression, and then his face tensed with effort again. \"Hold on, let me see if I give you some help,\" he said. Whatever he was trying to do, it was so hard he was panting. \"Help?\" I asked, trying to keep up. My lids wanted to slip closed, but I forced them open. \"Yeah,\" he said, breathing hard. \"Like clues.\" He took my face in his enormous, too-warm hands and held it just a few inches from his. He stared into my eyes while he whispered, as if to communicate something besides the words he spoke. \"Remember the first day we met\u2014on the beach in La Push?\" \"Of course I do.\" \"Tell me about it.\" I took a deep breath and tried to concentrate. \"You asked about my truck\u2026\" He nodded, urging me on. \"We talked about the Rabbit\u2026\" \"Keep going.\" \"We went for a walk down the beach\u2026\" My cheeks were growing warm under his palms as I remembered, but he wouldn't notice, hot as his skin was. I'd asked him to walk with me, flirting ineptly but successfully, in order to pump him for information. He was nodding, anxious for more. My voice was nearly soundless. \"You told me scary stories\u2026 Quileute legends.\" He closed his eyes and opened them again. \"Yes.\" The word was tense, fervent, like he was on the edge of something vital. He spoke slowly, making each word distinct. \"Do you remember what I said?\" Even in the dark, he must be able to see the change in the color of my face. How could I ever forget that? Without realizing what he was doing, Jacob had told me exactly what I needed to know that day\u2014that Edward was a vampire. He looked at me with eyes that knew too much. \"Think hard,\" he told me. \"Yes, I remember,\" I breathed. He inhaled deeply, struggling. \"Do you remember all the story\u2014\" He couldn't finish the question. His mouth popped open like something had stuck in his throat. \"All the stories?\" I asked. He nodded mutely. My head churned. Only one story really mattered. I knew he'd begun with others, but I couldn't remember the inconsequential prelude, especially not while my brain was so clouded with exhaustion. I started to shake my head. Jacob groaned and jumped off the bed. He pressed his fists against his forehead and breathed fast and angry. \"You know this, you know this,\" he muttered to himself. \"Jake? Jake, please, I'm exhausted. I'm no good at this right now. Maybe in the morning\u2026\" He took a steadying breath and nodded. \"Maybe it will come back to you. I guess I understand why you only remember the one story,\" he added in a sarcastic, bitter tone. He plunked back onto the mattress beside me. \"Do you mind if I ask you a question about that?\" he asked, still sarcastic. \"I've been dying to know.\" \"A question about what?\" I asked warily. \"About the vampire story I told you.\" I stared at him with guarded eyes, unable to answer. He asked his question anyway. \"Did you honestly not know?\" he asked me, his voice turning husky. \"Was I the one who told you what he was?\" How did he know this? Why did he decide to believe, why now? My teeth clenched together. I stared back at him, no intention of speaking. He could see that. \"See what I mean about loyalty?\" he murmured, even huskier now. \"It's the same for me, only worse.\u00a0 You can't imagine how tight I'm bound\u2026\" I didn't like that\u2014didn't like the way his eyes closed as if he were in pain when he spoke of being bound. More than dislike\u2014I realized I hated it, hated anything that caused him pain. Hated it fiercely. Sam's face filled my mind. For me, this was all essentially voluntary. I protected the Cullens' secret out of love; unrequited, but true. For Jacob, it didn't seem to be that way. \"Isn't there any way for you to get free?\" I whispered, touching the rough edge at the back of his shorn hair. His hands began to tremble, but he didn't open his eyes. \"No. I'm in this for life. A life sentence.\" A bleak laugh. \"Longer, maybe.\" \"No, Jake,\" I moaned. \"What if we ran away? Just you and me. What if we left home, and left Sam behind?\" \"It's not something I can run away from, Bella,\" he whispered. \"I would run with you, though, if I could.\" His shoulders were shaking now, too. He took a deep breath. \"Look, I've got to leave.\" \"Why?\" \"For one thing, you look like you're going to pass out at any second. You need your sleep\u2014I need you firing on all pistons. You're going to figure this out, you have to.\" \"And why else?\" He frowned. \"I had to sneak out\u2014I'm not supposed to see you. They've got to be wondering where I am.\" His mouth twisted. \"I suppose I should go let them know.\" \"You don't have to tell them anything,\" I hissed. \"All the same, I will.\" The anger flashed hot inside me. \"I hate them!\" Jacob looked at me with wide eyes, surprised. \"No, Bella. Don't hate the guys. It's not Sam's or any of the others' faults. I told you before\u2014it's me. Sam is actually\u2026 well, incredibly cool. Jared and Paul are great, too, though Paul is kind of\u2026 And Embry's always been my friend. Nothing's changed there\u2014the only thing that hasn't changed. I feel really bad about the things I used to think about Sam\u2026\" \"Sam was incredibly cool.\" I glared at him in disbelief, but let it go. \"Then why aren't you supposed to see me?\" I demanded. \"It's not safe,\" he mumbled looking down. His words sent a thrill of fear through me. Did he know that, too? Nobody knew that besides me. But he was right\u2014it was the middle of the night, the perfect time for hunting. Jacob shouldn't be here in my room. If someone came for me, I had to be alone. \"If I thought it was too\u2026 too risky,\" he whispered, \"I wouldn't have come. But Bella,\" he looked at me again, \"I made you a promise. I had no idea it would be so hard to keep, but that doesn't mean I'm not going to try.\" He saw the incomprehension in my face. \"After that stupid movie,\" he reminded me. \"I promised you that I wouldn't ever hurt you\u2026 So I really blew it this afternoon, didn't I?\" \"I know you didn't want to do it, Jake. It's okay.\" \"Thanks, Bella.\" He took my hand. \"I'm going to do what I can to be here for you, just like I promised.\" He grinned at me suddenly. The grin was not mine, nor Sam's, but some strange combination of the two. \"It would really help if you could figure this out on your own, Bella. Put some honest effort into it.\" I made a weak grimace. \"I'll try.\" \"And I'll try to see you soon.\" He sighed. \"And they'll try to talk me out of that.\" \"Don't listen to them.\" \"I'll try.\" He shook his head, as if he doubted his success. \"Come and tell me as soon as you figure it out.\" Something occurred to him just then, something that made his hands shake. \"If you\u2026 if you want to.\" \"Why wouldn't I want to see you?\" His face turned hard and bitter, one hundred percent the face that belonged to Sam. \"Oh, I can think of a reason,\" he said in a harsh tone. \"Look, I really have to go. Could you do something for me?\" I just nodded, frightened of the change in him. \"At least call me\u2014if you don't want to see me again. Let me know if it's like that.\" \"That won't happen\u2014\" He raised one hand, cutting me off. \"Just let me know.\" He stood and headed for the window. \"Don't be an idiot, Jake,\" I complained. \"You'll break your leg. Use the door. Charlie's not going to catch you.\" \"I won't get hurt,\" he muttered, but he turned for the door. He hesitated as he passed me, staring at me with an expression like something was stabbing him. He held one hand out, pleading. I took his hand, and suddenly he yanked me\u2014too roughly\u2014right off the bed so that I thudded against his chest. \"Just in case,\" he muttered against my hair, crushing me in a bear hug that about broke my ribs. \"Can't\u2014breathe!\" I gasped. He dropped me at once, keeping one hand at my waist so I didn't fall over. He pushed me, more gently this time, back down on the bed. \"Get some sleep, Bells. You've got to get your head working. I know you can do this. I need you. To understand. I won't lose you, Bella. Not for this.\" He was to the door in one stride, opening it quietly, and then disappearing through it. I listened for him to hit the squeaky step in the stairs, but there was no sound. I lay back on my bed, my head spinning. I was too confused, too worn out. I closed my eyes, trying to make sense of it, only to be swallowed up by unconsciousness so swiftly that it was disorienting. It was not the peaceful, dreamless sleep I'd yearned for\u2014of course not. I was in the forest again, and I started to wander the way I always did. I quickly became aware that this was not the same dream as usual. For one thing, I felt no compulsion to wander or to search; I was merely wandering out of habit, because that was what was usually expected of me here. Actually, this wasn't even the same forest. The smell was different, and the light, too. It smelled, not like the damp earth of the woods, but like the brine of the ocean. I couldn't see the sky; still, it seemed like the sun must be shining\u2014the leaves above were bright jade green. This was the forest around La Push\u2014near the beach there, I was sure of it. I knew that if I found the beach, I would be able to see the sun, so I hurried forward, following the faint sound of waves in the distance. And then Jacob was there. He grabbed my hand, pulling me back toward the blackest part of the forest.  \"Jacob, what's wrong?\" I asked. His face was the frightened face of a boy, and his hair was beautiful again, swept back into a ponytail on the nape of his neck. He yanked with all his strength, but I resisted; I didn't want to go into the dark. \"Run, Bella, you have to run!\" he whispered, terrified. The abrupt wave of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu was so strong it nearly woke me up. I knew why I recognized this place now. It was because I'd been here before, in another dream. A million years ago, part of a different life entirely. This was the dream I'd had the night after I'd walked with Jacob on the beach, the first night I knew that Edward was a vampire. Reliving that day with Jacob must have dredged this dream out of my buried memories. Detached from the dream now, I waited for it to play out. A light was coming toward me from the beach. In just a moment, Edward would walk through the trees, his skin faintly glowing and his eyes black and dangerous. He would beckon to me, and smile. He would be beautiful as an angel, and his teeth would be pointed and sharp\u2026 But I was getting ahead of myself. Something else had to happen first. Jacob dropped my hand and yelped. Shaking and twitching, he fell to the ground at my feet. \"Jacob!\" I screamed, but he was gone. In his place was an enormous, red-brown wolf with dark, intelligent eyes. The dream veered off course, like a train jumping the tracks. This was not the same wolf that I'd dreamed of in another life. This was the great russet wolf I'd stood half a foot from in the meadow, just a week ago. This wolf was gigantic, monstrous, bigger than a bear. This wolf stared intently at me, trying to convey something vital with his intelligent eyes. The black-brown, familiar eyes of Jacob Black. I woke screaming at the top of my lungs. I almost expected Charlie to come check on me this time. This wasn't my usual screaming. I buried my head in my pillow and tried to muffle the hysterics that my screams were building into. I pressed the cotton tight against my face, wondering if I couldn't also somehow smother the connection I'd just made. But Charlie didn't come in. and eventually I was able to strangle the strange screeching coming out of my throat. I remembered it all now\u2014every word that Jacob had said to me that day on the beach, even the part before he got to the vampires, the \"cold ones.\" Especially that first part. \"Do you know any of our old stories, about where we came from\u2014the Quileutes, I mean?\" he asked. \"Not really,\" I admitted. \"Well, there are lots of legends, some of them claiming to date back to the Flood\u2014supposedly, the ancient Quileutes tied their canoes to the tops of the tallest trees on the mountain to survive, like Noah and the ark.\" He smiled then, to show me how little stock he put in the histories. \"Another legend claims that we descended from wolves\u2014and that the wolves are our brothers still. It's against tribal law to kill them. \"Then there are the stories about the cold ones.\" His voice dropped a little lower. \"The cold ones?\" \"Yes. There are stories of the cold ones as old as the wolf legends, and some much more recent. According to legend, my own great-grandfather knew some of them. He was the one who made the treaty that kept them off our land.\" Jacob rolled his eyes. \" Your great-grandfather?\" \"He was a tribal elder, like my father. You see, the cold ones are the natural enemies of the wolf\u2014 well, not the wolf really, but the wolves that turn into men, like our ancestors. You would call them werewolves.\" \"Werewolves have enemies?\" \"Only one.\" There was something stuck in my throat, choking me. I tried to swallow it down, but it was lodged there, un-moving. I tried to spit it out. \"Werewolf,\" I gasped. Yes, that was the word that I was choking on. The whole world lurched, tilting the wrong way on its axis. What kind of a place was this? Could a world really exist where ancient legends went wandering around the borders of tiny, insignificant towns, facing down mythical monsters? Did this mean every impossible fairy tale was grounded somewhere in absolute truth? Was there anything sane or normal at all, or was everything just magic and ghost stories? I clutched my head in my hands, trying to keep it from exploding. A small, dry voice in the back of my mind asked me what the big deal was. Hadn't I already accepted the existence of vampires long ago\u2014and without all the hysterics that time? Exactly, I wanted to scream back at the voice. Wasn't one myth enough for anyone, enough for a lifetime? Besides, there'd never been one moment that I wasn't completely aware that Edward Cullen was above and beyond the ordinary. It wasn't such a surprise to find out what he was\u2014because he so obviously was something. But Jacob? Jacob, who was just Jacob, and nothing more than that? Jacob, my friend? Jacob, the only human I'd ever been able to relate to\u2026 And he wasn't even human. I fought the urge to scream again. What did this say about me? I knew the answer to that one. It said that there was something deeply wrong with me. Why else would my life be filled with characters from horror movies? Why else would I care so much about them that it would tear big chunks right out of my chest when they went off along their mythical ways? In my head, everything spun and shifted, rearranging so that things that had meant one thing before, now meant something else. There was no cult. There had never been a cult, never been a gang. No, it was much worse than that. It was a pack. A pack of five mind-blowingly gigantic, multihued werewolves that had stalked right past me in Edward's meadow\u2026 Suddenly, I was in a frantic hurry. I glanced at the clock\u2014it was way too early and I didn't care. I had to go to La Push now. I had to see Jacob so he could tell me that I hadn't lost my mind altogether. I pulled on the first clean clothes I could find, not bothering to be sure they matched, and took the stairs two at a time. I almost ran into Charlie as I skidded into the hallway, headed for the door. \"Where are you going?\" he asked, as surprised to see me as I was to see him. \"Do you know what time it is?\" \"Yeah. I have to go see Jacob.\" \"I thought the thing with Sam\u2014\" \"That doesn't matter, I have to talk to him right now.\" \"It's pretty early.\" He frowned when my expression didn't change. \"Don't you want breakfast?\" \"Not hungry.\" The words flew through my lips. He was blocking my path to the exit. I considered ducking around him and making a run for it, but I knew I would have to explain that to him later. \"I'll be back soon, okay?\" Charlie frowned. \"Straight to Jacob's house, right? No stops on the way?\" \"Of course not, where would I stop?\" My words were running together in my hurry. \"I don't know,\" he admitted. \"It's just\u2026 well, there's been another attack\u2014the wolves again. It was real close to the resort by the hot springs\u2014there's a witness this time. The victim was only a dozen yards from the road when he disappeared. His wife saw a huge gray wolf just a few minutes later, while she was searching for him, and ran for help.\" My stomach dropped like I'd hit a corkscrew on a roller coaster. \"A wolf attacked him?\" \"There's no sign of him\u2014just a little blood again.\" Charlie's face was pained. \"The rangers are going out armed, taking armed volunteers. There're a lot of hunters who are eager to be involved\u2014there's a reward being offered for wolf carcasses. That's going to mean a lot of firepower out there in the forest, and it worries me.\" He shook his head. \"When people get too excited, accidents happen\u2026\" \"They're going to shoot the wolves?\" My voice shot through three octaves. \"What else can we do? What's wrong?\" he asked, his tense eyes studying my face. I felt faint; I must be whiter than usual. \"You aren't turning into a tree-hugger on me, are you?\" I couldn't answer. If he hadn't been watching me, I would have put my head between my knees. I'd forgotten about the missing hikers, the bloody paw prints\u2026 I hadn't connected those facts to my first realization. \"Look, honey, don't let this scare you. Just stay in town or on the highway\u2014no stops\u2014okay?\" \"Okay,\" I repeated in a weak voice. \"I've got to go.\" I looked at him closely for the first time, and saw that he had his gun strapped to his waist and hiking boots on. \"You aren't going out there after the wolves, are you, Dad?\" \"I've got to help, Bells. People are disappearing.\" My voice shot up again, almost hysterical now. \"No! No, don't go. It's too dangerous!\" \"I've got to do my job, kid. Don't be such a pessimist\u2014I'll be fine.\" He turned for the door, and held it open. \"You leaving?\" I hesitated, my stomach still spinning in uncomfortable loops. What could I say to stop him? I was too dizzy to think of a solution. \"Bells?\" \"Maybe it's too early to go to La Push,\" I whispered. \"I agree,\" he said, and he stepped out into the rain, shutting the door behind him. As soon as he was out of sight, I dropped to the floor and put my head between my knees. Should I go after Charlie? What would I say? And what about Jacob? Jacob was my best friend; I needed to warn him. If he really was a\u2014I cringed and forced myself to think the word\u2014werewolf (and I knew it was true, I could feel it), then people would be shooting at him! I needed to tell him and his friends that people would try to kill them if they went running around like gigantic wolves. I needed to tell them to stop. They had to stop! Charlie was out there in the woods. Would they care about that? I wondered\u2026 Up until now, only strangers had disappeared. Did that mean anything, or was it just chance? I needed to believe that Jacob, at least, would care about that. Either way, I had to warn him. Or\u2026 did I? Jacob was my best friend, but was he a monster, too? A real one? A bad one? Should I warn him, if he and his friends were\u2026 were murderers! If they were out slaughtering innocent hikers in cold blood? If they were truly creatures from a horror movie in every sense, would it be wrong to protect them? It was inevitable that I would have to compare Jacob and his friends to the Cullens. I wrapped my arms around my chest, fighting the hole, while I thought of them. I didn't know anything about werewolves, clearly. I would have expected something closer to the movies\u2014big hairy half-men creatures or something\u2014if I'd expected anything at all. So I didn't know what made them hunt, whether hunger or thirst or just a desire to kill. It was hard to judge, not knowing that. But it couldn't be worse than what the Cullens endured in their quest to be good. I thought of Esme\u2014the tears started when I pictured her kind, lovely face\u2014and how, as motherly and loving as she was, she'd had to hold her nose, all ashamed, and run from me when I was bleeding. It couldn't be harder than that. I thought of Carlisle, the centuries upon centuries that he had struggled to teach himself to ignore blood, so that he could save lives as a doctor. Nothing could be harder than that. The werewolves had chosen a different path. Now, what should I choose?",

I got nosy, checking to make sure that Billy had taken him to a doctor. Billy said he had, but, for some reason I couldn't nail down, I didn't really believe him. I called again, several times a day, for the next two days, but no one was ever there. Saturday, I decided to go see him, invitation be damned. But the little red house was empty. This frightened me\u2014was Jacob so sick that he'd needed to go to the hospital? I stopped by the hospital on the way back home, but the nurse at the front desk told me neither Jacob or Billy had been in. I made Charlie call Harry Clearwater as soon as he got home from work. I waited, anxious, while Charlie chatted with his old friend; the conversation seemed to go on forever without Jacob even being mentioned. It seemed that Harry had been in the hospital . . some kind of tests for his heart. Charlie's forehead got all pinched together, but Harry joked with him, blowing it off, until Charlie was laughing again. Only then did Charlie ask about Jacob, and now his side of the conversation didn't give me much to work with, just a lot of hmms and yeahs. I drummed my fingers against the counter beside him until he put a hand over mine to stop me. Finally, Charlie hung up the phone and turned to me. \"Harry says there's been some trouble with the phone lines, and that's why you haven't been able to get through. Billy took Jake to the doc down there, and it looks like he has mono. He's real tired, and Billy said no visitors,\" he reported. \"No visitors?\" I demanded in disbelief. Charlie raised one eyebrow. \"Now don't you go making a pest of yourself, Bells. Billy knows what's best for Jake. He'll be up and around soon enough. Be patient.\" I didn't push it. Charlie was too worried about Harry. That was clearly the more important issue\u2014it wouldn't be right to bug him with my lesser concerns. Instead, I went straight upstairs and turned on my computer. I found a medical site online and typed \"mononucleosis\" into the search box. All I knew about mono was that you were supposed to get it from kissing, which was clearly not the case with Jake. I read through the symptoms quickly\u2014the fever he definitely had, but what about the rest of it? No horrible sore throat, no exhaustion, no headaches, at least not before he'd gone home from the movie; he'd said he felt \"fit as a fiddle.\" Did it really come on so fast? The article made it sound like the sore stuff showed up first.  I glared at the computer screen and wondered why, exactly, I was doing this. Why did I feel so\u2026 so suspicious, like I didn't believe Billy's story? Why would Billy lie to Harry? I was being silly, probably. I was just worried, and, to be honest, I was afraid of not being allowed to see Jacob\u2014that made me nervous. I skimmed through the rest of the article, looking for more information. I stopped when I got to the part about how mono could last more than a month. A month? My mouth fell open. But Billy couldn't enforce the no-visitors thing that long. Of course not. Jake would go crazy stuck in bed that long without anyone to talk to. What was Billy afraid of, anyway? The article said that a person with mono needed to avoid physical activity, but there was nothing about visitors. The disease wasn't very infectious. I'd give Billy a week, I decided, before I got pushy. A week was generous. A week was long. By Wednesday, I was sure I wasn't going to live till Saturday. When I'd decided to leave Billy and Jacob alone for a week, I hadn't really believed that Jacob would go along with Billy's rule. Every day when I got home from school, I ran to the phone to check for messages. There never were any. I cheated three times by trying to call him, but the phone lines still weren't working. I was in the house much too much, and much too alone. Without Jacob, and my\u00a0 adrenaline and my distractions, everything I'd been repressing started creeping up on me. The dreams got hard again. I could no longer see the end coming. Just the horrible nothingness\u2014half the time in the forest, half the time in the empty fern sea where the white house no longer existed. Sometimes Sam Uley was there in the forest, watching me again. I paid him no attention\u2014there was no comfort in his presence; it made me feel no less alone. It didn't stop me from screaming myself awake, night after night. The hole in my chest was worse than ever. I'd thought that I'd been getting it under control, but I found myself hunched over, day after day, clutching my sides together and gasping for air. I wasn't handling alone well. I was relieved beyond measure the morning I woke up\u2014screaming, of course\u2014and remembered that it was Saturday. Today I could call Jacob. And if the phone lines still weren't working, then I was going to La Push. One way or another, today would be better than the last lonely week. I dialed, and then waited without high expectations. It caught me off guard when Billy answered on the second ring. \"Hello?\" \"Oh, hey, the phone is working again! Hi, Billy. It's Bella. I was just calling to see how Jacob is doing. Is he up for visitors yet? I was thinking about dropping by\u2014\" \"I'm sorry, Bella,\" Billy interrupted, and I wondered if he were watching TV; he sounded distracted.  \"He's not in.\" \"Oh.\" It took me a second. \"So he's feeling better then?\" \"Yeah,\" Billy hesitated for an instant too long. \"Turns out it wasn't mono after all. Just some other virus.\" \"Oh. So\u2026 where is he?\" \"He's giving some friends a ride up to Port Angeles\u2014I think they were going to catch a double feature or something. He's gone for the whole day.\" \"Well, that's a relief. I've been so worried. I'm glad he felt good enough to get out.\" My voice sounded horribly phony as I babbled on. Jacob was better, but not well enough to call me. He was out with friends. I was sitting home, missing him more every hour. I was lonely, worried, bored\u2026 perforated\u2014and now also desolate as I realized that the week apart had not had the same effect on him. \"Is there anything in particular you wanted?\" Billy asked politely. \"No, not really.\" \"Well, I'll tell him that you called,\" Billy promised. \"Bye, Bella.\" \"Bye,\" I replied, but he'd already hung up. I stood for a moment with the phone still in my hand. Jacob must have changed his mind, just like I'd feared. He was going to take my advice and not waste any more time on someone who couldn't return his feelings. I felt the blood run out of my face. \"Something wrong?\" Charlie asked as he came down the stairs. \"No,\" I lied, hanging up the phone. \"Billy says Jacob is feeling better. It wasn't mono. So that's good.\" \"Is he coming here, or are you going there?\" Charlie asked absentmindedly as he started poking through the fridge. \"Neither,\" I admitted. \"He's going out with some other friends.\" The tone of my voice finally caught Charlie's attention. He looked up at me with sudden alarm, his hands frozen around a package of cheese slices. \"Isn't it a little early for lunch?\" I asked as lightly as I could manage, trying to distract him. \"No, I'm just packing something to take out to the river\u2026\" \"Oh, fishing today?\" \"Well, Harry called\u2026 and it's not raining.\" He was creating a stack of food on the counter as he spoke. Suddenly he looked up again as if he'd just realized something. \"Say, did you want me to stay with you, since Jake's out?\" \"That's okay, Dad,\" I said, working to sound indifferent. \"The fish bite better when the weather's nice.\" He stared at me, indecision clear on his face. I knew that he was worrying, afraid to leave me alone, in case I got \"mopey\" again. \"Seriously, Dad. I think I'll call Jessica,\" I fibbed quickly. I'd rather be alone than have him watching me all day. \"We have a Calculus test to study for. I could use her help.\" That part was true. But I'd have to make do without it. \"That's a good idea. You've been spending so much time with Jacob, your other friends are going to think you've forgotten them.\" I smiled and nodded as if I cared what my other friends thought. Charlie started to turn, but then spun back with a worried expression. \"Hey, you'll study here or at Jess's, right?\" \"Sure, where else?\" \"Well, it's just that I want you to be careful to stay out of the woods, like I told you before.\" It took me a minute to understand, distracted as I was. \"More bear trouble?\" Charlie nodded, frowning. \"We've got a missing hiker\u2014the rangers found his camp early this morning, but no sign of him. There were some really big animal prints\u2026 of course those could have come later, smelling the food\u2026 Anyway, they're setting traps for it now.\" \"Oh,\" I said vaguely. I wasn't really listening to his warnings; I was much more upset by the situation with Jacob than by the possibility of being eaten by a bear. I was glad that Charlie was in a hurry. He didn't wait for me to call Jessica, so I didn't have to put on that charade. I went through the motions of gathering my school-books on the kitchen table to pack them in my bag; that was probably too much, and if he hadn't been eager to hit the holes, it might have made him suspicious. I was so busy looking busy that the ferociously empty day ahead didn't really crash down on me until after I'd watched him drive away. It only took about two minutes of staring at the silent kitchen phone to decide that I wasn't staying home today. I considered my options. I wasn't going to call Jessica. As far as I could tell, Jessica had crossed over to the dark side. I could drive to La Push and get my motorcycle\u2014an appealing thought but for one minor problem: who was going to drive me to the emergency room if I needed it afterward? Or\u2026 I already had our map and compass in the truck. I was pretty sure I understood the process well enough by now that I wouldn't get lost. Maybe I could eliminate two lines today, putting us ahead of schedule for whenever Jacob decided to honor me with his presence again. I refused to think about how long that might be. Or if it was going to be never. I felt a brief twinge of guilt as I realized how Charlie would feel about this, but I ignored it. I just couldn't stay in the house again today. A few minutes later I was on the familiar dirt road that led to nowhere in particular. I had the windows rolled down and I drove as fast as was healthy for my truck, trying to enjoy the wind against my face. It was cloudy, but almost dry\u2014a very nice day, for Forks. Getting started took me longer than it would have taken Jacob. After I parked in the usual spot, I had to spend a good fifteen minutes studying the little needle on the compass face and the markings on the now worn map. When I was reasonably certain that I was following the right line of the web, I set off into the woods. The forest was full of life today, all the little creatures enjoying the momentary dryness. Somehow, though, even with the birds chirping and cawing, the insects buzzing noisily around my head, and the occasional scurry of the field mice through the shrubs, the forest seemed creepier today; it reminded me of my most recent nightmare. I knew it was just because I was alone, missing Jacob's carefree whistle and the sound of another pair of feet squishing across the damp ground. The sense of unease grew stronger the deeper I got into the trees. Breathing started to get more difficult\u2014not because of exertion, but because I was having trouble with the stupid hole in my chest again. I kept my arms tight around my torso and tried to banish the ache from my thoughts. I almost turned around, but I hated to waste the effort I'd already expended. The rhythm of my footsteps started to numb my mind and my pain as I trudged on. My breathing evened out eventually, and I was glad I hadn't quit. I was getting better at this bushwhacking thing; I could tell I was faster. I didn't realize quite how much more efficiently I was moving. I thought I'd covered maybe four miles, and I wasn't even starting to look around for it yet. And then, with an abruptness that disoriented me, I stepped through a low arch made by two vine maples\u2014pushing past the chest-high ferns\u2014into the meadow. It was the same place, of that I was instantly sure. I'd never seen another clearing so symmetrical. It was as perfectly round as if someone had intentionally created the flawless circle, tearing out the trees but leaving no evidence of that violence in the waving grass. To the east, I could hear the stream bubbling quietly. The place wasn't nearly so stunning without the sunlight, but it was still very beautiful and serene. It was the wrong season for wildflowers; the ground was thick with tall grass that swayed in the light breeze like ripples across a lake. It was the same place\u2026 but it didn't hold what I had been searching for. The disappointment was nearly as instantaneous as the recognition. I sank down right where I was, kneeling there at the edge of the clearing, beginning to gasp. What was the point of going any farther? Nothing lingered here. Nothing more than the memories that I could have called back whenever I wanted to, if I was ever willing to endure the corresponding pain\u2014the pain that had me now, had me cold. There was nothing special about this place without him. I wasn't exactly sure what I'd hoped to feel here, but the meadow was empty of atmosphere, empty of everything, just like everywhere else. Just like my nightmares. My head swirled dizzily. At least I'd come alone. I felt a rush of thankfulness as I realized that. If I'd discovered the meadow with Jacob\u2026 well, there was no way I could have disguised the abyss I was plunging into now. How could I have explained the way I was fracturing into pieces, the way I had to curl into a ball to keep the empty hole from tearing me apart? It was so much better that I didn't have an audience. And I wouldn't have to explain to anyone why I was in such a hurry to leave, either. Jacob would have assumed, after going to so much trouble to locate the stupid place, I would want to spend more than a few seconds here. But I was already trying to find the strength to get to my feet again, forcing myself out of the ball so that I could escape. There was too much pain in this empty place to bear\u2014I would crawl away if I had to. How lucky that I was alone! Alone. I repeated the word with grim satisfaction as I wrenched myself to my feet despite the pain. At precisely that moment, a figure stepped out from the trees to the north, some thirty paces away. A dizzying array of emotions shot through me in a second. The first was surprise; I was far from any trail here, and I didn't expect company. Then, as my eyes focused on the motionless figure, seeing the utter stillness, the pallid skin, a rush of piercing hope rocked through me. I suppressed it <em>viciously</em>, fighting against the equally sharp lash of agony as my eyes continued to the face beneath the black hair, the face that wasn't the one I wanted to see. Next was fear; this was not the face I grieved for, but it was close enough for me to know that the man facing me was no stray hiker. And finally, in the end, recognition. \"Laurent!\" I cried in surprised pleasure. It was an irrational response. I probably should have stopped at fear. Laurent had been one of James's coven when we'd first met. He hadn't been involved with the hunt that followed\u2014the hunt where I was the quarry\u2014but that was only because he was afraid; I was protected by a bigger coven than his own. It would have been different if that wasn't the case\u2014he'd had no compunctions, at the time, against making a meal of me. Of course, he must have changed, because he'd gone to Alaska to live with the other civilized coven there, the other family that refused to drink human blood for ethical\u00a0 reasons. The other family like\u2026 but I couldn't let myself think the name. Yes, fear would have made more sense, but all I felt was an overwhelming satisfaction. The meadow was a magic place again. A darker magic than I'd expected, to be sure, but magic all the same. Here was the connection I'd sought. The proof, however remote, that\u2014somewhere in the same world where I lived\u2014 he did exist. It was impossible how exactly the same Laurent looked. I suppose it was very silly and human to expect some kind of change in the last year. But there was something\u2026 I couldn't quite put my finger on it. \"Bella?\" he asked, looking more astonished than I felt. \"You remember.\" I smiled. It was ridiculous that I should be so elated because a vampire knew my name. He grinned. \"I didn't expect to see you here.\" He strolled toward me, his expression bemused. \"Isn't it the other way around? I do live here. I thought you'd gone to Alaska.\" He stopped about ten paces away, cocking his head to the side. His face was the most beautiful face I'd seen in what felt like an eternity. I studied his features with a strangely greedy sense of release. Here was someone I didn't have to pretend for\u2014someone who already knew everything I could never say. \"You're right,\" he agreed. \"I did go to Alaska. Still, I didn't expect\u2026 When I found the Cullen place empty, I thought they'd moved on.\" \"Oh.\" I bit my lip as the name set the raw edges of my wound throbbing. It took me a second to compose myself. Laurent waited with curious eyes. \"They did move on,\" I finally managed to tell him. \"Hmm,\" he murmured. \"I'm surprised they left you behind. Weren't you sort of a pet of theirs?\" His eyes were innocent of any intended offense. I smiled wryly. \"Something like that.\" \"Hmm,\" he said, thoughtful again. At that precise moment, I realized why he looked the same\u2014too much the same. After Carlisle told us that Laurent had stayed with Tanya's family, I'd begun to picture him, on the rare occasions that I thought of him at all, with the same golden eyes that the\u2026 Cullens\u2014I forced the name out, wincing\u2014had. That all good vampires had. I took an involuntary step back, and his curious, dark red eyes followed the movement. \"Do they visit often?\" he asked, still casual, but his weight shifted toward me. \"Lie,\" the beautiful velvet voice whispered anxiously from my memory. I started at the sound of his voice, but it should not have surprised me. Was I not in the worst danger imaginable? The motorcycle was safe as kittens next to this. I did what the voice said to do. \"Now and again.\" I tried to make my voice light, relaxed. \"The time seems longer to me, I imagine. You know how they get distracted\u2026\" I was beginning to babble. I had to work to shut myself up. \"Hmm,\" he said again. \"The house smelled like it had been vacant for a while\u2026\" \"You must lie better than that, Bella,\" the voice urged. I tried. \"I'll have to mention to Carlisle that you stopped by. He'll be sorry they missed your visit.\" I pretended to deliberate for a second. \"But I probably shouldn't mention it to\u2026 Edward, I suppose\u2014\" I barely managed to say his name, and it twisted my expression on the way out, ruining my bluff \"\u2014he has such a temper\u2026 well, I'm sure you remember. He's still touchy about the whole James thing.\" I rolled my eyes and waved one hand dismissively, like it was all ancient history, but there was an edge of hysteria to my voice. I wondered if he would recognize what it was. \"Is he really?\" Laurent asked pleasantly\u2026 skeptically. I kept my reply short, so that my voice wouldn't betray my panic. \"Mm-hmm.\" Laurent took a casual step to the side, gazing around at the little meadow. I didn't miss that the step brought him closer to me. In my head, the voice responded with a low snarl. \"So how are things working out in Denali? Carlisle said you were staying with Tanya?\" My voice was too high. The question made him pause. \"I like Tanya very much,\" he mused. \"And her sister Irina even more\u2026 I've never stayed in one place for so long before, and I enjoy the advantages, the novelty of it. But, the restrictions are difficult\u2026 I'm surprised that any of them can keep it up for long.\" He smiled at me conspiratorially. \"Sometimes I cheat.\" I couldn't swallow. My foot started to ease back, but I froze when his red eyes flickered down to catch the movement. \"Oh,\" I said in a faint voice. \"Jasper has problems with that, too.\" \"Don't move,\" the voice whispered. I tried to do what he instructed. It was hard; the instinct to take flight was nearly uncontrollable. \"Really?\" Laurent seemed interested. \"Is that why they left?\" \"No,\" I answered honestly. \"Jasper is more careful at home.\" \"Yes,\" Laurent agreed. \"I am, too.\" The step forward he took now was quite deliberate. \"Did Victoria ever find you?\" I asked, breathless, desperate to distract him. It was the first question that popped into my head, and I regretted it as soon as the words were spoken. Victoria\u2014who had hunted me with James, and then disappeared\u2014was not someone I wanted to think of at this particular moment. But the question did stop him. \"Yes,\" he said, hesitating on that step. \"I actually came here as a favor to her.\" He made a face. \"She won't be happy about this.\" \"About what?\" I said eagerly, inviting him to continue. He was glaring into the trees, away from me. I took advantage of his diversion, taking a furtive step back. He looked back at me and smiled\u2014the expression made him look like a black-haired angel. \"About me killing you,\" he answered in a seductive purr. I staggered back another step. The frantic growling in my head made it hard to hear. \"She wanted to save that part for herself,\" he went on blithely. \"She's sort of\u2026 put out with you, Bella.\" \"Me?\" I squeaked. He shook his head and chuckled. \"I know, it seems a little backward to me, too. But James was her mate, and your Edward killed him.\" Even here, on the point of death, his name tore against my unhealed wounds like a serrated edge. Laurent was oblivious to my reaction. \"She thought it more appropriate to kill you than Edward\u2014fair turnabout, mate for mate. She asked me to get the lay of the land for her, so to speak. I didn't imagine you would be so easy to get to. So maybe her plan was flawed\u2014apparently it wouldn't be the revenge she imagined, since you must not mean very much to him if he left you here unprotected.\" Another blow, another tear through my chest. Laurent's weight shifted slightly, and I stumbled another step back. He frowned. \"I suppose she'll be angry, all the same.\" \"Then why not wait for her?\" I choked out. A mischievous grin rearranged his features. \"Well, you've caught me at a bad time, Bella. I didn't come to this place on Victoria's mission\u2014I was hunting. I'm quite thirsty, and you do smell\u2026 simply mouthwatering.\" Laurent looked at me with approval, as if he meant it as a compliment. \"Threaten him,\" the beautiful delusion ordered, his voice distorted with dread. \"He'll know it was you,\" I whispered obediently. \"You won't get away with this.\" \"And why not?\" Laurent's smile widened. He gazed around the small opening in the trees. \"The scent will wash away with the next rain. No one will find your body\u2014you'll simply go missing, like so many, many other humans. There's no reason for Edward to think of me, if he cares enough to investigate. This is nothing personal, let me assure you, Bella. Just thirst.\" \"Beg,\" my hallucination begged. \"Please,\" I gasped. Laurent shook his head, his face kind. \"Look at it this way, Bella. You're very lucky I was the one to find you.\" \"Am I?\" I mouthed, faltering another step back. Laurent followed, lithe and graceful. \"Yes,\" he assured me. \"I'll be very quick. You won't feel a thing, I promise. Oh, I'll lie to Victoria about that later, naturally, just to placate her. But if you knew what she had planned for you, Bella\u2026\" He shook his head with a slow movement, almost as if in disgust. \"I swear you'd be thanking me for this.\" I stared at him in horror. He sniffed at the breeze that blew threads of my hair in his direction. \"Mouthwatering,\" he repeated, inhaling deeply. I tensed for the spring, my eyes squinting as I cringed away, and the sound of Edward's furious roar echoed distantly in the back of my head. His name burst through all the walls I'd built to contain it. Edward, Edward, Edward. I was going to die. It shouldn't matter if I thought of him now. Edward, I love you. Through my narrowed eyes, I watched as Laurent paused in the act of inhaling and whipped his head abruptly to the left. I was afraid to look away from him, to follow his glance, though he hardly needed a distraction or any other trick to overpower me. I was too amazed to feel relief when he started slowly backing away from me. \"I don't believe it,\" he said, his voice so low that I barely heard it. I had to look then. My eyes scanned the meadow, searching for the interruption that had extended my life by a few seconds. At first I saw nothing, and my gaze flickered back to Laurent. He was retreating more quickly now, his eyes boring into the forest. Then I saw it; a huge black shape eased out of the trees, quiet as a shadow, and stalked deliberately toward the vampire. It was enormous\u2014as tall as a horse, but thicker, much more muscular. The long muzzle grimaced, revealing a line of dagger-like incisors. A grisly snarl rolled out from between the teeth, rumbling across the clearing like a prolonged crack of thunder. The bear. Only, it wasn't a bear at all. Still, this gigantic black monster had to be the creature causing all the alarm. From a distance, anyone would assume it was a bear. What else could be so vast, so powerfully built? I wished I were lucky enough to see it from a distance. Instead, it padded silently through the grass a mere ten feet from where I stood. \"Don't move an inch,\" Edward's voice whispered. I stared at the monstrous creature, my mind boggling as I tried to put a name to it. There was a distinctly canine cast to the shape of it, the way it moved. I could only think of one possibility, locked in horror as I was. Yet I'd never imagined that a wolf could get so big. Another growl rumbled in its throat, and I shuddered away from the sound. Laurent was backing toward the edge of the trees, and, under the freezing terror,\u00a0 confusion swept through me. Why was Laurent retreating? Granted, the wolf was monstrous in size, but it was just an animal. What reason would a vampire have for fearing an animal? And Laurent was afraid. His eyes were wide with horror, just like mine. As if in answer to my question, suddenly the mammoth wolf was not alone. Flanking it on either side, another two gigantic beasts prowled silently into the meadow. One was a deep gray, the other brown, neither one quite as tall as the first. The gray wolf came through the trees only a few feet from me, its eyes locked on Laurent. Before I could even react, two more wolves followed, lined up in a V, like geese flying south. Which meant that the rusty brown monster that shrugged through the brush last was close enough for me to touch. I gave an involuntary gasp and jumped back\u2014which was the stupidest thing I could have done. I froze again, waiting for the wolves to turn on me, the much weaker of the available prey. I wished briefly that Laurent would get on with it and crush the wolf pack\u2014it should be so simple for him. I guessed that, between the two choices before me, being eaten by wolves was almost certainly the worse option. The wolf closest to me, the reddish brown one, turned its head slightly at the sound of my gasp. The wolf's eyes were dark, nearly black. It gazed at me for a fraction of a second, the deep eyes seeming too intelligent for a wild animal. As it stared at me, I suddenly thought of Jacob\u2014again, with gratitude. At least I'd come here alone, to this fairytale meadow filled with dark monsters. At least Jacob wasn't going to die, too. At least I wouldn't have his death on my hands. Then another low growl from the leader caused the russet wolf to whip his head around, back toward Laurent. Laurent was staring at the pack of monster wolves with unconcealed shock and fear. The first I could understand. But I was stunned when, without warning, he spun and disappeared into the trees. He ran away. The wolves were after him in a second, sprinting across the open grass with a few powerful bounds, snarling and snapping so loudly that my hands flew up instinctively to cover my ears. The sound faded with surprising swiftness once they disappeared into the woods. And then I was alone again. My knees buckled under me, and I fell onto my hands, sobs building in my throat. I knew I needed to leave, and leave now. How long would the wolves chase Laurent before they doubled back for me? Or would Laurent turn on them? Would he be the one that came looking? I couldn't move at first, though; my arms and legs were shaking, and I didn't know how to get back to my feet. My mind couldn't move past the fear, the horror or the confusion. I didn't understand what I'd just witnessed. A vampire should not have run from overgrown dogs like that. What good would their teeth be against his granite skin? And the wolves should have given Laurent a wide berth. Even if their extraordinary size had taught them to fear nothing, it still made no sense that they would pursue him. I doubted his icy marble skin would smell anything like food. Why would they pass up something warm-blooded and weak like me to chase after Laurent? I couldn't make it add up. A cold breeze whipped through the meadow, swaying the grass like something was moving through it. I scrambled to my feet, backing away even though the wind brushed harmlessly past me. Stumbling in panic, I turned and ran headlong into the trees. The next few hours were agony. It took me three times as long to escape the trees as it had to get to the meadow. At first I paid no attention to where I was headed, focused only on what I was running from By the time I collected myself enough to remember the compass, I was deep in the unfamiliar and menacing forest. My hands were shaking so violently that I had to set the compass on the muddy ground to be able to read it. Every few minutes I would stop to put the compass down and check that I was still heading northwest, hearing\u2014when the sounds weren't hidden behind the frantic squelching of my footsteps\u2014the quiet whisper of unseen things moving in the leaves. The call of a jaybird made me leap back and fall into a thick stand of young spruce, scraping up my arms and tangling my hair with sap. The sudden rush of a squirrel up a hemlock made me scream so loud it hurt my own ears. At last there was a break in the trees ahead. I came out onto the empty road a mile or so south of where I'd left the truck. Exhausted as I was, I jogged up the lane until I found it. By the time I pulled myself into the cab, I was sobbing again. I fiercely shoved down both stiff locks before I dug my keys out of my pocket. The roar of the engine was comforting and sane. It helped me control the tears as I sped as fast as my truck would allow toward the main highway. I was calmer, but still a mess when I got home. Charlie's cruiser was in the driveway\u2014I hadn't realized how late it was. The sky was already dusky. \"Bella?\" Charlie asked when I slammed the front door behind me and hastily turned the locks.  \"Yeah, it's me.\" My voice was unsteady. \"Where have you been?\" he thundered, appearing through the kitchen doorway with an ominous expression. I hesitated. He'd probably called the Stanleys. I'd better stick to the truth. \"I was hiking,\" I admitted. His eyes were tight. \"What happened to going to Jessica's?\" \"I didn't feel like Calculus today.\" Charlie folded his arms across his chest. \"I thought I asked you to stay out of the forest.\" \"Yeah, I know. Don't worry, I won't do it again.\" I shuddered. Charlie seemed to really look at me for the first time. I remembered that I had spent some time on the forest floor today; I must be a mess. \"What happened?\" Charlie demanded. Again, I decided that the truth, or part of it anyway, was the best option. I was too shaken to pretend that I'd spent an uneventful day with the flora and fauna. \"I saw the bear.\" I tried to say it calmly, but my voice was high and shaky. \"It's not a bear, though\u2014it's some kind of wolf. And there are five of them. A big black one, and gray, and reddish-brown\u2026\" Charlie's eyes grew round with horror. He strode quickly to me and grabbed the tops of my arms. \"Are you okay?\" My head bobbed in a weak nod. \"Tell me what happened.\" \"They didn't pay any attention to me. But after they were gone, I ran away and I fell down a lot.\" He let go of my shoulders and wrapped his arms around me. For a long moment, he didn't say anything. \"Wolves,\" he murmured. \"What?\" \"The rangers said the tracks were wrong for a bear\u2014but wolves just don't get that big\u2026\" \"These were huge.\" \"How many did you say you saw?\" \"Five.\" Charlie shook his head, frowning with anxiety, He finally spoke in a tone that allowed no argument. \"No more hiking.\" \"No problem,\" I promised fervently. .  Charlie called the station to report what I'd seen. I fudged a little bit about where exactly I'd seen the wolves\u2014claiming I'd been on the trail that led to the north. I didn't want my dad to know how deep I'd gone into the forest against his wishes, and, more importantly, I didn't want anyone wandering near where Laurent might be searching for me. The thought of it made me feel sick. \"Are you hungry?\" he asked me when he hung up the phone. I shook my head, though I must have been starving. I hadn't eaten all day. \"Just tired,\" I told him. I turned for the stairs. \"Hey,\" Charlie said, his voice suddenly suspicious again. \"Didn't you say Jacob was gone for the day?\" \"That's what Billy said,\" I told him, confused by his question. He studied my expression for a minute, and seemed satisfied with what he saw there. \"Huh.\" \"Why?\" I demanded. It sounded like he was implying that I'd been lying to him this morning. About something besides studying with Jessica. \"Well, it's just that when I went to pick up Harry, I saw Jacob out in front of the store down there with some of his friends. I waved hi, but he\u2026 well, I guess I don't know if he saw me. I think maybe he was arguing with his friends. He looked strange, like he was upset about something. And\u2026 different. It's like you can watch that kid growing! He gets bigger every time I see him.\" \"Billy said Jake and his friends were going up to Port Angeles to see some movies. They were probably just waiting for someone to meet them.\" \"Oh.\" Charlie nodded and headed for the kitchen. I stood in the hall, thinking about Jacob arguing with his friends. I wondered if he had confronted Embry about the situation with Sam. Maybe that was the reason he'd ditched me today\u2014if it meant he could sort things out with Embry, I was glad he had. I paused to check the locks again before I went to my room. It was a silly thing to do. What difference would a lock make to any of the monsters I'd seen this afternoon? I assumed the handle alone would stymie the wolves, not having opposable thumbs. And if Laurent came here\u2026 Or\u2026 Victoria. I lay down on my bed, but I was shaking too hard to hope for sleep. I curled into a cramped ball under my quilt, and faced the horrifying facts. There was nothing I could do. There were no precautions I could take. There was no place I could hide. There was no one who could help me. I realized, with a nauseous roll of my stomach, that the situation was worse than even that. Because all those facts applied to Charlie, too. My father, sleeping one room away from me, was just a hairsbreadth off the heart of the target that was centered on me. My scent would lead them here, whether I was here or not. The tremors rocked me until my teeth chattered. To calm myself, I fantasized the impossible: I imagined the big wolves catching up to Laurent in the woods and massacring the indestructible immortal the way they would any normal person. Despite the absurdity of such a vision, the idea comforted me. If the wolves got him, then he couldn't tell Victoria I was here all alone. If he didn't return, maybe she'd think the Cullens were still protecting me. If only the wolves could win such a fight\u2026 My good vampires were never coming back; how soothing it was to imagine that the other kind could also disappear. I squeezed my eyes tight together and waited for unconsciousness\u2014almost eager for my nightmare to start. Better that than the pale, beautiful face that smiled at me now from behind my lids. In my imagination, Victoria's eyes were black with thirst, bright with anticipation, and her lips curled back from her gleaming teeth in pleasure. Her red hair was brilliant as fire; it blew chaotically around her wild face. Laurent's words repeated in my head. If you knew what she had planned for you \u2026 I pressed my fist against my mouth to keep from screaming.",
