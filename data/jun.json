            "en": "Japan Is Fading       \n \nhttp://www.newsweek.com/id/212121/page/1 One thing the nation's next leaders don't talk about is growth. Japan is heading into a landmark election in a state of freefall. Stagnant since the early 1990s, Japan's economy fell off a cliff in the last quarter, dropping 15.2 percent in the worst collapse of any industrial nation in decades.  Automakers\u00e2\u20ac\u201dToyota, Nissan, and Honda, once the heart of the Japanese industrial miracle\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsaw exports fall 70 percent in April, and were forced to shutter factories to clear inventory. Since pocketbook issues decide elections, it's not surprising that Japanese voters appeared poised to toss out the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), only the second time it has lost power in half a century. Meanwhile, China is launching direct challenges to Japan's position as the leading economy in Asia. Beijing recently launched an official campaign to build a green car industry, a field in which Japan still holds a commanding lead. Some Japan watchers compare China's green car project to Sputnik, the Soviet satellite that trumped American preeminence in science and technology in the 1950s. Just as alarming, China has been making noises about replacing the dollar as the sole international reserve currency, and has begun conducting regional financing deals in Chinese yuan instead, a push Japanese officials see as a direct threat to the yen as well.  \"It brought home the fact that the yen is not used in this way by others,\" notes Yasuo Ota, an editorial writer for Nikkei. The worry grew in July, when top Chinese officials flew to Washington, D.C., to continue their high-level \"strategic dialogue\": \"That caused concern, because the Japanese feel that we need to be involved in any conversation about security in the region,\" notes Shinzo Kobori of the Institute for International Policy Studies in Tokyo. So Japan is preparing to usher in a new government against a backdrop of worry that the nation is already Asia's political and economic also-ran, prematurely playing No. 2 to China. It's all happened fast. When this decade opened, Japan's economy was still almost four times the size of China's, but in recent years China looked set to surpass Japan by 2010 or shortly thereafter.  Now, with China still growing at 8 percent a year and Japan shrinking, commentators in Japan have been forced to admit that the switch will likely come even sooner. \"It's nonsense for us to continue talking about competing with China [for sole leadership in Asia] when their economy will surpass ours by next year,\" says Kobori, echoing the sentiments of other academics, writers, intellectuals, and even younger politicians within Japan. There's a growing, reluctant consensus that Japan will have to find a new role. From the Meiji Restoration\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe great flowering of Japanese innovation and reform in the 1860s\u00e2\u20ac\u201duntil recently, Japan \"had basically one goal: catch up with the West and be accepted as a great power. They achieved that in the '80s, but they've never figured out what to do for an encore,\" says Columbia professor and Japan expert Gerald Curtis. \"Japan today is a tired country.\" The old model\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwork hard and save to finance exports to the West\u00e2\u20ac\u201dis clearly broken. (The other top developed export power, Germany, has also been particularly hard hit by the global recession, as all the rich consuming nations of the West enter what looks to be a long period of slow growth and weak demand.) With Asia emerging as \"the center of the global economy, its new growth engine, Japan now has to figure out how to put itself at the center of that center,\" says Curtis. The opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) clearly sees Japan as a regional Asian power, and no longer a nation tied only to the West. DPJ leader Yukio Hatoyama has denounced the global free-market consensus, of which Japan was once a happy member, blaming \"globalism\" and \"U.S.-led free-market fundamentalism\" for the current crisis.  His vision amounts to a retreat inward, beefing up \"fraternity\" at home with a stronger welfare state, and more generous pensions and child support, while refocusing Japan's trade and investment strategies on East Asia. Alarmingly, however, the DPJ manifesto did not even mention \"growth\" until it was attacked by the LDP, suggesting that the DPJ doesn't quite get its predicament. Maintaining Japan's comfortable standard of living won't be possible without growth. American and Japanese intellectuals have compared Japan's new position to Canada's, or Switzerland's\u00e2\u20ac\u201drich, content powers that have learned to thrive alongside giant neighbors. The problem, says MIT Japan expert Richard Samuels, is that it would be a painful \"deep dive\" for Japan to go the way of Canada, which has an economy more than three times smaller, and smoother relations with the U.S. than Japan has with China.  The Asian powers have a rough history dating to the Japanese occupation of China in World War II, and often competing interests in trade and security. Japan is still protected by the U.S. nuclear umbrella, now primarily against possible future threats from China. Others have suggested that a more fitting model could be found in France, the wealthy co-leader with Germany of a powerful regional bloc. Japan and China might play this role together in Asia. The DPJ has even proposed French-style child subsidies to boost the country's birthrate, which would revive some of the economic dynamism Japan has lost as a result of having the world's most rapidly aging population.  Of course, the EU started as the European Coal and Steel Community, a postwar French-German alliance to share resources; China and Japan are still fighting over offshore oil rights and atrocities from World War II. The huge gap in average yearly incomes\u00e2\u20ac\u201d$34,080 in Japan and $2,000 in China\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwill make it difficult for them to work together as regional leaders, the way Germany and France do. Yet the benefits of an aggressive regional strategy are clear\u00e2\u20ac\u201dFrance, for example, has boosted its per capita income by 42 percent since the formation of the European Union in 1993, and no one doubts that it has gained greatly by leveraging the common market. Japan could do the same. Goldman Sachs predicts that the major emerging markets, led by China and India, will overtake the combined GDP of the G7 by 2027, a decade faster than previously thought.  By 2010 China will account for an amazing 30 percent of global consumption growth, more than the G3 and double that of the U.S. The Japanese, who have hitherto focused more on economic ties to the U.S. and Europe, are slowly beginning to realize that they would do well to ride this train. Growth is imperative, whether the DPJ acknowledges it or not. Economists often talk about how the Japanese need to boost domestic consumption, which has been flat for a decade, to make up for falling exports. But the domestic market is shrinking. The population peaked in 2004 at 128 million, and is projected to fall to 90 million by 2055.  The ratio of working-age to elderly Japanese fell from 8:1 in 1975 to about 3:1 in 2005, and will probably shrivel to about 1.3:1 in 2055. This means \"there is no viable model for increasing domestic consumption [to the extent needed],\" says Kobori.  The Japanese are currently putting 5 percent of their GDP into fiscal stimulus, and still nothing is happening. America is putting 2 percent in, and is now in recovery. \"What we need is a new model based on more regional integration,\" says Kobori. \"If we can't find that model, we are in trouble.\" Japanese businesspeople are hunting for one: on a recent visit to top companies in Japan, Curtis found executives talking less about naiju (domestic demand) than about <em>jun</em>-naiju (pseudo\u00e2\u20ac\u201cdomestic demand), a new phrase that means demand in the home region of Asia.  \"The idea is to integrate Japan into the heart of this new and growing Asian 'domestic' market, not only by selling to middle-class Chinese and Southeast Asians, but also by increasing Japanese investment in Asian companies; further liberalizing import and export markets, particularly in very closed areas like agriculture; and working more closely with China and other less-developed countries in areas like the environment, technology, and energy,\" says Curtis. In recent years, trade flows to China in particular have increased rapidly; in 2000 exports to the U.S. from Japan were about five times those to China; now the figures are nearly equal (though it's important to note that most of what goes to China are high-tech components for assembly versus finished goods).  Flows could be further increased if Japan would dismantle trade barriers and encourage more export of, for example, expensive luxury agricultural products like its very high-quality rice to Asia's nouveau riche, while allowing penny-pinching Mrs. Watanabes at home to buy more cheap, mass-produced foods from China.  Ultimately, trade in finished goods will rise, too. Manufacturers are starting to focus more research and marketing dollars on Asian consumers rather than Western ones in order to boost regional exports of Japan's upscale cars and consumer goods. The DPJ platform calls for an increase in aid to develop Asia as a way of helping bolster those middle-class consumers. In other ways, Japan is still strikingly Western-oriented. It is typically one of the top four investors in China, yet it still sends nearly three times more of its direct investment in factories and companies to the United States.  Experts say Japan tends to pigeonhole China as a place for low-end outsourcing, and is particularly fearful of intellectual-property theft in China because relatively high-cost Japanese manufacturers lose everything if their ideas are stolen. Stronger protections against intellectual-property pirates could yield all kinds of collaboration, even a world-beating green car capital of the world run by Japan and China, Japan market analysts say. Closer ties to China require some semblance of trust. There are positive signs. DJP leaders have said they would not continue visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, a bone of contention because Japanese war criminals are buried there alongside regular World War II soldiers. And the two countries recently struck a deal to strengthen Asian currency reserves\u00e2\u20ac\u201dputting equal amounts of yen and yuan into the reserve pot, underscoring a joint commitment in Asia. Peter Petri, a senior fellow at the East-West Center in Honolulu, calls this deal \"a very important event\" that says \"we're in this together, and even though the future is that China will be the dominant economy, Japan has a lot to contribute, too.\" For Japan, Asian development must mean more than tighter economic relations with the Middle Kingdom. Japanese officials and companies are looking to strengthen ties with Australia, India, and Southeast Asia. The only high-profile Japanese corporate acquisition in Asia recently was Daiichi Sankyo's purchase of the Indian drugmaker Ranbaxy, and India has replaced China as the No. 1 destination for Japanese aid money. Japanese aid to ASEAN countries is growing, too.  \"The Japanese are increasingly going to invest in India, Vietnam, and Indonesia to balance the growth of China,\" says Michael Green, the Japan chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. He also notes that the Japanese lobbied hard to include India, Australia, and New Zealand in the East Asian summit, first held in 2005, in order to \"buffer Chinese influence.\" Tokyo's new focus on Asia could, conceivably, restore its image as a power in the world. To become \"the center of the center of global growth,\" as Curtis puts it, would make Japan more central to global diplomacy and politics as well. Closer ties to China could set up Japan as more of a buffer between the U.S. and China, and less of a protectorate of the United States. It could make Japan more of a major player in multilateral diplomacy, and less of a junior partner in a special relationship with the United States.  \"You can see Japan making a broader strategic outreach with new bilateral security agreements reached with Australia and India,\" and in the June meeting of defense ministers from the U.S., Japan, and South Korea, notes Green. But Japan has always been a one-dimensional economic power and, to regain global clout, it needs a return to real world-leading growth. That's not what Japan's next governors\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhether from the LDP or the DPJ\u00e2\u20ac\u201dare talking about. They dream of middle-power models, at most.",

            "en": "High Kick       High Kick! (literal translation: \"High Kick without Hesitation\", \"Unstoppable High Kick\") was a popular South Korean situation comedy revolving around the life of the Lee family, taking place in Seoul at the same time as the broadcast (Winter, 2006 - Summer, 2007). The title of the show \"High Kick!\" has several implications, one of which is the oft-depicted high kicks of Yoon-ho, one of the main characters. It was aired in South Korea from Monday to Friday. Due to its popularity, the show filmed more episodes than was initially planned. Many of the characters had starred in commercials and advertisements in Korea. Main characters Most characters use the actor's real name (with the exception of surnames). Lee Soon-jae (Lee Soon-jae) \u00a0 The head of the Lee family, he works alongside his daughter-in-law at his Korean medicine hospital. Being the oldest in the family, he can be harsh and strict toward his family members, and thinks only about himself. He always kicks or hits other members of the family; typical scenes are those in which he hits them in the head with a spoon during meals or kicks his oldest son Joon-ha's bottom when he farts. In several episodes, he chases other family members and even tries to hit them with a baseball bat. Due to this aggressive behavior, Soon-jae is often seen as the dictator of the Lee household and no one opposes what he says. In some episodes, other members complain in front of him, but always without success.  He falls in love with another woman but she moves to the US. He sends a letter to her, but misidentifies the address so it is sent to an African-American who apparently lived next door. He is obsessed with porn videos, and becomes nicknamed as \"Porn Soon-jae\". In episode 20, his family catches him watching porn, after which he runs away from home and wanders for a week. At the end of the show, he resigns his hospital and leaves everything to be handled by Hae-mi (Episode 164). According to the last episode (Episode 167), after his resignation, he visits Africa, and then after his return home he sleeps successively for 2 weeks, up to the last act in the show.  Nah Moon-hee (Nah Moon-hee)  Soon-jae's wife, she is incredibly strong and has an enormous appetite, which she passes on to Joon-ha. Despite her age, she does all of the cooking and cleaning, and looks after Joon (Min-yong's baby). Since Soon-jae and Hae-Mi often berate and insult her, she often has daydreams of them suffering. Like Min-Yong, she is annoyed by Hae-mi, and would do anything to embarrass her. She is a bit greedy and even merciless at times. Moon-hee is best friends with Gae-Sung Dek, and visits her often in prison.  Lee Joon-ha (Jeong <em>Jun</em>-ha)  Son of Soon-jae and Mun-hee. A huge strong man with an enormous appetite, nicknamed as the \"Lord of Gluttony\". Laid off from the company he was working, he spends his time at home as an unsuccessful investor and depends on the earnings of his wife, who is the good doctor at his father's hospital. Some episodes show him with a new job, but most of the time he ends up losing it because of his incompetence or bad luck. At home, he is often shown snoring loudly while sleeping, eating, or watching TV, and due to his idle days, he is often scolded by his father. He has a big appetite and great strength, which are inherited from his mother. Due to their enormous appetites, Joon-ha and Moon-hee enjoy eating big meals together.  Soon-jae berates Moon-hee and Joon-ha by referring to them as \"The Fat Mother and Son\". He also has a habit of frequently farting. If in deep trouble, Joon-ha runs away from Soon-jae . Though he does not have much authority among the family, he deeply loves his wife and often becomes the only one to understand his son Yoon-ho's feelings. Later, when he works at a consulting firm, he becomes a success and is able to earn a fortune. Yet, he still remains the lazy father at home. In some episodes, drunk Joon-ha behaves like an unstoppable beast, yelling for food, and in general no one but Hae-mi can control him in such state. Soon-jae gives Joon-ha several nicknames: Hulk, King Kong, animal, pig, boar, bear, gorilla and monster . These nicknames are based on Joon-ha's traits, such as laziness, stupidity, great strength and appetite.  Lee Min-yong (Choi Min-yong)  A late-born son of Soon-jae and Moon-hee, he works as a P. E. teacher at a high-school where his nephews attend. Min-yong is the opposite of Joon-ha in many terms. Min-yong is a slim man with straight hair, less lazy, more handsome, and employed, but has the nasty attitude toward Soon-jae, while Joon-ha is more like Moon-hee; a plump man with curly hair, very lazy, dumb looking, overweight, and unemployed, but more sympathetic than Min-yong. Returning to his parents house after a short-lived marriage with Shin Ji, he lives in a storeroom upstairs, which is connected with the main house with a firemen's pole. Though Min-yong can be sympathetic, at school he is unpopular with students for his strict attitude; normally shown with him giving physical punishment like Soon-jae and carrying a club with him all the time.  Min-yong gets in many silly quarrels with Hae-mi and would do anything to embarrass her in public. Though divorced, he cannot completely break up with Shin Ji because of their baby and the lingering feelings for each other. Min-yong dates Seo Min-jeong, a fellow school teacher, but his close relationship with the ex-wife hurts her. Later Shin Ji tries to accept that Min-yong loves Min-jeong when the two engage to get married. He becomes the first one to find dead body of Kang Yoo-mi's father outside her house (Episode 131). Later on, he and Min-Jeong breaks off because of Shinji's lingering love for Min-yong and Min-Jeong's opposing family. At the end of the show, Min-yong and Shinji seem to have gotten closer.  Park Hae-mi (Park Hae-mi)  The wife of Lee Joon-ha. A doctor that works with Lee Soon-jae. Hae-mi was in love with another man before her marriage. Accepting Joon-ha's proposal was to rival the lover who had dumped her, which Joon-ha finds out in one of the episodes. She gave financial support to Soon-jae's hospital when it was near the brink of closing down, and much more popular than Soon-jae as a doctor. She loves opera and singing and known for her catch phrase, \"Okay!\", but Min-yong and Moon-hee are very annoyed by them. She also does not approve of Shin Ji, and her battle against these three is one of the typical topics of the show. Affectionate mother but often seems to favor Min-ho over her younger son Yoon-ho.  \u00a0Yet sometimes her affection toward her younger son is shown as well, such as in the episode of the Mother's day (Episode 123) or the last episode, in which she becomes the only one supporting his idea of taking a year off from the high-school for traveling the country. She is also good friends with Kang Yoo-mi's mother. A few episodes of Hae-mi being drunk are shown; in one of them Min-yong attempts to take pictures of her being drunk and release them to the public (Episode 98), and in another, Min-ho catches her dancing and singing with a stranger who has a witch-like voice and gets scared (Episode 148).  Lee Min-ho (Kim Hye-seong)  The eldest son of Lee Joon-ha and Park Hae-mi. Being very bright, but physically small and soft, he is often portrayed as a \"mama's boy,\" and always quarreling with his younger brother Yoon-ho, who is in the same class at the school. An easy target to bully due to his weak appearance, while Yoon-ho would simply fight back no matter the odds. The contrast between the two brothers is one of the main themes of the show. At school he sits in the very front of the classroom along with Kim Bum, who has been best friends with him for a long time, and they embrace each other in a sign of friendship, which makes Yoon-ho think they are in gay love.  The brothers can be in a collaborative relationship, however, such as when they manipulate Soon-jae's weak knowledge of electronics to get him to buy a new computer (Episode 25). He also becomes the boyfriend of Kang Yoo-mi, but has to suffer many separations due to her mysterious disappearances, she killed the murderer of her parents (Episode 152). He also figures out Yoo-mi is 21 before she leaves, but says he doesn't care if she's 21 or not the brightest in her class. In the last episode, Min-ho spends the summer vacation at Jeju-do with his parents and Bum, and glimpses Yoo-mi there. This also becomes the last time he sees Bum before his departure to the US.  Lee Yoon-ho (Jeong Il-woo)  The youngest son of Lee Joon-ha and Park Hae-mi. He is a tall, strong, and handsome boy known for his high kick. He also narrates the story of the show. He is also a motorcycle maniac. He is very popular among the girls in his school, though his grade is low and he sometimes demonstrates his utter ignorance. In one episode disclosed, Yoon-ho was as bright as Min-ho in his childhood, but after riding on the back of motorcycle of a friend of Joon-ha's, he became completely absorbed in fighting and motorcycles; Joon-ha is blamed by Hae-mi for Yoon-ho's bad grades and delinquent behavior. As the odd one out in the family, Yoon-ho is often misunderstood and sometimes blamed for things he did not do.  In school, Yoon-ho sits in the very back corner, dozing off or reading comic books. He is even seen skipping class, often hanging out in the rooftop, sleeping or listening to music. But he has a secret crush on his teacher, Min-jeong, who is always trying to get him out of trouble, and often displays his kindness to her, which is usually masked by his unfriendliness. When he learns Min-jeong and Min-yong are engaged, he pleads with her not to get married. In the last episode (Episode 167), he appears taking a year off from school and traveling around the country on his motorcycle. At the end of the show, he miraculously meets his teacher Min-jeong, who resigned the school and disappeared from Seoul without any greetings the year before.  Shin Ji a. k. a. Shin Bong Hee (Shin Ji)  The ex-wife of Lee Min-yong and the mother of Joon. Loves music, and is trying to get a job at a music industry, singing CF songs and taking auditions for musicals. She asked for a divorce from Min-yong, wishing to study abroad in Moscow, but came back to Korea in short time. Min-yong and Shin Ji take turns in taking care of Joon, though Joon seems to be in the Lee household most of the time presumable due to Shin Ji's busy schedule. She still has feelings for her ex-husband and same as him, she hates Hae-mi as they both competed against each other since before her marriage. Roommate of Seo Min-jeong. It is revealed that Shin Ji was friends with Min-jeong since high school though things were different then. \u00a0 Shin Ji had her two front teeth sticking out from her mouth like a rabbit. Shin Ji later went through an operation to rid of the horrid teeth. Her well-known phrase is \"Sang you!\" though it is supposed to be \"thank you.\" Near the end of the show, she can not face the engagement of Min-yong and Min-jeong and decides to move to Russia again, but the miserable state brings her to a traffic accident. Min-yong separates with Min-jeong for bringing Shin Ji back. In the final episode, it is disclosed that Min-yong and Shin Ji is keeping a good relationship and he even proposed her again, but she refused saying she wants to wait till he truly loves her again. Seo Min-jeong (Seo Min-jeong)  An English teacher at the high-school that Lee Min-yong teaches at, and the homeroom teacher of Min-ho, Yoon-ho, Bum, Chan Seong and Seung Hyun. She rented the apartment that Min-yong and Shin Ji used to live in, and lives there with Shin Ji after her return from the short and unsuccessful trip to study in Moscow. She always seems to end up with accidents mostly due to her clumsiness. She usually, trips, falls, or sometimes in one episode ran into a stopped car because she was offered a ride. She is very shy and if embarrassed she becomes very aggressive. She has no control over her students due to her natural friendliness and a lack of discipline. She has a deep crush on Min-yong and the two become a couple, although Min-jeong is often hurt by Min-yong's lack of romance and his close, friendly relationship with his ex-wife.  On episode 117, she described Min-yong as combination by the appearance of Brad Pitt and the clothing style of Leonardo DiCaprio. Later Min-yong's love towards Min-jeong grows and they get engaged. Shin Ji asks Min-yong what he would do if Min-jeong's parents do not accept this wedding and he replies then they will marry on their own. Her parents object at first then accept. However, in the near end of the show, she and Min-yong decide to break up for the sake of Shin Ji, who still has clinging feelings for Min-yong. Following the break up, Min-jeong resigns the school much to Yoon-ho's sorrow and moves to the country to work in an all-girls middle school.  Kim Bum (Kim Bum)  Lee Min-ho's best friend and appears staying at Lee's house all the time, even wishing to become the proper member of the family. The two boys are very close and care for each other. They are often embracing each other or riding a bike together like lovers. Usually, Yoon-ho doesn't like them hanging out together and think they are acting like a married couple. Bum once has a huge crush on Yoo-mi, Min-ho's girlfriend, but later comes to despise her after finding out she was just making use of him. Bum does anything he wishes in the Lee household from eating breakfast, lunch and dinner with them, sleeping in anyone's room and even taking showers and bubble baths occasionally. He even goes as far as sleeping for a few nights.  In one episode, it is disclosed that he has brought loads of his own stuff to the Lee's house, from videos to even his own clothes. Bum's house is rarely portrayed in the show, but according to Bum's mother, who also became a frequent visitor, their house is described as very quiet and boring. Bum also owns a puppy that he and Min-ho name it 'Bum-min' or \u201cMin-bum\u201d. Soon-jae describes the dog as a 'shitty dog' after Bum asked if Bum-min could have his own house in the Lee household (Episode 132). At the end of the show, Bum moves away to the US in the summer of 2008, much to the Lee family's surprise as he was like a member of the family. Sadly, Moon-hee is the only one to say farewell to Bum as the other family members were either busy or away (Soon-jae working in Africa, Hae-mi busy with work at hospital, Yoon-ho away travelling around the country etc.)  Kang Yoo-mi (Park Min-young)  Lee Min-ho's girlfriend. Very pretty but extremely poor at studies, always getting the lowest scores at school. She is also secretly three years older than her schoolmates, but only Kim Bum and Lee Min-yong, her homeroom teacher who doesn't care about that so much, know it. She is usually seen being punished by Min-yong for her misbehavior such as combing her hair in class. She has lied to Min-ho many times about what talents she has, but they keep a good relationship. However, her natural ability as a runner was disclosed in one episode, while running away from Min-yong, and she represented the high-school at a running competition. Soon-jae always calls Yoo-mi, \"Soo-mi\" by mistake, which upsets her. Later in the show she has to escape the city as mobsters are looking for her, and disappears from the screen. During the last several shows, she is once shown getting on a car at night, which explodes as soon as she turns the engine on, leading many watchers to think she died. However, at the last show, she is also shown luxuriously cruising on a yacht in Jeju-do.",
