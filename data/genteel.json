            "en": "Special: World Cup & Politics \u2013 When Sport And Society Mix     Goal.com's Ewan Macdonald looks at how the world's biggest football tournament and politics collide. For many, perhaps most, football is an escape.  It's a chance to lose oneself in entertainment and passion for ninety minutes on a weekend; to fraternise with like-minded fans; to celebrate your local pride in style.  Yet it's undeniable that for millions worldwide, football is simply more than that.  What happens on the pitch can collide quite dramatically with other aspects of life, not least politics.  This is true of the club game, where teams founded by workers quickly found themselves exceeding the capabilities of more <em>genteel</em> organisations early in football's history, and where divisions ranging from the ethnic to the religious to the cultural persist to this day.  But it's in the realm of international competition that such matters really come to a fore, and nowhere is that more true than in the World Cup.  Indeed, the World Cup itself is built on a political divide of a sort.  The first edition of the competition in 1930 was hosted by Uruguay, on the quite reasonable grounds that they had won the last two world amateur titles at the Olympics.  But, feeling snubbed, European countries declined to enter.  Particularly sniffy were the constituent countries of the United Kingdom, not FIFA members, who refused to consider membership in the organization, much less the long journey abroad.  In the event four European teams were coaxed across the ocean.  France made history by scoring the first ever World Cup goal through Lucien Laurent, an amateur forward and factory worker. (That French side was intriguing for all manner of reasons: captain Alex Villaplane, for example, returned home to become an enthusiastic Nazi collaborator before being executed in 1944.)  In any case, Uruguay (who inevitably won the tournament) declined to return the favor four years later, boycotting the World Cup's arrival in Italy due to the ill-feeling from the poor European showing in their own back yard.  Three teams crossed the Atlantic; Brazil, Argentina and the United States all lost their only matches. The narrative of the colonized versus the colonizer made little sense in light of the fact that football was not yet the sport of the people - Brazil's representatives came in large part from the well-to-do and overwhelmingly white Botafogo club - but still the rivalry of Europe against the Americas came to define much of international football in its early days.  It still does so now, particularly from a South American perspective.   War And Peace   As with so much else of civil society, the World Cup stopped for World War II.  Italy's win in 1938 \u2013 in what was, incidentally, the first tournament to welcome an Asian side in the form of the Dutch East Indies - was the final kick of a FIFA ball until 1950, when tournament play resumed in Brazil.  Yet despite the fact the war had been over for five years, its repercussions were still felt.  Germany, newly partitioned, had two football associations, but neither represented the East.  One, instead, was in tiny Saarland, whose brief but exciting tenure as an international force did not culminate in qualification.  However, their last-minute acceptance showed that, for perhaps the first time, Europe was serious about competing in South America, and vice versa.  Even the Brits were tempted to come along, England winning the Home Nations Championship to take their place.  Scotland, at the time a formidable team, declined to attend despite being invited, reasoning that second place did not merit such a reward. (Fast-forward 60 years and one imagines that the Scots would feel slightly differently.) Only the withdrawal of India prevented the 1950 World Cup from being the truly global event that it promised to be.  That came later as the lucre and prestige of the Cup continued to grow.  For those hoping that greater global acceptance would bring an end to politicking, though, there was to be disappointment.  In fact as the tournament grew in stature in footballing terms, so too it became a global and social commodity.  In other words, the World Cup was a big deal, and was thus far more likely to attract off-pitch attention.  The Soviet Union, for example, qualified at the first time of asking in 1958 in a bid to flaunt more sporting muscle to the world. (This they did, brilliantly so, drawing with the much-fancied England and beating Austria.).  Meanwhile Turkey withdrew yet again after being placed, inexplicably, in the Asian qualifiers.  This gave their opponents, Israel, a bye to the next stage.  In that round neither Indonesia nor Egypt were able to take part, so Israel and Sudan - who had beaten Syria - moved on to the next and final match.  Sudan refused to play against Israel for political reasons and thus withdrew from competition altogether.  Thus there was Israel, the conqueror of Asia and Africa, alone as a World Cup entrant without playing a single game.  FIFA decided this was unacceptable, so arranged an impromptu play-off with a random European runner-up, Wales.  Wales beat the Israelis and thus qualified for their one and only World Cup. And all because Sudan wouldn't travel to Israel!  Such matters only grew in importance as the decades progressed.  In 1966 the World Cup came to England for the first time for their only victory (thus far), but did so without facing an African team, all of whom withdrew over FIFA's refusal to grant the continent an automatic place in the tournament; in 1970 Morocco became the first African team in over 30 years to play in a World Cup in a bizarre but brilliant tournament that summed up all of football's foibles \u2013 playing in the noonday sun to accommodate European television schedules, for example. As for 1982, European alliances came to the fore as West Germany and Austria contrived to play out a 1-0 win for the former in what will forever be known as the 'Shame of Gijon'.  This non-event was a fixed group match that allowed both the German language-speaking countries to progress to the next stage at the expense of Algeria thanks to a complex fixture arrangement \u2013 one again created at the behest of television \u2013 long since abandoned.  The end result was 1-0 to West Germany, as if it matters. Towards The Present Most of the political aspects we've seen so far have been negative, and mainly to do with power or victory.  For a change of pace, consider West Germany's World Cup win in 1990.  The Berlin Wall had been down for scarcely six months and as the 'Nationalelf' roared to victory in Italy, East and West were busy sealing the formal road to reunification.  In stark contrast to when the sides met in the 1978 World Cup \u2013 a tense, fraught event \u2013 in this instance the two Germanies celebrated the West's victory together.  That it helped settle some of the reunification nerves and bring a divided people together is undeniable.  It would be an exaggeration to say that reunification could not have happened without football, but it is not a stretch to say that it would not have been so quick.  A cynic might argue, west German elites may have been pleased for the win as it distracted observers from the harsh economic realities of fusion; even if this is true, it was abundantly plain that football was serving as the force for unity and good that it had all too often forgotten in the past.  The Yugoslavia team of such an era, too, had its own role to play.  Before the Balkans shattered in tragic fashion, the Yugoslavs were the pride of eastern Europe.  Serbs like Dragan Stojkovic lined up next to Croats such as Davor Suker and Bosnian legends including Safet Susic and Zlatko Vujovic.  Such a team, bringing the best of all cultures together, could well have gone on to be one of the best of all time - young stars such as Alen Boksic were still in their footballing infancy - but then the war came, and Yugoslavia would never again compete as a single entity in world play.  Now the Balkan states each have their own teams - still, thankfully, punching above their weight, but not as they might have done.  Indeed, football itself had its role to play in the dissolution: rivalry between future European champions Red Star Belgrade and Dinamo Zagreb months before the tournament brought ethnic strife to the forefront of peoples' minds. Four years later Andres Escobar, a Colombian defender, scored an own goal at the 1994 World Cup.  This would have been an unfortunate historical footnote for the stat buff if not for the fact that he was then shot to death upon his return home.  Why? Nobody knows for sure, but in a country such as Colombia, in which drug lords hold sway, it has been rumored that massive gambling losses in the underworld was the trigger.  The money and the power, then, that football has provided could have been a major contributing factor. (As far as the courts determined, however, Escobar was simply shot for protesting when a man in a bar ridiculed him for his own goal.)  The World Cup went truly global in 2002 with its arrival in east Asia, with Japan and South Korea becoming the first ever co-hosts.  Yet four years later an even greater moment of off-pitch drama was to follow.  In 2006 the Ivory Coast, long since wracked by civil war, saw battling factions put down arms and pick up remote controls for a ceasefire in order to support the Ivorians in their first ever crack at World Cup play.  It's easy to romanticize this incident - human rights observers noted that, while conventional war ceased, citizens were still under attack - but at the same time the role of both the sport itself and the personalities involved helped, however slightly the road to peace.   The Path Ahead Could the same be about to happen now?  For the first time ever, North and South Korea will compete at the same tournament.  The importance of what may occur in South Africa cannot be understated.  So much is at stake: the North has in recent months reacted with fury to allegations of its sinking a Southern vessel, and diplomatic relations between the two states \u2013 hardly ideal at the best of times \u2013 have reached a recent nadir.  Yet on the sporting arena the countries have a much more love-hate relationship.  True enough, the official news organ of the North essentially accused the South of poisoning their players in the lead-up to a vital qualifier last year, but in 2008 athletes from the two sides marched together at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games.  Might we see scenes of similar fraternity this year?  Meanwhile there are other countries without troubles to seek.  Chile, riven recently by a disastrous earthquake, has taken the World Cup team to their hearts in a way that even this football-crazy nation might not have done in years past.  Events as innocuous as launching the new national shirt have been greeted with intense fervour; should Chilean hero Humberto 'Chupete' Suazo fail to recover from injury in time for the opening game, the mood of the nation will take a significant downturn.  As for Greece, a country cowed and humiliated by its financial disasters and civic unrest, the World Cup is a superb chance to prove that this small population can still hold its own, much as they did in the 2004 European Championships by pulling off a massively unlikely underdog win. And that brings us to South Africa itself.  The host country has so much riding on this tournament.  FIFA do, too.  Their mission to bring the tournament to Africa is long-standing, and now it's been achieved: any organizational failing, any security breach, and problem of any kind will have detractors mobilizing in numbers (and perhaps justifiably so.)  But aside from such concerns, which amount to nickels and dimes, is the future of South Africa itself. (and Africa) Under the dreadful apartheid regime the country lived a strange, alone existence; now, the Rainbow Nation has a chance to truly prove to the world that it can fulfill its promise.  It's no exaggeration to say that the opening match of the World Cup will be, for all South Africans, the most important game of their lives.  If history's anything to go by, how this one goes both on and off the pitch could determine so much more in years to come.",

            "en": "22         22. HIDE-AND-SEEK It had taken much less time than I'd thought \u2014 all the terror, the despair, the shattering of my heart. The minutes were ticking by more slowly than usual. Jasper still hadn't come back when I returned to Alice. I was afraid to be in the same room with her, afraid that she would guess\u2026 and afraid to hide from her for the same reason. I would have thought I was far beyond the ability to be surprised, my thoughts tortured and unstable, but I was surprised when I saw Alice bent over the desk, gripping the edge with two hands. \"Alice?\" . She didn't react when I called her name, but her head was slowly rocking side to side, and I saw her face. Her eyes were blank, dazed\u2026 My thoughts flew to my mother. Was I already too late? I hurried to her side, reaching out automatically to touch her hand. \"Alice!\" Jasper's voice whipped, and then he was right behind her, his hands curling over hers, loosening them from their grip on the table. Across the room, the door swung shut with a low click. \"What is it?\" he demanded. She turned her face away from me, into his chest. \"Bella,\" she said. \"I'm right here,\" I replied. Her head twisted around, her eyes locking on mine, their expression still strangely blank. I realized at once that she hadn't been speaking to me, she'd been answering Jasper's question. \"What did you see?\" I said \u2014 and there was no question in my flat, uncaring voice. Jasper looked at me sharply. I kept my expression vacant and waited. His eyes were confused as they flickered swiftly between Alice's face and mine, feeling the chaos\u2026 for I could guess what Alice had seen now. I felt a tranquil atmosphere settle around me. I welcomed it, using it to keep my emotions disciplined, under control. Alice, too, recovered herself. \"Nothing, really,\" she answered finally, her voice remarkably calm and convincing. \"Just the same room as before.\" She finally looked at me, her expression smooth and withdrawn. \"Did you want breakfast?\" \"No, I'll eat at the airport.\" I was very calm, too. I went to the bathroom to shower. Almost as if I were borrowing Jasper's strange extra sense, I could feel Alice's wild \u2014 though well-concealed \u2014 desperation to have me out of the room, to be alone with Jasper. So she could tell him that they were doing something wrong, that they were going to fail\u2026 I got ready methodically, concentrating on each little task. I left my hair down, swirling around me, covering my face. The peaceful mood Jasper created worked its way through me and helped me think clearly. Helped me plan. I dug through my bag until I found my sock full of money. I emptied it into my pocket. \u00a0I was anxious to get to the airport, and glad when we left by seven. I sat alone this time in the back of the dark car. Alice leaned against the door, her face toward Jasper but, behind her sunglasses, shooting glances in my direction every few seconds. \"Alice?\" I asked indifferently. She was wary. \"Yes?\" \"How does it work? The things that you see?\" I stared out the side window, and my voice sounded bored. \"Edward said it wasn't definite\u2026 that things change?\" It was harder than I would have thought to say his name. That must have been what alerted Jasper, why a fresh wave of serenity filled the car. \"Yes, things change\u2026\" she murmured \u2014 hopefully, I thought. \"Some things are more certain than others\u2026 like the weather. People are harder. I only see the course they're on while they're on it. Once they change their minds \u2014 make a new decision, no matter how small \u2014 the whole future shifts.\" I nodded thoughtfully. \"So you couldn't see James in Phoenix until he decided to come here.\" \"Yes,\" she agreed, wary again. And she hadn't seen me in the mirror room with James until I'd made the decision to meet him there. I tried not to think about what else she might have seen. I didn't want my panic to make Jasper more suspicious. They would be watching me twice as carefully now, anyway, after Alice's vision. This was going to be impossible. We got to the airport. Luck was with me, or maybe it was just good odds. Edward's plane was landing in terminal four, the largest terminal, where most flights landed \u2014 so it wasn't surprising that his was. But it was the terminal I needed: the biggest, the most confusing. And there was a door on level three that might be the only chance. We parked on the fourth floor of the huge garage. I led the way, for once more knowledgeable about my surroundings than they were. We took the elevator down to level three, where the passengers unloaded. Alice and Jasper spent a long time looking at the departing flights board. I could hear them discussing the pros and cons of New York, Atlanta, Chicago. Places I'd never seen. And would never see. I waited for my opportunity, impatient, unable to stop my toe from tapping. We sat in the long rows of chairs by the metal detectors, Jasper and Alice pretending to people-watch but really watching me. Every inch I shifted in my seat was followed by a quick glance out of the corner of their eyes. It was hopeless. Should I run? Would they dare to stop me physically in this public place? Or would they simply follow? I pulled the unmarked envelope out of my pocket and set it on top of Alice's black leather bag. She looked at me. \"My letter,\" I said. She nodded, tucking it under the top flap. He would find it soon enough. The minutes passed and Edward's arrival grew closer. It was amazing how every cell in my body seemed to know he was coming, to long for his coming. That made it very hard. I found myself trying to think of excuses to stay, to see him first and then make my escape. But I knew that was impossible if I was going to have any chance to get away. Several times Alice offered to go get breakfast with me. Later, I told her, not yet. I stared at the arrival board, watching as flight after flight arrived on time. The flight from Seattle crept closer to the top of the board.  And then, when I had only thirty minutes to make my escape, the numbers changed. His plane was ten minutes early. I had no more time. \"I think I'll eat now,\" I said quickly. Alice stood. \"I'll come with you.\" \"Do you mind if Jasper comes instead?\" I asked. \"I'm feeling a little\u2026\" I didn't finish the sentence. My eyes were wild enough to convey what I didn't say. Jasper stood up. Alice's eyes were confused, but \u2014 I saw to my relief\u2014 not suspicious. She must be attributing the change in her vision to some maneuver of the tracker's rather than a betrayal by me. Jasper walked silently beside me, his hand on the small of my back, as if he were guiding me. I pretended a lack of interest in the first few airport cafes, my head scanning for what I really wanted. And there it was, around the corner, out of Alice's sharp sight: the level-three ladies' room. \"Do you mind?\" I asked Jasper as we passed. \"I'll just be a moment.\" \"I'll be right here,\" he said. As soon as the door shut behind me, I was running. I remembered the time I had gotten lost from this bathroom, because it had two exits. Outside the far door it was only a short sprint to the elevators, and if Jasper stayed where he said he would, I'd never be in his line of sight. I didn't look behind me as I ran. This was my only chance, and even if he saw me, I had to keep going. People stared, but I ignored them. Around the corner the elevators were waiting, and I dashed forward, throwing my hand between the closing doors of a full elevator headed down. I squeezed in beside the irritated passengers, and checked to make sure that the button for level one had been pushed. It was already lit, and the doors closed. As soon as the door opened I was off again, to the sound of annoyed murmurs behind me. I slowed myself as I passed the security guards by the luggage carousels, only to break into a run again as the exit doors came into view. I had no way of knowing if Jasper was looking for me yet. I would have only seconds if he was following my scent. I jumped out the automatic doors, nearly smacking into the glass when they opened too slowly. Along the crowded curb there wasn't a cab in sight. I had no time. Alice and Jasper were either about to realize I was gone, or they already had. They would find me in a heartbeat. A shuttle to the Hyatt was just closing its doors a few feet behind me.  \"Wait!\" I called, running, waving at the driver. \"This is the shuttle to the Hyatt,\" the driver said in confusion as he opened the doors. \"Yes,\" I huffed, \"that's where I'm going.\" I hurried up the steps. He looked askance at my luggage-less state, but then shrugged, not caring enough to ask. Most of the seats were empty. I sat as far from the other travelers as possible, and watched out the window as first the sidewalk, and then the airport, drifted away. I couldn't help imagining Edward, where he would stand at the edge of the road when he found the end of my trail. I couldn't cry yet, I told myself. I still had a long way to go. My luck held. In front of the Hyatt, a tired-looking couple was getting their last suitcase out of the trunk of a cab. I jumped out of the shuttle and ran to the cab, sliding into the seat behind the driver. The tired couple and the shuttle driver stared at me. I told the surprised cabbie my mother's address. \"I need to get there as soon as possible.\" \"That's in Scottsdale,\" he complained. I threw four twenties over the seat. \"Will that be enough?\" \"Sure, kid, no problem.\" I sat back against the seat, folding my arms across my lap. The familiar city began to rush around me, but I didn't look out the windows. I exerted myself to maintain control. I was determined not to lose myself at this point, now that my plan was successfully completed.  There was no point in indulging in more terror, more anxiety. My path was set. I just had to follow it now. So, instead of panicking, I closed my eyes and spent the twenty minutes' drive with Edward. I imagined that I had stayed at the airport to meet Edward. I visualized how I would stand on my toes, the sooner to see his face. How quickly, how gracefully he would move through the crowds of people separating us.  And then I would run to close those last few feet between us \u2014 reckless as always \u2014 and I would be in his marble arms, finally safe. I wondered where we would have gone. North somewhere, so he could be outside in the day. Or maybe somewhere very remote, so we could lay in the sun together again. I imagined him by the shore, his skin sparkling like the sea. It wouldn't matter how long we had to hide. To be trapped in a hotel room with him would be a kind of heaven. So many questions I still had for him. I could talk to him forever, never sleeping, never leaving his side. I could see his face so clearly now\u2026 almost hear his voice. And, despite all the horror and hopelessness, I was fleetingly happy. So involved was I in my escapist daydreams, I lost all track of the seconds racing by. \"Hey, what was the number?\" The cabbie's question punctured my fantasy, letting all the colors run out of my lovely delusions. Fear, bleak and hard, was waiting to fill the empty space they left behind. \"Fifty-eight twenty-one.\" My voice sounded strangled. The cabbie looked at me, nervous that I was having an episode or something. \"Here we are, then.\" He was anxious to get me out of his car, probably hoping I wouldn't ask for my change. \"Thank you,\" I whispered. There was no need to be afraid, I reminded myself. The house was empty. I had to hurry; my mom was waiting for me, frightened, depending on me. I ran to the door, reaching up automatically to grab the key under the eave. I unlocked the door. It was dark inside, empty, normal. I ran to the phone, turning on the kitchen light on my way. There, on the whiteboard, was a ten-digit number written in a small, neat hand. My fingers stumbled over the keypad, making mistakes. I had to hang up and start again. I concentrated only on the buttons this time, carefully pressing each one in turn. I was successful. I held the phone to my ear with a shaking hand. It rang only once. \"Hello, Bella,\" that easy voice answered. \"That was very quick. I'm impressed.\" \"Is my mom all right?\" \"She's perfectly fine. Don't worry, Bella, I have no quarrel with her.\u00a0 Unless you didn't come alone, of course.\" Light, amused. \"I'm alone.\" I'd never been more alone in my entire life. \"Very good. Now, do you know the ballet studio just around the corner from your home?\" \"Yes. I know how to get there.\" \"Well, then, I'll see you very soon.\" I hung up. I ran from the room, through the door, out into the baking heat. There was no time to look back at my house, and I didn't want to see it as it was now \u2014 empty, a symbol of fear instead of sanctuary. The last person to walk through those familiar rooms was my enemy. From the corner of my eye, I could almost see my mother standing in the shade of the big eucalyptus tree where I'd played as a child. Or kneeling by the little plot of dirt around the mailbox, the cemetery of all the flowers she'd tried to grow. The memories were better than any reality I would see today. But I raced away from them, toward the corner, leaving everything behind me. I felt so slow, like I was running through wet sand \u2014 I couldn't seem to get enough purchase from the concrete. I tripped several times, once falling, catching myself with my hands, scraping them on the sidewalk, and then lurching up to plunge forward again. But at last I made it to the corner. Just another street now; I ran, sweat pouring down my face, gasping. The sun was hot on my skin, too bright as it bounced off the white concrete and blinded me. I felt dangerously exposed. More fiercely than I would have dreamed I was capable of, I wished for the green, protective forests of Forks\u2026 of home. \u00a0When I rounded the last corner, onto Cactus, I could see the studio, looking just as I remembered it. The parking lot in front was empty, the vertical blinds in all the windows drawn. I couldn't run anymore \u2014 I couldn't breathe; exertion and fear had gotten the best of me. I thought of my mother to keep my feet moving, one in front of the other. As I got closer, I could see the sign inside the door. It was handwritten on hot pink paper; it said the dance studio was closed for spring break.  I touched the handle, tugged on it cautiously. It was unlocked. I fought to catch my breath, and opened the door. The lobby was dark and empty, cool, the air conditioner thrumming. The plastic molded chairs were stacked along the walls, and the carpet smelled like shampoo. The west dance floor was dark, I could see through the open viewing window. The east dance floor, the bigger room, was lit. But the blinds were closed on the window. Terror seized me so strongly that I was literally trapped by it. I couldn't make my feet move forward.  And then my mother's voice called. \"Bella? Bella?\" That same tone of hysterical panic. I sprinted to the door, to the sound of her voice. \"Bella, you scared me! Don't you ever do that to me again!\" Her voice continued as I ran into the long, high-ceilinged room. I stared around me, trying to find where her voice was coming from. I heard her laugh, and I whirled to the sound. There she was, on the TV screen, tousling my hair in relief. It was Thanksgiving, and I was twelve. We'd gone to see my grandmother in California, the last year before she died. We went to the beach one day, and I'd leaned too far over the edge of the pier. She'd seen my feet flailing, trying to reclaim my balance. \"Bella? Bella?\" she'd called to me in fear. And then the TV screen was blue. I turned slowly. He was standing very still by the back exit, so still I hadn't noticed him at first. In his hand was a remote control. We stared at each other for a long moment, and then he smiled. He walked toward me, quite close, and then passed me to put the remote down next to the VCR. I turned carefully to watch him. \"Sorry about that, Bella, but isn't it better that your mother didn't really have to be involved in all this?\" His voice was courteous, kind. And suddenly it hit me. My mother was safe. She was still in Florida. She'd never gotten my message. She'd never been terrified by the dark red eyes in the abnormally pale face before me. She was safe. \"Yes,\" I answered, my voice saturated with relief. \"You don't sound angry that I tricked you.\" \"I'm not.\" My sudden high made me brave. What did it matter now? It would soon be over. Charlie and Mom would never be harmed, would never have to fear. I felt almost giddy. Some analytical part of my mind warned me that I was dangerously close to snapping from the stress. \"How odd. You really mean it.\" His dark eyes assessed me with interest. The irises were nearly black, just a hint of ruby around the edges. Thirsty. \"I will give your strange coven this much, you humans can be quite interesting. I guess I can see the draw of observing you. It's amazing \u2014 some of you seem to have no sense of your own self-interest at all.\" He was standing a few feet away from me, arms folded, looking at me curiously. There was no menace in his face or stance. He was so very average-looking, nothing remarkable about his face or body at all. Just the white skin, the circled eyes I'd grown so used to. He wore a pale blue, long-sleeved shirt and faded blue jeans. \"I suppose you're going to tell me that your boyfriend will avenge you?\" he asked, hopefully it seemed to me. \"No, I don't think so. At least, I asked him not to.\" \"And what was his reply to that?\" \"I don't know.\" It was strangely easy to converse with this <em>genteel</em> hunter. \"I left him a letter.\" \"How romantic, a last letter. And do you think he will honor it?\" His voice was just a little harder now, a hint of sarcasm marring his polite tone. \"I hope so.\" Hmmm. Well, our hopes differ then. You see, this was all just a little too easy, too quick. To be quite honest, I'm disappointed. I expected a much greater challenge. And, after all, I only needed a little luck.\" I waited in silence. \"When Victoria couldn't get to your father, I had her find out more about you. There was no sense in running all over the planet chasing you down when I could comfortably wait for you in a place of my choosing. So, after I talked to Victoria, I decided to come to Phoenix to pay your mother a visit. I'd heard you say you were going home. At first, I never dreamed you meant it. But then I wondered. Humans can be very predictable; they like to be somewhere familiar, somewhere safe. And wouldn't it be the perfect ploy, to go to the last place you should be when you're hiding \u2014 the place that you said you'd be. \"But of course I wasn't sure, it was just a hunch. I usually get a feeling about the prey that I'm hunting, a sixth sense, if you will. I listened to your message when I got to your mother's house, but of course I couldn't be sure where you'd called from. It was very useful to have your number, but you could have been in Antarctica for all I knew, and the game wouldn't work unless you were close by. \"Then your boyfriend got on a plane to Phoenix. Victoria was monitoring them for me, naturally; in a game with this many players, I couldn't be working alone. And so they told me what I'd hoped, that you were here after all. I was prepared; I'd already been through your charming home movies. And then it was simply a matter of the bluff. \"Very easy, you know, not really up to my standards. So, you see, I'm hoping you're wrong about your boyfriend. Edward, isn't it?\" I didn't answer. The bravado was wearing off. I sensed that he was coming to the end of his gloat. It wasn't meant for me anyway. There was no glory in beating me, a weak human. \"Would you mind, very much, if I left a little letter of my own for your Edward?\" He took a step back and touched a palm-sized digital video camera balanced carefully on top of the stereo. A small red light indicated that it was already running. He adjusted it a few times, widened the frame. I stared at him in horror. \"I'm sorry, but I just don't think he'll be able to resist hunting me after he watches this. And I wouldn't want him to miss anything. It was all for him, of course. You're simply a human, who unfortunately was in the wrong place, at the wrong time, and indisputably running with the wrong crowd, I might add.\" He stepped toward me, smiling. \"Before we begin\u2026\" I felt a curl of nausea in the pit of my stomach as he spoke. This was something I had not anticipated. \"I would just like to rub it in, just a little bit. The answer was there all along, and I was so afraid Edward would see that and ruin my fun. It happened once, oh, ages ago. The one and only time my prey escaped me. \"You see, the vampire who was so stupidly fond of this little victim made the choice that your Edward was too weak to make. When the old one knew I was after his little friend, he stole her from the asylum where he worked \u2014 I never will understand the obsession some vampires seem to form with you humans \u2014 and as soon as he freed her he made her safe.  She didn't even seem to notice the pain, poor little creature. She'd been stuck in that black hole of a cell for so long. A hundred years earlier and she would have been burned at the stake for her visions. In the nineteen-twenties it was the asylum and the shock treatments. When she opened her eyes, strong with her fresh youth, it was like she'd never seen the sun before. The old vampire made her a strong new vampire, and there was no reason for me to touch her then.\" He sighed. \"I destroyed the old one in vengeance.\" \"Alice,\" I breathed, astonished. \"Yes, your little friend. I was surprised to see her in the clearing. So I guess her coven ought to be able to derive some comfort from this experience. I get you, but they get her. The one victim who escaped me, quite an honor, actually. \"And she did smell so delicious. I still regret that I never got to taste\u2026 She smelled even better than you do. Sorry \u2014 I don't mean to be offensive. You have a very nice smell. Floral, somehow\u2026\" He took another step toward me, till he was just inches away. He lifted a lock of my hair and sniffed at it delicately. Then he gently patted the strand back into place, and I felt his cool fingertips against my throat. He reached up to stroke my cheek once quickly with his thumb, his face curious. I wanted so badly to run, but I was frozen. I couldn't even flinch away. \"No,\" he murmured to himself as he dropped his hand, \"I don't understand.\" He sighed. \"Well, I suppose we should get on with it. And then I can call your friends and tell them where to find you, and my little message.\" I was definitely sick now. There was pain coming, I could see it in his eyes. It wouldn't be enough for him to win, to feed and go. There would be no quick end like I'd been counting on. My knees began to shake, and I was afraid I was going to fall. He stepped back, and began to circle, casually, as if he were trying to get a better view of a statue in a museum. His face was still open and friendly as he decided where to start. Then he slumped forward, into a crouch I recognized, and his pleasant smile slowly widened, grew, till it wasn't a smile at all but a contortion of teeth, exposed and glistening. I couldn't help myself\u2014 I tried to run. As useless as I knew it would be, as weak as my knees already were, panic took over and I bolted for the emergency door. He was in front of me in a flash. I didn't see if he used his hand or his foot, it was too fast. A crushing blow struck my chest \u2014 I felt myself flying backward, and then heard the crunch as my head bashed into the mirrors. The glass buckled, some of the pieces shattering and splintering on the floor beside me. I was too stunned to feel the pain. I couldn't breathe yet.  He walked toward me slowly. \"That's a very nice effect,\" he said, examining the mess of glass, his voice friendly again. \"I thought this room would be visually dramatic for my little film. That's why I picked this place to meet you. It's perfect, isn't it?\" I ignored him, scrambling on my hands and knees, crawling toward the other door. He was over me at once, his foot stepping down hard on my leg. I heard the sickening snap before I felt it. But then I did feel it, and I couldn't hold back my scream of agony. I twisted up to reach for my leg, and he was standing over me, smiling. \"Would you like to rethink your last request?\" he asked pleasantly. His toe nudged my broken leg and I heard a piercing scream. With a shock, I realized it was mine. \"Wouldn't you rather have Edward try to find me?\" he prompted. \"No!\" I croaked. \"No, Edward, don't\u2014\" And then something smashed into my face, throwing me back into the broken mirrors. Over the pain of my leg, I felt the sharp rip across my scalp where the glass cut into it. And then the warm wetness began to spread through my hair with alarming speed. I could feel it soaking the shoulder of my shirt, hear it dripping on the wood below. The smell of it twisted my stomach. Through the nausea and dizziness I saw something that gave me a sudden, final shred of hope. His eyes, merely intent before, now burned with an uncontrollable need. The blood \u2014 spreading crimson across my white shirt, pooling rapidly on the floor \u2014 was driving him mad with thirst. No matter his original intentions, he couldn't draw this out much longer. Let it be quick now, was all I could hope as the flow of blood from my head sucked my consciousness away with it.

            "en": "7 REPETITION         3. The truth I had the sense that i'd been asleep for a very long time\u2014my body was stiff, like i hadn't moved once through all that time, either. My mind was dazed and slow; strange, colorful dreams\u2014dreams and nightmares\u2014swirled dizzily around the inside of my head. They were so vivid. The horrible and the heavenly, all mixed together into a bizarre jumble. There was sharp impatience and fear, both part of that frustrating dream where your feet can't move fast enough\u2026 and there were plenty of monsters, red-eyed fiends that were all the more ghastly for their <em>genteel</em> civility. The dream was still strong\u2014i could even remember the names. But the strongest, clearest part of the dream was not the horror. It was the angel that was most clear. It was hard to let him go and wake up. This dream did not want to be shoved away into the vault of dreams I refused to revisit. I struggled with it as my mind became more alert, focusing on reality. I couldn't remember what day of the week it was, but I was sure Jacob or school or work or something was waiting for me. I inhaled deeply, wondering how to face another day. Something cold touched my forehead with the softest pressure. I squeezed my eyes more tightly shut. I was still dreaming, it seemed, and it felt \u00a0abnormally real. I was so close to waking\u2026 any second now, and it would be gone. But I realized that it felt too real, too real to be good for me. The stone arms I imagined wrapped around me were far too substantial. If I let this go any further, I'd be sorry for it later. With a resigned sigh, I wrenched back my eyelids to dispel the illusion. \"Oh!\" I gasped, and threw my fists over my eyes. Well, clearly, I'd gone too far; it must have been a mistake to let my imagination get so out of hand. Okay, so \"let\" was the wrong word. I'd forced it to get out of hand\u2014pretty much stalked my hallucinations\u2014and now my mind had snapped. It took less than half a second for me to realize that, as long as I was truly insane now, I might as well enjoy the delusions while they were pleasant. I opened my eyes again\u2014and Edward was still there, his perfect face just inches away from mine. \"Did I frighten you?\" His low voice was anxious. This was very good, as delusions went. The face, the voice, the scent, everything\u2014it was so much better than drowning. The beautiful figment of my imagination watched my changing expressions, with alarm. His irises were pitch-black, with bruise-like shadows under them. This surprised me; my hallucinatory Edwards were usually better fed. I blinked twice, desperately trying to remember the last thing that I was sure was real. Alice was part of my dream, and I wondered if she had really come back at all, or if that was just the preamble. I thought she'd returned the day I'd nearly drowned\u2026 \"Oh, crap\" I croaked. My throat was thick with sleeping. \"What's wrong, Bella?\" I frowned at him unhappily. His face was even more anxious than before. \"I'm dead, right?\" I moaned. \"I did drown. Crap, crap, crap! This is gonna kill Charlie.\" Edward frowned, too. \"You're not dead.\" \"Then why am I not waking up?\" I challenged, raising my eyebrows. \"You are awake, Bella.\" I shook my head. \"Sure, sure. That's what you want me to think. And then it will be worse when I do wake up. If I wake up, which I won't, because I'm dead. This is awful. Poor Charlie. And Renee and Jake\u2026\" I trailed off in horror at what I had done. \"I can see where you might confuse me with a nightmare.\" His short-lived smile was grim. \"But I can't imagine what you could have done to wind up in hell. Did you commit many murders while I was away?\" I grimaced. \"Obviously not. If I was in hell, you wouldn't be with me.\" He sighed. My head was getting clearer. My eyes flickered away from his face\u2014unwillingly\u2014for one second, to the dark, open window, and then back to him. I started to remember details\u2026 and I felt a faint, unfamiliar blush warm the skin over my cheekbones as I slowly realized that Edward was really, truly here with me, and I was wasting time being an idiot. \"Did all of that really happen, then?\" It was almost impossible to reassign my dream as reality. I couldn't wrap my head around the concept. \"That depends.\" Edward's smile was still hard. \"If you're referring to us nearly being massacred in Italy, then, yes.\" \"How strange,\" I mused. \"I really went to Italy. Did you know I'd never been farther east than Albuquerque?\" He rolled his eyes. \"Maybe you should go back to sleep. You're not coherent.\" \"I'm not tired anymore.\" It was all coming clear now. \"What time is it? How long have I been sleeping?\" \"It's just after one in the morning. So, about fourteen hours.\" I stretched as he spoke. I was so stiff. \"Charlie?\" I asked. Edward frowned. \"Sleeping. You should probably know that I'm breaking the rules right now. Well, not technically, since he said I was never to walk through his door again, and I came in the window\u2026 But, still, the intent was clear.\" \"Charlie banned you from the house?\" I asked, disbelief quickly melting into fury. His eyes were sad. \"Did you expect anything else?\" My eyes were mad. I was going to have a few words with my father\u2014perhaps it would be a good time to remind him that I was over the legal age of adulthood. It didn't matter so much, of course, except in principle. All too soon there would be no reason for the prohibition. I turned my thoughts to less painful avenues. \"What's the story?\" I asked, genuinely curious, but also trying desperately to keep the conversation casual, to keep a firm grip on myself, so I wouldn't scare him away with the frantic, gnawing craving that was raging inside me. \"What do you mean?\" \"What am I telling Charlie? What's my excuse for disappearing for\u2026 how long was I gone, anyway?\" I tried to count the hours in my head. \"Just three days.\" His eyes tightened, but he smiled more naturally this time. \"Actually, I was hoping you might have a good explanation. I've got nothing.\" I groaned. \"Fabulous.\" \"Well, maybe Alice will come up with something,\" he offered, trying to comfort me. And I was comforted. Who cared what I had to deal with later? Every second that he was here\u2014so close, his flawless face glowing in the dim light from the numbers on my alarm clock\u2014was precious and not to be wasted. \"So,\" I began, picking the least important\u2014though still vitally interesting\u2014question to start with. I was safely delivered home, and he might decide to leave at any moment. I had to keep him talking. Besides, this temporary heaven wasn't entirely complete without the sound of his voice. \"What have you been doing, up until three days ago?\" His face turned wary in an instant. \"Nothing terribly exciting.\" \"Of course not,\" I mumbled. \"Why are you making that face?\" \"Well\u2026\" I pursed my lips, considering. \"If you were, after all, just a dream, that's exactly the kind of thing you would say. My imagination must be used up.\" He sighed. \"If I tell you, will you finally believe that you're not having a nightmare?\" \"Nightmare!\" I repeated scornfully. He waited for my answer. \"Maybe,\" I said after a second of thought. \"If you tell me.\" \"I was\u2026 hunting.\" \"Is that the best you can do?\" I criticized. \"That definitely doesn't prove I'm awake.\" He hesitated, and then spoke slowly, choosing his words with care. \"I wasn't hunting for food\u2026 I was actually trying my hand at\u2026 tracking. I'm not very good at it.\" \"What were you tracking?\" I asked, intrigued. \"Nothing of consequence.\" His words didn't match his expression; he looked upset, uncomfortable. \"I don't understand.\" He hesitated; his face, shining with an odd green cast from the light of the clock, was torn. \"I\u2014\" He took a deep breath. \"I owe you an apology. No, of course I owe you much, \u00a0much more than that. But you have to know,\"\u2014the words began to flow so fast, the way I remembered he spoke sometimes when he was agitated, that I really had to concentrate to catch them all\u2014\"that I had no idea. I didn't realize the mess I was leaving behind. I thought it was safe for you here. So safe. I had no idea that Victoria,\"\u2014his lips curled back when he said the name\u2014\"would come back. I'll admit, when I saw her that one time, I was paying much more attention to James's thoughts. But I just didn't see that she had this kind of response in her. That she even had such a tie to him. I think I realize why now\u2014she was so sure of him, the thought of him failing never occurred to her. It was her overconfidence that clouded her feelings about him\u2014that kept me from seeing the depth of them, the bond there. \"Not that there's any excuse for what I left you to face. When I heard what you told Alice\u2014what she saw herself\u2014when I realized that you had to put your life in the hands of werewolves, immature, volatile, the worst thing out there besides Victoria herself\u2014he shuddered and the gush of words halted for a short second. \"Please know that I had no idea of any of this. I feel sick, sick to my core, even now, when I can see and feel you safe in my arms. I am the most miserable excuse for\u2014\" \"Stop,\" I interrupted him. He stared at me with agonized eyes, and I tried to find the right words\u2014the words that would free him from this imagined obligation that caused him so much pain. They were very hard words to say. I didn't know if I could get them out without breaking down. But I had to try to do it right. I didn't want to be a source of guilt and anguish in his life. He should be happy, no matter what it cost me. I'd really been hoping to put off this part of our last conversation. It was going to bring things to an end so much sooner. Drawing on all my months of practice with trying to be normal for Charlie, I kept my face smooth.  \"Edward,\" I said. His name burned my throat a little on the way out. I could feel the ghost of the hole, waiting to rip itself wide again as soon as he disappeared. I didn't quite see how I was going to survive it this time. \"This has to stop now. You can't think about things that way. You can't let this\u2026 this guilt\u2026 rule your life. You can't take responsibility for the things that happen to me here. None of it is your fault, it's just part of how life is for me. So, if I trip in front of a bus or whatever it is next time, you have to realize that it's not your job to take the blame. You can't just go running off to Italy \u00a0because you feel bad that you didn't save me. Even if I had jumped off that cliff to die, that would have been my choice, and not your fault. I know it's your\u2026 your nature to shoulder the blame for everything, but you really can't let that make you go to such extremes! It's very irresponsible\u2014think of Esme and Carlisle and\u2014\" I was on the edge of losing it. I stopped to take a deep breath, hoping to calm myself. I had to set him free. I had to make sure this never happened again. \"Isabella Marie Swan,\" he whispered, the strangest expression crossing his face. He almost looked mad. \"Do you believe that I asked the Volturi to kill me because I felt guilty?\" I could feel the blank incomprehension on my face. \"Didn't you?\" \"Feel guilty? Intensely so. More than you can comprehend.\" \"Then\u2026 what are you saying? I don't understand.\" \"Bella, I went to the Volturi because I thought you were dead,\" he said, voice soft, eyes fierce. \"Even if I'd had no hand in your death\"\u2014he shuddered as he whispered the last word\u2014\"even if it wasn't my fault, I would have gone to Italy. Obviously, I should have been more careful\u2014I should have spoken to Alice directly, rather than accepting it secondhand from Rosalie. But, really, what was I supposed to think when the boy said Charlie was at the funeral? What are the odds? \"The odds\u2026\" he muttered then, distracted. His voice was so low I wasn't sure I heard it right. \"The odds are always stacked against us. Mistake after mistake. I'll never criticize Romeo again.\" \"But I still don't understand,\" I said. \"That's my whole point. So what?\" \"Excuse me?\" \"So what if I was dead?\" He stared at me dubiously for a long moment before answering. \"Don't you remember anything I told you before?\" \"I remember everything that you told me.\" Including the words that had negated all the rest. He brushed the tip of his cool finger against my lower lip. \"Bella, you seem to be under a misapprehension.\" He closed his eyes, shaking his head back and forth with half a smile on his beautiful face. It wasn't a happy smile. \"I thought I'd explained it clearly before. Bella, I can't live in a world where you don't exist.\" \"I am\u2026\" My head swam as I looked for the appropriate word. \"Confused.\" That worked. I couldn't make sense of what he was saying. He stared deep into my eyes with his sincere, earnest gaze. \"I'm a good liar, Bella, I have to be.\" I froze, my muscles locking down as if for impact. The fault line in my chest rippled; the pain of it took my breath away. He shook my shoulder, trying to loosen my rigid pose. \"Let me finish! I'm a good liar, but still, for you to believe me so quickly.\" He winced. \"That was\u2026 excruciating.\" I waited, still frozen. \"When we were in the forest, when I was telling you goodbye\u2014\" I didn't allow myself to remember. I fought to keep myself in the present second only. \"You weren't going to let go,\" he whispered. \"I could see that. I didn't want to do it\u2014it felt like it would kill me to do it\u2014but I knew that if I couldn't convince you that I didn't love you anymore, it would just take you that much longer to get on with your life. I hoped that, if you thought I'd moved on, so would you.\" \"A clean break,\" I whispered through unmoving lips. \"Exactly. But I never imagined it would be so easy to do! I thought it would be next to impossible\u2014that you would be so sure of the truth that I would have to lie through my teeth for hours to even plant the seed of doubt in your head. I lied, and I'm so sorry\u2014sorry because I hurt you, sorry because it was a worthless effort. Sorry that I couldn't protect you from what I an. I lied to save you, and it didn't work. I'm sorry. \"But how could you believe me? After all the thousand times I've told you I love you, how could you let one word break your faith in me?\" I didn't answer. I was too shocked to form a rational response. \"I could see it in your eyes, that you honestly believed that I didn't want you anymore. The most absurd, ridiculous concept\u2014as if there were any way that I could exist without needing you!\" I was still frozen. His words were incomprehensible, because they were impossible. He shook my shoulder again, not hard, but enough that my teeth rattled a little. \"Bella,\" he sighed. \"Really, what were you thinking!\" And so I started to cry. The tears welled up and then gushed miserably down my cheeks. \"I knew it,\" I sobbed. \"I knew I was dreaming.\" \"You're impossible,\" he said, and he laughed once\u2014a hard laugh, frustrated. \"How can I put this so that you'll believe me? You're not asleep, and you're not dead. I'm here, and I love you. I have always loved you, and I will always love you. I was thinking of you, seeing your face in my mind, every second that I was away. When I told you that I didn't want you, it was the very blackest kind of blasphemy.\" I shook my head while the tears continued to ooze from the corners of my eyes. \"You don't believe me, do you?\" he whispered, his face paler than his usual pale\u2014I could see that even in the dim light. \"Why can you believe the lie, but not the truth?\" \"It never made sense for you to love me,\" I explained, my voice breaking twice. \"I always knew that.\" His eyes narrowed, his jaw tightened. \"I'll prove you're awake,\" he promised. He caught my face securely between his iron hands, ignoring my struggles when I tried to turn my head away. \"Please don't,\" I whispered. He stopped, his lips just half an inch from mine. \"Why not?\" he demanded. His breath blew into my face, making my head whirl. \"When I wake up\"\u2014He opened his mouth to protest, so I revised\u2014\"okay, forget that one\u2014when you leave again, it's going to be hard enough without this, too.\" He pulled back an inch, to stare at my face. \"Yesterday, when I would touch you, you were so\u2026 hesitant, so careful, and yet still the same. I need to know why. Is it because I'm too late? Because I've hurt you too much? Because you have moved on, as I meant for you to? That would be\u2026 quite fair. I won't contest your decision. So don't try to spare my feelings, please\u2014just tell me now whether or not you can still love me, after everything I've done to you.\u00a0 Can you?\" he whispered. \"What kind of an idiotic question is that?\" \"Just answer it. Please.\" I stared at him darkly for a long moment. \"The way I feel about you will never change. Of course I love you\u2014and there's nothing you can do about it!\" \"That's all I needed to hear.\" His mouth was on mine then, and I couldn't fight him. Not because he was so many thousand times stronger than me, but because my will crumbled into dust the second our lips met. This kiss was not quite as careful as others I remembered, which suited me just fine. If I was going to rip myself up further, I might as well get as much in trade as possible. So I kissed him back, my heart pounding out a jagged, disjointed rhythm while my breathing turned to panting and my fingers moved greedily to his face. I could feel his marble body against every line of mine, and I was so glad he hadn't listened to me\u2014there was no pain in the world that would have justified missing this. His hands memorized my face, the same way mine were tracing his, and, in the brief seconds when his lips were free, he whispered my name. When I was starting to get dizzy, he pulled away, only to lay his ear against my heart. I lay there, dazed, waiting for my gasping to slow and quiet. \"By the way,\" he said in a casual tone. \"I'm not leaving you.\" I didn't say anything, and he seemed to hear skepticism in my silence. He lifted his face to lock my gaze in his. \"I'm not going anywhere. Not without you,\" he added more seriously. \"I only left you in the first place because I wanted you to have a chance at a normal, happy, human life. I could see what I was doing to you\u2014keeping you constantly on the edge of danger, taking you away from the world you belonged in, risking your life every moment I was with you. So I had to try. I had to do something, and it seemed like leaving was the only way. If I hadn't thought you would be better off, I could have never made myself leave. I'm much too selfish. Only you could be more important than what I wanted\u2026 what I needed. What I want and need is to be with you, and I know I'll never be strong enough to leave again. I have too many excuses to stay\u2014thank heaven for that! It seems you can't be safe, no matter how many miles I put between us.\" \"Don't promise me anything,\" I whispered. If I let myself hope, and it came to nothing\u2026 that would kill me. Where all those merciless vampires had not been able to finish me off, hope would do the job. Anger glinted metallic in his black eyes. \"You think I'm lying to you now?\" \"No\u2014not lying.\" I shook my head, trying to think it through coherently. To examine the hypothesis that he did love me, while staying objective, clinical, so I wouldn't fall into the trap of hoping. \"You could mean it\u2026 now. But what about tomorrow, when you think about all the reasons you left in the first place? Or next month, when Jasper takes a snap at me?\" He flinched. I thought back over those last days of my life before he left me, tried to see them through the filter of what he was telling me now. From that perspective, imagining that he'd left me while loving me, left me for me, his brooding and cold silences took on a different meaning. \"It isn't as if you hadn't thought the first decision through, is it?\" I guessed. \"You'll end up doing what you think is right.\" \"I'm not as strong as you give me credit for,\" he said. \"Right and wrong have ceased to mean much to me; I was coming back anyway. Before Rosalie told me the news, I was already past trying to live through one week at a time, or even one day. I was fighting to make it through a single hour. It was only a matter of time before I showed up at your window and begged you to take me back. I'd be happy to beg now, if you'd like that.\" I grimaced. \"Be serious, please.\" \"Oh, I am,\" he insisted, glaring now. \"Will you please try to hear what I'm telling you? Will you let me attempt to explain what you mean to me?\" He waited, studying my face as he spoke to make sure I was really listening. \"Before you, Bella, my life was like a moonless night. Very dark, but there were stars\u2014points of light and reason\u2026 And then you shot across my sky like a meteor. Suddenly everything was on fire; there was brilliancy, there was beauty. When you were gone, when the meteor had fallen over the horizon, everything went black. Nothing had changed, but my eyes were blinded by the light. I couldn't see the stars anymore. And there was no more reason for anything.\" I wanted to believe him. But this was my life without him that he was describing, not the other way around. \"Your eyes will adjust,\" I mumbled. \"That's just the problem\u2014they can't.\" \"What about your distractions?\" He laughed without a trace of humor. \"Just part of the lie, love. There was no distraction from the\u2026 the agony. My heart hasn't beat in almost ninety years, but this was different. It was like my heart was gone\u2014like I was hollow. Like I'd left everything that was inside me here with you.\" \"That's funny,\" I muttered. He arched one perfect eyebrow. \"Funny? \" \"I meant strange\u2014I thought it was just me. Lots of pieces of me went missing, too. I haven't been able to really breathe in so long.\" I filled my lungs, luxuriating in the sensation. \"And my heart. That was definitely lost.\" He closed his eyes and laid his ear over my heart again. I let my cheek press against his hair, felt the texture of it on my skin, smelled the delicious scent of him. \"Tracking wasn't a distraction then?\" I asked, curious, and also needing to distract myself. I was very much in danger of hoping. I wouldn't be able to stop myself for long. My heart throbbed, singing in my chest. \"No.\" He sighed. \"That was never a distraction. It was an obligation.\" \"What does that mean?\" \"It means that, even though I never expected any danger from Victoria, I wasn't going to let her get away with\u2026 Well, like I said, I was horrible at it. I traced her as far as Texas, but then I followed a false lead down to Brazil\u2014and really she came here.\" He groaned. \"I wasn't even on the right continent! And all the while, worse than my worst fears\u2014\" \"You were hunting Victoria?\" I half-shrieked as soon as I could find my voice, shooting through two octaves. Charlie's distant snores stuttered, and then picked up a regular rhythm again. \"Not well,\" Edward answered, studying my outraged expression with a confused look. \"But I'll do better this time. She won't be tainting perfectly good air by breathing in and out for much longer.\" \"That is\u2026 out of the question,\" I managed to choke out. Insanity. Even if he had Emmett or Jasper help him. Even if he had Emmett and Jasper help. It was worse than my other imaginings: Jacob Black standing across a small space from Victoria's vicious and feline figure. I couldn't bear to picture Edward there, even though he was so much more durable than my half-human best friend.  \"It's too late for her. I might have let the other time slide, but not now, not after\u2014\" I interrupted him again, trying to sound calm. \"Didn't you just promise that you weren't going to leave?\" I asked, fighting the words as I said them, nor letting them plant themselves in my heart. \"That isn't exactly compatible with an extended tracking expedition, is it?\" He frowned. A snarl began to build low in his chest. \"I will keep my promise, Bella. But Victoria\"\u2014the snarl became more pronounced\u2014\"is going to die. Soon.\" \"Let's not be hasty,\" I said, trying to hide my panic. \"Maybe she's not coming back. Jake's pack probably scared her off. There's really no reason to go looking for her. Besides, I've got bigger problems than Victoria.\" Edward's eyes narrowed, but he nodded. \"It's true. The werewolves are a problem.\" I snorted. \"I wasn't talking about Jacob. My problems are a lot worse that a handful of adolescent wolves getting themselves into trouble.\" Edward looked as if he were about to say something, and then thought better of it. His teeth clicked together, and he spoke through them. \"Really?\" he asked. \"Then what would be your greatest problem? That would make Victoria's returning for you seem like such an inconsequential matter in comparison?\" \"How about the second greatest?\" I hedged. \"All right,\" he agreed, suspicious. I paused. I wasn't sure I could say the name. \"There are others who are coming to look for me,\" I reminded him in a subdued whisper. He sighed, but the reaction was not as strong as I would have imagined after his response to Victoria. \"The Volturi are only the second greatest?\" \"You don't seem that upset about it,\" I noted. \"Well, we have plenty of time to think it through. Time means something very different to them than it does to you, or even me. They count years the way you count days. I wouldn't be surprised if you were thirty before you crossed their minds again,\" he added lightly. Horror washed through me. Thirty. So his promises meant nothing, in the end. If I were going to turn thirty someday, then he couldn't be planning on staying long. The harsh pain of this knowledge made me realize that I'd already begun to hope, without giving myself permission to do so. \"You don't have to be afraid,\" he said, anxious as he watched the tears dew up again on the rims of my eyes. \"I won't let them hurt you.\" \"While you're here.\" Not that I cared what happened to me when he left. He took my face between his two stone hands, holding it tightly while his midnight eyes glared into mine with the gravitational force of a black hole. \"I will never leave you again.\" \"But you said thirty,\" I whispered. The tears leaked over the edge. \"What? You're going to stay, but let me get all old anyway? Right.\" His eyes softened, while his mouth went hard. \"That's exactly what I'm going to do. What choice have I?\u00a0 I cannot be without you, but I will not destroy your soul.\" \"Is this really\u2026\" I tried to keep my voice even, but this question was too hard. I remembered his face when Aro had almost begged him to consider making me immortal. The sick look there. Was this fixation with keeping me human really about my soul, or was it because he wasn't sure that he wanted me around that long? \"Yes?\" he asked, waiting for my question. I asked a different one. Almost\u2014but not quite\u2014as hard. \"But what about when I get so old that people think I'm your mother? Your \u00a0grandmother?\" My voice was pale with revulsion\u2014I could see Gran's face again in the dream mirror. His whole face was soft now. He brushed the tears from my cheek with his lips. \"That doesn't mean anything to me,\" he breathed against my skin. \"You will always be the most beautiful thing in my world.\u00a0 Of course\u2026\" He hesitated, flinching slightly. \"If you outgrew me\u2014if you wanted something more\u2014I would understand that, Bella. I promise I wouldn't stand in your way if you wanted to leave me.\" His eyes were liquid onyx and utterly sincere. He spoke as if he'd put endless amounts of thought into this asinine plan. \"You do realize that I'll die eventually, right?\" I demanded. He'd thought about this part, too. \"I'll follow after as soon as I can.\" \"That is seriously\u2026\"I looked for the right word. \"Sick.\" \"Bella, it's the only right way left\u2014\" \"Let's just back up for a minute,\" I said; feeling angry made it so much easier to be clear, decisive. \"You do remember the Volturi, right? I can't stay human forever. They'll kill me. Even if they don't think of me till I'm thirty\"\u2014I hissed the word\u2014\"do you really think they'll forget?\" \"No,\" he answered slowly, shaking his head. \"They won't forget. But\u2026\" \"But?\" He grinned while I stared at him warily. Maybe I wasn't the only crazy one. \"I have a few plans.\" \"And these plans,\" I said, my voice getting more acidic with each word. \"These plans all center around me staying human.\" My attitude hardened his expression. \"Naturally.\" His tone was brusque, his divine face arrogant. We glowered at each other for a long minute. Then I took a deep breath, squared my shoulders, I pushed his arms away so that I could sit up. \"Do you want me to leave?\" he asked, and it made my heart flutter to see that this idea hurt him, though he tried not to show it. \"No,\" I told him. \"I'm leaving.\" He watched me suspiciously as I climbed out of the bed and fumbled around in the dark room, looking for my shoes. \"May I ask where you are going.'\" he asked. \"I'm going to your house,\" I told him, still feeling around blindly. He got up and came to my side. \"Here are your shoes. How did you plan to get there?\" \"My truck.\" \"That will probably wake Charlie,\" he offered as a deterrent. I sighed. \"I know. But honestly, I'll be grounded for weeks as it is. How much more trouble can I really get in?\" \"None. He'll blame me, not you.\" \"If you have a better idea, I'm all ears.\" \"Stay here,\" he suggested, but his expression wasn't hopeful. \"No dice. But you go ahead and make yourself at home,\" I encouraged, surprised at how natural my teasing sounded, and headed for the door. He was there before me, blocking my way. I frowned, and turned for the window. It wasn't really that far to the ground, and it was mostly grass beneath\u2026 \"Okay,\" he sighed. \"I'll give you a ride.\" I shrugged. \"Either way. But you probably should be there, too.\" \"And why is that?\" \"Because you're extraordinarily opinionated, and I'm sure you'll want a chance to air your views.\" \"My views on which subject?\" He asked through his teeth. \"This isn't just about you anymore. You're not the center of the universe, you know.\" My own personal universe was, of course, a different story. \"If you're going to bring the Volturi down on us over something as stupid as leaving me human, then your family ought to have a say.\" \"A say in what?\" he asked, each word distinct. \"My mortality. I'm putting it to a vote.\"",
