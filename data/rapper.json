But what about Tom the motorcycle shop owner, Joe Knight and Karen Berman? \t\u00a0 \tTom, Joe and Karen all appear in a comic book called \"Financial Intelligence.\" But Mr. Knight and Ms. Berman are real people. In two thousand six, they wrote a book called \u201cFinancial Intelligence: A Manager\u2019s Guide to Knowing What the Numbers Really Mean.\u201d It was written for people who need to learn quickly about accounting. The book explains, in simple ways, often-complex methods of keeping financial information. It became a best-seller.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \u200b\u200bThis month, publisher SmarterComics released a comic book that provides the same information in easy-to-understand, picture form. The new book is a combination of a textbook and a graphic novel. It tells the story of Tom, a mechanic who must quickly learn how to direct the motorcycle repair shop his father founded. Tom has no experience with finance, and is struggling with the business. Joe Knight and Karen Berman help him. Artist Dave Wachter made illustrations for the comic book. \t\u00a0 \tFranco Arda is the founder and head of SmarterComics. He formerly worked as an investment banker. He started the company almost three years ago with his own money. He wanted to create educational comics that increase understanding. \t\u00a0 \tFRANCO ARDA: \u201cI think almost everybody understands the phrase that \u2018a picture says a thousand words,\u2019 so, I mean, mentally, probably ninety percent of us grew up with comics and they understand that comics or illustrations help learning a concept much quicker than just text alone.\u201d \t\u00a0 \t\u200bFranco Arda says \u201cFinancial Intelligence\u201d will help readers quickly understand many of the major areas of accounting.\u00a0 \t\u00a0 \tFRANCO ARDA: \u201cWithin an hour, you kind of get the idea of accounting, very quickly and not in a boring way. So you get these illustrations, you get the basics of accounting and you get some balance sheets and cash-flow statements.\u201d\u00a0 \t \tThe new comic book is available in paperback. There will also be versions for iPad and iPhone users. \t\u00a0 \tThe website Entrepreneur.com named SmarterComics to its list of 100 Brilliant Companies of 2012.\u00a0 The company has created comic book versions of more than ten other books. These include \u201cThink and Grow Rich\u201d by Napoleon Hill, \u201cThe Prince\u201d by Niccolo Machiavelli and \u201cThe Art of War\u201d by Sun Tzu. Later this year, SmarterComics plans to release a comic book by <em>rapper</em> 50Cent.",
