            "en": "21          21. PHONE CALL I could feel it was too early again when I woke, and I knew I was getting the schedule of my days and nights slowly reversed. I lay in my bed and listened to the quiet voices of Alice and Jasper in the other room. That they were loud enough for me to hear at all was strange. I rolled till my feet touched the floor and then staggered to the living room. The clock on the TV said it was just after two in the morning. Alice and Jasper were sitting together on the sofa, Alice sketching again while Jasper looked over her shoulder. They didn't look up when I entered, too engrossed in Alice's work. I crept to Jasper's side to peek. \"Did she see something more?\" I asked him quietly. \"Yes. Something's brought him back to the room with the VCR, but it's light now.\" I watched as Alice drew a square room with dark beams across its low ceiling. The walls were paneled in wood, a little too dark, out of date.  The floor had a dark carpet with a pattern in it. There was a large window against the south wall, and an opening through the west wall led to the living room. One side of that entrance was stone \u2014 a large tan stone fireplace that was open to both rooms. The focus of the room from this perspective, the TV and VCR, balanced on a too-small wooden stand, were in the southwest corner of the room. An aged sectional sofa curved around in front of the TV, a round coffee table in front of it. \"The phone goes there,\" I whispered, pointing. Two pairs of eternal eyes stared at me. \"That's my mother's house.\" Alice was already off the couch, phone in hand, dialing. I stared at the precise rendering of my mother's family room. Uncharacteristically, Jasper slid closer to me. He lightly touched his hand to my shoulder, and the physical contact seemed to make his calming influence stronger. The panic stayed dull, unfocused. Alice's lips were trembling with the speed of her words, the low buzzing impossible to decipher. I couldn't concentrate. \"Bella,\" Alice said. I looked at her numbly. \"Bella, Edward is coming to get you. He and Emmett and Carlisle are going to take you somewhere, to hide you for a while.\" \"Edward is coming?\" The words were like a life vest, holding my head above the flood. \"Yes, he's catching the first flight out of Seattle. We'll meet him at the airport, and you'll leave with him.\" \"But, my mother\u2026 he came here for my mother, Alice!\" Despite Jasper, the hysteria bubbled up in my voice. \"Jasper and I will stay till she's safe.\" \"I can't win, Alice. You can't guard everyone I know forever. Don't you see what he's doing? He's not tracking me at all. He'll find someone, he'll hurt someone I love\u2026 Alice, I can't \u2014\" \"We'll catch him, Bella,\" she assured me. \"And what if you get hurt, Alice? Do you think that's okay with me? Do you think it's only my human family he can hurt me with?\" Alice looked meaningfully at Jasper. A deep, heavy fog of lethargy washed over me, and my eyes closed without my permission. My mind struggled against the fog, realizing what was happening. I forced my eyes open and stood up, stepping away from Jasper's hand. \"I don't want to go back to sleep,\" I snapped. I walked to my room and shut the door, slammed it really, so I could be free to go to pieces privately. This time Alice didn't follow me. For three and a half hours I stared at the wall, curled in a ball, rocking. My mind went around in circles, trying to come up with some way out of this nightmare. There was no escape, no reprieve. I could see only one possible end looming darkly in my future. The only question was how many other people would be hurt before I reached it. The only solace, the only hope I had left, was knowing that I would see Edward soon. Maybe, if I could just see his face again, I would also be able to see the solution that eluded me now. When the phone rang, I returned to the front room, a little ashamed of my behavior. I hoped I hadn't offended either of them, that they would know how grateful I was for the sacrifices they were making on my account. Alice was talking as rapidly as ever, but what caught my attention was that, for the first time, Jasper was not in the room. I looked at the clock \u2014 it was five-thirty in the morning. \"They're just boarding their plane,\" Alice told me. \"They'll land at nine-forty-five.\" Just a few more hours to keep breathing till he was here. \"Where's Jasper?\" \"He went to check out.\" \"You aren't staying here?\" \"No, we're relocating closer to your mother's house.\" My stomach twisted uneasily at her words. But the phone rang again, distracting me. She looked surprised, but I was already walking forward, reaching hopefully for the phone. \"Hello?\" Alice asked. \"No, she's right here.\" She held the phone out to me. Your mother, she mouthed. \"Hello?\" \"Bella? Bella?\" It was my mother's voice, in a familiar tone I had heard a thousand times in my childhood, anytime I'd gotten too close to the edge of the sidewalk or strayed out of her sight in a crowded place. It was the sound of panic. I sighed. I'd been expecting this, though I'd tried to make my message as unalarming as possible without lessening the urgency of it. \"Calm down, Mom,\" I said in my most soothing voice, walking slowly away from Alice. I wasn't sure if I could lie as <em>convincingly</em> with her eyes on me. \"Everything is fine, okay? Just give me a minute and I'll explain everything, I promise.\" I paused, surprised that she hadn't interrupted me yet. \"Mom?\" \"Be very careful not to say anything until I tell you to.\" The voice I heard now was as unfamiliar as it was unexpected. It was a man's tenor voice, a very pleasant, generic voice \u2014 the kind of voice that you heard in the background of luxury car commercials. He spoke very quickly. \"Now, I don't need to hurt your mother, so please do exactly as I say, and she'll be fine.\" He paused for a minute while I listened in mute horror. \"That's very good,\" he congratulated. \"Now repeat after me, and do try to sound natural. Please say, 'No, Mom, stay where you are.'\" \"No, Mom, stay where you are.\" My voice was barely more than a whisper. \"I can see this is going to be difficult.\" The voice was amused, still light and friendly. \"Why don't you walk into another room now so your face doesn't ruin everything? There's no reason for your mother to suffer. As you're walking, please say, 'Mom, please listen to me.' Say it now.\" \"Mom, please listen to me,\" my voice pleaded. I walked very slowly to the bedroom, feeling Alice's worried stare on my back. I shut the door behind me, trying to think clearly through the terror that gripped my brain. \"There now, are you alone? Just answer yes or no.\"  \"Yes.\" \"But they can still hear you, I'm sure.\" \"Yes.\" \"All right, then,\" the agreeable voice continued, \"say, 'Mom, trust me.'\" \"Mom, trust me.\" \"This worked out rather better than I expected. I was prepared to wait, but your mother arrived ahead of schedule. It's easier this way, isn't it? Less suspense, less anxiety for you.\" I waited. \"Now I want you to listen very carefully. I'm going to need you to get away from your friends; do you think you can do that? Answer yes or no.\" \"No.\" \"I'm sorry to hear that. I was hoping you would be a little more creative than that. Do you think you could get away from them if your mother's life depended on it? Answer yes or no.\" Somehow, there had to be a way. I remembered that we were going to the airport. Sky Harbor International Airport: crowded, confusingly laid out\u2026 \"Yes.\" \"That's better. I'm sure it won't be easy, but if I get the slightest hint that you have any company, well, that would be very bad for your mother,\" the friendly voice promised. \"You must know enough about us by now to realize how quickly I would know if you tried to bring anyone along with you. And how little time I would need to deal with your mother if that was the case. Do you understand? Answer yes or no.\" \"Yes.\" My voice broke. \"Very good, Bella. Now this is what you have to do. I want you to go to your mother's house. Next to the phone there will be a number. Call it, and I'll tell you where to go from there.\" I already knew where I would go, and where this would end. But I would follow his instructions exactly. \"Can you do that? Answer yes or no.\" \"Yes.\" \"Before noon, please, Bella. I haven't got all day,\" he said politely. \"Where's Phil?\" I asked tersely. \"Ah, be careful now, Bella. Wait until I ask you to speak, please.\" I waited. \"It's important, now, that you don't make your friends suspicious when you go back to them.  Tell them that your mother called, and that you talked her out of coming home for the time being. Now repeat after me, 'Thank you, Mom.' Say it now.\" \"Thank you, Mom.\" The tears were coming. I tried to fight them back. \"Say, 'I love you, Mom, I'll see you soon.' Say it now.\" \"I love you, Mom.\" My voice was thick. \"I'll see you soon,\" I promised. \"Goodbye, Bella. I look forward to seeing you again.\" He hung up. I held the phone to my ear. My joints were frozen with terror \u2014 I couldn't unbend my fingers to drop it. I knew I had to think, but my head was filled with the sound of my mother's panic. Seconds ticked by while I fought for control.  Slowly, slowly, my thoughts started to break past that brick wall of pain. To plan. For I had no choices now but one: to go to the mirrored room and die. I had no guarantees, nothing to give to keep my mother alive. I could only hope that James would be satisfied with winning the game, that beating Edward would be enough. Despair gripped me; there was no way to bargain, nothing I could offer or withhold that could influence him. But I still had no choice. I had to try. I pushed the terror back as well as I could. My decision was made. It did no good to waste time agonizing over the outcome. I had to think clearly, because Alice and Jasper were waiting for me, and evading them was absolutely essential, and absolutely impossible. I was suddenly grateful that Jasper was gone. If he had been here to feel my anguish in the last five minutes, how could I have kept them from being suspicious? I choked back the dread, the anxiety, tried to stifle it. I couldn't afford it now. I didn't know when he would return. I concentrated on my escape. I had to hope that my familiarity with the airport would turn the odds in my favor. Somehow, I had to keep Alice away\u2026 I knew Alice was in the other room waiting for me, curious. But I had to deal with one more thing in private, before Jasper was back. I had to accept that I wouldn't see Edward again, not even one last glimpse of his face to carry with me to the mirror room. I was going to hurt him, and I couldn't say goodbye. I let the waves of torture wash over me, have their way for a time. Then I pushed them back, too, and went to face Alice. The only expression I could manage was a dull, dead look. I saw her alarm and I didn't wait for her to ask. I had just one script and I'd never manage improvisation now. \"My mom was worried, she wanted to come home. But it's okay, I convinced her to stay away.\" My voice was lifeless. \"We'll make sure she's fine, Bella, don't worry.\" I turned away; I couldn't let her see my face. My eye fell on a blank page of the hotel stationery on the desk. I went to it slowly, a plan forming. There was an envelope there, too. That was good. \"Alice,\" I asked slowly, without turning, keeping my voice level. \"If I write a letter for my mother, would you give it to her? Leave it at the house, I mean.\" \"Sure, Bella.\" Her voice was careful. She could see me coming apart at the seams. I had to keep my emotions under better control.  I went into the bedroom again, and knelt next to the little bedside table to write. \"Edward,\" I wrote. My hand was shaking, the letters were hardly legible. I love you. I am so sorry. He has my mom, and I have to try. I know it may not work. I am so very, very sorry. Don't be angry with Alice and Jasper. If I get away from them it will be a miracle. Tell them thank you for me. Alice especially, please.  And please, please, don't come after him. That's what he wants. I think.  I can't bear it if anyone has to be hurt because of me, especially you. Please, this is the only thing I can ask you now. For me. I love you. Forgive me. Bella I folded the letter carefully, and sealed it in the envelope. Eventually he would find it. I only hoped he would understand, and listen to me just this once. And then I carefully sealed away my heart.",

            "en": "24           24. AN IMPASSE My eyes opened to a bright, white light. I was in an unfamiliar room, a white room. The wall beside me was covered in long vertical blinds; over my head, the glaring lights blinded me. I was propped up on a hard, uneven bed \u2014 a bed with rails. The pillows were flat and lumpy. There was an annoying beeping sound somewhere close by. I hoped that meant I was still alive. Death shouldn't be this uncomfortable.  My hands were all twisted up with clear tubes, and something was taped across my face, under my nose. I lifted my hand to rip it off. \"No, you don't.\" And cool fingers caught my hand. \"Edward?\" I turned my head slightly, and his exquisite face was just inches from mine, his chin resting on the edge of my pillow. I realized again that I was alive, this time with gratitude and elation. \"Oh, Edward, I'm so sorry!\" \"Shhhh,\" he shushed me. \"Everything's all right now.\" \"What happened?\" I couldn't remember clearly, and my mind rebelled against me as I tried to recall. \"I was almost too late. I could have been too late,\" he whispered, his voice tormented. \"I was so stupid, Edward. I thought he had my mom.\" \"He tricked us all.\" \"I need to call Charlie and my mom,\" I realized through the haze. \"Alice called them. Ren\u00e9e is here \u2014 well, here in the hospital. She's getting something to eat right now.\" \"She's here?\" I tried to sit up, but the spinning in my head accelerated, and his hand pushed me gently down onto the pillows. \"She'll be back soon,\" he promised. \"And you need to stay still.\" \"But what did you tell her?\" I panicked. I had no interest in being soothed. My mom was here and I was recovering from a vampire attack. \"Why did you tell her I'm here?\" \"You fell down two flights of stairs and through a window.\" He paused.\u00a0 \"You have to admit, it could happen.\" I sighed, and it hurt. I stared down at my body under the sheet, the huge lump that was my leg. \"How bad am I?\" I asked. \"You have a broken leg, four broken ribs, some cracks in your skull, bruises covering every inch of your skin, and you've lost a lot of blood.  They gave you a few transfusions. I didn't like it \u2014 it made you smell all wrong for a while.\" \"That must have been a nice change for you.\" \"No, I like how you smell.\" \"How did you do it?\" I asked quietly. He knew what I meant at once. \"I'm not sure.\" He looked away from my wondering eyes, lifting my gauze-wrapped hand from the bed and holding it gently in his, careful not to disrupt the wire connecting me to one of the monitors. I waited patiently for the rest. He sighed without returning my gaze. \"It was impossible\u2026 to stop,\" he whispered. \"Impossible. But I did.\" He looked up finally, with half a smile. \"I must love you.\" \"Don't I taste as good as I smell?\" I smiled in response. That hurt my face. \"Even better \u2014 better than I'd imagined.\" \"I'm sorry,\" I apologized. He raised his eyes to the ceiling. \"Of all the things to apologize for.\" \"What should I apologize for?\" \"For very nearly taking yourself away from me forever.\" \"I'm sorry,\" I apologized again. \"I know why you did it.\" His voice was comforting. \"It was still irrational, of course. You should have waited for me, you should have told me.\" \"You wouldn't have let me go.\" \"No,\" he agreed in a grim tone, \"I wouldn't.\" Some very unpleasant memories were beginning to come back to me. I shuddered, and then winced. He was instantly anxious. \"Bella, what's wrong?\" \"What happened to James?\" \"After I pulled him off you, Emmett and Jasper took care of him.\" There was a fierce note of regret in his voice. This confused me. \"I didn't see Emmett and Jasper there.\" \"They had to leave the room\u2026 there was a lot of blood.\" \"But you stayed.\" \"Yes, I stayed.\" \"And Alice, and Carlisle\u2026\" I said in wonder. \"They love you, too, you know.\" A flash of painful images from the last time I'd seen Alice reminded me of something. \"Did Alice see the tape?\" I asked anxiously. \"Yes.\" A new sound darkened his voice, a tone of sheer hatred. \"She was always in the dark, that's why she didn't remember.\" \"I know. She understands now.\" His voice was even, but his face was black with fury. I tried to reach his face with my free hand, but something stopped me. I glanced down to see the IV pulling at my hand. \"Ugh.\" I winced. \"What is it?\" he asked anxiously \u2014 distracted, but not enough. The bleakness did not entirely leave his eyes. \"Needles,\" I explained, looking away from the one in my hand. I concentrated on a warped ceiling tile and tried to breathe deeply despite the ache in my ribs. \"Afraid of a needle,\" he muttered to himself under his breath, shaking his head. \"Oh, a sadistic vampire, intent on torturing her to death, sure, no problem, she runs off to meet him. An IV, on the other hand\u2026\" I rolled my eyes. I was pleased to discover that this reaction, at least, was pain-free. I decided to change the subject. \"Why are you here?\" I asked. He stared at me, first confusion and then hurt touching his eyes. His brows pulled together as he frowned. \"Do you want me to leave?\" \"No!\" I protested, horrified by the thought. \"No, I meant, why does my mother think you're here? I need to have my story straight before she gets back.\" \"Oh,\" he said, and his forehead smoothed back into marble. \"I came to Phoenix to talk some sense into you, to convince you to come back to Forks.\" His wide eyes were so earnest and sincere, I almost believed him myself. \"You agreed to see me, and you drove out to the hotel where I was staying with Carlisle and Alice \u2014 of course I was here with parental supervision,\" he inserted virtuously, \"but you tripped on the stairs on the way to my room and\u2026 well, you know the rest. You don't need to remember any details, though; you have a good excuse to be a little muddled about the finer points.\" I thought about it for a moment. \"There are a few flaws with that story. Like no broken windows.\" \"Not really,\" he said. \"Alice had a little bit too much fun fabricating evidence. It's all been taken care of very <em>convincingly</em> \u2014 you could probably sue the hotel if you wanted to. You have nothing to worry about,\" he promised, stroking my cheek with the lightest of touches. \"Your only job now is to heal.\" I wasn't so lost to the soreness or the fog of medication that I didn't respond to his touch. The beeping of the monitor jumped around erratically \u2014 now he wasn't the only one who could hear my heart misbehave. \"That's going to be embarrassing,\" I muttered to myself. He chuckled, and a speculative look came into his eye. \"Hmm, I wonder\u2026\" He leaned in slowly; the beeping noise accelerated wildly before his lips even touched me. But when they did, though with the most gentle of pressure, the beeping stopped altogether. He pulled back abruptly, his anxious expression turning to relief as the monitor reported the restarting of my heart. \"It seems that I'm going to have to be even more careful with you than usual.\" He frowned. \"I was not finished kissing you,\" I complained. \"Don't make me come over there.\" He grinned, and bent to press his lips lightly to mine. The monitor went wild. But then his lips were taut. He pulled away. \"I think I hear your mother,\" he said, grinning again. \"Don't leave me,\" I cried, an irrational surge of panic flooding through me. I couldn't let him go \u2014 he might disappear from me again. He read the terror in my eyes for a short second. \"I won't,\" he promised solemnly, and then he smiled. \"I'll take a nap.\" He moved from the hard plastic chair by my side to the turquoise faux-leather recliner at the foot of my bed, leaning it all the way back, and closing his eyes. He was perfectly still. \"Don't forget to breathe,\" I whispered sarcastically. He took a deep breath, his eyes still closed. I could hear my mother now. She was talking to someone, maybe a nurse, and she sounded tired and upset. I wanted to jump out of the bed and run to her, to calm her, promise that everything was fine. But I wasn't in any sort of shape for jumping, so I waited impatiently. The door opened a crack, and she peeked through. \"Mom!\" I whispered, my voice full of love and relief. She took in Edward's still form on the recliner, and tiptoed to my bedside. \"He never leaves, does he?\" she mumbled to herself. \"Mom, I'm so glad to see you!\" She bent down to hug me gently, and I felt warm tears falling on my cheeks. \"Bella, I was so upset!\" \"I'm sorry, Mom. But everything's fine now, it's okay,\" I comforted her. \"I'm just glad to finally see your eyes open.\" She sat on the edge of my bed. I suddenly realized I didn't have any idea when it was. \"How long have they been closed?\" \"It's Friday, hon, you've been out for a while.\" \"Friday?\" I was shocked. I tried to remember what day it had been when\u2026 but I didn't want to think about that. \"They had to keep you sedated for a while, honey \u2014 you've got a lot of injuries.\" \"I know.\" I could feel them. \"You're lucky Dr. Cullen was there. He's such a nice man\u2026 very young, though. And he looks more like a model than a doctor\u2026\" \"You met Carlisle?\" \"And Edward's sister Alice. She's a lovely girl.\" \"She is,\" I agreed wholeheartedly. She glanced over her shoulder at Edward, lying with his eyes closed in the chair. \"You didn't tell me you had such good friends in Forks.\" I cringed, and then moaned. \"What hurts?\" she demanded anxiously, turning back to me. Edward's eyes flashed to my face. \"It's fine,\" I assured them. \"I just have to remember not to move.\" He lapsed back into his phony slumber. I took advantage of my mother's momentary distraction to keep the subject from returning to my less-than-candid behavior. \"Where's Phil?\" I asked quickly. \"Florida \u2014 oh, Bella! You'll never guess! Just when we were about to leave, the best news!\" \"Phil got signed?\" I guessed. \"Yes! How did you guess! The Suns, can you believe it?\" \"That's great, Mom,\" I said as enthusiastically as I could manage, though I had little idea what that meant. \"And you'll like Jacksonville so much,\" she gushed while I stared at her vacantly. \"I was a little bit worried when Phil started talking about Akron, what with the snow and everything, because you know how I hate the cold, but now Jacksonville! It's always sunny, and the humidity really isn't that bad. We found the cutest house, yellow, with white trim, and a porch just like in an old movie, and this huge oak tree, and it's just a few minutes from the ocean, and you'll have your own bathroom \u2014\" \"Wait, Mom!\" I interrupted. Edward still had his eyes closed, but he looked too tense to pass as asleep. \"What are you talking about? I'm not going to Florida. I live in Forks.\" \"But you don't have to anymore, silly,\" she laughed. \"Phil will be able to be around so much more now\u2026 we've talked about it a lot, and what I'm going to do is trade off on the away games, half the time with you, half the time with him.\" \"Mom.\" I hesitated, wondering how best to be diplomatic about this. \"I want to live in Forks. I'm already settled in at school, and I have a couple of girlfriends\" \u2014 she glanced toward Edward again when I reminded her of friends, so I tried another direction \u2014 \"and Charlie needs me. \u00a0He's just all alone up there, and he can't cook at all.\" \"You want to stay in Forks?\" she asked, bewildered. The idea was inconceivable to her. And then her eyes flickered back toward Edward.  \"Why?\" \"I told you \u2014 school, Charlie \u2014 ouch!\" I'd shrugged. Not a good idea. .  Her hands fluttered helplessly over me, trying to find a safe place to pat. She made do with my forehead; it was unbandaged. \"Bella, honey, you hate Forks,\" she reminded me. \"It's not so bad.\" She frowned and looked back and forth between Edward and me, this time very deliberately. \"Is it this boy?\" she whispered. I opened my mouth to lie, but her eyes were scrutinizing my face, and I knew she would see through that. \"He's part of it,\" I admitted. No need to confess how big a part. \"So, have you had a chance to talk with Edward?\" I asked. \"Yes.\" She hesitated, looking at his perfectly still form. \"And I want to talk to you about that.\" Uh-oh. \"What about?\" I asked. \"I think that boy is in love with you,\" she accused, keeping her voice low. \"I think so, too,\" I confided. \"And how do you feel about him?\" She only poorly concealed the raging curiosity in her voice. I sighed, looking away. As much as I loved my mom, this was not a conversation I wanted to have with her. \"I'm pretty crazy about him.\" There \u2014 that sounded like something a teenager with her first boyfriend might say. \"Well, he seems very nice, and, my goodness, he's incredibly good-looking, but you're so young, Bella\u2026\" Her voice was unsure; as far as I could remember, this was the first time since I was eight that she'd come close to trying to sound like a parental authority. I recognized the reasonable-but-firm tone of voice from talks I'd had with her about men. \"I know that, Mom. Don't worry about it. It's just a crush,\" I soothed her. \"That's right,\" she agreed, easily pleased. Then she sighed and glanced guiltily over her shoulder at the big, round clock on the wall. \"Do you need to go?\" She bit her lip. \"Phil's supposed to call in a little while\u2026 I didn't know you were going to wake up\u2026\" \"No problem, Mom.\" I tried to tone down the relief so she wouldn't get her feelings hurt. \"I won't be alone.\" \"I'll be back soon. I've been sleeping here, you know,\" she announced, proud of herself. \"Oh, Mom, you don't have to do that! You can sleep at home \u2014 I'll never notice.\" The swirl of painkillers in my brain was making it hard to concentrate even now, though, apparently, I'd been sleeping for days. \"I was too nervous,\" she admitted sheepishly. \"There's been some crime in the \u00a0neighborhood, and I don't like being there alone.\" \"Crime?\" I asked in alarm. \"Someone broke into that dance studio around the corner from the house and burned it to the ground \u2014 there's nothing left at all! And they left a stolen car right out front. Do you remember when you used to dance there, honey?\" \"I remember.\" I shivered, and winced. \"I can stay, baby, if you need me.\" \"No, Mom, I'll be fine. Edward will be with me.\" She looked like that might be why she wanted to stay. \"I'll be back tonight.\" It sounded as much like a warning as it sounded like a promise, and she glanced at Edward again as she said it. \"I love you, Mom.\" \"I love you, too, Bella. Try to be more careful when you walk, honey, I don't want to lose you.\" Edward's eyes stayed closed, but a wide grin flashed across his face. A nurse came bustling in then to check all my tubes and wires. My mother kissed my forehead, patted my gauze-wrapped hand, and left. The nurse was checking the paper readout on my heart monitor. \"Are you feeling anxious, honey? Your heart rate got a little high there.\" \"I'm fine,\" I assured her. \"I'll tell your RN that you're awake. She'll be in to see you in a minute.\" As soon as she closed the door, Edward was at my side. \"You stole a car?\" I raised my eyebrows. He smiled, unrepentant. \"It was a good car, very fast.\" \"How was your nap?\" I asked. \"Interesting.\" His eyes narrowed. \"What?\" He looked down while he answered. \"I'm surprised. I thought Florida\u2026 and your mother\u2026 well, I thought that's what you would want.\" I stared at him uncomprehendingly. \"But you'd be stuck inside all day in Florida. You'd only be able to come out at night, just like a real vampire.\" He almost smiled, but not quite. And then his face was grave. \"I would stay in Forks, Bella. Or somewhere like it,\" he explained. \"Someplace where I couldn't hurt you anymore.\" It didn't sink in at first. I continued to stare at him blankly as the words one by one clicked into place in my head like a ghastly puzzle. I was barely conscious of the sound of my heart accelerating, though, as my breathing became hyperventilation, I was aware of the sharp aching in my protesting ribs. He didn't say anything; he watched my face warily as the pain that had nothing to do with broken bones, pain that was infinitely worse, threatened to crush me. And then another nurse walked purposefully into the room. Edward sat still as stone as she took in my expression with a practiced eye before turning to the monitors. \"Time for more pain meds, sweetheart?\" she asked kindly, tapping the IV feed. \"No, no,\" I mumbled, trying to keep the agony out of my voice. \"I don't need anything.\" I couldn't afford to close my eyes now. \"No need to be brave, honey. It's better if you don't get too stressed out; you need to rest.\" She waited, but I just shook my head. \"Okay,\" she sighed. \"Hit the call button when you're ready.\" She gave Edward a stern look, and threw one more anxious glance at the machinery, before leaving. His cool hands were on my face; I stared at him with wild eyes. \"Shhh, Bella, calm down.\" \"Don't leave me,\" I begged in a broken voice. \"I won't,\" he promised. \"Now relax before I call the nurse back to sedate you.\" But my heart couldn't slow. \"Bella.\" He stroked my face anxiously. \"I'm not going anywhere. I'll be right here as long as you need me.\" \"Do you swear you won't leave me?\" I whispered. I tried to control the gasping, at least. My ribs were throbbing. He put his hands on either side of my face and brought his face close to mine. His eyes were wide and serious. \"I swear.\" The smell of his breath was soothing. It seemed to ease the ache of my breathing. He continued to hold my gaze while my body slowly relaxed and the beeping returned to a normal pace. His eyes were dark, closer to black than gold today. \"Better?\" he asked. \"Yes,\" I said cautiously. He shook his head and muttered something unintelligible. I thought I picked out the word \"overreaction.\" \"Why did you say that?\" I whispered, trying to keep my voice from shaking. \"Are you tired of having to save me all the time? Do you want me to go away?\" \"No, I don't want to be without you, Bella, of course not. Be rational.  And I have no problem with saving you, either \u2014 if it weren't for the fact that I was the one putting you in danger\u2026 that I'm the reason that you're here.\" \"Yes, you are the reason.\" I frowned. \"The reason I'm here \u2014 alive.\" \"Barely.\" His voice was just a whisper. \"Covered in gauze and plaster and hardly able to move.\" \"I wasn't referring to my most recent near-death experience,\" I said, growing irritated. \"I was thinking of the others \u2014 you can take your pick. If it weren't for you, I would be rotting away in the Forks cemetery.\" He winced at my words, but the haunted look didn't leave his eyes. \"That's not the worst part, though,\" he continued to whisper. He acted as if I hadn't spoken. \"Not seeing you there on the floor\u2026 crumpled and broken.\" His voice was choked. \"Not thinking I was too late. Not even hearing you scream in pain \u2014 all those unbearable memories that I'll carry with me for the rest of eternity. No, the very worst was feeling\u2026 knowing that I couldn't stop. Believing that I was going to kill you myself.\" \"But you didn't.\" \"I could have. So easily.\" I knew I needed to stay calm\u2026 but he was trying to talk himself into leaving me, and the panic fluttered in my lungs, trying to get out.  \"Promise me,\" I whispered. \"What?\" \"You know what.\" I was starting to get angry now. He was so stubbornly determined to dwell on the negative. He heard the change in my tone. His eyes tightened. \"I don't seem to be strong enough to stay away from you, so I suppose that you'll get your way\u2026 whether it kills you or not,\" he added roughly. \"Good.\" He hadn't promised, though \u2014 a fact that I had not missed. The panic was only barely contained; I had no strength left to control the anger. \"You told me how you stopped\u2026 now I want to know why,\" I demanded. \"Why?\" he repeated warily. \"Why you did it. Why didn't you just let the venom spread? By now I would be just like you.\" Edward's eyes seemed to turn flat black, and I remembered that this was something he'd never intended me to know. Alice must have been preoccupied by the things she'd learned about herself\u2026 or she'd been very careful with her thoughts around him \u2014 clearly, he'd had no idea that she'd filled me in on the mechanics of vampire conversions. He was surprised, and infuriated. His nostrils flared, his mouth looked as if it was chiseled from stone. He wasn't going to answer, that much was clear. \"I'll be the first to admit that I have no experience with relationships,\" I said. \"But it just seems logical\u2026 a man and woman have to be somewhat equal\u2026 as in, one of them can't always be swooping in and saving the other one. They have to save each other equally.\" He folded his arms on the side of my bed and rested his chin on his arms. His expression was smooth, the anger reined in. Evidently he'd decided he wasn't angry with me. I hoped I'd get a chance to warn Alice before he caught up with her. \"You have saved me,\" he said quietly. \"I can't always be Lois Lane,\" I insisted. \"I want to be Superman, too.\" \"You don't know what you're asking.\" His voice was soft; he stared intently at the edge of the pillowcase. \"I think I do.\" \"Bella, you don't know. I've had almost ninety years to think about this, and I'm still not sure.\" \"Do you wish that Carlisle hadn't saved you?\" \"No, I don't wish that.\" He paused before continuing. \"But my life was over. I wasn't giving anything up.\" \"You are my life. You're the only thing it would hurt me to lose.\" I was getting better at this. It was easy to admit how much I needed him. He was very calm, though. Decided. \"I can't do it, Bella. I won't do that to you.\" \"Why not?\" My throat rasped and the words weren't as loud as I'd meant them to be. \"Don't tell me it's too hard! After today, or I guess it was a few days ago\u2026 anyway, after that, it should be nothing.\" He glared at me. \"And the pain?\" he asked. I blanched. I couldn't help it. But I tried to keep my expression from showing how clearly I remembered the feeling\u2026 the fire in my veins. \"That's my problem,\" I said. \"I can handle it.\" \"It's possible to take bravery to the point where it becomes insanity.\" \"It's not an issue. Three days. Big deal.\" Edward grimaced again as my words reminded him that I was more informed than he had ever intended me to be. I watched him repress the anger, watched as his eyes grew speculative. \"Charlie?\" he asked curtly. \"Ren\u00e9e?\" Minutes passed in silence as I struggled to answer his question. I opened my mouth, but no sound came out. I closed it again. He waited, and his expression became triumphant because he knew I had no true answer. \"Look, that's not an issue either,\" I finally muttered; my voice was as unconvincing as it always was when I lied. \"Ren\u00e9e has always made the choices that work for her \u2014 she'd want me to do the same. And Charlie's resilient, he's used to being on his own. I can't take care of them forever. I have my own life to live.\" \"Exactly,\" he snapped. \"And I won't end it for you.\" \"If you're waiting for me to be on my deathbed, I've got news for you! I was just there!\" \"You're going to recover,\" he reminded me. I took a deep breath to calm myself, ignoring the spasm of pain it triggered. I stared at him, and he stared back. There was no compromise in his face. \"No,\" I said slowly. \"I'm not.\" His forehead creased. \"Of course you are. You may have a scar or two\u2026\" \"You're wrong,\" I insisted. \"I'm going to die.\" \"Really, Bella.\" He was anxious now. \"You'll be out of here in a few days. Two week at most.\" I glared at him. \"I may not die now\u2026 but I'm going to die sometime. Every minute of the day, I get closer. And I'm going to get old.\" He frowned as what I was saying sunk in, pressing his long fingers to his temples and closing his eyes. \"That's how it's supposed to happen. How it should happen. How it would have happened if I didn't exist \u2014 and I shouldn't exist.\" I snorted. He opened his eyes in surprise. \"That's stupid. That's like going to someone who's just won the lottery, taking their money, and saying, 'Look, let's just go back to how things should be. It's better that way.' And I'm not buying it.\" \"I'm hardly a lottery prize,\" he growled. \"That's right. You're much better.\" He rolled his eyes and set his lips. \"Bella, we're not having this discussion anymore. I refuse to damn you to an eternity of night and that's the end of it.\" \"If you think that's the end, then you don't know me very well,\" I warned him. \"You're not the only vampire I know.\" His eyes went black again. \"Alice wouldn't dare.\" And for a moment he looked so frightening that I couldn't help but believe it \u2014 I couldn't imagine someone brave enough to cross him. \"Alice already saw it, didn't she?\" I guessed. \"That's why the things she says upset you. She knows I'm going to be like you\u2026 someday.\" \"She's wrong. She also saw you dead, but that didn't happen, either.\" \"You'll never catch me betting against Alice.\" We stared at each other for a very long time. It was quiet except for the whirring of the machines, the beeping, the dripping, the ticking of the big clock on the wall. Finally, his expression softened. \"So where does that leave us?\" I wondered. He chuckled humorlessly. \"I believe it's called an impasse.\" I sighed. \"Ouch,\" I muttered. \"How are you feeling?\" he asked, eyeing the button for the nurse. \"I'm fine,\" I lied. \"I don't believe you,\" he said gently. \"I'm not going back to sleep.\" \"You need rest. All this arguing isn't good for you.\" \"So give in,\" I hinted. \"Nice try.\" He reached for the button. \"No!\" He ignored me. \"Yes?\" the speaker on the wall squawked. \"I think we're ready for more pain medication,\" he said calmly, ignoring my furious expression. \"I'll send in the nurse.\" The voice sounded very bored. \"I won't take it,\" I promised. He looked toward the sack of fluids hanging beside my bed. \"I don't think they're going to ask you to swallow anything.\" My heart rate started to climb. He read the fear in my eyes, and sighed in frustration. \"Bella, you're in pain. You need to relax so you can heal. Why are you being so difficult?  They're not going to put any more needles in you now.\" \"I'm not afraid of the needles,\" I mumbled. \"I'm afraid to close my eyes.\" Then he smiled his crooked smile, and took my face between his hands. \"I told you I'm not going anywhere. Don't be afraid. As long as it makes you happy, I'll be here.\" I smiled back, ignoring the ache in my cheeks. \"You're talking about forever, you know.\" \"Oh, you'll get over it \u2014 it's just a crush.\" I shook my head in disbelief\u2014 it made me dizzy. \"I was shocked when Ren\u00e9e swallowed that one. I know you know better.\" \"That's the beautiful thing about being human,\" he told me. \"Things change.\" My eyes narrowed. \"Don't hold your breath.\" He was laughing when the nurse came in, brandishing a syringe. \"Excuse me,\" she said brusquely to Edward. He got up and crossed to the end of the small room, leaning against the wall. He folded his arms and waited. I kept my eyes on him, still apprehensive. He met my gaze calmly. \"Here you go, honey.\" The nurse smiled as she injected the medicine into my tube. \"You'll feel better now.\" \"Thanks,\" I mumbled, unenthusiastic. It didn't take long. I could feel the drowsiness trickling through my bloodstream almost immediately. \"That ought to do it,\" she muttered as my eyelids drooped. She must have left the room, because something cold and smooth touched my face. \"Stay.\" The word was slurred. \"I will,\" he promised. His voice was beautiful, like a lullaby. \"Like I said, as long as it makes you happy\u2026 as long as it's what's best for you.\" I tried to shake my head, but it was too heavy. \"S not the same thing,\" I mumbled. He laughed. \"Don't worry about that now, Bella. You can argue with me when you wake up.\" I think I smiled. '\"Kay.\" I could feel his lips at my ear. \"I love you,\" he whispered. \"Me, too.\" \"I know,\" he laughed quietly. I turned my head slightly\u2026 searching. He knew what I was after. His lips touched mine gently. \"Thanks,\" I sighed. \"Anytime.\" I wasn't really there at all anymore. But I fought against the stupor weakly. There was just one more thing I wanted to tell him. \"Edward?\" I struggled to pronounce his name clearly. \"Yes?\" \"I'm betting on Alice,\" I mumbled. And then the night closed over me.",

            "en": "Ch\u1ea1ng V\u1ea1ng - Twilight             I'd never given much thought to how I would die \u2014 though I'd had reason enough in the last few months \u2014 but even if I had, I would not have imagined it like this. I stared without breathing across the long room, into the dark eyes of the hunter, and he looked pleasantly back at me. Surely it was a good way to die, in the place of someone else, someone I loved. Noble, even. That ought to count for something. I knew that if I'd never gone to Forks, I wouldn't be facing death now. But, terrified as I was, I couldn't bring myself to regret the decision. When life offers you a dream so far beyond any of your expectations, it's not reasonable to grieve when it comes to an end. The hunter smiled in a friendly way as he sauntered forward to kill me. 1.\u00a0 FIRST SIGHT My mother drove me to the airport with the windows rolled down. It was seventy-five degrees in Phoenix, the sky a perfect, cloudless blue. I was wearing my favorite shirt \u2014 sleeveless, white eyelet lace; I was wearing it as a farewell gesture. My carry-on item was a parka. In the Olympic Peninsula of northwest Washington State, a small town named Forks exists under a near-constant cover of clouds. It rains on this inconsequential town more than any other place in the United States of America. It was from this town and its gloomy, omnipresent shade that my mother escaped with me when I was only a few months old. It was in this town that I'd been compelled to spend a month every summer until I was fourteen. That was the year I finally put my foot down; these past three summers, my dad, Charlie, vacationed with me in California for two weeks instead.  It was to Forks that I now exiled myself\u2014 an action that I took with great horror. I detested Forks. I loved Phoenix. I loved the sun and the blistering heat. I loved the vigorous, sprawling city. \"Bella,\" my mom said to me \u2014 the last of a thousand times \u2014 before I got on the plane.\u201d You don't have to do this.\" My mom looks like me, except with short hair and laugh lines. I felt a spasm of panic as I stared at her wide, childlike eyes. How could I leave my loving, erratic, harebrained mother to fend for herself? Of course she had Phil now, so the bills would probably get paid, there would be food in the refrigerator, gas in her car, and someone to call when she got lost, but still\u2026 \"I want to go,\" I lied. I'd always been a bad liar, but I'd been saying this lie so frequently lately that it sounded almost convincing now. \"Tell Charlie I said hi.\" \"I will.\" \"I'll see you soon,\" she insisted.\u201d You can come home whenever you want \u2014 I'll come right back as soon as you need me.\" But I could see the sacrifice in her eyes behind the promise.  \"Don't worry about me,\" I urged.\u201d It'll be great. I love you, Mom.\" She hugged me tightly for a minute, and then I got on the plane, and she was gone. It's a four-hour flight from Phoenix to Seattle, another hour in a small plane up to Port Angeles, and then an hour drive back down to Forks. Flying doesn't bother me; the hour in the car with Charlie, though, I was a little worried about. Charlie had really been fairly nice about the whole thing. He seemed genuinely pleased that I was coming to live with him for the first time with any degree of permanence. He'd already gotten me registered for high school and was going to help me get a car. But it was sure to be awkward with Charlie. Neither of us was what anyone would call verbose, and I didn't know what there was to say regardless. I knew he was more than a little confused by my decision \u2014 like my mother before me, I hadn't made a secret of my distaste for Forks. When I landed in Port Angeles, it was raining. I didn't see it as an omen \u2014 just unavoidable. I'd already said my goodbyes to the sun. Charlie was waiting for me with the cruiser. This I was expecting, too.  Charlie is Police Chief Swan to the good people of Forks. My primary motivation behind buying a car, despite the scarcity of my funds, was that I refused to be driven around town in a car with red and blue lights on top. Nothing slows down traffic like a cop. Charlie gave me an awkward, one-armed hug when I stumbled my way off the plane. \"It's good to see you, Bells,\" he said, smiling as he automatically caught and steadied me.\u201d You haven't changed much. How's Ren\u00e9e?\" \"Mom's fine. It's good to see you, too, Dad.\" I wasn't allowed to call him Charlie to his face. I had only a few bags. Most of my Arizona clothes were too permeable for Washington. My mom and I had pooled our resources to supplement my winter wardrobe, but it was still scanty. It all fit easily into the trunk of the cruiser. \"I found a good car for you, really cheap,\" he announced when we were strapped in. \"What kind of car?\" I was suspicious of the way he said \"good car for you\" as opposed to just \"good car.\" \"Well, it's a truck actually, a Chevy.\" \"Where did you find it?\" \"Do you remember Billy Black down at La Push?\" La Push is the tiny Indian reservation on the coast. \"No.\" \"He used to go fishing with us during the summer,\" Charlie prompted.  That would explain why I didn't remember him. I do a good job of blocking painful, unnecessary things from my memory. \"He's in a wheelchair now,\" Charlie continued when I didn't respond, \"so he can't drive anymore, and he offered to sell me his truck cheap.\" \"What year is it?\" I could see from his change of expression that this was the question he was hoping I wouldn't ask. \"Well, Billy's done a lot of work on the engine \u2014 it's only a few years old, really.\" I hoped he didn't think so little of me as to believe I would give up that easily.\u201d When did he buy it?\" \"He bought it in 1984, I think.\" \"Did he buy it new?\" \"Well, no. I think it was new in the early sixties \u2014 or late fifties at the earliest,\" he admitted sheepishly. \"Ch \u2014 Dad, I don't really know anything about cars. I wouldn't be able to fix it if anything went wrong, and I couldn't afford a mechanic\u2026\" \"Really, Bella, the thing runs great. They don't build them like that anymore.\" The thing, I thought to myself\u2026 it had possibilities \u2014 as a nickname, at the very least. \"How cheap is cheap?\" After all, that was the part I couldn't compromise on. \"Well, honey, I kind of already bought it for you. As a homecoming gift.\" Charlie peeked sideways at me with a hopeful expression. Wow. Free. \"You didn't need to do that, Dad. I was going to buy myself a car.\" \"I don't mind. I want you to be happy here.\" He was looking ahead at the road when he said this. Charlie wasn't comfortable with expressing his emotions out loud. I inherited that from him. So I was looking straight ahead as I responded. \"That's really nice, Dad. Thanks. I really appreciate it.\" No need to add that my being happy in Forks is an impossibility. He didn't need to suffer along with me. And I never looked a free truck in the mouth \u2014 or engine. \"Well, now, you're welcome,\" he mumbled, embarrassed by my thanks.  We exchanged a few more comments on the weather, which was wet, and that was pretty much it for Conversation. We stared out the windows in silence. It was beautiful, of course; I couldn't deny that. Everything was green: the trees, their trunks covered with moss, their branches hanging with a canopy of it, the ground covered with ferns. Even the air filtered down greenly through the leaves. Eventually we made it to Charlie's. He still lived in the small, two-bedroom house that he'd bought with my mother in the early days of their marriage. Those were the only kind of days their marriage had \u2014 the early ones. There, parked on the street in front of the house that never changed, was my new \u2014 well, new to me \u2014 truck. It was a faded red color, with big, rounded fenders and a bulbous cab. To my intense surprise, I loved it. I didn't know if it would run, but I could see myself in it. Plus, it was one of those solid iron affairs that never gets damaged \u2014 the kind you see at the scene of an accident, paint unscratched, surrounded by the pieces of the foreign car it had destroyed. \"Wow, Dad, I love it! Thanks!\" Now my horrific day tomorrow would be just that much less dreadful. I wouldn't be faced with the choice of either walking two miles in the rain to school or accepting a ride in the Chief's cruiser. \"I'm glad you like it,\" Charlie said gruffly, embarrassed again. It took only one trip to get all my stuff upstairs. I got the west bedroom that faced out over the front yard. The room was familiar; it had been belonged to me since I was born. The wooden floor, the light blue walls, the peaked ceiling, the yellowed lace curtains around the window \u2014 these were all a part of my childhood. The only changes Charlie had ever made were switching the crib for a bed and adding a desk as I grew. The desk now held a secondhand computer, with the phone line for the modem stapled along the floor to the nearest phone jack. This was a stipulation from my mother, so that we could stay in touch easily. The rocking chair from my baby days was still in the corner. There was only one small bathroom at the top of the stairs, which I would have to share with Charlie. I was trying not to dwell too much on that fact. One of the best things about Charlie is he doesn't hover. He left me alone to unpack and get settled, a feat that would have been altogether impossible for my mother. It was nice to be alone, not to have to smile and look pleased; a relief to stare dejectedly out the window at the sheeting rain and let just a few tears escape. I wasn't in the mood to go on a real crying jag. I would save that for bedtime, when I would have to think about the coming morning. Forks High School had a frightening total of only three hundred and fifty-seven \u2014 now fifty-eight \u2014 students; there were more than seven hundred people in my junior class alone back home. All of the kids here had grown up together \u2014 their grandparents had been toddlers together. I would be the new girl from the big city, a curiosity, a freak. Maybe, if I looked like a girl from Phoenix should, I could work this to my advantage. But physically, I'd never fit in anywhere. I should be tan, sporty, blond \u2014 a volleyball player, or a cheerleader, perhaps \u2014 all the things that go with living in the valley of the sun. Instead, I was ivory-skinned, without even the excuse of blue eyes or red hair, despite the constant sunshine. I had always been slender, but soft somehow, obviously not an athlete; I didn't have the necessary hand-eye coordination to play sports without humiliating myself \u2014 and harming both myself and anyone else who stood too close. When I finished putting my clothes in the old pine dresser, I took my bag of bathroom necessities and went to the communal bathroom to clean myself up after the day of travel. I looked at my face in the mirror as I brushed through my tangled, damp hair. Maybe it was the light, but already I looked sallower, unhealthy. My skin could be pretty \u2014 it was very clear, almost translucent-looking \u2014 but it all depended on color. I had no color here. Facing my pallid reflection in the mirror, I was forced to admit that I was lying to myself. It wasn't just physically that I'd never fit in. And if I couldn't find a niche in a school with three thousand people, what were my chances here? I didn't relate well to people my age. Maybe the truth was that I didn't relate well to people, period. Even my mother, who I was closer to than anyone else on the planet, was never in harmony with me, never on exactly the same page. Sometimes I wondered if I was seeing the same things through my eyes that the rest of the world was seeing through theirs. Maybe there was a glitch in my brain. But the cause didn't matter. All that mattered was the effect. And tomorrow would be just the beginning.  I didn't sleep well that night, even after I was done crying. The constant whooshing of the rain and wind across the roof wouldn't fade into the background. I pulled the faded old quilt over my head, and later added the pillow, too. But I couldn't fall asleep until after midnight, when the rain finally settled into a quieter drizzle. Thick fog was all I could see out my window in the morning, and I could feel the \u00a0claustrophobia creeping up on me. You could never see the sky here; it was like a cage. Breakfast with Charlie was a quiet event. He wished me good luck at school. I thanked him, knowing his hope was wasted. Good luck tended to avoid me. Charlie left first, off to the police station that was his wife and family. After he left, I sat at the old square oak table in one of the three unmatching chairs and examined his small kitchen, with its dark paneled walls, bright yellow cabinets, and white linoleum floor. Nothing was changed. My mother had painted the cabinets eighteen years ago in an attempt to bring some sunshine into the house. Over the small fireplace in the adjoining handkerchief-sized family room was a row of pictures. First a wedding picture of Charlie and my mom in Las Vegas, then one of the three of us in the hospital after I was born, taken by a helpful nurse, followed by the procession of my school pictures up to last year's. Those were embarrassing to look at \u2014 I would have to see what I could do to get Charlie to put them somewhere else, at least while I was living here. It was impossible, being in this house, not to realize that Charlie had never gotten over my mom. It made me uncomfortable. I didn't want to be too early to school, but I couldn't stay in the house anymore. I donned my jacket \u2014 which had the feel of a biohazard suit \u2014 and headed out into the rain. It was just drizzling still, not enough to soak me through immediately as I reached for the house key that was always hidden under the eaves by the door, and locked up. The sloshing of my new waterproof boots was unnerving. I missed the normal crunch of gravel as I walked. I couldn't pause and admire my truck again as I wanted; I was in a hurry to get out of the misty wet that swirled around my head and clung to my hair under my hood. Inside the truck, it was nice and dry. Either Billy or Charlie had obviously cleaned it up, but the tan upholstered seats still smelled faintly of tobacco, gasoline, and peppermint. The engine started quickly, to my relief, but loudly, roaring to life and then idling at top volume. Well, a truck this old was bound to have a flaw. The antique radio worked, a plus that I hadn't expected. Finding the school wasn't difficult, though I'd never been there before. The school was, like most other things, just off the highway. It was not obvious that it was a school; only the sign, which declared it to be the Forks High School, made me stop. It looked like a collection of matching houses, built with maroon-colored bricks. There were so many trees and shrubs I couldn't see its size at first. Where was the feel of the institution? I wondered nostalgically. Where were the chain-link fences, the metal detectors? I parked in front of the first building, which had a small sign over the door reading front office. No one else was parked there, so I was sure it was off limits, but I decided I would get directions inside instead of circling around in the rain like an idiot. I stepped unwillingly out of the toasty truck cab and walked down a little stone path lined with dark hedges. I took a deep breath before opening the door.  Inside, it was brightly lit, and warmer than I'd hoped. The office was small; a little waiting area with padded folding chairs, orange-flecked commercial carpet, notices and awards cluttering the walls, a big clock ticking loudly. Plants grew everywhere in large plastic pots, as if there wasn't enough greenery outside. The room was cut in half by a long counter, cluttered with wire baskets full of papers and brightly colored flyers taped to its front. There were three desks behind the counter, one of which was manned by a large, red-haired woman wearing glasses. She was wearing a purple t-shirt, which immediately made me feel overdressed. The red-haired woman looked up.\u201d Can I help you?\" \"I'm Isabella Swan,\" I informed her, and saw the immediate awareness light her eyes. I was expected, a topic of gossip no doubt. Daughter of the Chief's flighty ex-wife, come home at last. \"Of course,\" she said. She dug through a precariously stacked pile of documents on her desk till she found the ones she was looking for.\u201d I have your schedule right here, and a map of the school.\" She brought several sheets to the counter to show me. She went through my classes for me, highlighting the best route to each on the map, and gave me a slip to have each teacher sign, which I was to bring back at the end of the day. She smiled at me and hoped, like Charlie, that I would like it here in Forks. I smiled back as <em>convincingly</em> as I could. When I went back out to my truck, other students were starting to arrive. I drove around the school, following the line of traffic. I was glad to see that most of the cars were older like mine, nothing flashy. At home I'd lived in one of the few lower-income neighborhoods that were included in the Paradise Valley District. It was a common thing to see a new Mercedes or Porsche in the student lot. The nicest car here was a shiny Volvo, and it stood out. Still, I cut the engine as soon as I was in a spot, so that the thunderous volume wouldn't draw attention to me. I looked at the map in the truck, trying to memorize it now; hopefully I wouldn't have to walk around with it stuck in front of my nose all day. I stuffed everything in my bag, slung the strap over my shoulder, and sucked in a huge breath. I can do this, I lied to myself feebly. No one was going to bite me. I finally exhaled and stepped out of the truck.  I kept my face pulled back into my hood as I walked to the sidewalk, crowded with teenagers. My plain black jacket didn't stand out, I noticed with relief. Once I got around the cafeteria, building three was easy to spot. A large black \"3\" was painted on a white square on the east corner. I felt my breathing gradually creeping toward hyperventilation as I approached the door. I tried holding my breath as I followed two unisex raincoats through the door.  The classroom was small. The people in front of me stopped just inside the door to hang up their coats on a long row of hooks. I copied them.  They were two girls, one a porcelain-colored blonde, the other also pale, with light brown hair. At least my skin wouldn't be a standout here.  I took the slip up to the teacher, a tall, balding man whose desk had a nameplate identifying him as Mr. Mason. He gawked at me when he saw my name \u2014 not an encouraging response \u2014 and of course I flushed tomato red. But at least he sent me to an empty desk at the back without introducing me to the class. It was harder for my new classmates to stare at me in the back, but somehow, they managed. I kept my eyes down on the reading list the teacher had given me. It was fairly basic: Bronte, Shakespeare, Chaucer, Faulkner. I'd already read everything. That was comforting\u2026 and boring. I wondered if my mom would send me my folder of old essays, or if she would think that was cheating. I went through different arguments with her in my head while the teacher droned on. When the bell rang, a nasal buzzing sound, a gangly boy with skin problems and hair black as an oil slick leaned across the aisle to talk to me. \"You're Isabella Swan, aren't you?\" He looked like the overly helpful, chess club type. \"Bella,\" I corrected. Everyone within a three-seat radius turned to look at me. \"Where's your next class?\" he asked.  I had to check in my bag.\u201d Um, Government, with Jefferson, in building six.\" There was nowhere to look without meeting curious eyes.  \"I'm headed toward building four, I could show you the way\u2026\" Definitely over-helpful.\u201d I'm Eric,\" he added. I smiled tentatively.\u201d Thanks.\" We got our jackets and headed out into the rain, which had picked up. I could have sworn several people behind us were walking close enough to eavesdrop. I hoped I wasn't getting paranoid. \"So, this is a lot different than Phoenix, huh?\" he asked. \"Very.\" \"It doesn't rain much there, does it?\" \"Three or four times a year.\" \"Wow, what must that be like?\" he wondered. \"Sunny,\" I told him. \"You don't look very tan.\" \"My mother is part albino.\" He studied my face apprehensively, and I sighed. It looked like clouds and a sense of humor didn't mix. A few months of this and I'd forget how to use sarcasm. We walked back around the cafeteria, to the south buildings by the gym. Eric walked me right to the door, though it was clearly marked. \"Well, good luck,\" he said as I touched the handle.\u201d Maybe we'll have some other classes together.\" He sounded hopeful. I smiled at him vaguely and went inside.  The rest of the morning passed in about the same fashion. My Trigonometry teacher, Mr. Varner, who I would have hated anyway just because of the subject he taught, was the only one who made me stand in front of the class and introduce myself. I stammered, blushed, and tripped over my own boots on the way to my seat. After two classes, I started to recognize several of the faces in each class. There was always someone braver than the others who would introduce themselves and ask me questions about how I was liking Forks. I tried to be diplomatic, but mostly I just lied a lot. At least I never needed the map. One girl sat next to me in both Trig and Spanish, and she walked with me to the cafeteria for lunch. She was tiny, several inches shorter than my five feet four inches, but her wildly curly dark hair made up a lot of the difference between our heights. I couldn't remember her name, so I smiled and nodded as she prattled about teachers and classes. I didn't try to keep up. We sat at the end of a full table with several of her friends, who she introduced to me. I forgot all their names as soon as she spoke them. They seemed impressed by her bravery in speaking to me. The boy from English, Eric, waved at me from across the room. It was there, sitting in the lunchroom, trying to make conversation with seven curious strangers, that I first saw them. They were sitting in the corner of the cafeteria, as far away from where I sat as possible in the long room. There were five of them. They weren't talking, and they weren't eating, though they each had a tray of untouched food in front of them. They weren't gawking at me, unlike most of the other students, so it was safe to stare at them without fear of meeting an excessively interested pair of eyes. But it was none of these things that caught, and held, my attention. They didn't look anything alike. Of the three boys, one was big \u2014 muscled like a serious weight lifter, with dark, curly hair. Another was taller, leaner, but still muscular, and honey blond. The last was lanky, less bulky, with untidy, bronze-colored hair. He was more boyish than the others, who looked like they could be in college, or even teachers here rather than students. The girls were opposites. The tall one was statuesque. She had a beautiful figure, the kind you saw on the cover of the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue, the kind that made every girl around her take a hit on her self-esteem just by being in the same room. Her hair was golden, gently waving to the middle of her back. The short girl was pixielike, thin in the extreme, with small features. Her hair was a deep black, cropped short and pointing in every direction. And yet, they were all exactly alike. Every one of them was chalky pale, the palest of all the students living in this sunless town. Paler than me, the albino. They all had very dark eyes despite the range in hair tones. They also had dark shadows under those eyes \u2014 purplish, bruiselike shadows. As if they were all suffering from a sleepless night, or almost\u00a0 done recovering from a broken nose. Though their noses, all their features, were straight, perfect, angular.  But all this is not why I couldn't look away. I stared because their faces, so different, so similar, were all devastatingly, inhumanly beautiful. They were faces you never expected to see except perhaps on the airbrushed pages of a fashion magazine. Or painted by an old master as the face of an angel. It was hard to decide who was the most beautiful \u2014 maybe the perfect blond girl, or the bronze-haired boy. They were all looking away \u2014 away from each other, away from the other students, away from anything in particular as far as I could tell. As I watched, the small girl rose with her tray \u2014 unopened soda, unbitten apple \u2014 and walked away with a quick, graceful lope that belonged on a runway. I watched, amazed at her lithe dancer's step, till she dumped her tray and glided through the back door, faster than I would have thought possible. My eyes darted back to the others, who sat unchanging. \"Who are they?\" I asked the girl from my Spanish class, whose name I'd forgotten. As she looked up to see who I meant \u2014 though already knowing, probably, from my tone \u2014 suddenly he looked at her, the thinner one, the boyish one, the youngest, perhaps. He looked at my neighbor for just a fraction of a second, and then his dark eyes flickered to mine. He looked away quickly, more quickly than I could, though in a flush of embarrassment I dropped my eyes at once. In that brief flash of a glance, his face held nothing of interest \u2014 it was as if she had called his name, and he'd looked up in involuntary response, already having decided not to answer.  My neighbor giggled in embarrassment, looking at the table like I did.  \"That's Edward and Emmett Cullen, and Rosalie and Jasper Hale. The one who left was Alice Cullen; they all live together with Dr. Cullen and his wife.\" She said this under her breath. I glanced sideways at the beautiful boy, who was looking at his tray now, picking a bagel to pieces with long, pale fingers. His mouth was moving very quickly, his perfect lips barely opening.  The other three still looked away, and yet I felt he was speaking quietly to them. Strange, unpopular names, I thought. The kinds of names grandparents had.  But maybe that was in vogue here \u2014 small town names? I finally remembered that my neighbor was called Jessica, a perfectly common name. There were two girls named Jessica in my History class back home. \"They are\u2026 very nice-looking.\" I struggled with the conspicuous understatement. \"Yes!\" Jessica agreed with another giggle.\u201d They're all together though \u2014 Emmett and Rosalie, and Jasper and Alice, I mean. And they live together.\" Her voice held all the shock and condemnation of the small town, I thought critically. But, if I was being honest, I had to admit that even in Phoenix, it would cause gossip. \"Which ones are the Cullens?\" I asked.\u201d They don't look related\u2026\" \"Oh, they're not. Dr. Cullen is really young, in his twenties or early thirties. They're all adopted. The Hales are brother and sister, twins \u2014 the blondes \u2014 and they're foster children.\" \"They look a little old for foster children.\" \"They are now, Jasper and Rosalie are both eighteen, but they've been with Mrs. Cullen since they were eight. She's their aunt or something like that.\" \"That's really kind of nice \u2014 for them to take care of all those kids like that, when they're so young and everything.\" \"I guess so,\" Jessica admitted reluctantly, and I got the impression that she didn't like the doctor and his wife for some reason. With the glances she was throwing at their adopted children, I would presume the reason was jealousy.\u201d I think that Mrs. Cullen can't have any kids, though,\" she added, as if that lessened their kindness. Throughout all this conversation, my eyes flickered again and again to the table where the strange family sat. They continued to look at the walls and not eat. \"Have they always lived in Forks?\" I asked. Surely I would have noticed them on one of my summers here. \"No,\" she said in a voice that implied it should be obvious, even to a new arrival like me.\u201d They just moved down two years ago from somewhere in Alaska.\" I felt a surge of pity, and relief. Pity because, as beautiful as they were, they were outsiders, clearly not accepted. Relief that I wasn't the only newcomer here, and certainly not the most interesting by any standard. As I examined them, the youngest, one of the Cullens, looked up and met my gaze, this time with evident curiosity in his expression. As I looked swiftly away, it seemed to me that his glance held some kind of unmet expectation. \"Which one is the boy with the reddish brown hair?\" I asked. I peeked at him from the corner of my eye, and he was still staring at me, but not gawking like the other students had today \u2014 he had a slightly frustrated expression. I looked down again. \"That's Edward. He's gorgeous, of course, but don't waste your time. He doesn't date. Apparently none of the girls here are good-looking enough for him.\" She sniffed, a clear case of sour grapes. I wondered when he'd turned her down. I bit my lip to hide my smile. Then I glanced at him again. His face was turned away, but I thought his cheek appeared lifted, as if he were smiling, too. After a few more minutes, the four of them left the table together. They all were noticeably graceful \u2014 even the big, brawny one. It was unsettling to watch. The one named Edward didn't look at me again. I sat at the table with Jessica and her friends longer than I would have if I'd been sitting alone. I was anxious not to be late for class on my first day. One of my new acquaintances, who considerately reminded me that her name was Angela, had Biology II with me the next hour. We walked to class together in silence. She was shy, too. When we entered the classroom, Angela went to sit at a black-topped lab table exactly like the ones I was used to. She already had a neighbor. In fact, all the tables were filled but one. Next to the center aisle, I recognized Edward Cullen by his unusual hair, sitting next to that single open seat.  As I walked down the aisle to introduce myself to the teacher and get my slip signed, I was watching him surreptitiously. Just as I passed, he suddenly went rigid in his seat. He stared at me again, meeting my eyes with the strangest expression on his face \u2014 it was hostile, furious. I looked away quickly, shocked, going red again. I stumbled over a book in the walkway and had to catch myself on the edge of a table. The girl sitting there giggled. I'd noticed that his eyes were black \u2014 coal black. Mr. Banner signed my slip and handed me a book with no nonsense about introductions. I could tell we were going to get along. Of course, he had no choice but to send me to the one open seat in the middle of the room. I kept my eyes down as I went to sit by him, bewildered by the antagonistic stare he'd given me. I didn't look up as I set my book on the table and took my seat, but I saw his posture change from the corner of my eye. He was leaning away from me, sitting on the extreme edge of his chair and averting his face like he smelled something bad. Inconspicuously, I sniffed my hair. It smelled like strawberries, the scent of my favorite shampoo. It seemed an innocent enough odor. I let my hair fall over my right shoulder, making a dark curtain between us, and tried to pay attention to the teacher. Unfortunately the lecture was on cellular anatomy, something I'd already studied. I took notes carefully anyway, always looking down. I couldn't stop myself from peeking occasionally through the screen of my hair at the strange boy next to me. During the whole class, he never relaxed his stiff position on the edge of his chair, sitting as far from me as possible. I could see his hand on his left leg was clenched into a fist, tendons standing out under his pale skin. This, too, he never relaxed. He had the long sleeves of his white shirt pushed up to his elbows, and his forearm was surprisingly hard and muscular beneath his light skin. He wasn't nearly as slight as he'd looked next to his burly brother. The class seemed to drag on longer than the others. Was it because the day was finally coming to a close, or because I was waiting for his tight fist to loosen? It never did; he continued to sit so still it looked like he wasn't breathing. What was wrong with him? Was this his normal behavior? I questioned my judgment on Jessica's bitterness at lunch today. Maybe she was not as resentful as I'd thought.  It couldn't have anything to do with me. He didn't know me from Eve.  I peeked up at him one more time, and regretted it. He was glaring down at me again, his black eyes full of revulsion. As I flinched away from him, shrinking against my chair, the phrase if looks could kill suddenly ran through my mind. At that moment, the bell rang loudly, making me jump, and Edward Cullen was out of his seat. Fluidly he rose \u2014 he was much taller than I'd thought \u2014 his back to me, and he was out the door before anyone else was out of their seat. I sat frozen in my seat, staring blankly after him. He was so mean. It wasn't fair. I began gathering up my things slowly, trying to block the anger that filled me, for fear my eyes would tear up. For some reason, my temper was hardwired to my tear ducts. I usually cried when I was angry, a humiliating tendency. \"Aren't you Isabella Swan?\" a male voice asked. I looked up to see a cute, baby-faced boy, his pale blond hair carefully gelled into orderly spikes, smiling at me in a friendly way. He obviously didn't think I smelled bad. \"Bella,\" I corrected him, with a smile. \"I'm Mike.\" \"Hi, Mike.\" \"Do you need any help finding your next class?\" \"I'm headed to the gym, actually. I think I can find it.\" \"That's my next class, too.\" He seemed thrilled, though it wasn't that big of a coincidence in a school this small. We walked to class together; he was a chatterer \u2014 he supplied most of the conversation, which made it easy for me. He'd lived in California till he was ten, so he knew how I felt about the sun. It turned out he was in my English class also. He was the nicest person I'd met today. But as we were entering the gym, he asked, \"So, did you stab Edward Cullen with a pencil or what? I've never seen him act like that.\" I cringed. So I wasn't the only one who had noticed. And, apparently, that wasn't Edward Cullen's usual behavior. I decided to play dumb. \"Was that the boy I sat next to in Biology?\" I asked artlessly. \"Yes,\" he said.\u201d He looked like he was in pain or something.\" \"I don't know,\" I responded.\u201d I never spoke to him.\" \"He's a weird guy.\" Mike lingered by me instead of heading to the dressing room.\u201d If I were lucky enough to sit by you, I would have talked to you.\" I smiled at him before walking through the girls' locker room door. He was friendly and clearly admiring. But it wasn't enough to ease my irritation. The Gym teacher, Coach Clapp, found me a uniform but didn't make me dress down for today's class. At home, only two years of RE. were required. Here, P.E. was mandatory all four years. Forks was literally my personal hell on Earth. I watched four volleyball games running simultaneously. Remembering how many injuries I had sustained \u2014 and inflicted \u2014 playing volleyball, I felt faintly nauseated. The final bell rang at last. I walked slowly to the office to return my paperwork. The rain had drifted away, but the wind was strong, and colder. I wrapped my arms around myself. When I walked into the warm office, I almost turned around and walked back out. Edward Cullen stood at the desk in front of me. I recognized again that tousled bronze hair. He didn't appear to notice the sound of my entrance. I stood pressed against the back wall, waiting for the receptionist to be free. He was arguing with her in a low, attractive voice. I quickly picked up the gist of the argument. He was trying to trade from sixth-hour Biology to another time \u2014 any other time. I just couldn't believe that this was about me. It had to be something else, something that happened before I entered the Biology room. The look on his face must have been about another aggravation entirely. It was impossible that this stranger could take such a sudden, intense dislike to me. The door opened again, and the cold wind suddenly gusted through the room, rustling the papers on the desk, swirling my hair around my face. The girl who came in merely stepped to the desk, placed a note in the wire basket, and walked out again. But Edward Cullen's back stiffened, and he turned slowly to glare at me \u2014 his face was absurdly handsome \u2014 with piercing, hate-filled eyes. For an instant, I felt a thrill of genuine fear, raising the hair on my arms. The look only lasted a second, but it chilled me more than the freezing wind. He turned back to the receptionist. \"Never mind, then,\" he said hastily in a voice like velvet.\u201d I can see that it's impossible. Thank you so much for your help.\" And he turned on his heel without another look at me, and disappeared out the door. I went meekly to the desk, my face white for once instead of red, and handed her the signed slip. \"How did your first day go, dear?\" the receptionist asked maternally. \"Fine,\" I lied, my voice weak. She didn't look convinced. When I got to the truck, it was almost the last car in the lot. It seemed like a haven, already the closest thing to home I had in this damp green hole. I sat inside for a while, just staring out the windshield blankly. But soon I was cold enough to need the heater, so I turned the key and the engine roared to life. I headed back to Charlie's house, fighting tears the whole way there.",
