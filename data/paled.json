            "en": "7 REPETITION          18. THE FUNERAL I SPRINTED DOWN THE STAIRS AND THREW THE DOOR open. It was Jacob, of course. Even blind, Alice wasn't slow. He was standing about six feet back from the door, his nose wrinkled in distaste, but his face otherwise smooth\u2014masklike. He didn't fool me; I could see the faint trembling of his hands. Hostility rolled off of him in waves. It brought back that awful afternoon when he'd chosen Sam over me, and I felt my chin jerk up defensively in response. Jacob's Rabbit idled by the curb with Jared behind the wheel and Embry in the passenger seat. I understood what this meant: they were afraid to let him come here alone. It made me sad, and a little annoyed. The Cullens weren't like that. \"Hey,\" I finally said when he didn't speak. Jake pursed his lips, still hanging back from the door. His eyes flickered across the front of the house. I ground my teeth. \"She's not here. Do you need something?\" He hesitated. \"You're alone?\" \"Yes.\" I sighed. \"Can I talk to you a minute?\" \"Of course you can, Jacob. Come on in.\" Jacob glanced over his shoulder at his friends in the car. I saw Embry shake his head just a tiny bit. For some reason, this bugged me to no end. My teeth clenched together again. \"Chicken\" I mumbled under my breath. Jake's eyes flashed back to me, his thick, black brows pushing into a furious angle over \u00a0his deep-set eyes. His jaw set, and he marched\u2014there was no other way to describe the way he moved\u2014up the sidewalk and shrugged past me into the house. I locked gazes with first Jared and then Embry\u2014I didn't like the hard way they eyed me; did they really think I would let anything hurt Jacob?\u2014before I shut the door on them. Jacob was in the hall behind me, staring at the mess of blankets in the living room. \"Slumber party?\" he asked, his tone sarcastic. \"Yeah,\" I answered with the same level of acid. I didn't like Jacob when he acted this way. \"What's it to you? He wrinkled his nose again like he smelled something unpleasant. \"Where's your friend'?\" I could hear the quotation marks in his tone. \"She had some errands to run. Look, Jacob, what do you want?\" Something about the room seemed to make him edgier\u2014his long arms were quivering. He didn't answer my question. Instead he moved on to the kitchen, his restless eyes darting everywhere. I followed him. He paced back and forth along the short counter. \"Hey,\" I said, putting myself in his way. He stopped pacing and stared down at me. \"What's your problem?\" \"I don't like having to be here.\" That stung. I winced, and his eyes tightened. \"Then I'm sorry you had to come,\" I muttered. \"Why don't you tell me what you need so you can leave?\" \"I just have to ask you a couple of questions. It shouldn't take long. We have to get back for the funeral.\" \"Okay. Get it over with then.\" I was probably overdoing it with the antagonism, but I didn't want him to see how much this hurt. I knew I wasn't being fair. After all, I'd picked the bloodsucker over him last night. I'd hurt him first. He took a deep breath, and his trembling fingers were suddenly still. His face smoothed into a serene mask. \"One of the Cullens is staying here with you,\" he stated. \"Yes. Alice Cullen.\" He nodded thoughtfully. \"How long is she here for?\" \"As long as she wants to be.\" The belligerence was still there in my tone. \"It's an open invitation.\" \"Do you think you could\u2026 please\u2026 explain to her about the other one\u2014Victoria?\" I <em>paled</em>. \"I told her about that.\" He nodded. \"You should know that we can only watch our own lands with a Cullen here. You'll only be safe in La Push. I can't protect you here anymore.\" \"Okay,\" I said in a small voice. He looked away then, out the back windows. He didn't continue. \"Is that all?\" He kept his eyes on the glass as he answered. \"Just one more thing.\" I waited, but he didn't continue. \"Yes?\" I finally prompted. \"Are the rest of them coming back now?\" he asked in a cool, quiet voice. It reminded me of Sam's always calm manner. Jacob was becoming more like Sam\u2026 I wondered why that bothered me so much. Now I didn't speak. He looked back at my face with probing eyes. \"Well?\" he asked. He struggled to conceal the tension behind his serene expression. \"No.\" I said finally. Grudgingly. \"They aren't coming back.\" His expression didn't change. \"Okay. That's all.\" I glared at him, annoyance rekindled. \"Well, run along now. Go tell Sam that the scary monsters aren't coming to get you.\" \"Okay,\" he repeated, still calm. That seemed to be it. Jacob walked swiftly from the kitchen. I waited to hear the front door open, but I heard nothing. I could hear the clock over the stove ticking, and I marveled again at how quiet he'd become. What a disaster. How could I have alienated him so completely in such a short amount of time?  Would he forgive me when Alice was gone? What if he didn't? I slumped against the counter and buried my face in my hands. How had I made such a mess of everything? But what could I have done differently? Even in hindsight, I couldn't think of any better way, any perfect course of action. \"Bella\u2026 ?\" Jacob asked in a troubled voice. I pulled my face out of my hands to see Jacob hesitating in the kitchen doorway; he hadn't left when I'd thought. It was only when I saw the clear drops sparkling in my hands that I realized I was crying. Jacob's calm expression was gone; his face was anxious and unsure. He walked quickly back to stand in front of me, ducking his head so that his eyes were closer to being on the same level with mine. \"Did it again, didn't I?\" \"Did what?\" I asked, my voice cracking. \"Broke my promise. Sorry.\" \"'It\u2019s okay,\" I mumbled. \"I started it this time.\" His face twisted. \"I knew how you felt about them. It shouldn't have taken me by surprise like that.\" I could see the revulsion in his eyes. I wanted to explain to him what Alice was really like, to defend her against the judgments he'd made, but something warned me that now was not the time. So I just said, \"Sorry,\" again. \"Let's not worry about it, okay? She's just visiting, right? She'll leave, and things will go back to normal.\" \"Can't I be friends with you both at the same time?\" I asked, my voice not hiding an ounce of the hurt I felt. He shook his head slowly. \"No, I don't think you can.\" I sniffed and stared at his big feet. \"But you'll wait, right? You'll still be my friend, even though I love Alice, too?\" I didn't look up, afraid to see what he'd think of that last part. It took him a minute to answer, so I was probably right not to look. \"Yeah, I'll always be your friend,\" he said gruffly. \"No matter what you love.\" \"Promise?\" \"Promise.\" I felt his arms wind around me, and I leaned against his chest, still sniffling. \"This sucks.\" \"Yeah.\" Then he sniffed my hair and said, \"Ew.\" \"What?\" I demanded. I looked up to see that his nose was wrinkled again. \"Why does everyone keep doing that to me? I don't smell!\" He smiled a little. \"Yes, you do\u2014you smell like them. Blech. Too sweet\u2014sickly sweet. And\u2026 icy. It burns my nose.\" \"Really?\" That was strange. Alice smelled unbelievably wonderful. To a human, anyway. \"But why would Alice think I smelled, too, then?\" That wiped his smile away. \"Huh. Maybe I don't smell so good to her, either. Huh.\" \"Well, you both smell fine to me.\" I rested my head against him again. I was going to miss him terribly when he walked out my door. It was a nasty catch-22\u2014on the one hand, I wanted Alice to stay forever. I was going to die\u2014metaphorically\u2014when she left me. But how was I supposed to go without seeing Jake for any length of time? What a mess, I thought again. \"I'll miss you,\" Jacob whispered, echoing my thoughts. \"Every minute. I hope she leaves soon.\" \"It really doesn't have to be that way, Jake.\" He sighed. \"Yes, it really does. Bella. You\u2026 love her. So I'd better not get anywhere near her. I'm not sure that I'm even-tempered enough to handle that. Sam would be mad if I broke the treaty, and\"\u2014his voice turned sarcastic\u2014\"you probably wouldn't like it too much if I killed your friend.\" I recoiled from him when he said that, but he only tightened his arms, refusing to let me escape. \"There's no point in avoiding the truth. That's the way things are, Bells.\" \"I do not like the way things are.\" Jacob freed one arm so that he could cup his big brown hand under my chin and make me look at him. \"Yeah. It was easier when we were both human, wasn't it?\" I sighed. We stared at each other for a long moment. His hand smoldered against my skin. In my face, I knew there was nothing but wistful sadness\u2014I didn't want to have to say goodbye now, no matter for how short a time. At first his face reflected mine, but then, as neither of us looked away, his expression changed. He released me, lifting his other hand to brush his fingertips along my cheek, trailing them down to my jaw. I could feel his fingers tremble\u2014not with anger this time. He pressed his palm against my cheek, so that my face was trapped between his burning hands. \"Bella,\" he whispered. I was frozen. No! I hadn't made this decision yet. I didn't know if I could do this, and now I was out of time to think. But I would have been a fool if I thought rejecting him now would have no consequences. I stared back at him. He was not my Jacob, but he could be. His face was familiar and beloved. In so many real ways, I did love him. He was my comfort, my safe harbor. Right now, I could choose to have him belong to me. Alice was back for the moment, but that changed nothing. True love was forever lost. The prince was never coming back to kiss me awake from my enchanted sleep. I was not a princess, after all. So what was the fairy-tale protocol for other kisses? The mundane kind that didn't break any spells? Maybe it would be easy\u2014like holding his hand or having his arms around me. Maybe it would feel nice. Maybe it wouldn't feel like a betrayal. Besides, who was I betraying, anyway? Just \u00a0myself. Keeping his eyes on mine, Jacob began to bend his face toward me. And I was still absolutely undecided. .  The shrill ring of the phone made us both jump, but it did not break his focus. He took his hand from under my chin and reached over me to grab the receiver, but still held my face securely with the hand against my cheek. His dark eyes did not free mine. I was too muddled to react, even to take advantage of the distraction. \"Swan residence,\" Jacob said, his husky voice low and intense. Someone answered, and Jacob altered in an instant. He straightened up, and his hand dropped from my face. His eyes went flat, his face blank, and I would have bet the measly remainder of my college and that it was Alice. I recovered myself and held out my hand for the phone. Jacob ignored me. \"He's not here,\" Jacob said, and the words were menacing. There was some very short reply, a request for more information it seemed, because he added unwillingly, \"He's at the funeral.\" Then Jacob hung up the phone. \"Filthy bloodsucker,\" he muttered under his breath. The face he turned back to me was the bitter mask again. \"Who did you just hang up on?\" I gasped, infuriated. \"In my house, and on my phone?\" \"Easy! He hung up on me!\" \"He? Who was it?!\" He sneered the title. \"Dr. Carlisle Cullen.\" \"Why didn't you let me talk to him?!\" \"He didn't ask for you,\" Jacob said coldly. His face was smooth, expressionless, but his hands shook. \"He asked where Charlie was and I told him. I don't think I broke any rules of etiquette.\" \"You listen to me, Jacob Black\u2014\" But he obviously wasn't listening. He looked quickly over his shoulder, as if someone had called his name from the other room. His eyes went wide and his body stiff, then he started trembling. I listened too, automatically, but heard nothing. \"Bye, Bells,\" he spit out, and wheeled toward the front door. I ran after him. \"What is it?\" And then I ran into him, as he rocked back on his heels, cussing under his breath. He spun around again, knocking me sideways. I bobbled and fell to the floor, my legs tangled with his. \"Shoot, ow!\" I protested as he hurriedly jerked his legs free one at a time. I struggled to pull myself up as he darted for the back door; he suddenly froze again. Alice stood motionless at the foot of the stairs. \"Bella,\" she choked. I scrambled to my feet and lurched to her side. Her eyes were dazed and far away, her face drawn and whiter than bone. Her slim body trembled to an inner turmoil. \"Alice, what's wrong?\" I cried. I put my hands on her face, trying to calm her. Her eyes focused on mine abruptly, wide with pain. \"Edward,\" was all she whispered. My body reacted faster than my mind was able to catch up with the implications of her reply. I didn't at first understand why the room was spinning or where the hollow roar in my ears was coming from. My mind labored, unable to make sense of Alice's bleak face and how it could possibly relate to Edward, while my body was already swaying, seeking the relief of unconsciousness before the reality could hit me. The stairway tilted at the oddest angle. Jacob's furious voice was suddenly in my ear, hissing out a stream of profanities. I felt a vague disapproval. His new friends were clearly a bad influence. I was on the couch without understanding how I got there, and Jacob was still swearing. It felt like there was an earthquake\u2014the couch was shaking under me. \"What did you do to her?\" he demanded. Alice ignored him. \"Bella? Bella, snap out of it. We have to hurry.\" \"Stay back,\" Jacob warned. \"Calm down, Jacob Black,\" Alice ordered. \"You don't want to do that so close to her.\" \"I don't think I'll have any problem keeping my focus,\" he retorted, but his voice sounded a little cooler. \"Alice?\" My voice was weak. \"What happened?\" I asked, even though I didn't want to hear. \"I don't know,\" she suddenly wailed. \"What is he thinking?!\" I labored to pull myself up despite the dizziness. I realized it was Jacob's arm I was gripping for balance. He was the one shaking, not the couch. Alice was pulling a small silver phone from her bag when my eyes relocated her. Her fingers dialed the numbers so fast they were a blur. \"Rose, I need to talk to Carlisle now.\" Her voice whipped through the words. \"Fine, as soon as he's back. No, I'll be on a plane. Look, have you heard anything from Edward?\" Alice paused now, listening with an expression that grew more appalled every second. Her mouth opened into a little O of horror, and the phone shook in her hand. \"Why?\" she gasped. \"Why would you do that, Rosalie?\" Whatever the answer was, it made her jaw tighten in anger. Her eyes flashed and narrowed. \"Well, you're wrong on both counts, though, Rosalie, so that would be a problem, don't you think?\" she asked acidly. \"Yes, that's right. She's absolutely fine\u2014I was wrong\u2026 It's a long story\u2026 But you're wrong about that part, too, that's why I'm calling\u2026 Yes, that's exactly what I saw.\" Alice's voice was very hard and her lips were pulled back from her teeth.  \"It's a bit late for that, Rose.\u00a0 Save your remorse for someone who believes it.\" Alice snapped the phone shut with a sharp twist of her fingers. Her eyes were tortured as she turned to face me. \"Alice,\" I blurted out quickly. I couldn't let her speak yet. I needed a few more seconds before she spoke and her words destroyed what was left of my life. \"Alice, Carlisle is back, though. He called just before\u2026\" She stared at me blankly. \"How long ago?\" she asked in a hollow voice. \"Half a minute before you showed up.\" \"What did he say?\" She really focused now, waiting for my answer. \"I didn't talk to him.\" My eyes flickered to Jacob. Alice turned her penetrating gaze on him. He flinched, but held his place next to me. He sit awkwardly, almost as if he were trying to shield me with his body. \"He asked for Charlie, and I told him Charlie wasn't here,\" Jacob muttered resentfully. \"Is that everything?\" Alice demanded, her voice like ice. \"Then he hung up on me,\" Jacob spit back. A tremor rolled down his spine, shaking me with it.  \"You told him Charlie was at the funeral,\" I reminded him. Alice jerked her head back toward me \"What were his exact words?\" \"He said, 'He's not here,' and when Carlisle asked where Charlie was, Jacob said, 'At the funeral.'\" Alice moaned and sank to her knees. \"Tell me Alice,\" I whispered. \"That wasn't Carlisle on the phone,\" she said hopelessly. \"Are you calling me a liar?\" Jacob snarled from beside me. Alice ignored him, focusing on my bewildered face. \"It was Edward.\" The words were just a choked whisper. \"He thinks you're dead.\" My mind started to work again. These words weren't the ones I'd been afraid of, and the relief cleared my head. \"Rosalie told him I killed myself, didn't she?\" I said, sighing as I relaxed. \"Yes,\" Alice admitted, her eyes flashing hard again. \"In her defense, she did believe it. They rely on my sight far too much for something that works so imperfectly. But for her to track him down to tell him this! Didn't she realize\u2026 or care\u2026 ?\" Her voice faded away in horror. \"And when Edward called here, he thought Jacob meant my funeral,\" I realized. It stung to know how close I'd been, just inches away from his voice. My nails dug into Jacob's arm, but he didn't flinch. Alice looked at me strangely. \"You're not upset,\" she whispered. \"Well, it's really rotten timing, but it will all get straightened out. The next time he calls, someone will tell him\u2026 what\u2026 really\u2026\" I trailed off. Her gaze strangled the words in my throat. Why was she so panicked? Why was her face twisting now with pity and horror? What was it she had said to Rosalie on the phone just now? Something about what she'd seen\u2026 and Rosalie's remorse; Rosalie would never feel remorse for anything that happened to me. But if she'd hurt her family, hurt her brother\u2026 \"Bella,\" Alice whispered. \"Edward won't call again. He believed her.\" \"I. Don't. Understand.\" My mouth framed each word in silence. I couldn't push the air out to actually say the words that would make her explain what that meant. \"He's going to Italy.\" It took the length of one heartbeat for me to comprehend. When Edward's voice came back to me now, it was not the perfect imitation of my \u00a0delusions. It was just the weak, flat tone of my memories. But the words alone were enough to shred through my chest and leave it gaping open. Words from a time when I would have bet everything that I owned or could borrow on that fact that he loved me. Well, I wasn't going to live without you, he'd said as we watched Romeo and Juliet die, here in this very room. But I wasn't sure how to do it\u2026 I knew Emmett and Jasper would never help\u2026 so I was thinking maybe I would go to Italy and do something to provoke the Volturi\u2026 You don't irritate them. Not unless you want to die. Not unless you want to die. \"NO!\" The half-shrieked denial was so loud after the whispered words, it made us all jump. I felt the blood rushing to my face as I realized what she'd seen. \"No! No, no, no! He can't! He can't do that!\" \"He made up his mind as soon as your friend confirmed that it was too late to save you.\" \"But he\u2026 he left! He didn't want me anymore! What difference does it make now? He knew I would die sometime!\" \"I don't think he ever planned to outlive you by long,\" Alice said quietly. \"How dare he!\" I screamed. I was on my feet now, and Jacob rose uncertainly to put himself between Alice and me again. \"Oh, get out of the way, Jacob!\" I elbowed my way around his trembling body with desperate impatience. \"What do we do?\" I begged Alice. There had to be something. \"Can't we call him? Can Carlisle?\" She was shaking her head. \"That was the first thing I tried. He left his phone in a trash can in Rio\u2014someone answered it\u2026\" she whispered. \"You said before we had to hurry. Hurry how? Let's do it, whatever it is!\" \"Bella, I\u2014I don't think I can ask you to\u2026\" She trailed off in indecision. \"Ask me!\" I commanded. She put her hands on my shoulders, holding me in place, her fingers flexing sporadically to emphasize her words. \"We may already be too late. I saw him going to the Volturi\u2026 and asking to die.\" We both cringed, and my eyes were suddenly blind. I blinked feverishly at the tears. \"It all depends on what they choose. I can't see that till they make a decision. \"But if they say no, and they might\u2014Aro is fond of Carlisle, and wouldn't want to offend him\u2014Edward has a backup plan. They're very protective of their city. If Edward does something to upset the peace, he thinks they'll act to stop him. And he's right. They will.\" I stared at her with my jaw clenched in frustration. I'd heard nothing yet that would explain why we were still standing here. \"So if they agree to grant his favor, we're too late. If they say no, and he comes up with a plan to offend them quickly enough, we're too late. If he gives into his more theatrical tendencies\u2026 we might have time.\" \"Let's go!\" \"Listen, Bella! Whether we are in time or not, we will be in the heart of the Volturi city. I will be considered his accomplice if he is successful. You will be a human who not only knows too much, but also smells too good. There's a very good chance that they will eliminate us all\u2014though in your case it won't be punishment so much as dinnertime.\" \"This is what's keeping us here?\" I asked in disbelief. \"I'll go alone if you're afraid.\" I mentally tabulated what money was left in my account, and wondered if Alice would lend me the rest. \"I'm only afraid of getting you killed.\" I snorted in disgust. \"I almost get myself killed on a daily basis! Tell me what I need to do!\" \"You write a note to Charlie. I'll call the airlines.\" \"Charlie,\" I gasped. Not that my presence was protecting him, but could I leave him here alone to face\u2026 \"I'm not going to let anything happen to Charlie.\" Jacob's low voice was gruff and angry. \"Screw the treaty.\" I glanced up at him, and he scowled at my panicked expression. \"Hurry, Bella,\" Alice interrupted urgently. I ran to the kitchen, yanking the drawers open and throwing the contents all over the floor as I searched for a pen. A smooth, brown hand held one out to me. \"Thanks,\" I mumbled, pulling the cap off with my teeth. He silently handed me the pad of paper we wrote phone messages on. I tore off the top sheet and threw it over my shoulder. Dad, I wrote. I'm with Alice. Edward's in trouble. You can ground me when I get back. I know it's a bad time. So sorry. Love you so much. Bella. \"Don't go,\" Jacob whispered. The anger was all gone now that Alice was out of sight. I wasn't about to waste time arguing with him. \"Please, please, please take care of \u00a0Charlie,\" I said as I dashed back out to the front room. Alice was waiting in the doorway with a bag over her shoulder. \"Get your wallet\u2014you'll need ID. Please tell me you have a passport. I don't have time to forge one.\" I nodded and then raced up the stairs, my knees weak with gratitude that my mother had wanted to marry Phil on a beach in Mexico. Of course, like all her plans, it had fallen through. But not before I'd made all the practical arrangements I could for her. I tore through my room. I stuffed my old wallet, a clean T-shirt, and sweatpants into my backpack, and then threw my toothbrush on top. I hurled myself back down the stairs. The sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu was nearly stifling by this point. At least, unlike the last time\u2014when I'd run away from Forks to escape thirsty vampires rather than to find them\u2014I wouldn't have to say goodbye to Charlie in person. Jacob and Alice were locked in some kind of confrontation in front of the open door, standing so far apart you wouldn't assume at first that they were having a conversation. Neither one seemed to notice my noisy reappearance. \"You might control yourself on occasion, but these leeches you're taking her to\u2014\" Jacob was furiously accusing her. \"Yes. You're right, dog.\" Alice was snarling, too. \"The Volturi are the very essence of our kind\u2014they're the reason your hair stands on end when you smell me. They are the substance of your nightmares, the dread behind your instincts. I'm not unaware of that.\" \"And you take her to them like a bottle of wine for a party!\" he shouted. \"You think she'd be better off if I left her here alone, with Victoria stalking her?\" \"We can handle the redhead.\" \"Then why is she still hunting?\" Jacob growled, and a shudder rippled through his torso. \"Stop that!\" I shouted at them both, wild with impatience. \"Argue when we get back, let's \u00a0go!\" Alice turned for the car, disappearing in her haste. I hurried after her, pausing automatically to turn and lock the door. Jacob caught my arm with a shivering hand. \"Please, Bella. I'm begging.\" His dark eyes were glistening with tears. A lump filled my throat. \"Jake, I have to\u2014\" \"You don't, though. You really don't. You could stay here with me. You could stay alive. For Charlie. For me.\" The engine of Carlisle's Mercedes purred; the rhythm of the thrumming spiked when Alice revved it impatiently. I shook my head, tears spattering from my eyes with the sharp motion. I pulled my arm free, and he didn't fight me. \"Don't die, Bella,\" he choked out. \"Don't go. Don't.\" What if I never saw him again? The thought pushed me past the silent tears; a sob broke out from my chest. I threw my arms around his waist and hugged for one too-short moment, burying my tear-wet face against his chest. He put his big hand on the back of my hair, as if to hold me there. \"Bye, Jake.\" I pulled his hand from my hair, and kissed his palm. I couldn't bear to look at his face. \"Sorry,\" I whispered. Then I spun and raced for the car. The door on the passenger side was open and waiting. I threw my backpack over the headrest and slid in, slamming the door behind me. \"Take care of Charlie!\" I turned to shout out the window, but Jacob was nowhere in sight. As Alice stomped on the gas and\u2014with the tires screeching like human screams\u2014spun us around to face the road, I caught sight of a shred of white near the edge of the trees. A piece of a shoe.",

            "en": "7 REPETITION         15. PRESSURE It was spring break in Forks again. When i woke up on Monday morning, I lay in bed for a few seconds absorbing that. Last spring break, I'd been hunted by a vampire, too. I hoped this wasn't some kind of tradition forming. Already I was falling into the pattern of things in La Push. I'd spent Sunday mostly on the beach, while Charlie hung out with Billy at the Blacks' house. I was supposed to be with Jacob, but Jacob had other things to do, so I wandered alone, keeping the secret from Charlie. When Jacob dropped in to check on me, he apologized for ditching me so much. He told me his schedule wasn't always this crazy, but until Victoria was stopped, the wolves were on red alert. When we walked along the beach now, he always held my hand. This made me brood over what Jared had said, about Jacob involving his \"girlfriend.\" I supposed that that was exactly what it looked like from the outside. As long as Jake and I knew how it really was, I shouldn't let those kinds of assumptions bother me. And maybe they wouldn't, if I hadn't known that Jacob would have loved for things to be what they appeared. But his hand felt nice as it warmed mine, and I didn't protest. I worked Tuesday afternoon\u2014Jacob followed me on his bike to make sure I arrived safely\u2014and Mike noticed. \"Are you dating that kid from La Push? The sophomore?\" He asked, poorly disguising the resentment in his tone. I shrugged. \"Not in the technical sense of the word. I do spent most of my time with Jacob, though. He's my best friend.\" Mike's eyes narrowed shrewdly. \"Don't kid yourself, Bella. The guy's head over heels for you.\" \"I know,\" I sighed. \"Life is complicated.\" \"And girls are cruel,\" Mike said under his breath. I supposed that was an easy assumption to make, too. That night, Sam and Emily joined Charlie and me for dessert at Billy's house. Emily brought a cake that would have won over a harder man than Charlie. I could see, as the conversation flowed naturally through a range of casual subjects, that any worries Charlie might have harbored about gangs in La Push were being dissolved. Jake and I skipped out early, to get some privacy. We went out to his garage and sat in the Rabbit. Jacob leaned his head back, his face drawn with exhaustion. \"You need some sleep, Jake.\" \"I'll get around to it.\" He reached over and took my hand. His skin was blazing on mine. \"Is that one of those wolf things?\" I asked him. \"The heat, I mean.\" \"Yeah. We run a little warmer than the normal people. About one-oh-eight, one-oh-nine. I never get cold anymore. I could stand like this\"\u2014he gestured to his bare torso\u2014\"in a snowstorm and it wouldn't bother me. The flakes would turn to rain where I stood.\" \"And you all heal fast\u2014that's a wolf thing, too?\" \"Yeah, wanna see? It's pretty cool.\" His eyes flipped open and he grinned. He reached around me to the glove compartment and dug around for a minute. His hand came out with a pocketknife. \"No, I do not want to see!\" I shouted as soon as I realized what he was thinking. \"Put that away!\" Jacob chuckled, but shoved the knife back where it belonged. \"Fine. It's a good thing we heal, though.\u00a0 You can't go see just any doctor when you're running a temperature that should mean you're dead.\" \"No, I guess not.\" I thought about that for a minute. \"\u2026 And being so big\u2014that's part of it? Is that why you're all worried about Quil?\" \"That and the fact that Quil's grandfather says the kid could fry an egg on his forehead.\" Jacob's face turned hopeless. \"It won't be long now. There's no exact age\u2026 it just builds and builds and then suddenly\u2014\" He broke off, and it was a moment before he could speak again. \"Sometimes, if you get really upset or something, that can trigger it early. But I wasn't upset about anything\u2014I was happy.\" He laughed bitterly. \"Because of you, mostly. That's why it didn't happen to me sooner. Instead it just kept on building up inside me\u2014I was like a time bomb. You know what set me off? I got back from that movie and Billy said I looked weird. That was all, but I just snapped. And then I\u2014I exploded. I almost ripped his face off\u2014my own father!\" He shuddered, and his face <em>paled</em>. \"Is it really bad, Jake?\" I asked anxiously, wishing I had some way to help him. \"Are you miserable?\" \"No, I'm not miserable,\" he told me. \"Not anymore. Not now that you know. That was hard, before.\" He leaned over so that his cheek was resting on top of my head. He was quiet for a moment, and I wondered what he was thinking about. Maybe I didn't want to know. \"What's the hardest part?\" I whispered, still wishing I could help. \"The hardest part is feeling\u2026 out of control,\" he said slowly. \"Feeling like I can't be sure of myself\u2014like maybe you shouldn't be around me, like maybe nobody should. Like I'm a monster who might hurt somebody. You've seen Emily. Sam lost control of his temper for just one second\u2026 and she was standing too close. And now there's nothing he can ever do to put it right again. I hear his thoughts\u2014I know what that feels like\u2026 \"Who wants to be a nightmare, a monster? \"And then, the way it comes so easily to me, the way I'm better at it than the rest of them\u2014does that make me even less human than Enbry or Sam? Sometimes I'm afraid that I'm losing myself.\" \"Is it hard? To find yourself again?\" \"At first,\" he said. \"It takes some practice to phase back and forth. But it's easier for me.\" \"Why?\" I wondered. \"Because Ephraim Black was my father's grandfather, and Quil Ateara was my mother's grandfather.\" \"Quil?\" I asked in confusion. \"His great-grandfather,\" Jacob clarified. \"The Quil you know is my second cousin.\" \"But why does it matter who your great-grandfathers are?\" \"Because Ephraim and Quil were in the last pack. Levi Uley was the third. It's in my blood on both sides.\u00a0 I never had a chance. Like Quil doesn't have a chance.\" His expression was bleak. \"What's the very best part?\" I asked, hoping to cheer him up. \"The best part,\" he said, suddenly smiling again, \"is the speed.\" \"Better than the motorcycles?\" He nodded, enthusiastic. \"There's no comparison.\" \"How fast can you\u2026 ?\" \"Run?\" he finished my question. \"Fast enough. What can I measure it by? We caught\u2026 what was his name? Laurent? I imagine that means more to you than it would to someone else.\" It did mean something to me. I couldn't imagine that\u2014the wolves running faster than a vampire. When the Cullens ran, they all but turned invisible with speed. \"So, tell me something I don't know,\" he said. \"Something about vampires. How did you stand it, being around them? Didn't it creep you out?\" \"No,\" I said curtly. My tone made him thoughtful for a moment. \"Say, why'd your bloodsucker kill that James, anyway?\" he asked suddenly. \"James was trying to kill me\u2014it was like a game for him. He lost. Do you remember last spring when I was in the hospital down in Phoenix?\" Jacob sucked in a breath. \"He got that close?\" \"He got very, very close.\" I stroked my scar. Jacob noticed, because he held the hand I moved. \"What's that?\" He traded hands, examining my right. \"This is your funny scar, the cold one.\" He looked at it closer, with new eyes, and gasped. \"Yes, it's what you think it is,\" I said. \"James bit me.\" His eyes bulged, and his face turned a strange, sallow color under the russet surface. He looked like he was about to be sick. \"But if he bit you\u2026 ? Shouldn't you be\u2026 ?\" He choked. \"Edward saved me twice,\" I whispered. \"He sucked the venom out\u2014you know, like with a rattlesnake.\" I twitched as the pain lashed around the edges of the hole. But I wasn't the only one twitching. I could feel Jacob's whole body trembling next to mine. Even the car shook. \"Careful, Jake. Easy. Calm down.\" \"Yeah,\" he panted. \"Calm.\" He shook his head back and forth quickly. After a moment, only his hands were shaking. \"You okay?\" \"Yeah, almost. Tell me something else. Give me something else to think about.\" \"What do you want to know?\" \"I don't know.\" He had his eyes closed, concentrating. \"The extra stuff I guess. Did any of the other Cullens have\u2026 extra talents? Like the mind reading?\" I hesitated a second. This felt like a question he would ask of his spy, not his friend. But what was the point of hiding what I knew? It didn't matter now, and it would help him control himself. So I spoke quickly, the image of Emily's ruined face in my mind, and the hair rising on my arms. I couldn't imagine how the russet wolf would fit inside the Rabbit\u2014Jacob would tear the whole garage apart if he changed now. \"Jasper could\u2026 sort of control the emotions of the people around him. Not in a bad way, just to calm someone down, that kind of thing. It would probably help Paul a lot,\" I added, teasing weakly. \"And then Alice could see things that were going to happen. The future, you know, but not absolutely. The things she saw would change when someone changed the path they were on\u2026\" Like how she'd seen me dying\u2026 and she'd seen me becoming one of them. Two things that had not happened. And one that never would. My head started to spin\u2014I couldn't seem to pull in enough oxygen from the air. No lungs. Jacob was entirely in control now, very still beside me. \"Why do you do that?\" he asked. He tugged lightly at one of my arms, which was bound around my chest, and then gave up when it wouldn't come loose easily. I hadn't even realized I'd moved them. \"You do that when you're upset. Why?\" \"It hurts to think about them,\" I whispered. \"It's like I can't breathe\u2026 like I'm breaking into pieces\u2026\"It was bizarre how much I could tell Jacob now. We had no more secrets. He smoothed my hair. \"It's okay, Bella, it's okay. I won't bring it up again. I'm sorry.\" \"I'm fine.\" I gasped. \"Happens all the time. Not your fault.\" \"We're a pretty messed-up pair, aren't we?\" Jacob said. \"Neither one of us can hold our shape together right.\" \"Pathetic,\" I agreed, still breathless. \"At least we have each other,\" he said, clearly comforted by the thought. I was comforted, too. \"At least there's that,\" I agreed. And when we were together, it was fine. But Jacob had a horrible, dangerous job he felt compelled to do, and so I was often alone, stuck in La Push for safety, with nothing to do to keep my mind off any of my worries. I felt awkward, always taking up space at Billy's. I did some studying for another Calculus test that was coming up next week, but I could only look at math for so long. When I didn't have something obvious to do in my hands,\u00a0 I felt like I ought to be making conversation with Billy\u2014the pressure of normal societal rules. But Billy wasn't one for filling up the long silences, and so the awkwardness continued. I tried hanging out at Emily's place Wednesday afternoon, for a change. At first it was kind of nice. Emily was a cheerful person who never sat still. I drifted behind her while she flitted around her little house and yard, scrubbing at the spotless floor, pulling a tiny weed, fixing a broken hinge, tugging a string of wool through an ancient loom, and always cooking, too. She complained lightly about the increase in the boys' appetites from all their extra running, but it was easy to see she didn't mind taking care of them. It wasn't hard to be with her\u2014after all, we were both wolf girls now. But Sam checked in after I'd been there for a few hours. I only stayed long enough to ascertain that Jacob was fine and there was no news, and then I had to escape. The aura of love and contentment that surrounded them was harder to take in concentrated doses, with no one else around to dilute it. So that left me wandering the beach, pacing the length of the rocky crescent back and forth, again and again. Alone time wasn't good for me. Thanks to the new honesty with Jacob, I'd been talking and thinking about the Cullens way too much. No matter how I tried to distract myself\u2014and I had plenty to think of: I was honestly and desperately worried about Jacob and his wolf-brothers, I was terrified for Charlie and the others who thought they were hunting animals, I was getting in deeper and deeper with Jacob without ever having consciously decided to progress in that direction and I didn't know what to do about it\u2014none of these very real, very deserving of thought, very pressing concerns could take my mind off the pain in my chest for long. Eventually, I couldn't even walk anymore, because I couldn't breathe. I sat down on a patch of semidry rocks and curled up in a ball. Jacob found me like that, and I could tell from his expression that he understood. \"Sorry,\" he said right away. He pulled me up from the ground and wrapped both arms around my shoulders. I hadn't realized that I was cold until then. His warmth made me shudder, but at least I could breathe with him there. \"I'm ruining your spring break,\" Jacob accused himself as we walked back up the beach. \"No, you're not. I didn't have any plans. I don't think I like spring breaks, anyway.\" \"I'll take tomorrow morning off. The others can run without me. We'll do something fun.\" The word seemed out of place in my life right now, barely comprehensible, bizarre. \"Fun?\" \"Fun is exactly what you need. Hmm\u2026\" he gazed out across the heaving gray waves, deliberating. As his eyes scanned the horizon, he had a flash of inspiration. \"Got it!\" he crowed. \"Another promise to keep.\" \"What are you talking about?\" He let go of my hand and pointed toward the southern edge of the beach, where the flat, rocky half-moon dead-ended against the sheer sea cliffs. I stared, uncomprehending. \"Didn't I promise to take you cliff diving?\" I shivered. \"Yeah, it'll be pretty cold\u2014not as cold as it is today. Can you feel the weather changing? The pressure?\u00a0 It will be warmer tomorrow. You up for it?\" The dark water did not look inviting, and, from this angle, the cliffs looked even higher than before. But it had been days since I'd heard Edward's voice. That was probably part of the problem. I was addicted to the sound of my delusions. It made things worse if I went too long without them. Jumping off a cliff was certain to remedy that situation. \"Sure, I'm up for it. Fun.\" \"It's a date,\" he said, and draped his arm around my shoulders. \"Okay\u2014now let's go get you some sleep.\" I didn't like the way the circles under his eyes were beginning to look permanently etched onto his skin. I woke early the next morning and snuck a change of clothes out to the truck. I had a feeling that Charlie would approve of today's plan just about as much as he would approve of the motorcycle. The idea of a distraction from all my worries had me almost excited. Maybe it would be fun. A date with Jacob, a date with Edward\u2026 I laughed darkly to myself. Jake could say what he wanted about us being a messed-up pair\u2014I was the one who was truly messed up. I made the werewolf seem downright normal. I expected Jacob to meet me out front, the way he usually did when my noisy truck announced my arrival. When he didn't, I guessed that he might still be sleeping. I would wait\u2014let him get as much rest as he could. He needed his sleep, and that would give the day time to warm a bit more. Jake had been right about the weather, though; it had changed in the night. A thick layer of clouds pressed heavily on the atmosphere now, making it almost sultry; it was warm and close under the gray blanket. I left my sweater in the truck. I knocked quietly on the door. \"C'mon in, Bella,\" Billy said. He was at the kitchen table, eating cold cereal. \"Jake sleeping?\" \"Er, no.\" He set his spoon down, and his eyebrows pulled together. \"What happened?\" I demanded. I could tell from his expression that something had. \"Embry, Jared, and Paul crossed a fresh trail early this morning. Sam and Jake took off to help. Sam was hopeful\u2014she's hedged herself in beside the mountains. He thinks they have a good chance to finish this.\" \"Oh, no, Billy,\" I whispered. \"Oh, no.\" He chuckled, deep and low. \"Do you really like La Push so well that you want to extend your sentence here?\" \"Don't make jokes, Billy. This is too scary for that.\" \"You're right,\" he agreed, still complacent. His ancient eyes were impossible to read. \"This one's tricky.\" I bit my lip. \"It's not as dangerous for them as you think it is. Sam knows what he's doing. You're the one that you should worry about. The vampire doesn't want to fight them. She's just trying to find a way around them\u2026 to you.\" \"How does Sam know what he's doing?\" I demanded, brushing aside his concern for me. \"They've only killed just the one vampire\u2014that could have been luck.\" \"We take what we do very seriously, Bella. Nothing's been forgotten. Everything they need to know has been passed down from father to son for generations.\" That didn't comfort me the way he probably intended it to. The memory of Victoria, wild, catlike, lethal, was too strong in my head. If she couldn't get around the wolves, she would eventually try to go through them. Billy went back to his breakfast; I sat down on the sofa and flipped aimlessly though the TV channels. That didn't last long. I started to feel closed in by the small room, claustrophobic, upset by the fact that I couldn't see out the curtained windows. \"I'll be at the beach,\" I told Billy abruptly, and hurried out the door. Being outside didn't help as much as I'd hoped. The clouds pushed down with an invisible weight that kept the claustrophobia from easing. The forest seemed strangely vacant as I walked toward the beach. I didn't see any animals\u2014no birds, no squirrels. I couldn't hear any birds, either. The silence was eerie; there wasn't even the sound of wind in the trees.  I knew it was all just a product of the weather, but it still made me edgy. The heavy, warm pressure of the atmosphere was perceptible even to my weak human senses, and it hinted at something major in the storm department. A glance at the sky backed this up; the clouds were churning sluggishly despite the lack of breeze on the ground. The closest clouds were a smoky gray, but between the cracks I could see another layer that was a gruesome purple color. The skies had a ferocious plan in store for today. The animals must be bunkering down. As soon as I reached the beach, I wished I hadn't come\u2014I'd already had enough of this place. I'd been here almost every day, wandering alone. Was it so much different from my nightmares? But where else to go? I trudged down to the driftwood tree, and sat at the end so that I could lean against the tangled roots. I stared up at the angry sky broodingly, waiting for the first drops to break the stillness. I tried not to think about the danger Jacob and his friends were in. Because nothing could happen to Jacob. The thought was unendurable. I'd lost too much already\u2014would fate take the last few shreds of peace left behind? That seemed unfair, out of balance. But maybe I'd violated some unknown rule, crossed some line that had condemned me. Maybe it was wrong to be so involved with myths and legends, to turn my back on the human world. Maybe\u2026 No. Nothing would happen to Jacob. I had to believe that or I wouldn't be able to function. \"Argh!\" I groaned, and jumped off the log. I couldn't sit still; it was worse than pacing.  I'd really been counting on hearing Edward this morning. It seemed like that was the one thing that might make it bearable to live through this day. The hole had been festering lately, like it was getting revenge for the times that Jacob's presence had tamed it. The edges burned. The waves picked up as I paced, beginning to crash against the rocks, but there was still no wind. I felt pinned down by the pressure of the storm. Everything swirled around me, but it was perfectly still where I stood. The air had a faint electric charge\u2014I could feel the static in my hair. Farther out, the waves were angrier than they were along the shore. I could see them battering against the line of the cliffs, spraying big white clouds of sea foam into the sky. There was still no movement in the air, though the clouds roiled more quickly now. It was eerie looking\u2014like the clouds were moving by their own will. I shivered, though I knew it was just a trick of the pressure. The cliffs were a black knife edge against the livid sky. Staring at them, I remembered the day Jacob had told me about Sam and his \"gang.\" I thought of the boys\u2014the werewolves\u2014throwing themselves into the empty air. The image of the falling, spiraling figures was still vivid in my mind. I imagined the utter freedom of the fall\u2026 I imagined the way Edward's voice would have sounded in my head\u2014furious, velvet, perfect\u2026 The burning in my chest flared agonizingly. There had to be some way to quench it. The pain was growing more and more intolerable by the second. I glared at the cliffs and the crashing waves. Well, why not? Why not quench it right now? Jacob had promised me cliff diving, hadn't he? Just because he was unavailable, should I have to give up the distraction I needed so badly\u2014needed even worse because Jacob was out risking his life? Risking it, in essence, for me. If it weren't for me, Victoria would not be killing people here\u2026 just somewhere else, far away. If anything happened to Jacob, it would be my fault. That realization stabbed deep and had me jogging back up to the road toward Billy's house, where my truck waited. I knew my way to the lane that passed closest to the cliffs, but I had to hunt for the little path that would take me out to the ledge. As I followed it, I looked for turns or forks, knowing that Jake had planned to take me off the lower outcropping rather than the top, but the path wound in a thin single line toward the brink with no options. I didn't have time to find another way down\u2014the storm was moving in quickly now. The wind was finally beginning to touch me, the clouds pressing closer to the ground. Just as I reached the place where the dirt path fanned out into the stone precipice, the first drops broke through and splattered on my face. It was not hard to convince myself that I didn't have time to search for another way\u2014I wanted to jump from the top. This was the image that had lingered in my head. I wanted the long fall that would feel like flying. I knew that this was the stupidest, most reckless thing I had done yet. The thought made me smile. The pain was already easing, as if my body knew that Edward's voice was just seconds away\u2026 The ocean sounded very far away, somehow farther than before, when I was on the path in the trees. I grimaced when I thought of the probable temperature of the water. But I wasn't going to let that stop me. The wind blew stronger now, whipping the rain into eddies around me. I stepped out to the edge, keeping my eyes on the empty space in front of me. My toes felt ahead blindly, caressing the edge of the rock when they encountered it. I drew in a deep breath and held it . . waiting. \"Bella.\" I smiled and exhaled. Yes? I didn't answer out loud, for fear that the sound of my voice would shatter the beautiful illusion. He sounded so real, so close. It was only when he was disapproving like this that I could hear the true memory of his voice\u2014the velvet texture and the musical intonation that made up the most perfect of all voices. \"Don't do this,\" he pleaded. You wanted me to be human, I reminded him. Well, watch me. \"Please. For me.\" But you won't stay with me any other way. \"Please.\" It was just a whisper in the blowing rain that tossed my hair and drenched my clothes\u2014making me as wet as if this were my second jump of the day. I rolled up onto the balls of my feet. \"No, Bella!\" He was angry now, and the anger was so lovely. I smiled and raised my arms straight out, as if I were going to dive, lifting my face into the rain. But it was too ingrained from years of swimming at the public pool\u2014feet first, first time. I leaned forward, crouching to get more spring\u2026 And I flung myself off the cliff. I screamed as I dropped through the open air like a meteor, but it was a scream of exhilaration and not fear. The wind resisted, trying vainly to fight the\u00a0 unconquerable gravity, pushing against me and twirling me in spirals like a rocket crashing to the earth. Yes! The word echoed through my head as I sliced through the surface of the water. It was icy, colder than I'd feared, and yet the chill only added to the high. I was proud of myself as I plunged deeper into the freezing black water. I hadn't had one moment of terror\u2014just pure adrenaline. Really, the fall wasn't scary at all. Where was the challenge? That was when the current caught me. I'd been so preoccupied by the size of the cliffs, by the obvious danger of their high, sheer faces, that I hadn't worried at all about the dark water waiting. I never dreamed that the true menace was lurking far below me, under the heaving surf. It felt like the waves were fighting over me, jerking me back and forth between them as if determined to share by pulling me into halves. I knew the right way to avoid a riptide: swim parallel to the beach rather than struggling for the shore. But the knowledge did me little good when I didn't know which way the shore was. I couldn't even tell which way the surface was. The angry water was black in every direction; there was no brightness to direct me upward. Gravity was all-powerful when it competed with the air, but it had nothing on the waves\u2014I couldn't feel a downward pull, a sinking in any direction. Just the battering of the current that flung me round and round like a rag doll. I fought to keep my breath in, to keep my lips locked around my last store of oxygen. It didn't surprise me that my delusion of Edward was there. He owed me that much, considering that I was dying. I was surprised by how sure that knowledge was. I was going to drown. I was drowning. \"Keep swimming!\" Edward begged urgently in my head. Where? There was nothing but the darkness. There was no place to swim to. \"Stop that!\" he ordered. \"Don't you dare give up!\" The cold of the water was numbing my arms and legs. I didn't feel the buffeting so much as before. It was more of just a dizziness now, a helpless spinning in the water. But I listened to him. I forced my arms to continue reaching, my legs to kick harder, though every second I was facing a new direction. It couldn't be doing any good. What was the point? \"Fight!\" he yelled. \"Damn it, Bella, keep fighting.\" Why? I didn't want to fight anymore. And it wasn't the light-headedness, or the cold, or the failure of my arms as the muscles gave out in exhaustion, that made me content to stay where I was. I was almost happy that it was over. This was an easier death than others I'd faced. Oddly peaceful. I thought briefly of the clich\u00e9s, about how you were suppose to see your life flash before your eyes. I was so much luckier. Who wanted to see a rerun, anyway? I saw him, and I had no will to fight. It was so clear, so much more defined than any memory. My subconscious had stored Edward away in flawless detail, saving him for this final moment. I could see his perfect face as if he were really there; the exact shade of his icy skin, the shape of his lips, the line of his jaw, the gold glinting in his furious eyes. He was angry, naturally, that I was giving up. His teeth were clenched and his nostrils flared with rage. \"No! Bella, no!\" My ears were flooded with the freezing water, but his voice was clearer than ever. I ignored his words and concentrated on the sound of his voice. Why would I fight when I was so happy where I was? Even as my lungs burned for more air and my legs cramped in the icy cold, I was content. I'd forgotten what real happiness felt like. Happiness. It made the whole dying thing pretty bearable. The current won at that moment, shoving me abruptly against something hard, a rock invisible in the gloom. It hit me solidly across the chest, slamming into me like an iron bar, and the breath whooshed out of my lungs, escaping in a thick cloud of silver bubbles. Water flooded down my throat, choking and burning. The iron bar seemed to be dragging me, pulling me away from Edward, deeper into the dark, to the ocean floor. Goodbye, I love you, was my last thought.",

            "en": "13        13. CONFESSIONS Edward in the sunlight was shocking. I couldn't get used to it, though I'd been staring at him all afternoon. His skin, white despite the faint flush from yesterday's hunting trip, literally sparkled, like thousands of tiny diamonds were embedded in the surface. He lay perfectly still in the grass, his shirt open over his sculpted, incandescent chest, his scintillating arms bare. His glistening, pale lavender lids were shut, though of course he didn't sleep. A perfect statue, carved in some unknown stone, smooth like marble, glittering like crystal. Now and then, his lips would move, so fast it looked like they were trembling. But, when I asked, he told me he was singing to himself; it was too low for me to hear. I enjoyed the sun, too, though the air wasn't quite dry enough for my taste. I would have liked to lie back, as he did, and let the sun warm my face. But I stayed curled up, my chin resting on my knees, unwilling to take my eyes off him. The wind was gentle; it tangled my hair and ruffled the grass that swayed around his motionless form. The meadow, so spectacular to me at first, <em>paled</em> next to his magnificence. Hesitantly, always afraid, even now, that he would disappear like a mirage, too beautiful to be real\u2026 hesitantly, I reached out one finger and stroked the back of his shimmering hand, where it lay within my reach. I marveled again at the perfect texture, satin smooth, cool as stone. When I looked up again, his eyes were open, watching me. Butterscotch today, lighter, warmer after hunting. His quick smile turned up the corners of his flawless lips. \"I don't scare you?\" he asked playfully, but I could hear the real curiosity in his soft voice. \"No more than usual.\" He smiled wider; his teeth flashed in the sun. I inched closer, stretched out my whole hand now to trace the contours of his forearm with my fingertips. I saw that my fingers trembled, and knew it wouldn't escape his notice. \"Do you mind?\" I asked, for he had closed his eyes again. \"No,\" he said without opening his eyes. \"You can't imagine how that feels.\" He sighed. I lightly trailed my hand over the perfect muscles of his arm, followed\u00a0 the faint pattern of bluish veins inside the crease at his elbow. With my other hand, I reached to turn his hand over. Realizing what I wished, he flipped his palm up in one of those blindingly fast, disconcerting movements of his. It startled me; my fingers froze on his arm for a brief second. \"Sorry,\" he murmured. I looked up in time to see his golden eyes close again. \"It's too easy to be myself with you.\" I lifted his hand, turning it this way and that as I watched the sun glitter on his palm. I held it closer to my face, trying to see the hidden facets in his skin. \"Tell me what you're thinking,\" he whispered. I looked to see his eyes watching me, suddenly intent. \"It's still so strange for me, not knowing.\" \"You know, the rest of us feel that way all the time.\" \"It's a hard life.\" Did I imagine the hint of regret in his tone? \"But you didn't tell me.\" \"I was wishing I could know what you were thinking\u2026\" I hesitated. \"And?\" \"I was wishing that I could believe that you were real. And I was wishing that I wasn't afraid.\" \"I don't want you to be afraid.\" His voice was just a soft murmur. I heard what he couldn't truthfully say, that I didn't need to be afraid, that there was nothing to fear. \"Well, that's not exactly the fear I meant, though that's certainly something to think about.\" So quickly that I missed his movement, he was half sitting, propped up on his right arm, his left palm still in my hands. His angel's face was only a few inches from mine. I might have \u2014 should have \u2014 flinched away from his unexpected closeness, but I was unable to move.  His golden eyes mesmerized me. \"What are you afraid of, then?\" he whispered intently. But I couldn't answer. As I had just that once before, I smelled his cool breath in my face. Sweet, delicious, the scent made my mouth water. It was unlike anything else. Instinctively, unthinkingly, I leaned closer, inhaling. And he was gone, his hand ripped from mine. In the time it took my eyes to focus, he was twenty feet away, standing at the edge of the small meadow, in the deep shade of a huge fir tree. He stared at me, his eyes dark in the shadows, his expression unreadable. I could feel the hurt and shock on my face. My empty hands stung. \"I'm\u2026 sorry\u2026 Edward,\" I whispered. I knew he could hear. \"Give me a moment,\" he called, just loud enough for my less sensitive ears. I sat very still. After ten incredibly long seconds, he walked back, slowly for him. He stopped, still several feet away, and sank gracefully to the ground, crossing his legs. His eyes never left mine.  He took two deep breaths, and then smiled in apology. \"I am so very sorry.\" He hesitated. \"Would you understand what I meant if I said I was only human?\" I nodded once, not quite able to smile at his joke. Adrenaline pulsed through my veins as the realization of danger slowly sank in. He could smell that from where he sat. His smile turned mocking. \"I'm the world's best predator, aren't I? Everything about me invites you in \u2014 my voice, my face, even my smell. As if I need any of that!\" Unexpectedly, he was on his feet, bounding away, instantly out of sight, only to appear beneath the same tree as before, having circled the meadow in half a second. \"As if you could outrun me,\" he laughed bitterly. He reached up with one hand and, with a deafening crack, effortlessly ripped a two-foot-thick branch from the trunk of the spruce. He balanced it in that hand for a moment, and then threw it with blinding speed, shattering it against another huge tree, which shook and trembled at the blow. And he was in front of me again, standing two feet away, still as a stone. \"As if you could fight me off,\" he said gently. I sat without moving, more frightened of him than I had ever been. I'd never seen him so completely freed of that carefully cultivated facade. He'd never been less human\u2026 or more beautiful. Face ashen, eyes wide, I sat like a bird locked in the eyes of a snake. His lovely eyes seem to glow with rash excitement. Then, as the seconds passed, they dimmed. His expression slowly folded into a mask of ancient sadness. \"Don't be afraid,\" he murmured, his velvet voice unintentionally seductive. \"I promise\u2026\" He hesitated. \"I swear not to hurt you.\" He seemed more concerned with convincing himself than me. \"Don't be afraid,\" he whispered again as he stepped closer, with exaggerated slowness. He sat sinuously, with deliberately unhurried movements, till our faces were on the same level, just a foot apart. \"Please forgive me,\" he said formally. \"I can control myself. You caught me off guard. But I'm on my best behavior now.\" He waited, but I still couldn't speak. \"I'm not thirsty today, honestly.\" He winked. At that I had to laugh, though the sound was shaky and breathless. \"Are you all right?\" he asked tenderly, reaching out slowly, carefully, to place his marble hand back in mine. I looked at his smooth, cold hand, and then at his eyes. They were soft, repentant. I looked back at his hand, and then deliberately returned to tracing the lines in his hand with my fingertip. I looked up and smiled timidly. His answering smile was dazzling. \"So where were we, before I behaved so rudely?\" he asked in the gentle cadences of an earlier century. \"I honestly can't remember.\" He smiled, but his face was ashamed. \"I think we were talking about why you were afraid, besides the obvious reason.\" \"Oh, right.\" \"Well?\" I looked down at his hand and doodled aimlessly across his smooth, iridescent palm. The seconds ticked by. \"How easily frustrated I am,\" he sighed. I looked into his eyes, abruptly grasping that this was every bit as new to him as it was to me. As many years of unfathomable experience as he had, this was hard for him, too. I took courage from that thought. \"I was afraid\u2026 because, for, well, obvious reasons, I can't stay with you. And I'm afraid that I'd like to stay with you, much more than I should.\" I looked down at his hands as I spoke. It was difficult for me to say this aloud. \"Yes,\" he agreed slowly. \"That is something to be afraid of, indeed. Wanting to be with me. That's really not in your best interest.\" I frowned. \"I should have left long ago,\" he sighed. \"I should leave now. But I don't know if I can.\" \"I don't want you to leave,\" I mumbled pathetically, staring down again. \"Which is exactly why I should. But don't worry. I'm essentially a selfish creature. I crave your company too much to do what I should.\" \"I'm glad.\" \"Don't be!\" He withdrew his hand, more gently this time; his voice was harsher than usual. Harsh for him, still more beautiful than any human voice. It was hard to keep up \u2014 his sudden mood changes left me always a step behind, dazed. \"It's not only your company I crave! Never forget that. Never forget I am more dangerous to you than I am to anyone else.\" He stopped, and I looked to see him gazing unseeingly into the forest. I thought for a moment. \"I don't think I understand exactly what you mean \u2014 by that last part anyway,\" I said. He looked back at me and smiled, his mood shifting yet again. \"How do I explain?\" he mused. \"And without frightening you again\u2026 hmmmm.\" Without seeming to think about it, he placed his hand back in mine; I held it tightly in both of mine. He looked at our hands. \"That's amazingly pleasant, the warmth.\" He sighed. A moment passed as he assembled his thoughts. \"You know how everyone enjoys different flavors?\" he began. \"Some people love chocolate ice cream, others prefer strawberry?\" I nodded. \"Sorry about the food analogy \u2014 I couldn't think of another way to explain.\" I smiled. He smiled ruefully back. \"You see, every person smells different, has a different essence. If you locked an alcoholic in a room full of stale beer, he'd gladly drink it. But he could resist, if he wished to, if he were a recovering alcoholic. Now let's say you placed in that room a glass of hundred-year-old brandy, the rarest, finest cognac \u2014 and filled the room with its warm aroma \u2014 how do you think he would fare then?\" We sat silently, looking into each other's eyes \u2014 trying to read each other's thoughts. He broke the silence first. \"Maybe that's not the right comparison. Maybe it would be too easy to turn down the brandy. Perhaps I should have made our alcoholic a heroin addict instead.\" \"So what you're saying is, I'm your brand of heroin?\" I teased, trying to lighten the mood. He smiled swiftly, seeming to appreciate my effort. \"Yes, you are exactly my brand of heroin.\" \"Does that happen often?\" I asked. He looked across the treetops, thinking through his response. \"I spoke to my brothers about it.\" He still stared into the distance. \"To Jasper, every one of you is much the same. He's the most recent to join our family. It's a struggle for him to abstain at all. He hasn't had time to grow sensitive to the differences in smell, in flavor.\" He glanced swiftly at me, his expression apologetic. \"Sorry,\" he said. \"I don't mind. Please don't worry about offending me, or frightening me, or whichever. That's the way you think. I can understand, or I can try to at least. Just explain however you can.\" He took a deep breath and gazed at the sky again. \"So Jasper wasn't sure if he'd ever come across someone who was as\" \u2014 he hesitated, looking for the right word \u2014 \"appealing as you are to me.\u00a0 Which makes me think not. Emmett has been on the wagon longer, so to speak, and he understood what I meant. He says twice, for him, once stronger than the other.\" \"And for you?\" \"Never.\" The word hung there for a moment in the warm breeze. \"What did Emmett do?\" I asked to break the silence. It was the wrong question to ask. His face grew dark, his hand clenched into a fist inside mine. He looked away. I waited, but he wasn't going to answer. \"I guess I know,\" I finally said. He lifted his eyes; his expression was wistful, pleading. \"Even the strongest of us fall off the wagon, don't we?\" \"What are you asking? My permission?\" My voice was sharper than I'd intended. I tried to make my tone kinder \u2014 I could guess what his honesty must cost him. \"I mean, is there no hope, then?\" How calmly I could discuss my own death! \"No, no!\" He was instantly contrite. \"Of course there's hope! I mean, of course I won't\u2026\" He left the sentence hanging. His eyes burned into mine. \"It's different for us. Emmett\u2026 these were strangers he happened across. It was a long time ago, and he wasn't as\u2026 practiced, as careful, as he is now.\" He fell silent and watched me intently as I thought it through. \"So if we'd met\u2026 oh, in a dark alley or something\u2026\" I trailed off. \"It took everything I had not to jump up in the middle of that class full of children and \u2014\" He stopped abruptly, looking away. \"When you walked past me, I could have ruined everything Carlisle has built for us, right then and there. If I hadn't been denying my thirst for the last, well, too many years, I wouldn't have been able to stop myself.\" He paused, scowling at the trees. He glanced at me grimly, both of us remembering. \"You must have thought I was possessed.\" \"I couldn't understand why. How you could hate me so quickly\u2026\" \"To me, it was like you were some kind of demon, summoned straight from my own personal hell to ruin me. The fragrance coming off your skin\u2026 I thought it would make me deranged that first day. In that one hour, I thought of a hundred different ways to lure you from the room with me, to get you alone. And I fought them each back, thinking of my family, what I could do to them. I had to run out, to get away before I could speak the words that would make you follow\u2026\" He looked up then at my staggered expression as I tried to absorb his bitter memories. His golden eyes scorched from under his lashes, hypnotic and deadly. \"You would have come,\" he promised. I tried to speak calmly. \"Without a doubt.\" He frowned down at my hands, releasing me from the force of his stare. \"And then, as I tried to rearrange my schedule in a pointless attempt to avoid you, you were there \u2014 in that close, warm little room, the scent was maddening. I so very nearly took you then. There was only one other frail human there \u2014 so easily dealt with.\" I shivered in the warm sun, seeing my memories anew through his eyes, only now grasping the danger. Poor Ms. Cope; I shivered again at how close I'd come to being inadvertently responsible for her death. \"But I resisted. I don't know how. I forced myself not to wait for you, not to follow you from the school. It was easier outside, when I couldn't smell you anymore, to think clearly, to make the right decision. I left the others near home \u2014 I was too ashamed to tell them how weak I was, they only knew something was very wrong \u2014 and then I went straight to Carlisle, at the hospital, to tell him I was leaving.\" I stared in surprise.  \"I traded cars with him \u2014 he had a full tank of gas and I didn't want to stop. I didn't dare to go home, to face Esme. She wouldn't have let me go without a scene. She would have tried to convince me that it wasn't necessary\u2026 \"By the next morning I was in Alaska.\" He sounded ashamed, as if admitting a great cowardice. \"I spent two days there, with some old acquaintances\u2026 but I was homesick. I hated knowing I'd upset Esme, and the rest of them, my adopted family. In the pure air of the mountains it was hard to believe you were so irresistible. I convinced myself it was weak to run away. I'd dealt with temptation before, not of this magnitude, not even close, but I was strong. Who were you, an insignificant little girl\" \u2014 he grinned suddenly \u2014 \"to chase me from the place I wanted to be? So I came back\u2026\" He stared off into space. I couldn't speak. \"I took precautions, hunting, feeding more than usual before seeing you again. I was sure that I was strong enough to treat you like any other human. I was arrogant about it. \"It was unquestionably a complication that I couldn't simply read your thoughts to know what your reaction was to me. I wasn't used to having to go to such circuitous measures, listening to your words in Jessica's mind\u2026 her mind isn't very original, and it was annoying to have to stoop to that. And then I couldn't know if you really meant what you said. It was all extremely irritating.\" He frowned at the memory. \"I wanted you to forget my behavior that first day, if possible, so I tried to talk with you like I would with any person. I was eager actually, hoping to decipher some of your thoughts. But you were too interesting, I found myself caught up in your expressions\u2026 and every now and then you would stir the air with your hand or your hair, and the scent would stun me again\u2026 \"Of course, then you were nearly crushed to death in front of my eyes. Later I thought of a perfectly good excuse for why I acted at that moment \u2014 because if I hadn't saved you, if your blood had been spilled there in front of me, I don't think I could have stopped myself from exposing us for what we are. But I only thought of that excuse later. At the time, all I could think was, 'Not her.'\" He closed his eyes, lost in his agonized confession. I listened, more eager than rational. Common sense told me I should be terrified. Instead, I was relieved to finally understand. And I was filled with compassion for his suffering, even now, as he confessed his craving to take my life. I finally was able to speak, though my voice was faint. \"In the hospital?\" His eyes flashed up to mine. \"I was appalled. I couldn't believe I had put us in danger after all, put myself in your power \u2014 you of all people. As if I needed another motive to kill you.\"  We both flinched as that word slipped out. \"But it had the opposite effect,\" he continued quickly. \"I fought with Rosalie, Emmett, and Jasper when they suggested that now was the time\u2026 the worst fight we've ever had. Carlisle sided with me, and Alice.\" He grimaced when he said her name. I couldn't imagine why. \"Esme told me to do whatever I had to in order to stay.\" He shook his head indulgently. \"All that next day I eavesdropped on the minds of everyone you spoke to, shocked that you kept your word. I didn't understand you at all. But I knew that I couldn't become more involved with you. I did my very best to stay as far from you as possible. And every day the perfume of your skin, your breath, your hair\u2026 it hit me as hard as the very first day.\" He met my eyes again, and they were surprisingly tender. \"And for all that,\" he continued, \"I'd have fared better if I had exposed us all at that first moment, than if now, here \u2014 with no witnesses and nothing to stop me \u2014 I were to hurt you.\" I was human enough to have to ask. \"Why?\" \"Isabella.\" He pronounced my full name carefully, then playfully ruffled my hair with his free hand. A shock ran through my body at his casual touch. \"Bella, I couldn't live with myself if I ever hurt you. You don't know how it's tortured me.\" He looked down, ashamed again. \"The thought of you, still, white, cold\u2026 to never see you blush scarlet again, to never see that flash of intuition in your eyes when you see through my pretenses\u2026 it would be unendurable.\" He lifted his glorious, agonized eyes to mine. \"You are the most important thing to me now. The most important thing to me ever.\" My head was spinning at the rapid change in direction our conversation had taken. From the cheerful topic of my impending demise, we were suddenly declaring ourselves. He waited, and even though I looked down to study our hands between us, I knew his golden eyes were on me.  \"You already know how I feel, of course,\" I finally said. \"I'm here\u2026 which, roughly translated, means I would rather die than stay away from you.\" I frowned. \"I'm an idiot.\" \"You are an idiot,\" he agreed with a laugh. Our eyes met, and I laughed, too. We laughed together at the idiocy and sheer impossibility of such a moment. \"And so the lion fell in love with the lamb\u2026\" he murmured. I looked away, hiding my eyes as I thrilled to the word. \"What a stupid lamb,\" I sighed. \"What a sick, masochistic lion.\" He stared into the shadowy forest for a long moment, and I wondered where his thoughts had taken him. \"Why\u2026 ?\" I began, and then paused, not sure how to continue. He looked at me and smiled; sunlight glinted off his face, his teeth.  \"Yes?\" \"Tell me why you ran from me before.\" His smile faded. \"You know why.\" \"No, I mean, exactly what did I do wrong? I'll have to be on my guard, you see, so I better start learning what I shouldn't do. This, for example\" \u2014 I stroked the back of his hand \u2014 \"seems to be all right.\" He smiled again. \"You didn't do anything wrong, Bella. It was my fault.\" \"But I want to help, if I can, to not make this harder for you.\" \"Well\u2026\" He contemplated for a moment. \"It was just how close you were. Most humans instinctively shy away from us, are repelled by our alienness\u2026 I wasn't expecting you to come so close. And the smell of your throat.\" He stopped short, looking to see if he'd upset me. \"Okay, then,\" I said flippantly, trying to alleviate the suddenly tense atmosphere. I tucked my chin. \"No throat exposure.\" It worked; he laughed. \"No, really, it was more the surprise than anything else.\" He raised his free hand and placed it gently on the side of my neck. I sat very still, the chill of his touch a natural warning \u2014 a warning telling me to be terrified. But there was no feeling of fear in me. There were, however, other feelings\u2026 \"You see,\" he said. \"Perfectly fine.\" My blood was racing, and I wished I could slow it, sensing that this must make everything so much more difficult \u2014 the thudding of my pulse in my veins. Surely he could hear it. \"The blush on your cheeks is lovely,\" he murmured. He gently freed his other hand. My hands fell limply into my lap. Softly he brushed my cheek, then held my face between his marble hands. \"Be very still,\" he whispered, as if I wasn't already frozen. Slowly, never moving his eyes from mine, he leaned toward me. Then abruptly, but very gently, he rested his cold cheek against the hollow at the base of my throat. I was quite unable to move, even if I'd wanted to. I listened to the sound of his even breathing, watching the sun and wind play in his bronze hair, more human than any other part of him. With deliberate slowness, his hands slid down the sides of my neck. I shivered, and I heard him catch his breath. But his hands didn't pause as they softly moved to my shoulders, and then stopped. His face drifted to the side, his nose skimming across my collarbone. He came to rest with the side of his face pressed tenderly against my chest. Listening to my heart. \"Ah,\" he sighed. I don't know how long we sat without moving. It could have been hours.  Eventually the throb of my pulse quieted, but he didn't move or speak again as he held me. I knew at any moment it could be too much, and my life could end \u2014 so quickly that I might not even notice. And I couldn't make myself be afraid. I couldn't think of anything, except that he was touching me. And then, too soon, he released me.  His eyes were peaceful. \"It won't be so hard again,\" he said with satisfaction. \"Was that very hard for you?\" \"Not nearly as bad as I imagined it would be. And you?\" \"No, it wasn't bad\u2026 for me.\" He smiled at my inflection. \"You know what I mean.\" I smiled. \"Here.\" He took my hand and placed it against his cheek. \"Do you feel how warm it is?\" And it was almost warm, his usually icy skin. But I barely noticed, for I was touching his face, something I'd dreamed of constantly since the first day I'd seen him. \"Don't move,\" I whispered. No one could be still like Edward. He closed his eyes and became as immobile as stone, a carving under my hand. I moved even more slowly than he had, careful not to make one unexpected move. I caressed his cheek, delicately stroked his eyelid, the purple shadow in the hollow under his eye. I traced the shape of his perfect nose, and then, so carefully, his flawless lips. His lips parted under my hand, and I could feel his cool breath on my fingertips. I wanted to lean in, to inhale the scent of him. So I dropped my hand and leaned away, not wanting to push him too far. He opened his eyes, and they were hungry. Not in a way to make me fear, but rather to tighten the muscles in the pit of my stomach and send my pulse hammering through my veins again. \"I wish,\" he whispered, \"I wish you could feel the\u2026 complexity\u2026 the confusion\u2026 I feel. That you could understand.\" He raised his hand to my hair, then carefully brushed it across my face. \"Tell me,\" I breathed. \"I don't think I can. I've told you, on the one hand, the hunger \u2014 the thirst \u2014 that, deplorable creature that I am, I feel for you. And I think you can understand that, to an extent. Though\" \u2014 he half-smiled \u2014 \"as you are not addicted to any illegal substances, you probably can't empathize completely. \"But\u2026\" His fingers touched my lips lightly, making me shiver again. \"There are other hungers. Hungers I don't even understand, that are foreign to me.\" \"I may understand that better than you think.\" \"I'm not used to feeling so human. Is it always like this?\" \"For me?\" I paused. \"No, never. Never before this.\" He held my hands between his. They felt so feeble in his iron strength. \"I don't know how to be close to you,\" he admitted. \"I don't know if I can.\" I leaned forward very slowly, cautioning him with my eyes. I placed my cheek against his stone chest. I could hear his breath, and nothing else. \"This is enough,\" I sighed, closing my eyes. In a very human gesture, he put his arms around me and pressed his face against my hair. \"You're better at this than you give yourself credit for,\" I noted. \"I have human instincts \u2014 they may be buried deep, but they're there.\" We sat like that for another immeasurable moment; I wondered if he could be as unwilling to move as I was. But I could see the light was fading, the shadows of the forest beginning to touch us, and I sighed. \"You have to go.\" \"I thought you couldn't read my mind.\" \"It's getting clearer.\" I could hear a smile in his voice. He took my shoulders and I looked into his face. \"Can I show you something?\" he asked, sudden excitement flaring in his eyes. \"Show me what?\" \"I'll show you how I travel in the forest.\" He saw my expression. \"Don't worry, you'll be very safe, and we'll get to your truck much faster.\" His mouth twitched up into that crooked smile so beautiful my heart nearly stopped. \"Will you turn into a bat?\" I asked warily. He laughed, louder than I'd ever heard. \"Like I haven't heard that one before!\" \"Right, I'm sure you get that all the time.\" \"Come on, little coward, climb on my back.\" I waited to see if he was kidding, but, apparently, he meant it. He smiled as he read my hesitation, and reached for me. My heart reacted; even though he couldn't hear my thoughts, my pulse always gave me away. He then proceeded to sling me onto his back, with very little effort on my part, besides, when in place, clamping my legs and arms so tightly around him that it would choke a normal person. It was like clinging to a stone. \"I'm a bit heavier than your average backpack,\" I warned.  \"Hah!\" he snorted. I could almost hear his eyes rolling. I'd never seen him in such high spirits before. He startled me, suddenly grabbing my hand, pressing my palm to his face, and inhaling deeply. \"Easier all the time,\" he muttered. And then he was running. If I'd ever feared death before in his presence, it was nothing compared to how I felt now. He streaked through the dark, thick underbrush of the forest like a bullet, like a ghost. There was no sound, no evidence that his feet touched the earth. His breathing never changed, never indicated any effort. But the trees flew by at deadly speeds, always missing us by inches. I was too terrified to close my eyes, though the cool forest air whipped against my face and burned them. I felt as if I were stupidly sticking my head out the window of an airplane in flight. And, for the first time in my life, I felt the dizzy faintness of motion sickness. Then it was over. We'd hiked hours this morning to reach Edward's meadow, and now, in a matter of minutes, we were back to the truck. \"Exhilarating, isn't it?\" His voice was high, excited. He stood motionless, waiting for me to climb down. I tried, but my muscles wouldn't respond. My arms and legs stayed locked around him while my head spun uncomfortably. \"Bella?\" he asked, anxious now. \"I think I need to lie down,\" I gasped. \"Oh, sorry.\" He waited for me, but I still couldn't move. \"I think I need help,\" I admitted. He laughed quietly, and gently unloosened my stranglehold on his neck. There was no resisting the iron strength of his hands. Then he pulled me around to face him, cradling me in his arms like a small child. He held me for a moment, then carefully placed me on the springy ferns. \"How do you feel?\" he asked. I couldn't be sure how I felt when my head was spinning so crazily. \"Dizzy, I think.\" \"Put your head between your knees.\" I tried that, and it helped a little. I breathed in and out slowly, keeping my head very still. I felt him sitting beside me. The moments passed, and eventually I found that I could raise my head. There was a hollow ringing sound in my ears. \"I guess that wasn't the best idea,\" he mused. I tried to be positive, but my voice was weak. \"No, it was very interesting.\" \"Hah! You're as white as a ghost \u2014 no, you're as white as me!\" \"I think I should have closed my eyes.\" \"Remember that next time.\" \"Next time!\" I groaned. He laughed, his mood still radiant. \"Show-off,\" I muttered. \"Open your eyes, Bella,\" he said quietly. And he was right there, his face so close to mine. His beauty stunned my mind \u2014 it was too much, an excess I couldn't grow accustomed to. \"I was thinking, while I was running\u2026\" He paused. \"About not hitting the trees, I hope.\" \"Silly Bella,\" he chuckled. \"Running is second nature to me, it's not something I have to think about.\" \"Show-off,\" I muttered again. He smiled. \"No,\" he continued, \"I was thinking there was something I wanted to try.\" And he took my face in his hands again. I couldn't breathe. He hesitated \u2014 not in the normal way, the human way. Not the way a man might hesitate before he kissed a woman, to gauge her reaction, to see how he would be received. Perhaps he would hesitate to prolong the moment, that ideal moment of anticipation, sometimes better than the kiss itself. Edward hesitated to test himself, to see if this was safe, to make sure he was still in control of his need. And then his cold, marble lips pressed very softly against mine. What neither of us was prepared for was my response. Blood boiled under my skin, burned in my lips. My breath came in a wild gasp. My fingers knotted in his hair, clutching him to me. My lips parted as I breathed in his heady scent. Immediately I felt him turn to unresponsive stone beneath my lips. His hands gently, but with irresistible force, pushed my face back. I opened my eyes and saw his guarded expression. \"Oops,\" I breathed. \"That's an understatement.\" His eyes were wild, his jaw clenched in acute restraint, yet he didn't lapse from his perfect articulation. He held my face just inches from his. He dazzled my eyes. \"Should I\u2026 ?\" I tried to disengage myself, to give him some room. His hands refused to let me move so much as an inch. \"No, it's tolerable. Wait for a moment, please.\" His voice was polite, controlled. I kept my eyes on his, watched as the excitement in them faded and gentled. Then he smiled a surprisingly impish grin. \"There,\" he said, obviously pleased with himself. \"Tolerable?\" I asked. He laughed aloud. \"I'm stronger than I thought. It's nice to know.\" \"I wish I could say the same. I'm sorry.\" \"You are only human, after all.\" \"Thanks so much,\" I said, my voice acerbic. He was on his feet in one of his lithe, almost invisibly quick movements. He held out his hand to me, an unexpected gesture. I was so used to our standard of careful non-contact. I took his icy hand, needing the support more than I thought. My balance had not yet returned. \"Are you still faint from the run? Or was it my kissing expertise?\" How lighthearted, how human he seemed as he laughed now, his seraphic face untroubled. He was a different Edward than the one I had known. And I felt all the more besotted by him. It would cause me physical pain to be separated from him now. \"I can't be sure, I'm still woozy,\" I managed to respond. \"I think it's some of both, though.\" \"Maybe you should let me drive.\" \"Are you insane?\" I protested. \"I can drive better than you on your best day,\" he teased. \"You have much slower reflexes.\" \"I'm sure that's true, but I don't think my nerves, or my truck, could take it.\" \"Some trust, please, Bella.\" My hand was in my pocket, curled tightly around the key. I pursed my lips, deliberated, then shook my head with a tight grin. \"Nope. Not a chance.\" He raised his eyebrows in disbelief. I started to step around him, heading for the driver's side. He might have let me pass if I hadn't wobbled slightly. Then again, he might not have. His arm created an inescapable snare around my waist. \"Bella, I've already expended a great deal of personal effort at this point to keep you alive. I'm not about to let you behind the wheel of a vehicle when you can't even walk straight. Besides, friends don't let friends drive drunk,\" he quoted with a chuckle. I could smell the unbearably sweet fragrance coming off his chest. \"Drunk?\" I objected. \"You're intoxicated by my very presence.\" He was grinning that playful smirk again. \"I can't argue with that,\" I sighed.; I couldn't resist him in anything. I held the key high and dropped it, watching his hand flash like lightning to catch it soundlessly. \"Take it easy \u2014 my truck is a senior citizen.\" \"Very sensible,\" he approved. \"And are you not affected at all?\" I asked, irked. \"By my presence?\" Again his mobile features transformed, his expression became soft, warm. He didn't answer at first; he simply bent his face to mine, and brushed his lips slowly along my jaw, from my ear to my chin, back and forth. I trembled. \"Regardless,\" he finally murmured, \"I have better reflexes.\"",
