            "en": "Search For Survivors Continues After Chile Massive Quake       Rescue workers are tearing through the rubble in search of survivors in Chile Sunday, a day after a massive earthquake shattered the country's central region.  The 8.8 magnitude quake struck the South American country Saturday in the early morning hours.  Many Chileans have continued to stay out of their homes because of the jolting series of aftershocks, some as strong as 6.9 magnitude. The quake has killed more than 300 people and damaged as many as 1.5 million homes. Officials say the death toll is expected to rise. Rescuers are working to reach about a 100 people trapped in an apartment building that collapsed in Concepcion, the country's second-largest city. The main rescue operation is centered in the city, about 100 kilometers from the epicenter of the quake. Looters ransacked stores in Concepcion Sunday, stealing both food and electrical appliances. Police used tear gas and water cannons to disperse a crowd of looters at one supermarket. <em>Chilean</em> President Michelle Bachelet declared a \"state of catastrophe\" in central Chile, where the quake toppled buildings, overturned cars and brought down power and phone lines.  Bridges fell and many streets were covered with rubble. Fires were reported. Several hospitals collapsed. The president has not asked for assistance from other countries, but several nations have offered to send aid. Speaking at the Vatican Sunday, Pope Benedict said he is praying for the people of Chile and other populations in the Pacific tested by the calamity.  The earthquake has raised a daunting first challenge for billionaire Sebastian Pinera, who was elected Chile's president in January. He takes office in two weeks. Chile's children who were preparing to return to school Monday at the end of their summer break have had their vacation extended another week. In the capital, Santiago, officials closed the international airport because of damage. Argentina and other parts of South America also felt the earthquake. While cell phone communication was knocked out by the quake, many people used social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook to reach out to friends and loved ones. The U.S. Geological Survey says an earthquake with a magnitude of 8 or more is classified as a \"great\" earthquake that can cause tremendous damage.  The biggest earthquake ever recorded struck the same area of Chile in 1960. It had a magnitude of 9.5 and also set off a tsunami, which had devastating effects in Pacific countries including Japan and the Philippines, where at least 1,600 people were killed.",

            "en": "Many obstacles to a final Middle East peace deal      \n \n15 October 2010 Last updated at 02:14 GMT  Three of the 33 men rescued after 69 days trapped in the San Jose mine in Chile have been discharged from hospital and allowed to go home. The three, who were not officially identified, left in a white car amid tight security. Doctors said all the miners had responded well to treatment and many more of them would go home on Friday. Earlier President Sebastian Pinera visited them and promised to stamp out \"inhuman\" working conditions in Chile. Copiapo hospital's deputy medical director Dr Jorge Montes the three men who left would be allowed to carry out physical activity and would need sunglasses only if they were exposed to intense light. However, he warned that \"the psychological condition of the patients is something we cannot predict\". Dramatic rescue The miners had been told they would need to be held in the hospital for 48 hours but Health Minister Jaime Manalich announced earlier that their condition was so good that many would be able to leave within 24 hours. He said their condition was nothing short of a miracle. Some of the men have been given dental surgery and two have the lung disease, silicosis: Mario Sepulveda, the second miner to have been rescued, and Mario Gomez, 63, who is on a course of antibiotics for pneumonia. The men were hauled to the surface one at a time in a complicated and dramatic operation that took about 22 hours from the time the first miner reached the ground to when the last miner surfaced. They were winched up a narrow shaft in a metal capsule from where they had been trapped 625m (2,050 feet) below ground since the mine partially collapsed on 5 August. \"The trip up was calm,\" said rescued miner Richard Villarroel. \"Everything was well prepared. I came up listening to music.\" He and the 32 other miners have set a world record for surviving the longest time trapped underground. As they arrived at the surface, each miner was greeted by President Pinera, who promised a review that would lead to a \"very radical change\" affecting the health and safety of workers in mining as well as the transport, fishing and construction industries. He said it was impossible to guarantee that Chile would never face such an accident in the future. \"But we can guarantee one thing: never again in our country will we allow working in conditions so inhuman and so unsafe as happened in the San Jose mine and many other places in our country.\" He told the miners there will be a big celebration for them on 25 October, in the capital Santiago. He also invited them for a game of football the same day against the officials who had helped rescue them.  Mr Pinera joked that the winners would be allowed to live at the presidential palace, La Moneda, while the losers would have to go back down the mine. Offers The miners survived the first 17 days of their ordeal by eking out rations that were meant to last just a few days before rescuers found them via a probe lowered down a bore hole about the width of a grapefruit. Food and other supplies were lowered to the men while they waited for a larger shaft to be drilled for their rescue. Now that the men are safe, thoughts have turned to their emotional wellbeing. An insight into how the miners are adjusting to life above ground has come from a diary written for the BBC by the three children of Omar Reygadas, the 17th to be freed. One of the children, Ximena, has described how her father has become so pale after his 69 days underground that he resembles the cartoon ghost, Casper. \"In general, he's in good spirits. But then when he remembers the first few days after the accident, he starts crying, he gets very upset,\" she wrote. \"But then he pulls himself together and his spirits are high once more.\" The <em>Chilean</em> government has promised to care for the miners for at least six months. Offers and invitations to the men have begun to pour in.  European football clubs Manchester United and Real Madrid have invited the 33 to watch them play and they have also received offers of holidays and TV appearances. They are also expected to receive offers of jobs, advertising deals and book and movie contracts to tell their extraordinary stories http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11547889",

            "en": "Special: World Cup & Politics \u2013 When Sport And Society Mix     Goal.com's Ewan Macdonald looks at how the world's biggest football tournament and politics collide. For many, perhaps most, football is an escape.  It's a chance to lose oneself in entertainment and passion for ninety minutes on a weekend; to fraternise with like-minded fans; to celebrate your local pride in style.  Yet it's undeniable that for millions worldwide, football is simply more than that.  What happens on the pitch can collide quite dramatically with other aspects of life, not least politics.  This is true of the club game, where teams founded by workers quickly found themselves exceeding the capabilities of more genteel organisations early in football's history, and where divisions ranging from the ethnic to the religious to the cultural persist to this day.  But it's in the realm of international competition that such matters really come to a fore, and nowhere is that more true than in the World Cup.  Indeed, the World Cup itself is built on a political divide of a sort.  The first edition of the competition in 1930 was hosted by Uruguay, on the quite reasonable grounds that they had won the last two world amateur titles at the Olympics.  But, feeling snubbed, European countries declined to enter.  Particularly sniffy were the constituent countries of the United Kingdom, not FIFA members, who refused to consider membership in the organization, much less the long journey abroad.  In the event four European teams were coaxed across the ocean.  France made history by scoring the first ever World Cup goal through Lucien Laurent, an amateur forward and factory worker. (That French side was intriguing for all manner of reasons: captain Alex Villaplane, for example, returned home to become an enthusiastic Nazi collaborator before being executed in 1944.)  In any case, Uruguay (who inevitably won the tournament) declined to return the favor four years later, boycotting the World Cup's arrival in Italy due to the ill-feeling from the poor European showing in their own back yard.  Three teams crossed the Atlantic; Brazil, Argentina and the United States all lost their only matches. The narrative of the colonized versus the colonizer made little sense in light of the fact that football was not yet the sport of the people - Brazil's representatives came in large part from the well-to-do and overwhelmingly white Botafogo club - but still the rivalry of Europe against the Americas came to define much of international football in its early days.  It still does so now, particularly from a South American perspective.   War And Peace   As with so much else of civil society, the World Cup stopped for World War II.  Italy's win in 1938 \u2013 in what was, incidentally, the first tournament to welcome an Asian side in the form of the Dutch East Indies - was the final kick of a FIFA ball until 1950, when tournament play resumed in Brazil.  Yet despite the fact the war had been over for five years, its repercussions were still felt.  Germany, newly partitioned, had two football associations, but neither represented the East.  One, instead, was in tiny Saarland, whose brief but exciting tenure as an international force did not culminate in qualification.  However, their last-minute acceptance showed that, for perhaps the first time, Europe was serious about competing in South America, and vice versa.  Even the Brits were tempted to come along, England winning the Home Nations Championship to take their place.  Scotland, at the time a formidable team, declined to attend despite being invited, reasoning that second place did not merit such a reward. (Fast-forward 60 years and one imagines that the Scots would feel slightly differently.) Only the withdrawal of India prevented the 1950 World Cup from being the truly global event that it promised to be.  That came later as the lucre and prestige of the Cup continued to grow.  For those hoping that greater global acceptance would bring an end to politicking, though, there was to be disappointment.  In fact as the tournament grew in stature in footballing terms, so too it became a global and social commodity.  In other words, the World Cup was a big deal, and was thus far more likely to attract off-pitch attention.  The Soviet Union, for example, qualified at the first time of asking in 1958 in a bid to flaunt more sporting muscle to the world. (This they did, brilliantly so, drawing with the much-fancied England and beating Austria.).  Meanwhile Turkey withdrew yet again after being placed, inexplicably, in the Asian qualifiers.  This gave their opponents, Israel, a bye to the next stage.  In that round neither Indonesia nor Egypt were able to take part, so Israel and Sudan - who had beaten Syria - moved on to the next and final match.  Sudan refused to play against Israel for political reasons and thus withdrew from competition altogether.  Thus there was Israel, the conqueror of Asia and Africa, alone as a World Cup entrant without playing a single game.  FIFA decided this was unacceptable, so arranged an impromptu play-off with a random European runner-up, Wales.  Wales beat the Israelis and thus qualified for their one and only World Cup. And all because Sudan wouldn't travel to Israel!  Such matters only grew in importance as the decades progressed.  In 1966 the World Cup came to England for the first time for their only victory (thus far), but did so without facing an African team, all of whom withdrew over FIFA's refusal to grant the continent an automatic place in the tournament; in 1970 Morocco became the first African team in over 30 years to play in a World Cup in a bizarre but brilliant tournament that summed up all of football's foibles \u2013 playing in the noonday sun to accommodate European television schedules, for example. As for 1982, European alliances came to the fore as West Germany and Austria contrived to play out a 1-0 win for the former in what will forever be known as the 'Shame of Gijon'.  This non-event was a fixed group match that allowed both the German language-speaking countries to progress to the next stage at the expense of Algeria thanks to a complex fixture arrangement \u2013 one again created at the behest of television \u2013 long since abandoned.  The end result was 1-0 to West Germany, as if it matters. Towards The Present Most of the political aspects we've seen so far have been negative, and mainly to do with power or victory.  For a change of pace, consider West Germany's World Cup win in 1990.  The Berlin Wall had been down for scarcely six months and as the 'Nationalelf' roared to victory in Italy, East and West were busy sealing the formal road to reunification.  In stark contrast to when the sides met in the 1978 World Cup \u2013 a tense, fraught event \u2013 in this instance the two Germanies celebrated the West's victory together.  That it helped settle some of the reunification nerves and bring a divided people together is undeniable.  It would be an exaggeration to say that reunification could not have happened without football, but it is not a stretch to say that it would not have been so quick.  A cynic might argue, west German elites may have been pleased for the win as it distracted observers from the harsh economic realities of fusion; even if this is true, it was abundantly plain that football was serving as the force for unity and good that it had all too often forgotten in the past.  The Yugoslavia team of such an era, too, had its own role to play.  Before the Balkans shattered in tragic fashion, the Yugoslavs were the pride of eastern Europe.  Serbs like Dragan Stojkovic lined up next to Croats such as Davor Suker and Bosnian legends including Safet Susic and Zlatko Vujovic.  Such a team, bringing the best of all cultures together, could well have gone on to be one of the best of all time - young stars such as Alen Boksic were still in their footballing infancy - but then the war came, and Yugoslavia would never again compete as a single entity in world play.  Now the Balkan states each have their own teams - still, thankfully, punching above their weight, but not as they might have done.  Indeed, football itself had its role to play in the dissolution: rivalry between future European champions Red Star Belgrade and Dinamo Zagreb months before the tournament brought ethnic strife to the forefront of peoples' minds. Four years later Andres Escobar, a Colombian defender, scored an own goal at the 1994 World Cup.  This would have been an unfortunate historical footnote for the stat buff if not for the fact that he was then shot to death upon his return home.  Why? Nobody knows for sure, but in a country such as Colombia, in which drug lords hold sway, it has been rumored that massive gambling losses in the underworld was the trigger.  The money and the power, then, that football has provided could have been a major contributing factor. (As far as the courts determined, however, Escobar was simply shot for protesting when a man in a bar ridiculed him for his own goal.)  The World Cup went truly global in 2002 with its arrival in east Asia, with Japan and South Korea becoming the first ever co-hosts.  Yet four years later an even greater moment of off-pitch drama was to follow.  In 2006 the Ivory Coast, long since wracked by civil war, saw battling factions put down arms and pick up remote controls for a ceasefire in order to support the Ivorians in their first ever crack at World Cup play.  It's easy to romanticize this incident - human rights observers noted that, while conventional war ceased, citizens were still under attack - but at the same time the role of both the sport itself and the personalities involved helped, however slightly the road to peace.   The Path Ahead Could the same be about to happen now?  For the first time ever, North and South Korea will compete at the same tournament.  The importance of what may occur in South Africa cannot be understated.  So much is at stake: the North has in recent months reacted with fury to allegations of its sinking a Southern vessel, and diplomatic relations between the two states \u2013 hardly ideal at the best of times \u2013 have reached a recent nadir.  Yet on the sporting arena the countries have a much more love-hate relationship.  True enough, the official news organ of the North essentially accused the South of poisoning their players in the lead-up to a vital qualifier last year, but in 2008 athletes from the two sides marched together at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games.  Might we see scenes of similar fraternity this year?  Meanwhile there are other countries without troubles to seek.  Chile, riven recently by a disastrous earthquake, has taken the World Cup team to their hearts in a way that even this football-crazy nation might not have done in years past.  Events as innocuous as launching the new national shirt have been greeted with intense fervour; should <em>Chilean</em> hero Humberto 'Chupete' Suazo fail to recover from injury in time for the opening game, the mood of the nation will take a significant downturn.  As for Greece, a country cowed and humiliated by its financial disasters and civic unrest, the World Cup is a superb chance to prove that this small population can still hold its own, much as they did in the 2004 European Championships by pulling off a massively unlikely underdog win. And that brings us to South Africa itself.  The host country has so much riding on this tournament.  FIFA do, too.  Their mission to bring the tournament to Africa is long-standing, and now it's been achieved: any organizational failing, any security breach, and problem of any kind will have detractors mobilizing in numbers (and perhaps justifiably so.)  But aside from such concerns, which amount to nickels and dimes, is the future of South Africa itself. (and Africa) Under the dreadful apartheid regime the country lived a strange, alone existence; now, the Rainbow Nation has a chance to truly prove to the world that it can fulfill its promise.  It's no exaggeration to say that the opening match of the World Cup will be, for all South Africans, the most important game of their lives.  If history's anything to go by, how this one goes both on and off the pitch could determine so much more in years to come.",
