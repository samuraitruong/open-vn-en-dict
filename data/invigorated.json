They were widespread in Australia 7,000\u00a0years ago, but have probably been extinct on the continent for 2,000 years. This is believed to\u00a0be because of the introduction of dingoes around 8,000 years ago. Because of disease, thylacine\u00a0numbers may have been declining in Tasmania at the time of European settlement 200 years ago, but\u00a0the decline was certainly accelerated by the new arrivals. The last known Tasmanian Tiger died in\u00a0Hobart Zoo in 1936 and the animal is officially classified as extinct. Technically, this means that it has\u00a0not been officially sighted in the wild or captivity for 50 years. However, there are still unsubstanti-<em>ated</em> sightings.",
