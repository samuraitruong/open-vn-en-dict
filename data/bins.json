            "en": "School Gardening Boosts Children's Wellbeing And Development, Study       A new study suggests that incorporating gardening into the education children receive at school boosts their wellbeing, learning and development and helps equip them for many of the challenges of adult life.  The qualitative study, published on Monday and commissioned by the UK's Royal Horticultural Society whose headquarters are in London, was conducted by the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER), the largest independent educational research center in the UK.  The RHS said gardening should be seen as an important teaching aid, as it makes children feel happy and boosts their development. The study found that children attending schools that encouraged gardening lived more healthily and became more resilient and confident.  Dr Simon Thornton Wood, Director of Science and Learning at the RHS, told the press that:  \"As the new coalition government considers a new approach to the primary curriculum, we hope they acknowledge the striking conclusions of our research and that gardens enable a creative, flexible approach to teaching that has significant benefits.\"     He said children that go to schools where gardening is on the curriculum, as opposed to being an extra-curricular activity, are better equipped to deal with the challenges of adulthood. The report, which sports a colourful photo of a \"minibeast hotel\" on the cover, highlights that schools that actively use a garden produce happy, healthy, well-balanced, rounded children because they use it as a teaching tool so children learn the \"3Rs\" of Resilience\", Readiness (to learn) and Responsibility.  For the study, researchers surveyed 1,300 school teachers and investigated 10 schools taking part in the RHS Campaign for School Gardening, ranging from a large urban primary school in London to a small village school in rural Yorkshire.     They found that involving children in school gardening boosted their learning and development in many areas, such as increasing:   \nScientific knowledge and understanding, from botany to food production.\n\n  Literacy and numeracy, including widening vocabulary.\n\n  Listening and spoken interaction (\"oracy\" skills).\n\n  Awareness of the seasons.\n\n  Physical skills, including fine motor skills.\n\n  Confidence, resilience, self-esteem, emotional wellbeing, positive behaviour and sense of responsibility.\n\n  Positive attitude to healthy food choices.\n\n  The report also found that children involved in school gardening developed the ability to work, communicate with people from all ages and backgrounds, and had a responsible approach to life so they could achieve goals and play a positive role in society.     Children also learned to care for the environment, said the report, explaining that:   \" ... creating wildlife habitats such as 'minibeast hotels' and ponds, and growing types of flowers and plants that encouraged butterflies and birds, have helped pupils to understand how they can contribute to a diversity of wildlife in their area.\" Growing their own produce also helped children grasp the idea of sustainability and the concept of food miles, while the \"use of <em>bins</em> to produce compost for the garden has given them an opportunity to understand how recycling works in practice\". School gardening also presented opportunities for children to learn about commerce and handling money, as one teacher interviewed for the study explained:  \"They [the children] talk about how much seeds [and] seedlings cost, how many will survive, what they can sell them for, how much profit they make and how long that process takes.\"  In some cases the children managed budgets for their school gardens, and researched sources of supplies to get the best deal.  This concept was taken a step further in one particular school where they decided to keep chickens to produce eggs to make cakes to sell in the town.   Some schools used the idea of the garden to help children develop communication and negotiation skills. For example, in one school the children had to put together project funding proposals to the head, in another they had to design and present schemes for the garden.  Embedding gardening in the school curriculum works when the idea has the active support of the head teacher, a key member of staff drives it, the garden has a high profile in the school, and the amount of work involved is manageable, said the report authors. The RHS launched its Campaign for School Gardening in 2007, the aim being to encourage schools to create their own gardens. Over 12,000 schools covering 2.5 million schoolchildren have signed up.  The next phase is to train 4,500 teachers in how to use a garden as a teaching tool. Research on School Gardening, RHS.  Written by: Catharine Paddock, PhD  Copyright: Medical News Today",

            "en": "Malaysia opens 'hatch' for abandoned babies       The cries of an abandoned baby boy echo in the nursery at Orphancare, a Malaysian charity that helps orphans find adoptive parents. He is the only child here and does not have a name. But in many ways he is seen as one of the lucky ones. He was left in a baby \"hatch\" - the first in the country - designed to allow mothers to leave their babies anonymously. The charity hopes it will rescue more unwanted newborns, as the authorities seek to stem the rising number of abandoned babies. Close to 500 babies have been found abandoned since 2005. Some were left in Muslim prayer halls, on doorsteps and even in rubbish <em>bins</em>. Many are found dead. It is thought these children are mainly abandoned by single mothers. Having a child out of wedlock is still seen as deeply shameful in this Muslim-majority country, where sex education is mainly focused on abstinence. 'The only solution'  The Orphancare office is located in a quiet suburb outside Kuala Lumpur. Next to the front entrance is a small door that opens to a tiny cot. Once the baby is placed in the cot, an alarm is triggered and the air conditioner turns on. When the door closes, the baby is safely locked inside and a caretaker fetches the child. This way, the baby is kept safe, and the mother's identity will never be known. Critics say the programme will make it too easy for mothers to abandon their babies, encouraging extra-marital sex. But Noraini Hashim of Orphancare says anonymity is the only way to ensure parents will use the hatch rather than toss their babies in a bin. \"We're not out to prosecute the mother or the couple who brings the baby in,\" she says. It is illegal for Muslims to have sex outside marriage in Malaysia. The country has a dual track legal system where Islamic law applies to Muslims. Non-Muslims are covered under civil law. But the stigma of having a child out of wedlock is what drives single mothers to desperate acts, says Ms Noraini. She says the pressure is greater for young girls when their boyfriends leave them and they feel unable to confide in family or friends. \"In that state of depression I suppose the only solution they have is to abandon the baby,\" Ms Noraini says. The government, concerned by the rising number of abandoned babies, has asked police to start investigating these cases as attempted murder or murder, which carry the death sentence. 'Shameful'  Close to the busy centre of Kuala Lumpur is a shelter for unmarried, pregnant women. The Kewaja refuge is one of the few places they can turn to since abortion is not readily available. It is made up of a row of single-storey houses at the end of a dirt road, partly hidden by banana trees. The women all wear headscarves and oversized T-shirts to hide their swollen bellies. They will stay at the shelter until their babies are born. Three women agreed to tell me their stories under condition of anonymity. One 19-year-old girl, who calls herself Su, says she went to the shelter when she was five months pregnant so she wouldn't shame the family in front of the neighbours. Siti, 18, gave birth to a baby girl at the shelter. Her father thinks she is away studying. She can't return home until her mother calls her back. She's been waiting for over a month. Mila is 28 and came to the shelter in her final month of pregnancy. Unlike the other two she is engaged and has a steady job but she still feels unable to keep her child because having sex before marriage is forbidden in Islam. \"If the baby knew he was born out of wedlock he will carry the shame for the rest of his life,\" she says. All three women told me they knew about contraception but were too ashamed to buy it. The shelter is run by Yahya Mohamed Yusof and his wife. He says shelters like his and the baby hatch help to save lives, but it doesn't tackle the problem of unwanted pregnancies. Mr Yahya says they are seeing an increase every month. \"When we started 14 years ago, we had fewer than 10 girls at the shelter. But now, we have at least 70 pregnant women under our care,\" he says. To keep their pregnancy secret, most of the women who stay at the Kewaja shelter will give their babies up for adoption. In this country, unwed mothers still feel they have little choice.",
