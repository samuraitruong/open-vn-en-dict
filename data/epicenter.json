            "en": "Earthquake Hits Myanmar         BANGKOK \u2014 A severe earthquake of 6.8 magnitude struck a sparsely populated mountain area in the Golden Triangle region of northeastern Myanmar Thursday, but although the tremors were felt over a wide radius, initial reports of damage and injuries were light.  One person in northern Thailand was reported killed, a bridge was destroyed near the <em>epicenter</em>, homes were damaged in southern China and buildings shook as far away as Bangkok, Hanoi and Yangon, Myanmar\u2019s largest city.  Buildings were damaged near the <em>epicenter</em> in Myanmar\u2019s Shan State and villagers continued to feel aftershocks for several hours, according to an official with World Vision in Myanmar. But reports of any damage and injuries were slow to emerge overnight from the remote mountains and valleys.  The area affected is landlocked, and no tsunami warning was issued.  One woman was killed in the Thai border city of Chiang Rai, about 70 miles south of the <em>epicenter</em>, when a wall fell on her as she was sleeping, Thai television reported. Some people there said they were shaken from their beds or ran into the streets. One woman attending a funeral said she clung to a pole to stay upright.  \u201cI felt I was swaying like a child in a cradle,\u201d the woman, Nutpisut Thongkika, a 50-year-old teacher, said in a telephone interview from Chiang Rai. \u201cThe situation here was very chaotic when the earthquake hit.\u201d  Thai television said no serious damage was reported in Chiang Rai.  Many tourists in nearby Chiangmai fled their hotels and remained for hours in the streets.  The United States Geological Survey said the earthquake was just six miles deep, meaning that severe shaking could have caused major damage to buildings in a wide area. It also reported a smaller quake, of 4.8 magnitude, about a half-hour later.  Buildings shook for more than a minute in China\u2019s nearby Yunnan Province and many residents fled their homes in Nanning City, the capital of Guangzi Autonomous Region, the Xinhua news agency reported. It said officials were investigating the extent of the damage.  Another earthquake on March 10 in Yunnan Province in southwest China took 26 lives and destroyed a number of schools, Xinhua reported.  The tremors Thursday caused panic in Hanoi, 380 miles to the east of the <em>epicenter</em>, where residents said they heard the shattering of windows, the Vietnam News Agency reported. Tall buildings shook and chandeliers swayed in Bangkok, 480 miles to the south.  Hours after the quake, people in villages near the <em>epicenter</em> remained in the streets afraid to return indoors, said Jenny McIntyre, communications manager in Yangon for World Vision, a children\u2019s aid agency.  \u00a0\u201cThese are subsistence farmers, simple people who have got simple water systems which will potentially be threatened,\u201d she said, adding that the damaged bridge had cut off an area near the <em>epicenter</em>.  She said she also felt the tremors in Yangon, 350 miles to the southwest. \u201cI suddenly felt really sick and strange and I realized that everything was rocking and the lightshades were all rocking,\u201d she said.  Wongdeun Kongcharoen, 34, a hotel manager in Chiang Rai, said the earthquake cracked the walls of houses and scattered glassware and other belongings in all directions.  \u00a0\u201cPeople here are still nervous and staying outside,\u201d she said about two hours after the tremors. \u201cWe feel like the situation that happened in Japan. It was so scary.\u201d  She said a Japanese friend told her the shaking was light compared to earthquakes in that country. \u201cBut this was the first time for us to experience a situation like this,\u201d Ms. Wongden said. \u201cSo that\u2019s why we were still outside and still scared.\u201d",

            "en": "Search For Survivors Continues After Chile Massive Quake       Rescue workers are tearing through the rubble in search of survivors in Chile Sunday, a day after a massive earthquake shattered the country's central region.  The 8.8 magnitude quake struck the South American country Saturday in the early morning hours.  Many Chileans have continued to stay out of their homes because of the jolting series of aftershocks, some as strong as 6.9 magnitude. The quake has killed more than 300 people and damaged as many as 1.5 million homes. Officials say the death toll is expected to rise. Rescuers are working to reach about a 100 people trapped in an apartment building that collapsed in Concepcion, the country's second-largest city. The main rescue operation is centered in the city, about 100 kilometers from the <em>epicenter</em> of the quake. Looters ransacked stores in Concepcion Sunday, stealing both food and electrical appliances. Police used tear gas and water cannons to disperse a crowd of looters at one supermarket. Chilean President Michelle Bachelet declared a \"state of catastrophe\" in central Chile, where the quake toppled buildings, overturned cars and brought down power and phone lines.  Bridges fell and many streets were covered with rubble. Fires were reported. Several hospitals collapsed. The president has not asked for assistance from other countries, but several nations have offered to send aid. Speaking at the Vatican Sunday, Pope Benedict said he is praying for the people of Chile and other populations in the Pacific tested by the calamity.  The earthquake has raised a daunting first challenge for billionaire Sebastian Pinera, who was elected Chile's president in January. He takes office in two weeks. Chile's children who were preparing to return to school Monday at the end of their summer break have had their vacation extended another week. In the capital, Santiago, officials closed the international airport because of damage. Argentina and other parts of South America also felt the earthquake. While cell phone communication was knocked out by the quake, many people used social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook to reach out to friends and loved ones. The U.S. Geological Survey says an earthquake with a magnitude of 8 or more is classified as a \"great\" earthquake that can cause tremendous damage.  The biggest earthquake ever recorded struck the same area of Chile in 1960. It had a magnitude of 9.5 and also set off a tsunami, which had devastating effects in Pacific countries including Japan and the Philippines, where at least 1,600 people were killed.",

More than 10,000 people have been injured and many more people may be trapped in damaged buildings. The earthquake struck the western Chinese province of Qinghai early Wednesday, collapsing buildings in villages around the region. The China Earthquake Administration estimates the quake as being a 7.1 magnitude, while the U.S. Geological Survey puts it at 6.9. The quake struck just before 8 in the morning in the mountainous and remote western area, which divides Qinghai Province and Tibet. A second strong quake struck about five minutes later, state media say, destroying 85 percent of the buildings in one township near the <em>epicenter</em>. School children are among those reported as trapped and many injured people can be seen in the street with bleeding head wounds. An Armed Police Detachment Commander in Qinghai, Shi Huajie, told Chinese state TV some 600 rescuers are scrambling to save the many people he says are buried in Yushu County. But he says a lack of organization is slowing their efforts. Shi says the earthquake stuck when many people were still asleep - and he says the rescue effort is also being hampered by the lack of heavy lifting equipment. Telecommunications have been disrupted and roads from the nearest airport are reported to be badly damaged. Rescue equipment is being rushed to the high altitude area. The quake comes nearly two years after the massive western Sichuan earthquake, which claimed at least 68,000 lives. That quake sparked angry protests among residents who said the poor quality of buildings was to blame for the large number of casualties, especially children who died when their schools collapsed.

            "en": "There were no reports of major damage or serious injuries from the 5.8 magnitude quake, which was centered in Mineral, Virginia. It was the largest quake in Virginia since 1897 and struck at a shallow depth, increasing its potency. The Pentagon, White House and Capitol were evacuated in Washington, and thousands of alarmed workers scurried into the streets up and down the East Coast as the lunchtime quake sent items crashing down from store and office shelves. \"We were rocking,\" said Larry Beach, who works at the U.S. Agency for International Development in downtown Washington, 83 miles from the quake's <em>epicenter</em>. \"It was definitely significant.\" Federal workers were sent home early. Washington's National Cathedral, host to state funerals and memorial services for many U.S. presidents, suffered damage with three spires in the central tower breaking off. The U.S. East Coast does not normally experience quakes as strong as Tuesday's. The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake was of 5.8 magnitude, downgrading an earlier estimate if 5.9. Earthquakes of magnitude 5.5 can cause damage to buildings and other structures. In addition to the Virginia earthquake, there were nine tremors in the area immediately around Cokedale, Colorado, near the border of New Mexico. \"Today we had two significant earthquakes shake large portions of the country,\" said David Wald, a geophysicist with the USGS. \"The Western earthquake, magnitude 5.3, within the last 24 hours, shook roughly four western states, primarily Colorado and New Mexico, but also parts of Kansas, Oklahoma as well as Texas -- large states, but probably experienced by tens of thousands of people,\" he said. CAPITOL SHAKEN As if a rare strong earthquake were not enough, the East Coast was also on alert for powerful Hurricane Irene which was heading up from the Caribbean and could hit at the weekend. The quake made chandeliers sway in the Capitol and the floor of the Senate shook before staff headed for the exits. Some minor damage could be seen in the rotunda, under the dome of the Capitol. Bits of paint and plaster fell from high on the walls and chunks of plaster fell from above a doorway in the Capitol's Statuary Hall. Congress is in recess so most members were away. \"I thought at first somebody was shaking my chair and then I thought maybe it was a bomb,\" said Senate aide Wendy Oscarson-Kirchner. Phone service was disrupted throughout the region as network congestion blocked cell phone users from making calls. There were also nuclear safety fears when one of four emergency diesel generators at the North Anna nuclear power plant in Virginia lost power due to the quake and automatically halted operations. The plant operated by Dominion Resources was designed to withstand an earthquake of magnitude up to 6.2, a company spokesman said. Dominion reported no major damage to the facility. Three generators were needed to kick in and keep the reactors' radioactive cores cool. A fourth diesel unit failed. In New York, the tremors prompted evacuations of courthouses, City Hall and halted work at the World Trade Center construction site. \"What a spooky, strange feeling,\" said Billy Simeonidis, the owner of BareBurger in Brooklyn. \"You just don't have any control. I don't know how they do it on the West Coast.\" Control towers at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City and Newark Liberty Airport in New Jersey were also evacuated, and flights were grounded briefly in Washington, Philadelphia and New York. The quake was felt as far away as Toronto. Buildings in Boston were evacuated, and some people who experienced swaying offices said they felt their stomachs turn. \"We see we had shaking from Canada and Maine all the way down to Georgia and in Michigan and Illinois. So this was over about 20 states,\" said the USGS's Wald. But saturation TV coverage of an East Coast quake that caused little damage drew smirks of amused disbelief from seismic-savvy Californians watching the news. \"East Coasters freak out, West Coasters roll their eyes,\" read one headline accompanying a story about Twitter reactions on the Hollywood website The Wrap.com.",
