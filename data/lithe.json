            "en": "10        10. INTERROGATIONS It was very hard, in the morning, to argue with the part of me that was sure last night was a dream. Logic wasn't on my side, or common sense. I clung to the parts I couldn't have imagined \u2014 like his smell. I was sure I could never have dreamed that up on my own. It was foggy and dark outside my window, absolutely perfect. He had no reason not to be in school today. I dressed in my heavy clothes, remembering I didn't have a jacket. Further proof that my memory was real. When I got downstairs, Charlie was gone again \u2014 I was running later than I'd realized. I swallowed a granola bar in three bites, chased it down with milk straight from the carton, and then hurried out the door. Hopefully the rain would hold off until I could find Jessica. It was unusually foggy; the air was almost smoky with it. The mist was ice cold where it clung to the exposed skin on my face and neck. I couldn't wait to get the heat going in my truck. It was such a thick fog that I was a few feet down the driveway before I realized there was a car in it: a silver car. My heart thudded, stuttered, and then picked up again in double time. I didn't see where he came from, but suddenly he was there, pulling the door open for me. \"Do you want to ride with me today?\" he asked, amused by my expression as he caught me by surprise yet again. There was uncertainty in his voice. He was really giving me a choice \u2014 I was free to refuse, and part of him hoped for that. It was a vain hope. \"Yes, thank you,\" I said, trying to keep my voice calm. As I stepped into the warm car, I noticed his tan jacket was slung over the headrest of the passenger seat. The door closed behind me, and, sooner than should be possible, he was sitting next to me, starting the car. \"I brought the jacket for you. I didn't want you to get sick or something.\" His voice was guarded. I noticed that he wore no jacket himself, just a light gray knit V-neck shirt with long sleeves. Again, the fabric clung to his perfectly muscled chest. It was a colossal tribute to his face that it kept my eyes away from his body. \"I'm not quite that delicate,\" I said, but I pulled the jacket onto my lap, pushing my arms through the too-long sleeves, curious to see if the scent could possibly be as good as I remembered. It was better. \"Aren't you?\" he contradicted in a voice so low I wasn't sure if he meant for me to hear. We drove through the fog-shrouded streets, always too fast, feeling awkward. I was, at least. Last night all the walls were down\u2026 almost all. I didn't know if we were still being as candid today. It left me tongue-tied. I waited for him to speak. He turned to smirk at me. \"What, no twenty questions today?\" \"Do my questions bother you?\" I asked, relieved. \"Not as much as your reactions do.\" He looked like he was joking, but I couldn't be sure. I frowned. \"Do I react badly?\" \"No, that's the problem. You take everything so coolly \u2014 it's unnatural.\u00a0 It makes me wonder what you're really thinking.\" \"I always tell you what I'm really thinking.\" \"You edit,\" he accused. \"Not very much.\" \"Enough to drive me insane.\" \"You don't want to hear it,\" I mumbled, almost whispered. As soon as the words were out, I regretted them. The pain in my voice was very faint; I could only hope he hadn't noticed it. He didn't respond, and I wondered if I had ruined the mood. His face was unreadable as we drove into the school parking lot. Something occurred to me belatedly. \"Where's the rest of your family?\" I asked \u2014 more than glad to be alone with him, but remembering that his car was usually full. \"They took Rosalie's car.\" He shrugged as he parked next to a glossy red convertible with the top up. \"Ostentatious, isn't it?\" \"Um, wow,\" I breathed. \"If she has that, why does she ride with you?\" \"Like I said, it's ostentatious. We try to blend in.\" \"You don't succeed.\" I laughed and shook my head as we got out of the car. I wasn't late anymore; his lunatic driving had gotten me to school in plenty of time. \"So why did Rosalie drive today if it's more conspicuous?\" \"Hadn't you noticed? I'm breaking all the rules now.\" He met me at the front of the car, staying very close to my side as we walked onto campus. I wanted to close that little distance, to reach out and touch him, but I was afraid he wouldn't like me to. \"Why do you have cars like that at all?\" I wondered aloud. \"If you're looking for privacy?\" \"An indulgence,\" he admitted with an impish smile. \"We all like to drive fast.\" \"Figures,\" I muttered under my breath. Under the shelter of the cafeteria roof's overhang, Jessica was waiting, her eyes about to bug out of their sockets. Over her arm, bless her, was my jacket. \"Hey, Jessica,\" I said when we were a few feet away. \"Thanks for remembering.\" She handed me my jacket without speaking. \"Good morning, Jessica,\" Edward said politely. It wasn't really his fault that his voice was so irresistible. Or what his eyes were capable of.  \"Er\u2026 hi.\" She shifted her wide eyes to me, trying to gather her jumbled thoughts. \"I guess I'll see you in Trig.\" She gave me a meaningful look, and I suppressed a sigh. What on earth was I going to tell her? \"Yeah, I'll see you then.\" She walked away, pausing twice to peek back over her shoulder at us. \"What are you going to tell her?\" Edward murmured. \"Hey, I thought you couldn't read my mind!\" I hissed. \"I can't,\" he said, startled. Then understanding brightened his eyes. \"However, I can read hers \u2014 she'll be waiting to ambush you in class.\" I groaned as I pulled off his jacket and handed it to him, replacing it with my own. He folded it over his arm. \"So what are you going to tell her?\" \"A little help?\" I pleaded. \"What does she want to know?\" He shook his head, grinning wickedly. \"That's not fair.\" \"No, you not sharing what you know \u2014 now that's not fair.\" He deliberated for a moment as we walked. We stopped outside the door to my first class. \"She wants to know if we're secretly dating. And she wants to know how you feel about me,\" he finally said. \"Yikes. What should I say?\" I tried to keep my expression very innocent. People were passing us on their way to class, probably staring, but I was barely aware of them. \"Hmmm.\" He paused to catch a stray lock of hair that was escaping the twist on my neck and wound it back into place. My heart spluttered hyperactively. \"I suppose you could say yes to the first\u2026 if you don't mind \u2014 it's easier than any other explanation.\" \"I don't mind,\" I said in a faint voice. \"And as for her other question\u2026 well, I'll be listening to hear the answer to that one myself.\" One side of his mouth pulled up into my favorite uneven smile. I couldn't catch my breath soon enough to respond to that remark. He turned and walked away. \"I'll see you at lunch,\" he called over his shoulder. Three people walking in the door stopped to stare at me. I hurried into class, flushed and irritated. He was such a cheater. Now I was even more worried about what I was going to say to Jessica. I sat in my usual seat, slamming my bag down in aggravation. \"Morning, Bella,\" Mike said from the seat next to me. I looked up to see an odd, almost resigned look on his face. \"How was Port Angeles?\" \"It was\u2026\" There was no honest way to sum it up. \"Great,\" I finished lamely. \"Jessica got a really cute dress.\" \"Did she say anything about Monday night?\" he asked, his eyes brightening. I smiled at the turn the conversation had taken. \"She said she had a really good time,\" I assured him. \"She did?\" he said eagerly. \"Most definitely.\" Mr. Mason called the class to order then, asking us to turn in our papers. English and then Government passed in a blur, while I worried about how to explain things to Jessica and agonized over whether Edward would really be listening to what I said through the medium of Jess's thoughts. How very inconvenient his little talent could be \u2014 when it wasn't saving my life. The fog had almost dissolved by the end of the second hour, but the day was still dark with low, oppressing clouds. I smiled up at the sky. Edward was right, of course. When I walked into Trig Jessica was sitting in the back row, nearly bouncing off her seat in agitation. I reluctantly went to sit by her, trying to convince myself it would be better to get it over with as soon as possible. \"Tell me everything!\" she commanded before I was in the seat. \"What do you want to know?\" I hedged. \"What happened last night?\" \"He bought me dinner, and then he drove me home.\" She glared at me, her expression stiff with skepticism. \"How did you get home so fast?\" \"He drives like a maniac. It was terrifying.\" I hoped he heard that. \"Was it like a date \u2014 did you tell him to meet you there?\" I hadn't thought of that. \"No \u2014 I was very surprised to see him there.\" Her lips puckered in disappointment at the transparent honesty in my voice. \"But he picked you up for school today?\" she probed. \"Yes \u2014 that was a surprise, too. He noticed I didn't have a jacket last night,\" I explained. \"So are you going out again?\" \"He offered to drive me to Seattle Saturday because he thinks toy truck isn't up to it \u2014 does that count?\" \"Yes.\" She nodded. \"Well, then, yes.\" \"W-o-w.\" She exaggerated the word into three syllables. \"Edward Cullen.\" \"I know,\" I agreed. \"Wow\" didn't even cover it. \"Wait!\" Her hands flew up, palms toward me like she was stopping traffic. \"Has he kissed you?\" \"No,\" I mumbled. \"It's not like that.\" She looked disappointed. I'm sure I did, too. \"Do you think Saturday\u2026 ?\" She raised her eyebrows. \"I really doubt it.\" The discontent in my voice was poorly disguised. \"What did you talk about?\" She pushed for more information in a whisper. Class had started but Mr. Varner wasn't paying close attention and we weren't the only ones still talking. \"I don't know, Jess, lots of stuff,\" I whispered back. \"We talked about the English essay a little.\" A very, very little. I think \u00a0he mentioned it in passing. \"Please, Bella,\" she begged. \"Give me some details.\" \"Well\u2026 okay, I've got one. You should have seen the waitress flirting with him \u2014 it was over the top. But he didn't pay any attention to her at all.\" Let him make what he could of that. \"That's a good sign,\" she nodded. \"Was she pretty?\" \"Very \u2014 and probably nineteen or twenty.\" \"Even better. He must like you.\" \"I think so, but it's hard to tell. He's always so cryptic,\" I threw in for his benefit, sighing. \"I don't know how you're brave enough to be alone with him,\" she breathed. \"Why?\" I was shocked, but she didn't understand my reaction. \"He's so\u2026 intimidating. I wouldn't know what to say to him.\" She made a face, probably remembering this morning or last night, when he'd turned the overwhelming force of his eyes on her. \"I do have some trouble with incoherency when I'm around him,\" I admitted. \"Oh well. He is unbelievably gorgeous.\" Jessica shrugged as if this excused any flaws. Which, in her book, it probably did. \"There's a lot more to him than that.\" \"Really? Like what?\" I wished I had let it go. Almost as much as I was hoping he'd been kidding about listening in. \"I can't explain it right\u2026 but he's even more unbelievable behind the face.\" The vampire who wanted to be good \u2014 who ran around saving people's lives so he wouldn't be a monster\u2026 I stared toward the front of the room. \"Is that possible?\" She giggled. I ignored her, trying to look like I was paying attention to Mr. Varner. \"So you like him, then?\" She wasn't about to give up. \"Yes,\" I said curtly. \"I mean, do you really like him?\" she urged. \"Yes,\" I said again, blushing. I hoped that detail wouldn't register in her thoughts. She'd had enough with the single syllable answers. \"How much do you like him?\" \"Too much,\" I whispered back. \"More than he likes me. But I don't see how I can help that.\" I sighed, one blush blending into the next. Then, thankfully, Mr. Varner called on Jessica for an answer. She didn't get a chance to start on the subject again during class, and as soon as the bell rang, I took evasive action. \"In English, Mike asked me if you said anything about Monday night,\" I told her. \"You're kidding! What did you say?!\" she gasped, completely sidetracked. \"I told him you said you had a lot of fun \u2014 he looked pleased.\" \"Tell me exactly what he said, and your exact answer!\" We spent the rest of the walk dissecting sentence structures and most of Spanish on a minute description of Mike's facial expressions. I wouldn't have helped draw it out for as long as I did if I wasn't worried about the subject returning to me. And then the bell rang for lunch. As I jumped up out of my seat, shoving my books roughly in my bag, my uplifted expression must have tipped Jessica off. \"You're not sitting with us today, are you?\" she guessed. \"I don't think so.\" I couldn't be sure that he wouldn't disappear inconveniently again. But outside the door to our Spanish class, leaning against the wall \u2014 looking more like a Greek god than anyone had a right to \u2014 Edward was waiting for me. Jessica took one look, rolled her eyes, and departed. \"See you later, Bella.\" Her voice was thick with implications. I might have to turn off the ringer on the phone. \"Hello.\" His voice was amused and irritated at the same time. He had been listening, it was obvious. \"Hi.\" I couldn't think of anything else to say, and he didn't speak \u2014 biding his time, I presumed \u2014 so it was a quiet walk to the cafeteria. Walking with Edward through the crowded lunchtime rush was a lot like my first day here; everyone stared. He led the way into the line, still not speaking, though his eyes returned to my face every few seconds, their expression speculative. It seemed to me that irritation was winning out over amusement as the dominant emotion in his face. I fidgeted nervously with the zipper on my jacket. He stepped up to the counter and filled a tray with food. \"What are you doing?\" I objected. \"You're not getting all that for me?\" He shook his head, stepping forward to buy the food. \"Half is for me, of course.\" I raised one eyebrow. He led the way to the same place we'd sat that one time before. From the other end of the long table, a group of seniors gazed at us in amazement as we sat across from each other. Edward seemed oblivious. \"Take whatever you want,\" he said, pushing the tray toward me. \"I'm curious,\" I said as I picked up an apple, turning it around in my hands, \"what would you do if someone dared you to eat food?\" \"You're always curious.\" He grimaced, shaking his head. He glared at me, holding my eyes as he lifted the slice of pizza off the tray, and deliberately bit off a mouthful, chewed quickly, and then swallowed. I watched, eyes wide. \"If someone dared you to eat dirt, you could, couldn't you?\" he asked condescendingly. I wrinkled my nose. \"I did once\u2026 on a dare,\" I admitted. \"It wasn't so bad.\" He laughed. \"I suppose I'm not surprised.\" Something over my shoulder seemed to catch his attention. \"Jessica's analyzing everything I do \u2014 she'll break it down for you later.\" He pushed the rest of the pizza toward me. The mention of Jessica brought a hint of his former irritation back to his features. I put down the apple and took a bite of the pizza, looking away, knowing he was about to start. \"So the waitress was pretty, was she?\" he asked casually. \"You really didn't notice?\" \"No. I wasn't paying attention. I had a lot on my mind.\" \"Poor girl.\" I could afford to be generous now. \"Something you said to Jessica\u2026 well, it bothers me.\" He refused to be distracted. His voice was husky, and he glanced up from under his lashes with troubled eyes. \"I'm not surprised you heard something you didn't like. You know what they say about eavesdropners,\" I reminded him. \"I warned you I would be listening.\" \"And I warned you that you didn't want to know everything I was thinking.\" \"You did,\" he agreed, but his voice was still rough. \"You aren't precisely right, though. I do want to know what you're thinking \u2014 everything. I just wish\u2026 that you wouldn't be thinking some things.\" I scowled. \"That's quite a distinction.\" \"But that's not really the point at the moment.\" \"Then what is?\" We were inclined toward each other across the table now. He had his large white hands folded under his chin; I leaned forward, my right hand cupped around my neck. I had to remind myself that we were in a crowded lunchroom, with probably many curious eyes on us. It was too easy to get wrapped up in our own private, tense little bubble. \"Do you truly believe that you care more for me than I do for you?\" he murmured, leaning closer to me as he spoke, his dark golden eyes piercing. I tried to remember how to exhale. I had to look away before it came back to me. \"You're doing it again,\" I muttered. His eyes opened wide with surprise. \"What?\" \"Dazzling me,\" I admitted, trying to concentrate as I looked back at him. \"Oh.\" He frowned. \"It's not your fault,\" I sighed. \"You can't help it.\" \"Are you going to answer the question?\" I looked down. \"Yes.\" \"Yes, you are going to answer, or yes, you really think that?\" He was irritated again. \"Yes, I really think that.\" I kept my eyes down on the table, my eyes tracing the pattern of the faux wood grains printed on the laminate. The silence dragged on. I stubbornly refused to be the first to break it this time, fighting hard against the temptation to peek at his expression. Finally he spoke, voice velvet soft. \"You're wrong.\" I glanced up to see that his eyes were gentle. \"You can't know that,\" I disagreed in a whisper. I shook my head in doubt, though my heart throbbed at his words and I wanted so badly to believe them. \"What makes you think so?\" His liquid topaz eyes were penetrating \u2014 trying futilely, I assumed, to lift the truth straight from my mind. I stared back, struggling to think clearly in spite of his face, to find some way to explain. As I searched for the words, I could see him getting impatient; frustrated by my silence, he started to scowl. I lifted my hand from my neck, and held up one finger. \"Let me think,\" I insisted. His expression cleared, now that he was satisfied that I was planning to answer. I dropped my hand to the table, moving my left hand so that my palms were pressed together. I stared at my hands, twisting and untwisting my fingers, as I finally spoke. \"Well, aside from the obvious, sometimes\u2026\" I hesitated. \"I can't be sure \u2014 I don't know how to read minds \u2014 but sometimes it seems like you're trying to say goodbye when you're saying something else.\" That was the best I could sum up the sensation of anguish that his words triggered in me at times. \"Perceptive,\" he whispered. And there was the anguish again, surfacing as he confirmed my fear. \"That's exactly why you're wrong, though,\" he began to explain, but then his eyes narrowed. \"What do you mean, 'the obvious'?\" \"Well, look at me,\" I said, unnecessarily as he was already staring. \"I'm absolutely ordinary \u2014 well, except for bad things like all the near-death experiences and being so clumsy that I'm almost disabled. And look at you.\" I waved my hand toward him and all his bewildering perfection. His brow creased angrily for a moment, then smoothed as his eyes took on a knowing look. \"You don't see yourself very clearly, you know. I'll admit you're dead-on about the bad things,\" he chuckled blackly, \"but you didn't hear what every human male in this school was thinking on your first day.\" I blinked, astonished. \"I don't believe it\u2026\" I mumbled to myself. \"Trust me just this once \u2014 you are the opposite of ordinary.\" My embarrassment was much stronger than my pleasure at the look that came into his eyes when he said this. I quickly reminded him of my original argument. \"But I'm not saying goodbye,\" I pointed out. \"Don't you see? That's what proves me right. I care the most, because if I can do it\" \u2014 he shook his head, seeming to struggle with the thought \u2014 \"if leaving is the right thing to do, then I'll hurt myself to keep from hurting you, to keep you safe.\" I glared. \"And you don't think I would do the same?\" \"You'd never have to make the choice.\" Abruptly, his unpredictable mood shifted again; a mischievous, devastating smile rearranged his features. \"Of course, keeping you safe is beginning to feel like a full-time occupation that requires my constant presence.\" \"No one has tried to do away with me today,\" I reminded him, grateful for the lighter subject. I didn't want him to talk about goodbyes anymore. If I had to, I supposed I could purposefully put myself in danger to keep him close\u2026 I banished that thought before his quick eyes read it on my face. That idea would definitely get me in trouble. \"Yet,\" he added. \"Yet,\" I agreed; I would have argued, but now I wanted him to be expecting disasters. \"I have another question for you.\" His face was still casual. \"Shoot.\" \"Do you really need to go to Seattle this Saturday, or was that just an excuse to get out of saying no to all your admirers?\" I made a face at the memory. \"You know, I haven't forgiven you for the Tyler thing yet,\" I warned him. \"It's your fault that he's deluded himself into thinking I'm going to prom with him.\" \"Oh, he would have found a chance to ask you without me \u2014 I just really wanted to watch your face,\" he chuckled, I would have been angrier if his laughter wasn't so fascinating. \"If I'd asked you, would you have turned me down?\" he asked, still laughing to himself. \"Probably not,\" I admitted. \"But I would have canceled later \u2014 faked an illness or a sprained ankle.\" He was puzzled. \"Why would you do that?\" I shook my head sadly. \"You've never seen me in Gym, I guess, but I would have thought you would understand.\" \"Are you referring to the fact that you can't walk across a flat, stable surface without finding something to trip over?\" \"Obviously.\" \"That wouldn't be a problem.\" He was very confident. \"It's all in the leading.\" He could see that I was about to protest, and he cut me off. \"But you never told me \u2014 are you resolved on going to Seattle, or do you mind if we do something different?\" As long as the \"we\" part was in, I didn't care about anything else. \"I'm open to alternatives,\" I allowed. \"But I do have a favor to ask.\" He looked wary, as he always did when I asked an open-ended question. \"What?\" \"Can I drive?\" He frowned. \"Why?\" \"Well, mostly because when I told Charlie I was going to Seattle, he specifically asked if I was going alone and, at the time, I was. If he asked again, I probably wouldn't lie, but I don't think he will ask again, and leaving my truck at home would just bring up the subject unnecessarily. And also, because your driving frightens me.\" He rolled his eyes. \"Of all the things about me that could frighten you, you worry about my driving.\" He shook his head in disgust, but then his eyes were serious again. \"Won't you want to tell your father that you're spending the day with me?\" There was an undercurrent to his question that I didn't understand. \"With Charlie, less is always more.\" I was definite about that. \"Where are we going, anyway?\" \"The weather will be nice, so I'll be staying out of the public eye\u2026 and you can stay with me, if you'd like to.\" Again, he was leaving the choice up to me. \"And you'll show me what you meant, about the sun?\" I asked, excited by the idea of unraveling another of the unknowns. \"Yes.\" He smiled, and then paused. \"But if you don't want to be\u2026 alone with me, I'd still rather you didn't go to Seattle by yourself. I shudder to think of the trouble you could find in a city that size.\" I was miffed. \"Phoenix is three times bigger than Seattle \u2014 just in population. In physical size \u2014\" \"But apparently,\" he interrupted me, \"your number wasn't up in Phoenix. So I'd rather you stayed near me.\" His eyes did that unfair smoldering thing again. I couldn't argue, with the eyes or the motivation, and it was a moot point anyway. \"As it happens, I don't mind being alone with you.\" \"I know,\" he sighed, brooding. \"You should tell Charlie, though.\" \"Why in the world would I do that?\" His eyes were suddenly fierce. \"To give me some small incentive to bring you back.\" I gulped. But, after a moment of thought, I was sure. \"I think I'll take my chances.\" He exhaled angrily, and looked away. \"Let's talk about something else,\" I suggested. \"What do you want to talk about?\" he asked. He was still annoyed. I glanced around us, making sure we were well out of anyone's hearing. As I cast my eyes around the room, I caught the eyes of his sister, Alice, staring at me. The others were looking at Edward. I looked away swiftly, back to him, and I asked the first thing that came to mind. \"Why did you go to that Goat Rocks place last weekend\u2026 to hunt? Charlie said it wasn't a good place to hike, because of bears.\" He stared at me as if I was missing something very obvious. \"Bears?\" I gasped, and he smirked. \"You know, bears are not in season,\" I added sternly, to hide my shock. \"If you read carefully, the laws only cover hunting with weapons,\" he informed me. He watched my face with enjoyment as that slowly sank in. \"Bears?\" I repeated with difficulty. \"Grizzly is Emmett's favorite.\" His voice was still offhand, but his eyes were scrutinizing my reaction. I tried to pull myself together. \"Hmmm,\" I said, taking another bite of pizza as an excuse to look down. I chewed slowly, and then took a long drink of Coke without looking up. \"So,\" I said after a moment, finally meeting his now-anxious gaze. \"What's your favorite?\" He raised an eyebrow and the corners of his mouth turned down in disapproval. \"Mountain lion.\" \"Ah,\" I said in a politely disinterested tone, looking for my soda again. \"Of course,\" he said, and his tone mirrored mine, \"we have to be careful not to impact the environment with injudicious hunting. We try to focus on areas with an overpopulation of predators \u2014 ranging as far away as we need. There's always plenty of deer and elk here, and they'll do, but where's the fun in that?\" He smiled teasingly. \"Where indeed,\" I murmured around another bite of pizza. \"Early spring is Emmett's favorite bear season \u2014 they're just coming out of hibernation, so they're more irritable.\" He smiled at some remembered joke. \"Nothing more fun than an irritated grizzly bear,\" I agreed, nodding. He snickered, shaking his head. \"Tell me what you're really thinking, please.\" \"I'm trying to picture it \u2014 but I can't,\" I admitted. \"How do you hunt a bear without weapons?\" \"Oh, we have weapons.\" He flashed his bright teeth in a brief, threatening smile. I fought back a shiver before it could expose me. \"Just not the kind they consider when writing hunting laws. If you've ever seen a bear attack on television, you should be able to visualize Emmett hunting.\" I couldn't stop the next shiver that flashed down my spine. I peeked across the cafeteria toward Emmett, grateful that he wasn't looking my way. The thick bands of muscle that wrapped his arms and torso were somehow even more menacing now. Edward followed my gaze and chuckled. I stared at him, unnerved. \"Are you like a bear, too?\" I asked in a low voice. \"More like the lion, or so they tell me,\" he said lightly. \"Perhaps our preferences are indicative.\" I tried to smile. \"Perhaps,\" I repeated. But my mind was filled with opposing images that I couldn't merge together. \"Is that something I might get to see?\" \"Absolutely not!\" His face turned even whiter than usual, and his eyes were suddenly furious. I leaned back, stunned and \u2014 though I'd never admit it to him \u2014 frightened by his reaction. He leaned back as well, folding his arms across his chest. \"Too scary for me?\" I asked when I could control my voice again. \"If that were it, I would take you out tonight,\" he said, his voice cutting. \"You need a healthy dose of fear. Nothing could be more beneficial for you.\" \"Then why?\" I pressed, trying to ignore his angry expression. He glared at me for a long minute. \"Later,\" he finally said. He was on his feet in one <em>lithe</em> movement. \"We're going to be late.\" I glanced around, startled to see that he was right and the cafeteria was nearly vacant. When I was with him, the time and the place were such a muddled blur that I completely lost track of both. I jumped up, grabbing my bag from the back of my chair. \"Later, then,\" I agreed. I wouldn't forget.",

            "en": "10         10. THE MEADOW JACOB DIDN'T CALL. The first time I called, Billy answered and told me that Jacob was still in bed. I got nosy, checking to make sure that Billy had taken him to a doctor. Billy said he had, but, for some reason I couldn't nail down, I didn't really believe him. I called again, several times a day, for the next two days, but no one was ever there. Saturday, I decided to go see him, invitation be damned. But the little red house was empty. This frightened me\u2014was Jacob so sick that he'd needed to go to the hospital? I stopped by the hospital on the way back home, but the nurse at the front desk told me neither Jacob or Billy had been in. I made Charlie call Harry Clearwater as soon as he got home from work. I waited, anxious, while Charlie chatted with his old friend; the conversation seemed to go on forever without Jacob even being mentioned. It seemed that Harry had been in the hospital . . some kind of tests for his heart. Charlie's forehead got all pinched together, but Harry joked with him, blowing it off, until Charlie was laughing again. Only then did Charlie ask about Jacob, and now his side of the conversation didn't give me much to work with, just a lot of hmms and yeahs. I drummed my fingers against the counter beside him until he put a hand over mine to stop me. Finally, Charlie hung up the phone and turned to me. \"Harry says there's been some trouble with the phone lines, and that's why you haven't been able to get through. Billy took Jake to the doc down there, and it looks like he has mono. He's real tired, and Billy said no visitors,\" he reported. \"No visitors?\" I demanded in disbelief. Charlie raised one eyebrow. \"Now don't you go making a pest of yourself, Bells. Billy knows what's best for Jake. He'll be up and around soon enough. Be patient.\" I didn't push it. Charlie was too worried about Harry. That was clearly the more important issue\u2014it wouldn't be right to bug him with my lesser concerns. Instead, I went straight upstairs and turned on my computer. I found a medical site online and typed \"mononucleosis\" into the search box. All I knew about mono was that you were supposed to get it from kissing, which was clearly not the case with Jake. I read through the symptoms quickly\u2014the fever he definitely had, but what about the rest of it? No horrible sore throat, no exhaustion, no headaches, at least not before he'd gone home from the movie; he'd said he felt \"fit as a fiddle.\" Did it really come on so fast? The article made it sound like the sore stuff showed up first.  I glared at the computer screen and wondered why, exactly, I was doing this. Why did I feel so\u2026 so suspicious, like I didn't believe Billy's story? Why would Billy lie to Harry? I was being silly, probably. I was just worried, and, to be honest, I was afraid of not being allowed to see Jacob\u2014that made me nervous. I skimmed through the rest of the article, looking for more information. I stopped when I got to the part about how mono could last more than a month. A month? My mouth fell open. But Billy couldn't enforce the no-visitors thing that long. Of course not. Jake would go crazy stuck in bed that long without anyone to talk to. What was Billy afraid of, anyway? The article said that a person with mono needed to avoid physical activity, but there was nothing about visitors. The disease wasn't very infectious. I'd give Billy a week, I decided, before I got pushy. A week was generous. A week was long. By Wednesday, I was sure I wasn't going to live till Saturday. When I'd decided to leave Billy and Jacob alone for a week, I hadn't really believed that Jacob would go along with Billy's rule. Every day when I got home from school, I ran to the phone to check for messages. There never were any. I cheated three times by trying to call him, but the phone lines still weren't working. I was in the house much too much, and much too alone. Without Jacob, and my\u00a0 adrenaline and my distractions, everything I'd been repressing started creeping up on me. The dreams got hard again. I could no longer see the end coming. Just the horrible nothingness\u2014half the time in the forest, half the time in the empty fern sea where the white house no longer existed. Sometimes Sam Uley was there in the forest, watching me again. I paid him no attention\u2014there was no comfort in his presence; it made me feel no less alone. It didn't stop me from screaming myself awake, night after night. The hole in my chest was worse than ever. I'd thought that I'd been getting it under control, but I found myself hunched over, day after day, clutching my sides together and gasping for air. I wasn't handling alone well. I was relieved beyond measure the morning I woke up\u2014screaming, of course\u2014and remembered that it was Saturday. Today I could call Jacob. And if the phone lines still weren't working, then I was going to La Push. One way or another, today would be better than the last lonely week. I dialed, and then waited without high expectations. It caught me off guard when Billy answered on the second ring. \"Hello?\" \"Oh, hey, the phone is working again! Hi, Billy. It's Bella. I was just calling to see how Jacob is doing. Is he up for visitors yet? I was thinking about dropping by\u2014\" \"I'm sorry, Bella,\" Billy interrupted, and I wondered if he were watching TV; he sounded distracted.  \"He's not in.\" \"Oh.\" It took me a second. \"So he's feeling better then?\" \"Yeah,\" Billy hesitated for an instant too long. \"Turns out it wasn't mono after all. Just some other virus.\" \"Oh. So\u2026 where is he?\" \"He's giving some friends a ride up to Port Angeles\u2014I think they were going to catch a double feature or something. He's gone for the whole day.\" \"Well, that's a relief. I've been so worried. I'm glad he felt good enough to get out.\" My voice sounded horribly phony as I babbled on. Jacob was better, but not well enough to call me. He was out with friends. I was sitting home, missing him more every hour. I was lonely, worried, bored\u2026 perforated\u2014and now also desolate as I realized that the week apart had not had the same effect on him. \"Is there anything in particular you wanted?\" Billy asked politely. \"No, not really.\" \"Well, I'll tell him that you called,\" Billy promised. \"Bye, Bella.\" \"Bye,\" I replied, but he'd already hung up. I stood for a moment with the phone still in my hand. Jacob must have changed his mind, just like I'd feared. He was going to take my advice and not waste any more time on someone who couldn't return his feelings. I felt the blood run out of my face. \"Something wrong?\" Charlie asked as he came down the stairs. \"No,\" I lied, hanging up the phone. \"Billy says Jacob is feeling better. It wasn't mono. So that's good.\" \"Is he coming here, or are you going there?\" Charlie asked absentmindedly as he started poking through the fridge. \"Neither,\" I admitted. \"He's going out with some other friends.\" The tone of my voice finally caught Charlie's attention. He looked up at me with sudden alarm, his hands frozen around a package of cheese slices. \"Isn't it a little early for lunch?\" I asked as lightly as I could manage, trying to distract him. \"No, I'm just packing something to take out to the river\u2026\" \"Oh, fishing today?\" \"Well, Harry called\u2026 and it's not raining.\" He was creating a stack of food on the counter as he spoke. Suddenly he looked up again as if he'd just realized something. \"Say, did you want me to stay with you, since Jake's out?\" \"That's okay, Dad,\" I said, working to sound indifferent. \"The fish bite better when the weather's nice.\" He stared at me, indecision clear on his face. I knew that he was worrying, afraid to leave me alone, in case I got \"mopey\" again. \"Seriously, Dad. I think I'll call Jessica,\" I fibbed quickly. I'd rather be alone than have him watching me all day. \"We have a Calculus test to study for. I could use her help.\" That part was true. But I'd have to make do without it. \"That's a good idea. You've been spending so much time with Jacob, your other friends are going to think you've forgotten them.\" I smiled and nodded as if I cared what my other friends thought. Charlie started to turn, but then spun back with a worried expression. \"Hey, you'll study here or at Jess's, right?\" \"Sure, where else?\" \"Well, it's just that I want you to be careful to stay out of the woods, like I told you before.\" It took me a minute to understand, distracted as I was. \"More bear trouble?\" Charlie nodded, frowning. \"We've got a missing hiker\u2014the rangers found his camp early this morning, but no sign of him. There were some really big animal prints\u2026 of course those could have come later, smelling the food\u2026 Anyway, they're setting traps for it now.\" \"Oh,\" I said vaguely. I wasn't really listening to his warnings; I was much more upset by the situation with Jacob than by the possibility of being eaten by a bear. I was glad that Charlie was in a hurry. He didn't wait for me to call Jessica, so I didn't have to put on that charade. I went through the motions of gathering my school-books on the kitchen table to pack them in my bag; that was probably too much, and if he hadn't been eager to hit the holes, it might have made him suspicious. I was so busy looking busy that the ferociously empty day ahead didn't really crash down on me until after I'd watched him drive away. It only took about two minutes of staring at the silent kitchen phone to decide that I wasn't staying home today. I considered my options. I wasn't going to call Jessica. As far as I could tell, Jessica had crossed over to the dark side. I could drive to La Push and get my motorcycle\u2014an appealing thought but for one minor problem: who was going to drive me to the emergency room if I needed it afterward? Or\u2026 I already had our map and compass in the truck. I was pretty sure I understood the process well enough by now that I wouldn't get lost. Maybe I could eliminate two lines today, putting us ahead of schedule for whenever Jacob decided to honor me with his presence again. I refused to think about how long that might be. Or if it was going to be never. I felt a brief twinge of guilt as I realized how Charlie would feel about this, but I ignored it. I just couldn't stay in the house again today. A few minutes later I was on the familiar dirt road that led to nowhere in particular. I had the windows rolled down and I drove as fast as was healthy for my truck, trying to enjoy the wind against my face. It was cloudy, but almost dry\u2014a very nice day, for Forks. Getting started took me longer than it would have taken Jacob. After I parked in the usual spot, I had to spend a good fifteen minutes studying the little needle on the compass face and the markings on the now worn map. When I was reasonably certain that I was following the right line of the web, I set off into the woods. The forest was full of life today, all the little creatures enjoying the momentary dryness. Somehow, though, even with the birds chirping and cawing, the insects buzzing noisily around my head, and the occasional scurry of the field mice through the shrubs, the forest seemed creepier today; it reminded me of my most recent nightmare. I knew it was just because I was alone, missing Jacob's carefree whistle and the sound of another pair of feet squishing across the damp ground. The sense of unease grew stronger the deeper I got into the trees. Breathing started to get more difficult\u2014not because of exertion, but because I was having trouble with the stupid hole in my chest again. I kept my arms tight around my torso and tried to banish the ache from my thoughts. I almost turned around, but I hated to waste the effort I'd already expended. The rhythm of my footsteps started to numb my mind and my pain as I trudged on. My breathing evened out eventually, and I was glad I hadn't quit. I was getting better at this bushwhacking thing; I could tell I was faster. I didn't realize quite how much more efficiently I was moving. I thought I'd covered maybe four miles, and I wasn't even starting to look around for it yet. And then, with an abruptness that disoriented me, I stepped through a low arch made by two vine maples\u2014pushing past the chest-high ferns\u2014into the meadow. It was the same place, of that I was instantly sure. I'd never seen another clearing so symmetrical. It was as perfectly round as if someone had intentionally created the flawless circle, tearing out the trees but leaving no evidence of that violence in the waving grass. To the east, I could hear the stream bubbling quietly. The place wasn't nearly so stunning without the sunlight, but it was still very beautiful and serene. It was the wrong season for wildflowers; the ground was thick with tall grass that swayed in the light breeze like ripples across a lake. It was the same place\u2026 but it didn't hold what I had been searching for. The disappointment was nearly as instantaneous as the recognition. I sank down right where I was, kneeling there at the edge of the clearing, beginning to gasp. What was the point of going any farther? Nothing lingered here. Nothing more than the memories that I could have called back whenever I wanted to, if I was ever willing to endure the corresponding pain\u2014the pain that had me now, had me cold. There was nothing special about this place without him. I wasn't exactly sure what I'd hoped to feel here, but the meadow was empty of atmosphere, empty of everything, just like everywhere else. Just like my nightmares. My head swirled dizzily. At least I'd come alone. I felt a rush of thankfulness as I realized that. If I'd discovered the meadow with Jacob\u2026 well, there was no way I could have disguised the abyss I was plunging into now. How could I have explained the way I was fracturing into pieces, the way I had to curl into a ball to keep the empty hole from tearing me apart? It was so much better that I didn't have an audience. And I wouldn't have to explain to anyone why I was in such a hurry to leave, either. Jacob would have assumed, after going to so much trouble to locate the stupid place, I would want to spend more than a few seconds here. But I was already trying to find the strength to get to my feet again, forcing myself out of the ball so that I could escape. There was too much pain in this empty place to bear\u2014I would crawl away if I had to. How lucky that I was alone! Alone. I repeated the word with grim satisfaction as I wrenched myself to my feet despite the pain. At precisely that moment, a figure stepped out from the trees to the north, some thirty paces away. A dizzying array of emotions shot through me in a second. The first was surprise; I was far from any trail here, and I didn't expect company. Then, as my eyes focused on the motionless figure, seeing the utter stillness, the pallid skin, a rush of piercing hope rocked through me. I suppressed it viciously, fighting against the equally sharp lash of agony as my eyes continued to the face beneath the black hair, the face that wasn't the one I wanted to see. Next was fear; this was not the face I grieved for, but it was close enough for me to know that the man facing me was no stray hiker. And finally, in the end, recognition. \"Laurent!\" I cried in surprised pleasure. It was an irrational response. I probably should have stopped at fear. Laurent had been one of James's coven when we'd first met. He hadn't been involved with the hunt that followed\u2014the hunt where I was the quarry\u2014but that was only because he was afraid; I was protected by a bigger coven than his own. It would have been different if that wasn't the case\u2014he'd had no compunctions, at the time, against making a meal of me. Of course, he must have changed, because he'd gone to Alaska to live with the other civilized coven there, the other family that refused to drink human blood for ethical\u00a0 reasons. The other family like\u2026 but I couldn't let myself think the name. Yes, fear would have made more sense, but all I felt was an overwhelming satisfaction. The meadow was a magic place again. A darker magic than I'd expected, to be sure, but magic all the same. Here was the connection I'd sought. The proof, however remote, that\u2014somewhere in the same world where I lived\u2014 he did exist. It was impossible how exactly the same Laurent looked. I suppose it was very silly and human to expect some kind of change in the last year. But there was something\u2026 I couldn't quite put my finger on it. \"Bella?\" he asked, looking more astonished than I felt. \"You remember.\" I smiled. It was ridiculous that I should be so elated because a vampire knew my name. He grinned. \"I didn't expect to see you here.\" He strolled toward me, his expression bemused. \"Isn't it the other way around? I do live here. I thought you'd gone to Alaska.\" He stopped about ten paces away, cocking his head to the side. His face was the most beautiful face I'd seen in what felt like an eternity. I studied his features with a strangely greedy sense of release. Here was someone I didn't have to pretend for\u2014someone who already knew everything I could never say. \"You're right,\" he agreed. \"I did go to Alaska. Still, I didn't expect\u2026 When I found the Cullen place empty, I thought they'd moved on.\" \"Oh.\" I bit my lip as the name set the raw edges of my wound throbbing. It took me a second to compose myself. Laurent waited with curious eyes. \"They did move on,\" I finally managed to tell him. \"Hmm,\" he murmured. \"I'm surprised they left you behind. Weren't you sort of a pet of theirs?\" His eyes were innocent of any intended offense. I smiled wryly. \"Something like that.\" \"Hmm,\" he said, thoughtful again. At that precise moment, I realized why he looked the same\u2014too much the same. After Carlisle told us that Laurent had stayed with Tanya's family, I'd begun to picture him, on the rare occasions that I thought of him at all, with the same golden eyes that the\u2026 Cullens\u2014I forced the name out, wincing\u2014had. That all good vampires had. I took an involuntary step back, and his curious, dark red eyes followed the movement. \"Do they visit often?\" he asked, still casual, but his weight shifted toward me. \"Lie,\" the beautiful velvet voice whispered anxiously from my memory. I started at the sound of his voice, but it should not have surprised me. Was I not in the worst danger imaginable? The motorcycle was safe as kittens next to this. I did what the voice said to do. \"Now and again.\" I tried to make my voice light, relaxed. \"The time seems longer to me, I imagine. You know how they get distracted\u2026\" I was beginning to babble. I had to work to shut myself up. \"Hmm,\" he said again. \"The house smelled like it had been vacant for a while\u2026\" \"You must lie better than that, Bella,\" the voice urged. I tried. \"I'll have to mention to Carlisle that you stopped by. He'll be sorry they missed your visit.\" I pretended to deliberate for a second. \"But I probably shouldn't mention it to\u2026 Edward, I suppose\u2014\" I barely managed to say his name, and it twisted my expression on the way out, ruining my bluff \"\u2014he has such a temper\u2026 well, I'm sure you remember. He's still touchy about the whole James thing.\" I rolled my eyes and waved one hand dismissively, like it was all ancient history, but there was an edge of hysteria to my voice. I wondered if he would recognize what it was. \"Is he really?\" Laurent asked pleasantly\u2026 skeptically. I kept my reply short, so that my voice wouldn't betray my panic. \"Mm-hmm.\" Laurent took a casual step to the side, gazing around at the little meadow. I didn't miss that the step brought him closer to me. In my head, the voice responded with a low snarl. \"So how are things working out in Denali? Carlisle said you were staying with Tanya?\" My voice was too high. The question made him pause. \"I like Tanya very much,\" he mused. \"And her sister Irina even more\u2026 I've never stayed in one place for so long before, and I enjoy the advantages, the novelty of it. But, the restrictions are difficult\u2026 I'm surprised that any of them can keep it up for long.\" He smiled at me conspiratorially. \"Sometimes I cheat.\" I couldn't swallow. My foot started to ease back, but I froze when his red eyes flickered down to catch the movement. \"Oh,\" I said in a faint voice. \"Jasper has problems with that, too.\" \"Don't move,\" the voice whispered. I tried to do what he instructed. It was hard; the instinct to take flight was nearly uncontrollable. \"Really?\" Laurent seemed interested. \"Is that why they left?\" \"No,\" I answered honestly. \"Jasper is more careful at home.\" \"Yes,\" Laurent agreed. \"I am, too.\" The step forward he took now was quite deliberate. \"Did Victoria ever find you?\" I asked, breathless, desperate to distract him. It was the first question that popped into my head, and I regretted it as soon as the words were spoken. Victoria\u2014who had hunted me with James, and then disappeared\u2014was not someone I wanted to think of at this particular moment. But the question did stop him. \"Yes,\" he said, hesitating on that step. \"I actually came here as a favor to her.\" He made a face. \"She won't be happy about this.\" \"About what?\" I said eagerly, inviting him to continue. He was glaring into the trees, away from me. I took advantage of his diversion, taking a furtive step back. He looked back at me and smiled\u2014the expression made him look like a black-haired angel. \"About me killing you,\" he answered in a seductive purr. I staggered back another step. The frantic growling in my head made it hard to hear. \"She wanted to save that part for herself,\" he went on blithely. \"She's sort of\u2026 put out with you, Bella.\" \"Me?\" I squeaked. He shook his head and chuckled. \"I know, it seems a little backward to me, too. But James was her mate, and your Edward killed him.\" Even here, on the point of death, his name tore against my unhealed wounds like a serrated edge. Laurent was oblivious to my reaction. \"She thought it more appropriate to kill you than Edward\u2014fair turnabout, mate for mate. She asked me to get the lay of the land for her, so to speak. I didn't imagine you would be so easy to get to. So maybe her plan was flawed\u2014apparently it wouldn't be the revenge she imagined, since you must not mean very much to him if he left you here unprotected.\" Another blow, another tear through my chest. Laurent's weight shifted slightly, and I stumbled another step back. He frowned. \"I suppose she'll be angry, all the same.\" \"Then why not wait for her?\" I choked out. A mischievous grin rearranged his features. \"Well, you've caught me at a bad time, Bella. I didn't come to this place on Victoria's mission\u2014I was hunting. I'm quite thirsty, and you do smell\u2026 simply mouthwatering.\" Laurent looked at me with approval, as if he meant it as a compliment. \"Threaten him,\" the beautiful delusion ordered, his voice distorted with dread. \"He'll know it was you,\" I whispered obediently. \"You won't get away with this.\" \"And why not?\" Laurent's smile widened. He gazed around the small opening in the trees. \"The scent will wash away with the next rain. No one will find your body\u2014you'll simply go missing, like so many, many other humans. There's no reason for Edward to think of me, if he cares enough to investigate. This is nothing personal, let me assure you, Bella. Just thirst.\" \"Beg,\" my hallucination begged. \"Please,\" I gasped. Laurent shook his head, his face kind. \"Look at it this way, Bella. You're very lucky I was the one to find you.\" \"Am I?\" I mouthed, faltering another step back. Laurent followed, <em>lithe</em> and graceful. \"Yes,\" he assured me. \"I'll be very quick. You won't feel a thing, I promise. Oh, I'll lie to Victoria about that later, naturally, just to placate her. But if you knew what she had planned for you, Bella\u2026\" He shook his head with a slow movement, almost as if in disgust. \"I swear you'd be thanking me for this.\" I stared at him in horror. He sniffed at the breeze that blew threads of my hair in his direction. \"Mouthwatering,\" he repeated, inhaling deeply. I tensed for the spring, my eyes squinting as I cringed away, and the sound of Edward's furious roar echoed distantly in the back of my head. His name burst through all the walls I'd built to contain it. Edward, Edward, Edward. I was going to die. It shouldn't matter if I thought of him now. Edward, I love you. Through my narrowed eyes, I watched as Laurent paused in the act of inhaling and whipped his head abruptly to the left. I was afraid to look away from him, to follow his glance, though he hardly needed a distraction or any other trick to overpower me. I was too amazed to feel relief when he started slowly backing away from me. \"I don't believe it,\" he said, his voice so low that I barely heard it. I had to look then. My eyes scanned the meadow, searching for the interruption that had extended my life by a few seconds. At first I saw nothing, and my gaze flickered back to Laurent. He was retreating more quickly now, his eyes boring into the forest. Then I saw it; a huge black shape eased out of the trees, quiet as a shadow, and stalked deliberately toward the vampire. It was enormous\u2014as tall as a horse, but thicker, much more muscular. The long muzzle grimaced, revealing a line of dagger-like incisors. A grisly snarl rolled out from between the teeth, rumbling across the clearing like a prolonged crack of thunder. The bear. Only, it wasn't a bear at all. Still, this gigantic black monster had to be the creature causing all the alarm. From a distance, anyone would assume it was a bear. What else could be so vast, so powerfully built? I wished I were lucky enough to see it from a distance. Instead, it padded silently through the grass a mere ten feet from where I stood. \"Don't move an inch,\" Edward's voice whispered. I stared at the monstrous creature, my mind boggling as I tried to put a name to it. There was a distinctly canine cast to the shape of it, the way it moved. I could only think of one possibility, locked in horror as I was. Yet I'd never imagined that a wolf could get so big. Another growl rumbled in its throat, and I shuddered away from the sound. Laurent was backing toward the edge of the trees, and, under the freezing terror,\u00a0 confusion swept through me. Why was Laurent retreating? Granted, the wolf was monstrous in size, but it was just an animal. What reason would a vampire have for fearing an animal? And Laurent was afraid. His eyes were wide with horror, just like mine. As if in answer to my question, suddenly the mammoth wolf was not alone. Flanking it on either side, another two gigantic beasts prowled silently into the meadow. One was a deep gray, the other brown, neither one quite as tall as the first. The gray wolf came through the trees only a few feet from me, its eyes locked on Laurent. Before I could even react, two more wolves followed, lined up in a V, like geese flying south. Which meant that the rusty brown monster that shrugged through the brush last was close enough for me to touch. I gave an involuntary gasp and jumped back\u2014which was the stupidest thing I could have done. I froze again, waiting for the wolves to turn on me, the much weaker of the available prey. I wished briefly that Laurent would get on with it and crush the wolf pack\u2014it should be so simple for him. I guessed that, between the two choices before me, being eaten by wolves was almost certainly the worse option. The wolf closest to me, the reddish brown one, turned its head slightly at the sound of my gasp. The wolf's eyes were dark, nearly black. It gazed at me for a fraction of a second, the deep eyes seeming too intelligent for a wild animal. As it stared at me, I suddenly thought of Jacob\u2014again, with gratitude. At least I'd come here alone, to this fairytale meadow filled with dark monsters. At least Jacob wasn't going to die, too. At least I wouldn't have his death on my hands. Then another low growl from the leader caused the russet wolf to whip his head around, back toward Laurent. Laurent was staring at the pack of monster wolves with unconcealed shock and fear. The first I could understand. But I was stunned when, without warning, he spun and disappeared into the trees. He ran away. The wolves were after him in a second, sprinting across the open grass with a few powerful bounds, snarling and snapping so loudly that my hands flew up instinctively to cover my ears. The sound faded with surprising swiftness once they disappeared into the woods. And then I was alone again. My knees buckled under me, and I fell onto my hands, sobs building in my throat. I knew I needed to leave, and leave now. How long would the wolves chase Laurent before they doubled back for me? Or would Laurent turn on them? Would he be the one that came looking? I couldn't move at first, though; my arms and legs were shaking, and I didn't know how to get back to my feet. My mind couldn't move past the fear, the horror or the confusion. I didn't understand what I'd just witnessed. A vampire should not have run from overgrown dogs like that. What good would their teeth be against his granite skin? And the wolves should have given Laurent a wide berth. Even if their extraordinary size had taught them to fear nothing, it still made no sense that they would pursue him. I doubted his icy marble skin would smell anything like food. Why would they pass up something warm-blooded and weak like me to chase after Laurent? I couldn't make it add up. A cold breeze whipped through the meadow, swaying the grass like something was moving through it. I scrambled to my feet, backing away even though the wind brushed harmlessly past me. Stumbling in panic, I turned and ran headlong into the trees. The next few hours were agony. It took me three times as long to escape the trees as it had to get to the meadow. At first I paid no attention to where I was headed, focused only on what I was running from By the time I collected myself enough to remember the compass, I was deep in the unfamiliar and menacing forest. My hands were shaking so violently that I had to set the compass on the muddy ground to be able to read it. Every few minutes I would stop to put the compass down and check that I was still heading northwest, hearing\u2014when the sounds weren't hidden behind the frantic squelching of my footsteps\u2014the quiet whisper of unseen things moving in the leaves. The call of a jaybird made me leap back and fall into a thick stand of young spruce, scraping up my arms and tangling my hair with sap. The sudden rush of a squirrel up a hemlock made me scream so loud it hurt my own ears. At last there was a break in the trees ahead. I came out onto the empty road a mile or so south of where I'd left the truck. Exhausted as I was, I jogged up the lane until I found it. By the time I pulled myself into the cab, I was sobbing again. I fiercely shoved down both stiff locks before I dug my keys out of my pocket. The roar of the engine was comforting and sane. It helped me control the tears as I sped as fast as my truck would allow toward the main highway. I was calmer, but still a mess when I got home. Charlie's cruiser was in the driveway\u2014I hadn't realized how late it was. The sky was already dusky. \"Bella?\" Charlie asked when I slammed the front door behind me and hastily turned the locks.  \"Yeah, it's me.\" My voice was unsteady. \"Where have you been?\" he thundered, appearing through the kitchen doorway with an ominous expression. I hesitated. He'd probably called the Stanleys. I'd better stick to the truth. \"I was hiking,\" I admitted. His eyes were tight. \"What happened to going to Jessica's?\" \"I didn't feel like Calculus today.\" Charlie folded his arms across his chest. \"I thought I asked you to stay out of the forest.\" \"Yeah, I know. Don't worry, I won't do it again.\" I shuddered. Charlie seemed to really look at me for the first time. I remembered that I had spent some time on the forest floor today; I must be a mess. \"What happened?\" Charlie demanded. Again, I decided that the truth, or part of it anyway, was the best option. I was too shaken to pretend that I'd spent an uneventful day with the flora and fauna. \"I saw the bear.\" I tried to say it calmly, but my voice was high and shaky. \"It's not a bear, though\u2014it's some kind of wolf. And there are five of them. A big black one, and gray, and reddish-brown\u2026\" Charlie's eyes grew round with horror. He strode quickly to me and grabbed the tops of my arms. \"Are you okay?\" My head bobbed in a weak nod. \"Tell me what happened.\" \"They didn't pay any attention to me. But after they were gone, I ran away and I fell down a lot.\" He let go of my shoulders and wrapped his arms around me. For a long moment, he didn't say anything. \"Wolves,\" he murmured. \"What?\" \"The rangers said the tracks were wrong for a bear\u2014but wolves just don't get that big\u2026\" \"These were huge.\" \"How many did you say you saw?\" \"Five.\" Charlie shook his head, frowning with anxiety, He finally spoke in a tone that allowed no argument. \"No more hiking.\" \"No problem,\" I promised fervently. .  Charlie called the station to report what I'd seen. I fudged a little bit about where exactly I'd seen the wolves\u2014claiming I'd been on the trail that led to the north. I didn't want my dad to know how deep I'd gone into the forest against his wishes, and, more importantly, I didn't want anyone wandering near where Laurent might be searching for me. The thought of it made me feel sick. \"Are you hungry?\" he asked me when he hung up the phone. I shook my head, though I must have been starving. I hadn't eaten all day. \"Just tired,\" I told him. I turned for the stairs. \"Hey,\" Charlie said, his voice suddenly suspicious again. \"Didn't you say Jacob was gone for the day?\" \"That's what Billy said,\" I told him, confused by his question. He studied my expression for a minute, and seemed satisfied with what he saw there. \"Huh.\" \"Why?\" I demanded. It sounded like he was implying that I'd been lying to him this morning. About something besides studying with Jessica. \"Well, it's just that when I went to pick up Harry, I saw Jacob out in front of the store down there with some of his friends. I waved hi, but he\u2026 well, I guess I don't know if he saw me. I think maybe he was arguing with his friends. He looked strange, like he was upset about something. And\u2026 different. It's like you can watch that kid growing! He gets bigger every time I see him.\" \"Billy said Jake and his friends were going up to Port Angeles to see some movies. They were probably just waiting for someone to meet them.\" \"Oh.\" Charlie nodded and headed for the kitchen. I stood in the hall, thinking about Jacob arguing with his friends. I wondered if he had confronted Embry about the situation with Sam. Maybe that was the reason he'd ditched me today\u2014if it meant he could sort things out with Embry, I was glad he had. I paused to check the locks again before I went to my room. It was a silly thing to do. What difference would a lock make to any of the monsters I'd seen this afternoon? I assumed the handle alone would stymie the wolves, not having opposable thumbs. And if Laurent came here\u2026 Or\u2026 Victoria. I lay down on my bed, but I was shaking too hard to hope for sleep. I curled into a cramped ball under my quilt, and faced the horrifying facts. There was nothing I could do. There were no precautions I could take. There was no place I could hide. There was no one who could help me. I realized, with a nauseous roll of my stomach, that the situation was worse than even that. Because all those facts applied to Charlie, too. My father, sleeping one room away from me, was just a hairsbreadth off the heart of the target that was centered on me. My scent would lead them here, whether I was here or not. The tremors rocked me until my teeth chattered. To calm myself, I fantasized the impossible: I imagined the big wolves catching up to Laurent in the woods and massacring the indestructible immortal the way they would any normal person. Despite the absurdity of such a vision, the idea comforted me. If the wolves got him, then he couldn't tell Victoria I was here all alone. If he didn't return, maybe she'd think the Cullens were still protecting me. If only the wolves could win such a fight\u2026 My good vampires were never coming back; how soothing it was to imagine that the other kind could also disappear. I squeezed my eyes tight together and waited for unconsciousness\u2014almost eager for my nightmare to start. Better that than the pale, beautiful face that smiled at me now from behind my lids. In my imagination, Victoria's eyes were black with thirst, bright with anticipation, and her lips curled back from her gleaming teeth in pleasure. Her red hair was brilliant as fire; it blew chaotically around her wild face. Laurent's words repeated in my head. If you knew what she had planned for you \u2026 I pressed my fist against my mouth to keep from screaming.",

His skin, white despite the faint flush from yesterday's hunting trip, literally sparkled, like thousands of tiny diamonds were embedded in the surface. He lay perfectly still in the grass, his shirt open over his sculpted, incandescent chest, his scintillating arms bare. His glistening, pale lavender lids were shut, though of course he didn't sleep. A perfect statue, carved in some unknown stone, smooth like marble, glittering like crystal. Now and then, his lips would move, so fast it looked like they were trembling. But, when I asked, he told me he was singing to himself; it was too low for me to hear. I enjoyed the sun, too, though the air wasn't quite dry enough for my taste. I would have liked to lie back, as he did, and let the sun warm my face. But I stayed curled up, my chin resting on my knees, unwilling to take my eyes off him. The wind was gentle; it tangled my hair and ruffled the grass that swayed around his motionless form. The meadow, so spectacular to me at first, paled next to his magnificence. Hesitantly, always afraid, even now, that he would disappear like a mirage, too beautiful to be real\u2026 hesitantly, I reached out one finger and stroked the back of his shimmering hand, where it lay within my reach. I marveled again at the perfect texture, satin smooth, cool as stone. When I looked up again, his eyes were open, watching me. Butterscotch today, lighter, warmer after hunting. His quick smile turned up the corners of his flawless lips. \"I don't scare you?\" he asked playfully, but I could hear the real curiosity in his soft voice. \"No more than usual.\" He smiled wider; his teeth flashed in the sun. I inched closer, stretched out my whole hand now to trace the contours of his forearm with my fingertips. I saw that my fingers trembled, and knew it wouldn't escape his notice. \"Do you mind?\" I asked, for he had closed his eyes again. \"No,\" he said without opening his eyes. \"You can't imagine how that feels.\" He sighed. I lightly trailed my hand over the perfect muscles of his arm, followed\u00a0 the faint pattern of bluish veins inside the crease at his elbow. With my other hand, I reached to turn his hand over. Realizing what I wished, he flipped his palm up in one of those blindingly fast, disconcerting movements of his. It startled me; my fingers froze on his arm for a brief second. \"Sorry,\" he murmured. I looked up in time to see his golden eyes close again. \"It's too easy to be myself with you.\" I lifted his hand, turning it this way and that as I watched the sun glitter on his palm. I held it closer to my face, trying to see the hidden facets in his skin. \"Tell me what you're thinking,\" he whispered. I looked to see his eyes watching me, suddenly intent. \"It's still so strange for me, not knowing.\" \"You know, the rest of us feel that way all the time.\" \"It's a hard life.\" Did I imagine the hint of regret in his tone? \"But you didn't tell me.\" \"I was wishing I could know what you were thinking\u2026\" I hesitated. \"And?\" \"I was wishing that I could believe that you were real. And I was wishing that I wasn't afraid.\" \"I don't want you to be afraid.\" His voice was just a soft murmur. I heard what he couldn't truthfully say, that I didn't need to be afraid, that there was nothing to fear. \"Well, that's not exactly the fear I meant, though that's certainly something to think about.\" So quickly that I missed his movement, he was half sitting, propped up on his right arm, his left palm still in my hands. His angel's face was only a few inches from mine. I might have \u2014 should have \u2014 flinched away from his unexpected closeness, but I was unable to move.  His golden eyes mesmerized me. \"What are you afraid of, then?\" he whispered intently. But I couldn't answer. As I had just that once before, I smelled his cool breath in my face. Sweet, delicious, the scent made my mouth water. It was unlike anything else. Instinctively, unthinkingly, I leaned closer, inhaling. And he was gone, his hand ripped from mine. In the time it took my eyes to focus, he was twenty feet away, standing at the edge of the small meadow, in the deep shade of a huge fir tree. He stared at me, his eyes dark in the shadows, his expression unreadable. I could feel the hurt and shock on my face. My empty hands stung. \"I'm\u2026 sorry\u2026 Edward,\" I whispered. I knew he could hear. \"Give me a moment,\" he called, just loud enough for my less sensitive ears. I sat very still. After ten incredibly long seconds, he walked back, slowly for him. He stopped, still several feet away, and sank gracefully to the ground, crossing his legs. His eyes never left mine.  He took two deep breaths, and then smiled in apology. \"I am so very sorry.\" He hesitated. \"Would you understand what I meant if I said I was only human?\" I nodded once, not quite able to smile at his joke. Adrenaline pulsed through my veins as the realization of danger slowly sank in. He could smell that from where he sat. His smile turned mocking. \"I'm the world's best predator, aren't I? Everything about me invites you in \u2014 my voice, my face, even my smell. As if I need any of that!\" Unexpectedly, he was on his feet, bounding away, instantly out of sight, only to appear beneath the same tree as before, having circled the meadow in half a second. \"As if you could outrun me,\" he laughed bitterly. He reached up with one hand and, with a deafening crack, effortlessly ripped a two-foot-thick branch from the trunk of the spruce. He balanced it in that hand for a moment, and then threw it with blinding speed, shattering it against another huge tree, which shook and trembled at the blow. And he was in front of me again, standing two feet away, still as a stone. \"As if you could fight me off,\" he said gently. I sat without moving, more frightened of him than I had ever been. I'd never seen him so completely freed of that carefully cultivated facade. He'd never been less human\u2026 or more beautiful. Face ashen, eyes wide, I sat like a bird locked in the eyes of a snake. His lovely eyes seem to glow with rash excitement. Then, as the seconds passed, they dimmed. His expression slowly folded into a mask of ancient sadness. \"Don't be afraid,\" he murmured, his velvet voice unintentionally seductive. \"I promise\u2026\" He hesitated. \"I swear not to hurt you.\" He seemed more concerned with convincing himself than me. \"Don't be afraid,\" he whispered again as he stepped closer, with exaggerated slowness. He sat sinuously, with deliberately unhurried movements, till our faces were on the same level, just a foot apart. \"Please forgive me,\" he said formally. \"I can control myself. You caught me off guard. But I'm on my best behavior now.\" He waited, but I still couldn't speak. \"I'm not thirsty today, honestly.\" He winked. At that I had to laugh, though the sound was shaky and breathless. \"Are you all right?\" he asked tenderly, reaching out slowly, carefully, to place his marble hand back in mine. I looked at his smooth, cold hand, and then at his eyes. They were soft, repentant. I looked back at his hand, and then deliberately returned to tracing the lines in his hand with my fingertip. I looked up and smiled timidly. His answering smile was dazzling. \"So where were we, before I behaved so rudely?\" he asked in the gentle cadences of an earlier century. \"I honestly can't remember.\" He smiled, but his face was ashamed. \"I think we were talking about why you were afraid, besides the obvious reason.\" \"Oh, right.\" \"Well?\" I looked down at his hand and doodled aimlessly across his smooth, iridescent palm. The seconds ticked by. \"How easily frustrated I am,\" he sighed. I looked into his eyes, abruptly grasping that this was every bit as new to him as it was to me. As many years of unfathomable experience as he had, this was hard for him, too. I took courage from that thought. \"I was afraid\u2026 because, for, well, obvious reasons, I can't stay with you. And I'm afraid that I'd like to stay with you, much more than I should.\" I looked down at his hands as I spoke. It was difficult for me to say this aloud. \"Yes,\" he agreed slowly. \"That is something to be afraid of, indeed. Wanting to be with me. That's really not in your best interest.\" I frowned. \"I should have left long ago,\" he sighed. \"I should leave now. But I don't know if I can.\" \"I don't want you to leave,\" I mumbled pathetically, staring down again. \"Which is exactly why I should. But don't worry. I'm essentially a selfish creature. I crave your company too much to do what I should.\" \"I'm glad.\" \"Don't be!\" He withdrew his hand, more gently this time; his voice was harsher than usual. Harsh for him, still more beautiful than any human voice. It was hard to keep up \u2014 his sudden mood changes left me always a step behind, dazed. \"It's not only your company I crave! Never forget that. Never forget I am more dangerous to you than I am to anyone else.\" He stopped, and I looked to see him gazing unseeingly into the forest. I thought for a moment. \"I don't think I understand exactly what you mean \u2014 by that last part anyway,\" I said. He looked back at me and smiled, his mood shifting yet again. \"How do I explain?\" he mused. \"And without frightening you again\u2026 hmmmm.\" Without seeming to think about it, he placed his hand back in mine; I held it tightly in both of mine. He looked at our hands. \"That's amazingly pleasant, the warmth.\" He sighed. A moment passed as he assembled his thoughts. \"You know how everyone enjoys different flavors?\" he began. \"Some people love chocolate ice cream, others prefer strawberry?\" I nodded. \"Sorry about the food analogy \u2014 I couldn't think of another way to explain.\" I smiled. He smiled ruefully back. \"You see, every person smells different, has a different essence. If you locked an alcoholic in a room full of stale beer, he'd gladly drink it. But he could resist, if he wished to, if he were a recovering alcoholic. Now let's say you placed in that room a glass of hundred-year-old brandy, the rarest, finest cognac \u2014 and filled the room with its warm aroma \u2014 how do you think he would fare then?\" We sat silently, looking into each other's eyes \u2014 trying to read each other's thoughts. He broke the silence first. \"Maybe that's not the right comparison. Maybe it would be too easy to turn down the brandy. Perhaps I should have made our alcoholic a heroin addict instead.\" \"So what you're saying is, I'm your brand of heroin?\" I teased, trying to lighten the mood. He smiled swiftly, seeming to appreciate my effort. \"Yes, you are exactly my brand of heroin.\" \"Does that happen often?\" I asked. He looked across the treetops, thinking through his response. \"I spoke to my brothers about it.\" He still stared into the distance. \"To Jasper, every one of you is much the same. He's the most recent to join our family. It's a struggle for him to abstain at all. He hasn't had time to grow sensitive to the differences in smell, in flavor.\" He glanced swiftly at me, his expression apologetic. \"Sorry,\" he said. \"I don't mind. Please don't worry about offending me, or frightening me, or whichever. That's the way you think. I can understand, or I can try to at least. Just explain however you can.\" He took a deep breath and gazed at the sky again. \"So Jasper wasn't sure if he'd ever come across someone who was as\" \u2014 he hesitated, looking for the right word \u2014 \"appealing as you are to me.\u00a0 Which makes me think not. Emmett has been on the wagon longer, so to speak, and he understood what I meant. He says twice, for him, once stronger than the other.\" \"And for you?\" \"Never.\" The word hung there for a moment in the warm breeze. \"What did Emmett do?\" I asked to break the silence. It was the wrong question to ask. His face grew dark, his hand clenched into a fist inside mine. He looked away. I waited, but he wasn't going to answer. \"I guess I know,\" I finally said. He lifted his eyes; his expression was wistful, pleading. \"Even the strongest of us fall off the wagon, don't we?\" \"What are you asking? My permission?\" My voice was sharper than I'd intended. I tried to make my tone kinder \u2014 I could guess what his honesty must cost him. \"I mean, is there no hope, then?\" How calmly I could discuss my own death! \"No, no!\" He was instantly contrite. \"Of course there's hope! I mean, of course I won't\u2026\" He left the sentence hanging. His eyes burned into mine. \"It's different for us. Emmett\u2026 these were strangers he happened across. It was a long time ago, and he wasn't as\u2026 practiced, as careful, as he is now.\" He fell silent and watched me intently as I thought it through. \"So if we'd met\u2026 oh, in a dark alley or something\u2026\" I trailed off. \"It took everything I had not to jump up in the middle of that class full of children and \u2014\" He stopped abruptly, looking away. \"When you walked past me, I could have ruined everything Carlisle has built for us, right then and there. If I hadn't been denying my thirst for the last, well, too many years, I wouldn't have been able to stop myself.\" He paused, scowling at the trees. He glanced at me grimly, both of us remembering. \"You must have thought I was possessed.\" \"I couldn't understand why. How you could hate me so quickly\u2026\" \"To me, it was like you were some kind of demon, summoned straight from my own personal hell to ruin me. The fragrance coming off your skin\u2026 I thought it would make me deranged that first day. In that one hour, I thought of a hundred different ways to lure you from the room with me, to get you alone. And I fought them each back, thinking of my family, what I could do to them. I had to run out, to get away before I could speak the words that would make you follow\u2026\" He looked up then at my staggered expression as I tried to absorb his bitter memories. His golden eyes scorched from under his lashes, hypnotic and deadly. \"You would have come,\" he promised. I tried to speak calmly. \"Without a doubt.\" He frowned down at my hands, releasing me from the force of his stare. \"And then, as I tried to rearrange my schedule in a pointless attempt to avoid you, you were there \u2014 in that close, warm little room, the scent was maddening. I so very nearly took you then. There was only one other frail human there \u2014 so easily dealt with.\" I shivered in the warm sun, seeing my memories anew through his eyes, only now grasping the danger. Poor Ms. Cope; I shivered again at how close I'd come to being inadvertently responsible for her death. \"But I resisted. I don't know how. I forced myself not to wait for you, not to follow you from the school. It was easier outside, when I couldn't smell you anymore, to think clearly, to make the right decision. I left the others near home \u2014 I was too ashamed to tell them how weak I was, they only knew something was very wrong \u2014 and then I went straight to Carlisle, at the hospital, to tell him I was leaving.\" I stared in surprise.  \"I traded cars with him \u2014 he had a full tank of gas and I didn't want to stop. I didn't dare to go home, to face Esme. She wouldn't have let me go without a scene. She would have tried to convince me that it wasn't necessary\u2026 \"By the next morning I was in Alaska.\" He sounded ashamed, as if admitting a great cowardice. \"I spent two days there, with some old acquaintances\u2026 but I was homesick. I hated knowing I'd upset Esme, and the rest of them, my adopted family. In the pure air of the mountains it was hard to believe you were so irresistible. I convinced myself it was weak to run away. I'd dealt with temptation before, not of this magnitude, not even close, but I was strong. Who were you, an insignificant little girl\" \u2014 he grinned suddenly \u2014 \"to chase me from the place I wanted to be? So I came back\u2026\" He stared off into space. I couldn't speak. \"I took precautions, hunting, feeding more than usual before seeing you again. I was sure that I was strong enough to treat you like any other human. I was arrogant about it. \"It was unquestionably a complication that I couldn't simply read your thoughts to know what your reaction was to me. I wasn't used to having to go to such circuitous measures, listening to your words in Jessica's mind\u2026 her mind isn't very original, and it was annoying to have to stoop to that. And then I couldn't know if you really meant what you said. It was all extremely irritating.\" He frowned at the memory. \"I wanted you to forget my behavior that first day, if possible, so I tried to talk with you like I would with any person. I was eager actually, hoping to decipher some of your thoughts. But you were too interesting, I found myself caught up in your expressions\u2026 and every now and then you would stir the air with your hand or your hair, and the scent would stun me again\u2026 \"Of course, then you were nearly crushed to death in front of my eyes. Later I thought of a perfectly good excuse for why I acted at that moment \u2014 because if I hadn't saved you, if your blood had been spilled there in front of me, I don't think I could have stopped myself from exposing us for what we are. But I only thought of that excuse later. At the time, all I could think was, 'Not her.'\" He closed his eyes, lost in his agonized confession. I listened, more eager than rational. Common sense told me I should be terrified. Instead, I was relieved to finally understand. And I was filled with compassion for his suffering, even now, as he confessed his craving to take my life. I finally was able to speak, though my voice was faint. \"In the hospital?\" His eyes flashed up to mine. \"I was appalled. I couldn't believe I had put us in danger after all, put myself in your power \u2014 you of all people. As if I needed another motive to kill you.\"  We both flinched as that word slipped out. \"But it had the opposite effect,\" he continued quickly. \"I fought with Rosalie, Emmett, and Jasper when they suggested that now was the time\u2026 the worst fight we've ever had. Carlisle sided with me, and Alice.\" He grimaced when he said her name. I couldn't imagine why. \"Esme told me to do whatever I had to in order to stay.\" He shook his head indulgently. \"All that next day I eavesdropped on the minds of everyone you spoke to, shocked that you kept your word. I didn't understand you at all. But I knew that I couldn't become more involved with you. I did my very best to stay as far from you as possible. And every day the perfume of your skin, your breath, your hair\u2026 it hit me as hard as the very first day.\" He met my eyes again, and they were surprisingly tender. \"And for all that,\" he continued, \"I'd have fared better if I had exposed us all at that first moment, than if now, here \u2014 with no witnesses and nothing to stop me \u2014 I were to hurt you.\" I was human enough to have to ask. \"Why?\" \"Isabella.\" He pronounced my full name carefully, then playfully ruffled my hair with his free hand. A shock ran through my body at his casual touch. \"Bella, I couldn't live with myself if I ever hurt you. You don't know how it's tortured me.\" He looked down, ashamed again. \"The thought of you, still, white, cold\u2026 to never see you blush scarlet again, to never see that flash of intuition in your eyes when you see through my pretenses\u2026 it would be unendurable.\" He lifted his glorious, agonized eyes to mine. \"You are the most important thing to me now. The most important thing to me ever.\" My head was spinning at the rapid change in direction our conversation had taken. From the cheerful topic of my impending demise, we were suddenly declaring ourselves. He waited, and even though I looked down to study our hands between us, I knew his golden eyes were on me.  \"You already know how I feel, of course,\" I finally said. \"I'm here\u2026 which, roughly translated, means I would rather die than stay away from you.\" I frowned. \"I'm an idiot.\" \"You are an idiot,\" he agreed with a laugh. Our eyes met, and I laughed, too. We laughed together at the idiocy and sheer impossibility of such a moment. \"And so the lion fell in love with the lamb\u2026\" he murmured. I looked away, hiding my eyes as I thrilled to the word. \"What a stupid lamb,\" I sighed. \"What a sick, masochistic lion.\" He stared into the shadowy forest for a long moment, and I wondered where his thoughts had taken him. \"Why\u2026 ?\" I began, and then paused, not sure how to continue. He looked at me and smiled; sunlight glinted off his face, his teeth.  \"Yes?\" \"Tell me why you ran from me before.\" His smile faded. \"You know why.\" \"No, I mean, exactly what did I do wrong? I'll have to be on my guard, you see, so I better start learning what I shouldn't do. This, for example\" \u2014 I stroked the back of his hand \u2014 \"seems to be all right.\" He smiled again. \"You didn't do anything wrong, Bella. It was my fault.\" \"But I want to help, if I can, to not make this harder for you.\" \"Well\u2026\" He contemplated for a moment. \"It was just how close you were. Most humans instinctively shy away from us, are repelled by our alienness\u2026 I wasn't expecting you to come so close. And the smell of your throat.\" He stopped short, looking to see if he'd upset me. \"Okay, then,\" I said flippantly, trying to alleviate the suddenly tense atmosphere. I tucked my chin. \"No throat exposure.\" It worked; he laughed. \"No, really, it was more the surprise than anything else.\" He raised his free hand and placed it gently on the side of my neck. I sat very still, the chill of his touch a natural warning \u2014 a warning telling me to be terrified. But there was no feeling of fear in me. There were, however, other feelings\u2026 \"You see,\" he said. \"Perfectly fine.\" My blood was racing, and I wished I could slow it, sensing that this must make everything so much more difficult \u2014 the thudding of my pulse in my veins. Surely he could hear it. \"The blush on your cheeks is lovely,\" he murmured. He gently freed his other hand. My hands fell limply into my lap. Softly he brushed my cheek, then held my face between his marble hands. \"Be very still,\" he whispered, as if I wasn't already frozen. Slowly, never moving his eyes from mine, he leaned toward me. Then abruptly, but very gently, he rested his cold cheek against the hollow at the base of my throat. I was quite unable to move, even if I'd wanted to. I listened to the sound of his even breathing, watching the sun and wind play in his bronze hair, more human than any other part of him. With deliberate slowness, his hands slid down the sides of my neck. I shivered, and I heard him catch his breath. But his hands didn't pause as they softly moved to my shoulders, and then stopped. His face drifted to the side, his nose skimming across my collarbone. He came to rest with the side of his face pressed tenderly against my chest. Listening to my heart. \"Ah,\" he sighed. I don't know how long we sat without moving. It could have been hours.  Eventually the throb of my pulse quieted, but he didn't move or speak again as he held me. I knew at any moment it could be too much, and my life could end \u2014 so quickly that I might not even notice. And I couldn't make myself be afraid. I couldn't think of anything, except that he was touching me. And then, too soon, he released me.  His eyes were peaceful. \"It won't be so hard again,\" he said with satisfaction. \"Was that very hard for you?\" \"Not nearly as bad as I imagined it would be. And you?\" \"No, it wasn't bad\u2026 for me.\" He smiled at my inflection. \"You know what I mean.\" I smiled. \"Here.\" He took my hand and placed it against his cheek. \"Do you feel how warm it is?\" And it was almost warm, his usually icy skin. But I barely noticed, for I was touching his face, something I'd dreamed of constantly since the first day I'd seen him. \"Don't move,\" I whispered. No one could be still like Edward. He closed his eyes and became as immobile as stone, a carving under my hand. I moved even more slowly than he had, careful not to make one unexpected move. I caressed his cheek, delicately stroked his eyelid, the purple shadow in the hollow under his eye. I traced the shape of his perfect nose, and then, so carefully, his flawless lips. His lips parted under my hand, and I could feel his cool breath on my fingertips. I wanted to lean in, to inhale the scent of him. So I dropped my hand and leaned away, not wanting to push him too far. He opened his eyes, and they were hungry. Not in a way to make me fear, but rather to tighten the muscles in the pit of my stomach and send my pulse hammering through my veins again. \"I wish,\" he whispered, \"I wish you could feel the\u2026 complexity\u2026 the confusion\u2026 I feel. That you could understand.\" He raised his hand to my hair, then carefully brushed it across my face. \"Tell me,\" I breathed. \"I don't think I can. I've told you, on the one hand, the hunger \u2014 the thirst \u2014 that, deplorable creature that I am, I feel for you. And I think you can understand that, to an extent. Though\" \u2014 he half-smiled \u2014 \"as you are not addicted to any illegal substances, you probably can't empathize completely. \"But\u2026\" His fingers touched my lips lightly, making me shiver again. \"There are other hungers. Hungers I don't even understand, that are foreign to me.\" \"I may understand that better than you think.\" \"I'm not used to feeling so human. Is it always like this?\" \"For me?\" I paused. \"No, never. Never before this.\" He held my hands between his. They felt so feeble in his iron strength. \"I don't know how to be close to you,\" he admitted. \"I don't know if I can.\" I leaned forward very slowly, cautioning him with my eyes. I placed my cheek against his stone chest. I could hear his breath, and nothing else. \"This is enough,\" I sighed, closing my eyes. In a very human gesture, he put his arms around me and pressed his face against my hair. \"You're better at this than you give yourself credit for,\" I noted. \"I have human instincts \u2014 they may be buried deep, but they're there.\" We sat like that for another immeasurable moment; I wondered if he could be as unwilling to move as I was. But I could see the light was fading, the shadows of the forest beginning to touch us, and I sighed. \"You have to go.\" \"I thought you couldn't read my mind.\" \"It's getting clearer.\" I could hear a smile in his voice. He took my shoulders and I looked into his face. \"Can I show you something?\" he asked, sudden excitement flaring in his eyes. \"Show me what?\" \"I'll show you how I travel in the forest.\" He saw my expression. \"Don't worry, you'll be very safe, and we'll get to your truck much faster.\" His mouth twitched up into that crooked smile so beautiful my heart nearly stopped. \"Will you turn into a bat?\" I asked warily. He laughed, louder than I'd ever heard. \"Like I haven't heard that one before!\" \"Right, I'm sure you get that all the time.\" \"Come on, little coward, climb on my back.\" I waited to see if he was kidding, but, apparently, he meant it. He smiled as he read my hesitation, and reached for me. My heart reacted; even though he couldn't hear my thoughts, my pulse always gave me away. He then proceeded to sling me onto his back, with very little effort on my part, besides, when in place, clamping my legs and arms so tightly around him that it would choke a normal person. It was like clinging to a stone. \"I'm a bit heavier than your average backpack,\" I warned.  \"Hah!\" he snorted. I could almost hear his eyes rolling. I'd never seen him in such high spirits before. He startled me, suddenly grabbing my hand, pressing my palm to his face, and inhaling deeply. \"Easier all the time,\" he muttered. And then he was running. If I'd ever feared death before in his presence, it was nothing compared to how I felt now. He streaked through the dark, thick underbrush of the forest like a bullet, like a ghost. There was no sound, no evidence that his feet touched the earth. His breathing never changed, never indicated any effort. But the trees flew by at deadly speeds, always missing us by inches. I was too terrified to close my eyes, though the cool forest air whipped against my face and burned them. I felt as if I were stupidly sticking my head out the window of an airplane in flight. And, for the first time in my life, I felt the dizzy faintness of motion sickness. Then it was over. We'd hiked hours this morning to reach Edward's meadow, and now, in a matter of minutes, we were back to the truck. \"Exhilarating, isn't it?\" His voice was high, excited. He stood motionless, waiting for me to climb down. I tried, but my muscles wouldn't respond. My arms and legs stayed locked around him while my head spun uncomfortably. \"Bella?\" he asked, anxious now. \"I think I need to lie down,\" I gasped. \"Oh, sorry.\" He waited for me, but I still couldn't move. \"I think I need help,\" I admitted. He laughed quietly, and gently unloosened my stranglehold on his neck. There was no resisting the iron strength of his hands. Then he pulled me around to face him, cradling me in his arms like a small child. He held me for a moment, then carefully placed me on the springy ferns. \"How do you feel?\" he asked. I couldn't be sure how I felt when my head was spinning so crazily. \"Dizzy, I think.\" \"Put your head between your knees.\" I tried that, and it helped a little. I breathed in and out slowly, keeping my head very still. I felt him sitting beside me. The moments passed, and eventually I found that I could raise my head. There was a hollow ringing sound in my ears. \"I guess that wasn't the best idea,\" he mused. I tried to be positive, but my voice was weak. \"No, it was very interesting.\" \"Hah! You're as white as a ghost \u2014 no, you're as white as me!\" \"I think I should have closed my eyes.\" \"Remember that next time.\" \"Next time!\" I groaned. He laughed, his mood still radiant. \"Show-off,\" I muttered. \"Open your eyes, Bella,\" he said quietly. And he was right there, his face so close to mine. His beauty stunned my mind \u2014 it was too much, an excess I couldn't grow accustomed to. \"I was thinking, while I was running\u2026\" He paused. \"About not hitting the trees, I hope.\" \"Silly Bella,\" he chuckled. \"Running is second nature to me, it's not something I have to think about.\" \"Show-off,\" I muttered again. He smiled. \"No,\" he continued, \"I was thinking there was something I wanted to try.\" And he took my face in his hands again. I couldn't breathe. He hesitated \u2014 not in the normal way, the human way. Not the way a man might hesitate before he kissed a woman, to gauge her reaction, to see how he would be received. Perhaps he would hesitate to prolong the moment, that ideal moment of anticipation, sometimes better than the kiss itself. Edward hesitated to test himself, to see if this was safe, to make sure he was still in control of his need. And then his cold, marble lips pressed very softly against mine. What neither of us was prepared for was my response. Blood boiled under my skin, burned in my lips. My breath came in a wild gasp. My fingers knotted in his hair, clutching him to me. My lips parted as I breathed in his heady scent. Immediately I felt him turn to unresponsive stone beneath my lips. His hands gently, but with irresistible force, pushed my face back. I opened my eyes and saw his guarded expression. \"Oops,\" I breathed. \"That's an understatement.\" His eyes were wild, his jaw clenched in acute restraint, yet he didn't lapse from his perfect articulation. He held my face just inches from his. He dazzled my eyes. \"Should I\u2026 ?\" I tried to disengage myself, to give him some room. His hands refused to let me move so much as an inch. \"No, it's tolerable. Wait for a moment, please.\" His voice was polite, controlled. I kept my eyes on his, watched as the excitement in them faded and gentled. Then he smiled a surprisingly impish grin. \"There,\" he said, obviously pleased with himself. \"Tolerable?\" I asked. He laughed aloud. \"I'm stronger than I thought. It's nice to know.\" \"I wish I could say the same. I'm sorry.\" \"You are only human, after all.\" \"Thanks so much,\" I said, my voice acerbic. He was on his feet in one of his <em>lithe</em>, almost invisibly quick movements. He held out his hand to me, an unexpected gesture. I was so used to our standard of careful non-contact. I took his icy hand, needing the support more than I thought. My balance had not yet returned. \"Are you still faint from the run? Or was it my kissing expertise?\" How lighthearted, how human he seemed as he laughed now, his seraphic face untroubled. He was a different Edward than the one I had known. And I felt all the more besotted by him. It would cause me physical pain to be separated from him now. \"I can't be sure, I'm still woozy,\" I managed to respond. \"I think it's some of both, though.\" \"Maybe you should let me drive.\" \"Are you insane?\" I protested. \"I can drive better than you on your best day,\" he teased. \"You have much slower reflexes.\" \"I'm sure that's true, but I don't think my nerves, or my truck, could take it.\" \"Some trust, please, Bella.\" My hand was in my pocket, curled tightly around the key. I pursed my lips, deliberated, then shook my head with a tight grin. \"Nope. Not a chance.\" He raised his eyebrows in disbelief. I started to step around him, heading for the driver's side. He might have let me pass if I hadn't wobbled slightly. Then again, he might not have. His arm created an inescapable snare around my waist. \"Bella, I've already expended a great deal of personal effort at this point to keep you alive. I'm not about to let you behind the wheel of a vehicle when you can't even walk straight. Besides, friends don't let friends drive drunk,\" he quoted with a chuckle. I could smell the unbearably sweet fragrance coming off his chest. \"Drunk?\" I objected. \"You're intoxicated by my very presence.\" He was grinning that playful smirk again. \"I can't argue with that,\" I sighed.; I couldn't resist him in anything. I held the key high and dropped it, watching his hand flash like lightning to catch it soundlessly. \"Take it easy \u2014 my truck is a senior citizen.\" \"Very sensible,\" he approved. \"And are you not affected at all?\" I asked, irked. \"By my presence?\" Again his mobile features transformed, his expression became soft, warm. He didn't answer at first; he simply bent his face to mine, and brushed his lips slowly along my jaw, from my ear to my chin, back and forth. I trembled. \"Regardless,\" he finally murmured, \"I have better reflexes.\"",

            "en": "Ch\u1ea1ng V\u1ea1ng - Twilight             I'd never given much thought to how I would die \u2014 though I'd had reason enough in the last few months \u2014 but even if I had, I would not have imagined it like this. I stared without breathing across the long room, into the dark eyes of the hunter, and he looked pleasantly back at me. Surely it was a good way to die, in the place of someone else, someone I loved. Noble, even. That ought to count for something. I knew that if I'd never gone to Forks, I wouldn't be facing death now. But, terrified as I was, I couldn't bring myself to regret the decision. When life offers you a dream so far beyond any of your expectations, it's not reasonable to grieve when it comes to an end. The hunter smiled in a friendly way as he sauntered forward to kill me. 1.\u00a0 FIRST SIGHT My mother drove me to the airport with the windows rolled down. It was seventy-five degrees in Phoenix, the sky a perfect, cloudless blue. I was wearing my favorite shirt \u2014 sleeveless, white eyelet lace; I was wearing it as a farewell gesture. My carry-on item was a parka. In the Olympic Peninsula of northwest Washington State, a small town named Forks exists under a near-constant cover of clouds. It rains on this inconsequential town more than any other place in the United States of America. It was from this town and its gloomy, omnipresent shade that my mother escaped with me when I was only a few months old. It was in this town that I'd been compelled to spend a month every summer until I was fourteen. That was the year I finally put my foot down; these past three summers, my dad, Charlie, vacationed with me in California for two weeks instead.  It was to Forks that I now exiled myself\u2014 an action that I took with great horror. I detested Forks. I loved Phoenix. I loved the sun and the blistering heat. I loved the vigorous, sprawling city. \"Bella,\" my mom said to me \u2014 the last of a thousand times \u2014 before I got on the plane.\u201d You don't have to do this.\" My mom looks like me, except with short hair and laugh lines. I felt a spasm of panic as I stared at her wide, childlike eyes. How could I leave my loving, erratic, harebrained mother to fend for herself? Of course she had Phil now, so the bills would probably get paid, there would be food in the refrigerator, gas in her car, and someone to call when she got lost, but still\u2026 \"I want to go,\" I lied. I'd always been a bad liar, but I'd been saying this lie so frequently lately that it sounded almost convincing now. \"Tell Charlie I said hi.\" \"I will.\" \"I'll see you soon,\" she insisted.\u201d You can come home whenever you want \u2014 I'll come right back as soon as you need me.\" But I could see the sacrifice in her eyes behind the promise.  \"Don't worry about me,\" I urged.\u201d It'll be great. I love you, Mom.\" She hugged me tightly for a minute, and then I got on the plane, and she was gone. It's a four-hour flight from Phoenix to Seattle, another hour in a small plane up to Port Angeles, and then an hour drive back down to Forks. Flying doesn't bother me; the hour in the car with Charlie, though, I was a little worried about. Charlie had really been fairly nice about the whole thing. He seemed genuinely pleased that I was coming to live with him for the first time with any degree of permanence. He'd already gotten me registered for high school and was going to help me get a car. But it was sure to be awkward with Charlie. Neither of us was what anyone would call verbose, and I didn't know what there was to say regardless. I knew he was more than a little confused by my decision \u2014 like my mother before me, I hadn't made a secret of my distaste for Forks. When I landed in Port Angeles, it was raining. I didn't see it as an omen \u2014 just unavoidable. I'd already said my goodbyes to the sun. Charlie was waiting for me with the cruiser. This I was expecting, too.  Charlie is Police Chief Swan to the good people of Forks. My primary motivation behind buying a car, despite the scarcity of my funds, was that I refused to be driven around town in a car with red and blue lights on top. Nothing slows down traffic like a cop. Charlie gave me an awkward, one-armed hug when I stumbled my way off the plane. \"It's good to see you, Bells,\" he said, smiling as he automatically caught and steadied me.\u201d You haven't changed much. How's Ren\u00e9e?\" \"Mom's fine. It's good to see you, too, Dad.\" I wasn't allowed to call him Charlie to his face. I had only a few bags. Most of my Arizona clothes were too permeable for Washington. My mom and I had pooled our resources to supplement my winter wardrobe, but it was still scanty. It all fit easily into the trunk of the cruiser. \"I found a good car for you, really cheap,\" he announced when we were strapped in. \"What kind of car?\" I was suspicious of the way he said \"good car for you\" as opposed to just \"good car.\" \"Well, it's a truck actually, a Chevy.\" \"Where did you find it?\" \"Do you remember Billy Black down at La Push?\" La Push is the tiny Indian reservation on the coast. \"No.\" \"He used to go fishing with us during the summer,\" Charlie prompted.  That would explain why I didn't remember him. I do a good job of blocking painful, unnecessary things from my memory. \"He's in a wheelchair now,\" Charlie continued when I didn't respond, \"so he can't drive anymore, and he offered to sell me his truck cheap.\" \"What year is it?\" I could see from his change of expression that this was the question he was hoping I wouldn't ask. \"Well, Billy's done a lot of work on the engine \u2014 it's only a few years old, really.\" I hoped he didn't think so little of me as to believe I would give up that easily.\u201d When did he buy it?\" \"He bought it in 1984, I think.\" \"Did he buy it new?\" \"Well, no. I think it was new in the early sixties \u2014 or late fifties at the earliest,\" he admitted sheepishly. \"Ch \u2014 Dad, I don't really know anything about cars. I wouldn't be able to fix it if anything went wrong, and I couldn't afford a mechanic\u2026\" \"Really, Bella, the thing runs great. They don't build them like that anymore.\" The thing, I thought to myself\u2026 it had possibilities \u2014 as a nickname, at the very least. \"How cheap is cheap?\" After all, that was the part I couldn't compromise on. \"Well, honey, I kind of already bought it for you. As a homecoming gift.\" Charlie peeked sideways at me with a hopeful expression. Wow. Free. \"You didn't need to do that, Dad. I was going to buy myself a car.\" \"I don't mind. I want you to be happy here.\" He was looking ahead at the road when he said this. Charlie wasn't comfortable with expressing his emotions out loud. I inherited that from him. So I was looking straight ahead as I responded. \"That's really nice, Dad. Thanks. I really appreciate it.\" No need to add that my being happy in Forks is an impossibility. He didn't need to suffer along with me. And I never looked a free truck in the mouth \u2014 or engine. \"Well, now, you're welcome,\" he mumbled, embarrassed by my thanks.  We exchanged a few more comments on the weather, which was wet, and that was pretty much it for Conversation. We stared out the windows in silence. It was beautiful, of course; I couldn't deny that. Everything was green: the trees, their trunks covered with moss, their branches hanging with a canopy of it, the ground covered with ferns. Even the air filtered down greenly through the leaves. Eventually we made it to Charlie's. He still lived in the small, two-bedroom house that he'd bought with my mother in the early days of their marriage. Those were the only kind of days their marriage had \u2014 the early ones. There, parked on the street in front of the house that never changed, was my new \u2014 well, new to me \u2014 truck. It was a faded red color, with big, rounded fenders and a bulbous cab. To my intense surprise, I loved it. I didn't know if it would run, but I could see myself in it. Plus, it was one of those solid iron affairs that never gets damaged \u2014 the kind you see at the scene of an accident, paint unscratched, surrounded by the pieces of the foreign car it had destroyed. \"Wow, Dad, I love it! Thanks!\" Now my horrific day tomorrow would be just that much less dreadful. I wouldn't be faced with the choice of either walking two miles in the rain to school or accepting a ride in the Chief's cruiser. \"I'm glad you like it,\" Charlie said gruffly, embarrassed again. It took only one trip to get all my stuff upstairs. I got the west bedroom that faced out over the front yard. The room was familiar; it had been belonged to me since I was born. The wooden floor, the light blue walls, the peaked ceiling, the yellowed lace curtains around the window \u2014 these were all a part of my childhood. The only changes Charlie had ever made were switching the crib for a bed and adding a desk as I grew. The desk now held a secondhand computer, with the phone line for the modem stapled along the floor to the nearest phone jack. This was a stipulation from my mother, so that we could stay in touch easily. The rocking chair from my baby days was still in the corner. There was only one small bathroom at the top of the stairs, which I would have to share with Charlie. I was trying not to dwell too much on that fact. One of the best things about Charlie is he doesn't hover. He left me alone to unpack and get settled, a feat that would have been altogether impossible for my mother. It was nice to be alone, not to have to smile and look pleased; a relief to stare dejectedly out the window at the sheeting rain and let just a few tears escape. I wasn't in the mood to go on a real crying jag. I would save that for bedtime, when I would have to think about the coming morning. Forks High School had a frightening total of only three hundred and fifty-seven \u2014 now fifty-eight \u2014 students; there were more than seven hundred people in my junior class alone back home. All of the kids here had grown up together \u2014 their grandparents had been toddlers together. I would be the new girl from the big city, a curiosity, a freak. Maybe, if I looked like a girl from Phoenix should, I could work this to my advantage. But physically, I'd never fit in anywhere. I should be tan, sporty, blond \u2014 a volleyball player, or a cheerleader, perhaps \u2014 all the things that go with living in the valley of the sun. Instead, I was ivory-skinned, without even the excuse of blue eyes or red hair, despite the constant sunshine. I had always been slender, but soft somehow, obviously not an athlete; I didn't have the necessary hand-eye coordination to play sports without humiliating myself \u2014 and harming both myself and anyone else who stood too close. When I finished putting my clothes in the old pine dresser, I took my bag of bathroom necessities and went to the communal bathroom to clean myself up after the day of travel. I looked at my face in the mirror as I brushed through my tangled, damp hair. Maybe it was the light, but already I looked sallower, unhealthy. My skin could be pretty \u2014 it was very clear, almost translucent-looking \u2014 but it all depended on color. I had no color here. Facing my pallid reflection in the mirror, I was forced to admit that I was lying to myself. It wasn't just physically that I'd never fit in. And if I couldn't find a niche in a school with three thousand people, what were my chances here? I didn't relate well to people my age. Maybe the truth was that I didn't relate well to people, period. Even my mother, who I was closer to than anyone else on the planet, was never in harmony with me, never on exactly the same page. Sometimes I wondered if I was seeing the same things through my eyes that the rest of the world was seeing through theirs. Maybe there was a glitch in my brain. But the cause didn't matter. All that mattered was the effect. And tomorrow would be just the beginning.  I didn't sleep well that night, even after I was done crying. The constant whooshing of the rain and wind across the roof wouldn't fade into the background. I pulled the faded old quilt over my head, and later added the pillow, too. But I couldn't fall asleep until after midnight, when the rain finally settled into a quieter drizzle. Thick fog was all I could see out my window in the morning, and I could feel the \u00a0claustrophobia creeping up on me. You could never see the sky here; it was like a cage. Breakfast with Charlie was a quiet event. He wished me good luck at school. I thanked him, knowing his hope was wasted. Good luck tended to avoid me. Charlie left first, off to the police station that was his wife and family. After he left, I sat at the old square oak table in one of the three unmatching chairs and examined his small kitchen, with its dark paneled walls, bright yellow cabinets, and white linoleum floor. Nothing was changed. My mother had painted the cabinets eighteen years ago in an attempt to bring some sunshine into the house. Over the small fireplace in the adjoining handkerchief-sized family room was a row of pictures. First a wedding picture of Charlie and my mom in Las Vegas, then one of the three of us in the hospital after I was born, taken by a helpful nurse, followed by the procession of my school pictures up to last year's. Those were embarrassing to look at \u2014 I would have to see what I could do to get Charlie to put them somewhere else, at least while I was living here. It was impossible, being in this house, not to realize that Charlie had never gotten over my mom. It made me uncomfortable. I didn't want to be too early to school, but I couldn't stay in the house anymore. I donned my jacket \u2014 which had the feel of a biohazard suit \u2014 and headed out into the rain. It was just drizzling still, not enough to soak me through immediately as I reached for the house key that was always hidden under the eaves by the door, and locked up. The sloshing of my new waterproof boots was unnerving. I missed the normal crunch of gravel as I walked. I couldn't pause and admire my truck again as I wanted; I was in a hurry to get out of the misty wet that swirled around my head and clung to my hair under my hood. Inside the truck, it was nice and dry. Either Billy or Charlie had obviously cleaned it up, but the tan upholstered seats still smelled faintly of tobacco, gasoline, and peppermint. The engine started quickly, to my relief, but loudly, roaring to life and then idling at top volume. Well, a truck this old was bound to have a flaw. The antique radio worked, a plus that I hadn't expected. Finding the school wasn't difficult, though I'd never been there before. The school was, like most other things, just off the highway. It was not obvious that it was a school; only the sign, which declared it to be the Forks High School, made me stop. It looked like a collection of matching houses, built with maroon-colored bricks. There were so many trees and shrubs I couldn't see its size at first. Where was the feel of the institution? I wondered nostalgically. Where were the chain-link fences, the metal detectors? I parked in front of the first building, which had a small sign over the door reading front office. No one else was parked there, so I was sure it was off limits, but I decided I would get directions inside instead of circling around in the rain like an idiot. I stepped unwillingly out of the toasty truck cab and walked down a little stone path lined with dark hedges. I took a deep breath before opening the door.  Inside, it was brightly lit, and warmer than I'd hoped. The office was small; a little waiting area with padded folding chairs, orange-flecked commercial carpet, notices and awards cluttering the walls, a big clock ticking loudly. Plants grew everywhere in large plastic pots, as if there wasn't enough greenery outside. The room was cut in half by a long counter, cluttered with wire baskets full of papers and brightly colored flyers taped to its front. There were three desks behind the counter, one of which was manned by a large, red-haired woman wearing glasses. She was wearing a purple t-shirt, which immediately made me feel overdressed. The red-haired woman looked up.\u201d Can I help you?\" \"I'm Isabella Swan,\" I informed her, and saw the immediate awareness light her eyes. I was expected, a topic of gossip no doubt. Daughter of the Chief's flighty ex-wife, come home at last. \"Of course,\" she said. She dug through a precariously stacked pile of documents on her desk till she found the ones she was looking for.\u201d I have your schedule right here, and a map of the school.\" She brought several sheets to the counter to show me. She went through my classes for me, highlighting the best route to each on the map, and gave me a slip to have each teacher sign, which I was to bring back at the end of the day. She smiled at me and hoped, like Charlie, that I would like it here in Forks. I smiled back as convincingly as I could. When I went back out to my truck, other students were starting to arrive. I drove around the school, following the line of traffic. I was glad to see that most of the cars were older like mine, nothing flashy. At home I'd lived in one of the few lower-income neighborhoods that were included in the Paradise Valley District. It was a common thing to see a new Mercedes or Porsche in the student lot. The nicest car here was a shiny Volvo, and it stood out. Still, I cut the engine as soon as I was in a spot, so that the thunderous volume wouldn't draw attention to me. I looked at the map in the truck, trying to memorize it now; hopefully I wouldn't have to walk around with it stuck in front of my nose all day. I stuffed everything in my bag, slung the strap over my shoulder, and sucked in a huge breath. I can do this, I lied to myself feebly. No one was going to bite me. I finally exhaled and stepped out of the truck.  I kept my face pulled back into my hood as I walked to the sidewalk, crowded with teenagers. My plain black jacket didn't stand out, I noticed with relief. Once I got around the cafeteria, building three was easy to spot. A large black \"3\" was painted on a white square on the east corner. I felt my breathing gradually creeping toward hyperventilation as I approached the door. I tried holding my breath as I followed two unisex raincoats through the door.  The classroom was small. The people in front of me stopped just inside the door to hang up their coats on a long row of hooks. I copied them.  They were two girls, one a porcelain-colored blonde, the other also pale, with light brown hair. At least my skin wouldn't be a standout here.  I took the slip up to the teacher, a tall, balding man whose desk had a nameplate identifying him as Mr. Mason. He gawked at me when he saw my name \u2014 not an encouraging response \u2014 and of course I flushed tomato red. But at least he sent me to an empty desk at the back without introducing me to the class. It was harder for my new classmates to stare at me in the back, but somehow, they managed. I kept my eyes down on the reading list the teacher had given me. It was fairly basic: Bronte, Shakespeare, Chaucer, Faulkner. I'd already read everything. That was comforting\u2026 and boring. I wondered if my mom would send me my folder of old essays, or if she would think that was cheating. I went through different arguments with her in my head while the teacher droned on. When the bell rang, a nasal buzzing sound, a gangly boy with skin problems and hair black as an oil slick leaned across the aisle to talk to me. \"You're Isabella Swan, aren't you?\" He looked like the overly helpful, chess club type. \"Bella,\" I corrected. Everyone within a three-seat radius turned to look at me. \"Where's your next class?\" he asked.  I had to check in my bag.\u201d Um, Government, with Jefferson, in building six.\" There was nowhere to look without meeting curious eyes.  \"I'm headed toward building four, I could show you the way\u2026\" Definitely over-helpful.\u201d I'm Eric,\" he added. I smiled tentatively.\u201d Thanks.\" We got our jackets and headed out into the rain, which had picked up. I could have sworn several people behind us were walking close enough to eavesdrop. I hoped I wasn't getting paranoid. \"So, this is a lot different than Phoenix, huh?\" he asked. \"Very.\" \"It doesn't rain much there, does it?\" \"Three or four times a year.\" \"Wow, what must that be like?\" he wondered. \"Sunny,\" I told him. \"You don't look very tan.\" \"My mother is part albino.\" He studied my face apprehensively, and I sighed. It looked like clouds and a sense of humor didn't mix. A few months of this and I'd forget how to use sarcasm. We walked back around the cafeteria, to the south buildings by the gym. Eric walked me right to the door, though it was clearly marked. \"Well, good luck,\" he said as I touched the handle.\u201d Maybe we'll have some other classes together.\" He sounded hopeful. I smiled at him vaguely and went inside.  The rest of the morning passed in about the same fashion. My Trigonometry teacher, Mr. Varner, who I would have hated anyway just because of the subject he taught, was the only one who made me stand in front of the class and introduce myself. I stammered, blushed, and tripped over my own boots on the way to my seat. After two classes, I started to recognize several of the faces in each class. There was always someone braver than the others who would introduce themselves and ask me questions about how I was liking Forks. I tried to be diplomatic, but mostly I just lied a lot. At least I never needed the map. One girl sat next to me in both Trig and Spanish, and she walked with me to the cafeteria for lunch. She was tiny, several inches shorter than my five feet four inches, but her wildly curly dark hair made up a lot of the difference between our heights. I couldn't remember her name, so I smiled and nodded as she prattled about teachers and classes. I didn't try to keep up. We sat at the end of a full table with several of her friends, who she introduced to me. I forgot all their names as soon as she spoke them. They seemed impressed by her bravery in speaking to me. The boy from English, Eric, waved at me from across the room. It was there, sitting in the lunchroom, trying to make conversation with seven curious strangers, that I first saw them. They were sitting in the corner of the cafeteria, as far away from where I sat as possible in the long room. There were five of them. They weren't talking, and they weren't eating, though they each had a tray of untouched food in front of them. They weren't gawking at me, unlike most of the other students, so it was safe to stare at them without fear of meeting an excessively interested pair of eyes. But it was none of these things that caught, and held, my attention. They didn't look anything alike. Of the three boys, one was big \u2014 muscled like a serious weight lifter, with dark, curly hair. Another was taller, leaner, but still muscular, and honey blond. The last was lanky, less bulky, with untidy, bronze-colored hair. He was more boyish than the others, who looked like they could be in college, or even teachers here rather than students. The girls were opposites. The tall one was statuesque. She had a beautiful figure, the kind you saw on the cover of the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue, the kind that made every girl around her take a hit on her self-esteem just by being in the same room. Her hair was golden, gently waving to the middle of her back. The short girl was pixielike, thin in the extreme, with small features. Her hair was a deep black, cropped short and pointing in every direction. And yet, they were all exactly alike. Every one of them was chalky pale, the palest of all the students living in this sunless town. Paler than me, the albino. They all had very dark eyes despite the range in hair tones. They also had dark shadows under those eyes \u2014 purplish, bruiselike shadows. As if they were all suffering from a sleepless night, or almost\u00a0 done recovering from a broken nose. Though their noses, all their features, were straight, perfect, angular.  But all this is not why I couldn't look away. I stared because their faces, so different, so similar, were all devastatingly, inhumanly beautiful. They were faces you never expected to see except perhaps on the airbrushed pages of a fashion magazine. Or painted by an old master as the face of an angel. It was hard to decide who was the most beautiful \u2014 maybe the perfect blond girl, or the bronze-haired boy. They were all looking away \u2014 away from each other, away from the other students, away from anything in particular as far as I could tell. As I watched, the small girl rose with her tray \u2014 unopened soda, unbitten apple \u2014 and walked away with a quick, graceful lope that belonged on a runway. I watched, amazed at her <em>lithe</em> dancer's step, till she dumped her tray and glided through the back door, faster than I would have thought possible. My eyes darted back to the others, who sat unchanging. \"Who are they?\" I asked the girl from my Spanish class, whose name I'd forgotten. As she looked up to see who I meant \u2014 though already knowing, probably, from my tone \u2014 suddenly he looked at her, the thinner one, the boyish one, the youngest, perhaps. He looked at my neighbor for just a fraction of a second, and then his dark eyes flickered to mine. He looked away quickly, more quickly than I could, though in a flush of embarrassment I dropped my eyes at once. In that brief flash of a glance, his face held nothing of interest \u2014 it was as if she had called his name, and he'd looked up in involuntary response, already having decided not to answer.  My neighbor giggled in embarrassment, looking at the table like I did.  \"That's Edward and Emmett Cullen, and Rosalie and Jasper Hale. The one who left was Alice Cullen; they all live together with Dr. Cullen and his wife.\" She said this under her breath. I glanced sideways at the beautiful boy, who was looking at his tray now, picking a bagel to pieces with long, pale fingers. His mouth was moving very quickly, his perfect lips barely opening.  The other three still looked away, and yet I felt he was speaking quietly to them. Strange, unpopular names, I thought. The kinds of names grandparents had.  But maybe that was in vogue here \u2014 small town names? I finally remembered that my neighbor was called Jessica, a perfectly common name. There were two girls named Jessica in my History class back home. \"They are\u2026 very nice-looking.\" I struggled with the conspicuous understatement. \"Yes!\" Jessica agreed with another giggle.\u201d They're all together though \u2014 Emmett and Rosalie, and Jasper and Alice, I mean. And they live together.\" Her voice held all the shock and condemnation of the small town, I thought critically. But, if I was being honest, I had to admit that even in Phoenix, it would cause gossip. \"Which ones are the Cullens?\" I asked.\u201d They don't look related\u2026\" \"Oh, they're not. Dr. Cullen is really young, in his twenties or early thirties. They're all adopted. The Hales are brother and sister, twins \u2014 the blondes \u2014 and they're foster children.\" \"They look a little old for foster children.\" \"They are now, Jasper and Rosalie are both eighteen, but they've been with Mrs. Cullen since they were eight. She's their aunt or something like that.\" \"That's really kind of nice \u2014 for them to take care of all those kids like that, when they're so young and everything.\" \"I guess so,\" Jessica admitted reluctantly, and I got the impression that she didn't like the doctor and his wife for some reason. With the glances she was throwing at their adopted children, I would presume the reason was jealousy.\u201d I think that Mrs. Cullen can't have any kids, though,\" she added, as if that lessened their kindness. Throughout all this conversation, my eyes flickered again and again to the table where the strange family sat. They continued to look at the walls and not eat. \"Have they always lived in Forks?\" I asked. Surely I would have noticed them on one of my summers here. \"No,\" she said in a voice that implied it should be obvious, even to a new arrival like me.\u201d They just moved down two years ago from somewhere in Alaska.\" I felt a surge of pity, and relief. Pity because, as beautiful as they were, they were outsiders, clearly not accepted. Relief that I wasn't the only newcomer here, and certainly not the most interesting by any standard. As I examined them, the youngest, one of the Cullens, looked up and met my gaze, this time with evident curiosity in his expression. As I looked swiftly away, it seemed to me that his glance held some kind of unmet expectation. \"Which one is the boy with the reddish brown hair?\" I asked. I peeked at him from the corner of my eye, and he was still staring at me, but not gawking like the other students had today \u2014 he had a slightly frustrated expression. I looked down again. \"That's Edward. He's gorgeous, of course, but don't waste your time. He doesn't date. Apparently none of the girls here are good-looking enough for him.\" She sniffed, a clear case of sour grapes. I wondered when he'd turned her down. I bit my lip to hide my smile. Then I glanced at him again. His face was turned away, but I thought his cheek appeared lifted, as if he were smiling, too. After a few more minutes, the four of them left the table together. They all were noticeably graceful \u2014 even the big, brawny one. It was unsettling to watch. The one named Edward didn't look at me again. I sat at the table with Jessica and her friends longer than I would have if I'd been sitting alone. I was anxious not to be late for class on my first day. One of my new acquaintances, who considerately reminded me that her name was Angela, had Biology II with me the next hour. We walked to class together in silence. She was shy, too. When we entered the classroom, Angela went to sit at a black-topped lab table exactly like the ones I was used to. She already had a neighbor. In fact, all the tables were filled but one. Next to the center aisle, I recognized Edward Cullen by his unusual hair, sitting next to that single open seat.  As I walked down the aisle to introduce myself to the teacher and get my slip signed, I was watching him surreptitiously. Just as I passed, he suddenly went rigid in his seat. He stared at me again, meeting my eyes with the strangest expression on his face \u2014 it was hostile, furious. I looked away quickly, shocked, going red again. I stumbled over a book in the walkway and had to catch myself on the edge of a table. The girl sitting there giggled. I'd noticed that his eyes were black \u2014 coal black. Mr. Banner signed my slip and handed me a book with no nonsense about introductions. I could tell we were going to get along. Of course, he had no choice but to send me to the one open seat in the middle of the room. I kept my eyes down as I went to sit by him, bewildered by the antagonistic stare he'd given me. I didn't look up as I set my book on the table and took my seat, but I saw his posture change from the corner of my eye. He was leaning away from me, sitting on the extreme edge of his chair and averting his face like he smelled something bad. Inconspicuously, I sniffed my hair. It smelled like strawberries, the scent of my favorite shampoo. It seemed an innocent enough odor. I let my hair fall over my right shoulder, making a dark curtain between us, and tried to pay attention to the teacher. Unfortunately the lecture was on cellular anatomy, something I'd already studied. I took notes carefully anyway, always looking down. I couldn't stop myself from peeking occasionally through the screen of my hair at the strange boy next to me. During the whole class, he never relaxed his stiff position on the edge of his chair, sitting as far from me as possible. I could see his hand on his left leg was clenched into a fist, tendons standing out under his pale skin. This, too, he never relaxed. He had the long sleeves of his white shirt pushed up to his elbows, and his forearm was surprisingly hard and muscular beneath his light skin. He wasn't nearly as slight as he'd looked next to his burly brother. The class seemed to drag on longer than the others. Was it because the day was finally coming to a close, or because I was waiting for his tight fist to loosen? It never did; he continued to sit so still it looked like he wasn't breathing. What was wrong with him? Was this his normal behavior? I questioned my judgment on Jessica's bitterness at lunch today. Maybe she was not as resentful as I'd thought.  It couldn't have anything to do with me. He didn't know me from Eve.  I peeked up at him one more time, and regretted it. He was glaring down at me again, his black eyes full of revulsion. As I flinched away from him, shrinking against my chair, the phrase if looks could kill suddenly ran through my mind. At that moment, the bell rang loudly, making me jump, and Edward Cullen was out of his seat. Fluidly he rose \u2014 he was much taller than I'd thought \u2014 his back to me, and he was out the door before anyone else was out of their seat. I sat frozen in my seat, staring blankly after him. He was so mean. It wasn't fair. I began gathering up my things slowly, trying to block the anger that filled me, for fear my eyes would tear up. For some reason, my temper was hardwired to my tear ducts. I usually cried when I was angry, a humiliating tendency. \"Aren't you Isabella Swan?\" a male voice asked. I looked up to see a cute, baby-faced boy, his pale blond hair carefully gelled into orderly spikes, smiling at me in a friendly way. He obviously didn't think I smelled bad. \"Bella,\" I corrected him, with a smile. \"I'm Mike.\" \"Hi, Mike.\" \"Do you need any help finding your next class?\" \"I'm headed to the gym, actually. I think I can find it.\" \"That's my next class, too.\" He seemed thrilled, though it wasn't that big of a coincidence in a school this small. We walked to class together; he was a chatterer \u2014 he supplied most of the conversation, which made it easy for me. He'd lived in California till he was ten, so he knew how I felt about the sun. It turned out he was in my English class also. He was the nicest person I'd met today. But as we were entering the gym, he asked, \"So, did you stab Edward Cullen with a pencil or what? I've never seen him act like that.\" I cringed. So I wasn't the only one who had noticed. And, apparently, that wasn't Edward Cullen's usual behavior. I decided to play dumb. \"Was that the boy I sat next to in Biology?\" I asked artlessly. \"Yes,\" he said.\u201d He looked like he was in pain or something.\" \"I don't know,\" I responded.\u201d I never spoke to him.\" \"He's a weird guy.\" Mike lingered by me instead of heading to the dressing room.\u201d If I were lucky enough to sit by you, I would have talked to you.\" I smiled at him before walking through the girls' locker room door. He was friendly and clearly admiring. But it wasn't enough to ease my irritation. The Gym teacher, Coach Clapp, found me a uniform but didn't make me dress down for today's class. At home, only two years of RE. were required. Here, P.E. was mandatory all four years. Forks was literally my personal hell on Earth. I watched four volleyball games running simultaneously. Remembering how many injuries I had sustained \u2014 and inflicted \u2014 playing volleyball, I felt faintly nauseated. The final bell rang at last. I walked slowly to the office to return my paperwork. The rain had drifted away, but the wind was strong, and colder. I wrapped my arms around myself. When I walked into the warm office, I almost turned around and walked back out. Edward Cullen stood at the desk in front of me. I recognized again that tousled bronze hair. He didn't appear to notice the sound of my entrance. I stood pressed against the back wall, waiting for the receptionist to be free. He was arguing with her in a low, attractive voice. I quickly picked up the gist of the argument. He was trying to trade from sixth-hour Biology to another time \u2014 any other time. I just couldn't believe that this was about me. It had to be something else, something that happened before I entered the Biology room. The look on his face must have been about another aggravation entirely. It was impossible that this stranger could take such a sudden, intense dislike to me. The door opened again, and the cold wind suddenly gusted through the room, rustling the papers on the desk, swirling my hair around my face. The girl who came in merely stepped to the desk, placed a note in the wire basket, and walked out again. But Edward Cullen's back stiffened, and he turned slowly to glare at me \u2014 his face was absurdly handsome \u2014 with piercing, hate-filled eyes. For an instant, I felt a thrill of genuine fear, raising the hair on my arms. The look only lasted a second, but it chilled me more than the freezing wind. He turned back to the receptionist. \"Never mind, then,\" he said hastily in a voice like velvet.\u201d I can see that it's impossible. Thank you so much for your help.\" And he turned on his heel without another look at me, and disappeared out the door. I went meekly to the desk, my face white for once instead of red, and handed her the signed slip. \"How did your first day go, dear?\" the receptionist asked maternally. \"Fine,\" I lied, my voice weak. She didn't look convinced. When I got to the truck, it was almost the last car in the lot. It seemed like a haven, already the closest thing to home I had in this damp green hole. I sat inside for a while, just staring out the windshield blankly. But soon I was cold enough to need the heater, so I turned the key and the engine roared to life. I headed back to Charlie's house, fighting tears the whole way there.",
