The survival of these graphic motifs can likely be attributed to their isolation for hundreds of years in the region\u2019s once-thick forest, only rediscovered by Englishman Captain TS <em>Burt</em> in 1838.   In fact, <em>Burt</em> himself had to be persuaded by his Indian attendants to make the journey; he didn\u2019t believe anything of interest would be found at the remote spot. These charmed temples have also managed to evade the wrath of India\u2019s moral police, who in recent years banned or destroyed a range of cultural artefacts, ranging from Salman Rushdie\u2019s books to MF Hussain\u2019s paintings.",
