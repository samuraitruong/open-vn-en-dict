Devised almost 50 years ago as a unit of account for the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the SDR is a notional basket of major currencies including the US dollar, the euro, the yen and the British pound. <em>Unsurprisingly</em>, given its inconvenience, the idea never caught on, and the SDR lapsed into well-deserved obscurity, universally ignored outside the rarefied economic atmosphere of the IMF\u2019s offices.",

Tim saw the flummoxed fish while out free diving in Byron Bay with a friend. Nobody quite knows how it managed to get in there (alcohol may have been involved) but despite its obvious disadvantage, the fish was still able to control the movements of the equally hapless jellyfish. <em>Unsurprisingly</em>, Sam says he\u2019s never seen anything quite like this during his five years as a photographer.
