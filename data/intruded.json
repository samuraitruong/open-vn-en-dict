            "en": "7 REPETITION         17. VISITOR UNNATURALLY STILL AND WHITE, WITH LARGE BLACK EYES intent on my face, my visitor waited perfectly motionless in the center of the hall, beautiful beyond imagining. My knees trembled for a second, and I nearly fell. Then I hurled myself at her. \"Alice, oh, Alice!\" I cried, as I slammed into her. I'd forgotten how hard she was; it was like running headlong into a wall of cement. \"Bella?\" There was a strange mingling of relief and confusion in her voice. I locked my arms around her, gasping to inhale as much of the scent of her skin as possible. It wasn't like anything else\u2014not floral or spice, citrus or musk. No perfume in the world could compare. My memory hadn't done it justice. I didn't notice when the gasping turned into something else\u2014I only realized I was sobbing when Alice dragged me to the living room couch and pulled me into her lap. It was like curling up into a cool stone, but a stone that was contoured comfortingly to the shape of my body. She rubbed my back in a gentle rhythm, waiting for me to get control of myself. \"I'm\u2026 sorry,\" I blubbered. \"I'm just\u2026 so happy\u2026 to see you!\" \"It's okay, Bella. Everything's okay.\" \"Yes,\" I bawled. And, for once, it seemed that way. Alice sighed. \"I'd forgotten how exuberant you are,\" she said, and her tone was disapproving. I looked up at her through my streaming eyes. Alice's neck was tight, straining away from me, her lips pressed together firmly. Her eyes were black as pitch. \"Oh,\" I puffed, as I realized the problem. She was thirsty. And I smelled appetizing. It had been a while since I'd had to think about that kind of thing. \"Sorry.\" \"It's my own fault. It's been too long since I hunted. I shouldn't let myself get so thirsty. But I was in a hurry today.\" The look she directed at me then was a glare. \"Speaking of which, would you like to explain to me how you're alive?\" That brought me up short and stopped the sobs. I realized what must have happened immediately, and why Alice was here. I swallowed loudly. \"You saw me fall.\" \"No,\" she disagreed, her eyes narrowing. \"I saw you jump.\" I pursed my lips as I tried to think of an explanation that wouldn't sound nuts. Alice shook her head. \"I told him this would happen, but he didn't believe me. 'Bella promised,'\" her voice imitated his so perfectly that I froze in shock while the pain ripped through my torso. \"'Don't be looking for her future, either,'\" she continued to quote him. '\"We've done enough damage.\" \"But just because I'm not looking, doesn't mean I don't see\" she went on. \"I wasn't \u00a0keeping tabs on you,\u00a0 I swear, Bella. It's just that I'm already attuned to you\u2026 when I saw you jumping, I didn't think, I just got on a plane. I knew I would be too late, but I couldn't do nothing. And then I get here, thinking maybe I could help Charlie somehow, and you drive up.\" She shook her head, this time in confusion. Her voice was strained. \"I saw you go into the water and I waited and waited for you to come up, but you didn't. \u00a0\u00a0What happened? And how could you do that to Charlie? Did you stop to think what this would do to him? And my brother? Do you have any idea what Edward\u2014\" I cut her off then, as soon as she said his name. I'd let her go on, even after I realized the misunderstanding she was under, just to hear the perfect bell tone of her voice. But it was time to interrupt. \"Alice, I wasn't committing suicide.\" She eyed me dubiously. \"Are you saying you didn't jump off a cliff?\" \"No, but\u2026\" I grimaced. \"It was for recreational purposes only.\" Her expression hardened. \"I'd seen some of Jacob's friends cliff diving,\" I insisted. \"It looked like\u2026 fun, and I was bored\u2026\" She waited. \"I didn't think about how the storm would affect the currents. Actually, I didn't think about the water much at all.\" Alice didn't buy it. I could see that she still thought I had been trying to kill myself. I decided to redirect. \"So if you saw me go in, why didn't you see Jacob?\" She cocked her head to the side, distracted. I continued. \"It's true that I probably would have drowned if Jacob hadn't jumped in after me. Well, okay, there's no probably about it. But he did, and he pulled me out, and I guess he towed me back to shore, though I was kind of out for that part. It couldn't have been more than a minute that I was under before he grabbed me. How come you didn't see that?\" She frowned in perplexity. \"Someone pulled you out?\" \"Yes. Jacob saved me.\" I watched curiously as an enigmatic range of emotions flitted across her face. Something was bothering her\u2014her imperfect vision? But I wasn't sure. Then she deliberately leaned in and sniffed my shoulder. I froze. \"Don't be ridiculous,\" she muttered, sniffing at me some more. \"What are you doing?\" She ignored my question. \"Who was with you out there just now? It sounded like you were arguing.\" \"Jacob Black. He's\u2026 sort of my best friend, I guess. At least, he was\u2026\" I thought of Jacob's angry, betrayed face, and wondered what he was to me now. Alice nodded, seeming preoccupied. \"What?\" \"I don't know,\" she said. \"I'm not sure what it means.\" \"Well, I'm not dead, at least.\" She rolled her eyes. \"He was a fool to think you could survive alone. I've never seen anyone so prone to life-threatening idiocy.\" \"I survived,\" I pointed out. She was thinking of something else. \"So, if the currents were too much for you, how did this Jacob manage?\" \"Jacob is\u2026 strong.\" She heard the reluctance in my voice, and her eyebrows rose. I gnawed on my lip for a second. Was this a secret, or not? And if it was, then who was my greatest allegiance to? Jacob, or Alice? It was too hard to keep secrets, I decided. Jacob knew everything, why not Alice, too? \"See, well, he's\u2026 sort of a werewolf,\" I admitted in a rush. \"The Quileutes turn into \u00a0wolves when there are vampires around. They know Carlisle from a long time ago. Were you with Carlisle back then?\" Alice gawked at me for a moment, and then recovered herself, blinking rapidly. \"Well, I guess that explains the smell,\" she muttered. \"But does it explain what I didn't see?\" She frowned, her porcelain forehead creasing. \"The smell?\" I repeated. \"You smell awful,\" she said absently, still frowning. \"A werewolf? Are you sure about that?\"  \"Very sure,\" I promised, wincing as I remembered Paul and Jacob fighting in the road. \"I guess you weren't with Carlisle the last time there were werewolves here in Forks?\" \"No. I hadn't found him yet.\" Alice was still lost in thought. Suddenly, her eyes widened, and she turned to stare at me with a shocked expression. \"Your best friend is a \u00a0werewolf?\" I nodded sheepishly. \"How long has this been going on?\" \"Not long,\" I said, my voice sounding defensive. \"He's only been a werewolf for just a few weeks.\" She glowered at me. \"A young werewolf? Even worse! Edward was right\u2014you're a magnet for danger. Weren't you supposed to be staying out of trouble?\" \"There's nothing wrong with werewolves,\" I grumbled, stung by her critical tone. \"Until they lose their tempers.\" She shook her head sharply from side to side. \"Leave it to you, Bella.  Anyone else would be better off when the vampires left town. But you have to start hanging out with the first monsters you can find.\" I didn't want to argue with Alice\u2014I was still trembling with joy that she was really, truly here, that I could touch her marble skin and hear her wind-chime voice\u2014but she had it all wrong. \"No, Alice, the vampires didn't really leave\u2014not all of them, anyway. That's the whole trouble. If it weren't for the werewolves, Victoria would have gotten me by now. Well, if it weren't for Jake and his friends, Laurent would have gotten me before she could, I guess, so\u2014\" \"Victoria?\" she hissed. \"Laurent?\" I nodded, a teensy bit alarmed by the expression in her black eyes. I pointed at my chest. \"Danger magnet, remember?\" She shook her head again. \"Tell me everything\u2014start at the beginning.\" I glossed over the beginning, skipping the motorcycles and the voices, but telling her everything else right up to today's misadventure. Alice didn't like my thin explanation about boredom and the cliffs, so I hurried on to the strange flame I'd seen on the water and what I thought it meant. Her eyes narrowed almost to slits at that part. It was strange to see her look so\u2026 so dangerous\u2014like a vampire. I swallowed hard and went on with the rest about Harry. She listened to my story without interrupting. Occasionally, she would shake her head, and the crease in her forehead deepened until it looked like it was carved permanently into the marble of her skin. She didn't speak and, finally, I fell quiet, struck again by the borrowed grief at Harry's passing. I thought of Charlie; he would be home soon. What condition would he be in? \"Our leaving didn't do you any good at all, did it?\" Alice murmured. I laughed once\u2014it was a slightly hysterical sound. \"That was never the point, though, was it? It's not like you left for my benefit.\" Alice scowled at the floor for a moment. \"Well\u2026 I guess I acted impulsively today. I probably shouldn't have <em>intruded</em>.\" I could feel the blood draining from my face. My stomach dropped. \"Don't go, Alice,\" I whispered. My fingers locked around the collar of her white shirt and I began to hyperventilate. \"Please don't leave me.\" Her eyes opened wider. \"All right,\" she said, enunciating each word with slow precision. \"I'm not going anywhere tonight. Take a deep breath.\" I tried to obey, though I couldn't quite locate my lungs. She watched my face while I concentrated on my breathing. She waited till I was calmer to comment.  \"You look like hell, Bella.\" \"I drowned today,\" I reminded her. \"It goes deeper than that. You're a mess.\" I flinched. \"Look, I'm doing my best.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"It hasn't been easy. I'm working on it.\" She frowned. \"I told him,\" she said to herself. \"Alice,\" I sighed. \"What did you think you were going to find? I mean, besides me dead? Did you expect to find me skipping around and whistling show tunes? You know me better than that.\" \"I do. But I hoped.\" \"Then I guess I don't have the corner on the idiocy market.\" The phone rang. \"That has to be Charlie,\" I said, staggering to my feet. I grabbed Alice's stone hand and dragged her with me to the kitchen. I wasn't about to let her out of my sight. \"Charlie?\" I answered the phone. \"No, it's me,\" Jacob said. \"Jake!\" Alice scrutinized my expression. \"Just making sure you were still alive,\" Jacob said sourly. \"I'm fine. I told you that it wasn't\u2014\" \"Yeah. I got it. 'Bye.\" Jacob hung up on me. I sighed and let my head hang back, staring at the ceiling. \"That's going to be a problem.\" Alice squeezed my hand. \"They aren't excited I'm here.\" \"Not especially. But it's none of their business anyway.\" Alice put her arm around me. \"So what do we do now?\" she mused. She seemed to talk to herself for a moment. \"Things to do. Loose ends to tie.\" \"What things to do?\" Her face was suddenly careful. \"I don't know for sure\u2026 I need to see Carlisle.\" Would she leave so soon? My stomach dropped. \"Could you stay?\" I begged. \"Please? For just a little while. I've missed you so much.\" My voice broke. \"If you think that's a good idea.\" Her eyes were unhappy. \"I do. You can stay here\u2014Charlie would love that.\" \"I have a house, Bella.\" I nodded, disappointed but resigned. She hesitated, studying me. \"Well, I need to go get a suitcase of clothes, at the very least.\" I threw my arms around her. \"Alice, you're the best!\" \"And I think I'll need to hunt. Immediately,\" she added in a strained voice. \"Oops.\" I took a step back. \"Can you stay out of trouble for one hour?\" she asked skeptically. Then, before I could \u00a0answer, she held up one finger and closed her eyes. Her face went smooth and blank for a few seconds. And then her eyes opened and she answered her own question. \"Yes, you'll be fine. For tonight, anyway.\" She grimaced. Even making faces, she looked like an angel. \"You'll come back?\" I asked in a small voice. \"I promise\u2014one hour.\" I glanced at the clock over the kitchen table. She laughed and leaned in quickly to kiss me on the cheek. Then she was gone. I took a deep breath. Alice would be back. I suddenly felt so much better. I had plenty to do to keep myself busy while I waited. A shower was definitely first on the agenda. I sniffed my shoulders as I undressed, but I couldn't smell anything but the brine and seaweed scent of the ocean. I wondered what Alice had meant about me smelling bad. When I was cleaned up, I went back to the kitchen. I couldn't see any signs that Charlie had eaten recently, and he would probably be hungry when he got back. I hummed tunelessly to myself as I moved around the kitchen. While Thursday's casserole rotated in the microwave, I made up the couch with sheets and an old pillow. Alice wouldn't need it, but Charlie would need to see it. I was careful not to watch the clock. There was no reason to start myself panicking; Alice had promised. I hurried through my dinner, not tasting it\u2014just feeling the ache as it slid down my raw throat. Mostly I was thirsty; I must have drunk a half gallon of water by the time I was finished. All the salt in my system had dehydrated me. I went to go try to watch TV while I waited. Alice was already there, sitting on her improvised bed. Her eyes were a liquid butterscotch. She smiled and patted the pillow. \"Thanks.\" \"You're early,\" I said, elated. I sat down next to her and leaned my head on her shoulder. She put her cold arms around me and sighed. \"Bella. What are we going to do with you?\" \"I don't know,\" I admitted. \"I really have been trying my hardest.\" \"I believe you.\" It was silent. \"Does\u2014does he\u2026\" I took a deep breath. It was harder to say his name out loud, even though I was able to think it now. \"Does Edward know you're here?\" I couldn't help asking. It was my pain, after all. I'd deal with it when she was gone, I promised myself, and felt sick at the thought. \"No.\" There was only one way that could be true. \"He's not with Carlisle and Esme?\" \"He checks in every few months.\" \"Oh.\" He must still be out enjoying his distractions. I focused my curiosity on a safer topic. \"You said you flew here\u2026 Where did you come from?\" \"I was in Denali. Visiting Tanya's family.\" \"Is Jasper here? Did he come with your'\" She shook her head. \"He didn't approve of my interfering. We promised\u2026\" she trailed off, and then her tone changed. \"And you think Charlie won't mind my being here?\" she asked, sounding worried. \"Charlie thinks you're wonderful, Alice.\" \"Well, we're about to find out.\" Sure enough, a few seconds later I heard the cruiser pull into the driveway. I jumped up and hurried to open the door. Charlie trudged slowly up the walk, his eyes on the ground and his shoulders slumped. I walked forward to meet him; he didn't even see me until I hugged him around the waist. He embraced me back fiercely. \"I'm so sorry about Harry, Dad.\" \"I'm really going to miss him,\" Charlie mumbled. \"How's Sue doing?\" \"She seems dazed, like she hasn't grasped it yet. Sam's staying with her\u2026\" The volume of his voice faded in and out. \"Those poor kids. Leah's just a year older than you, and Seth is only fourteen\u2026\" He shook his head. He kept his arms tight around me as he started toward the door again. \"Um, Dad?\" I figured I'd better warn him. \"You'll never guess who's here.\" He looked at me blankly. His head swiveled around, and he spied the Mercedes across the street, the porch light reflecting off the glossy black paint. Before he could react, Alice was in the doorway. \"Hi, Charlie,\" she said in a subdued voice. \"I'm sorry I came at such a bad time.\" \"Alice Cullen?\" he peered at the slight figure in front of him as if he doubted what his eyes were telling him. \"Alice, is that you?\" \"It's me,\" she confirmed. \"I was in the neighborhood.\" \"Is Carlisle\u2026?\" \"No, I'm alone.\" Both Alice and I knew he wasn't really asking about Carlisle. His arm tightened over my shoulder. \"She can stay here, can't she?\" I pleaded. \"I already asked her.\" \"Of course,\" Charlie said mechanically. \"We'd love to have you, Alice.\" \"Thank you, Charlie. I know it's horrid timing.\" \"No, it's fine, really. I'm going to be really busy doing what I can for Harry's family; it will be nice for Bella to have some company.\" \"There's dinner for you on the table, Dad,\" I told him. \"Thanks, Bell.\" He gave me one more squeeze before he shuffled toward the kitchen. Alice went back to the couch, and I followed her. This time, she was the one to pull me against her shoulder. \"You look tired.\" \"Yeah,\" I agreed, and shrugged. \"Near-death experiences do that to me\u2026 So, what does Carlisle think of you being here?\" \"He doesn't know. He and Esme were on a hunting trip. I'll hear from him in a few days, when he gets back.\" \"You won't tell him, though\u2026 when he checks in again?\" I asked. She knew I didn't mean Carlisle now. \"No. He'd bite my head off,\" Alice said grimly. I laughed once, and then sighed. I didn't want to sleep. I wanted to stay up all night talking to Alice. And it didn't make sense for me to be tired, what with crashing on Jacob's couch all day. But drowning really had taken a lot out of me, and my eyes wouldn't stay open. I rested my head on her stone shoulder, and drifted into a more peaceful oblivion than I had any hope of. I woke early, from a deep and dreamless sleep, feeling well-rested, but stiff. I was on the couch tucked under the blankets I'd laid out for Alice, and I could hear her and Charlie talking in the kitchen. It sounded like Charlie was fixing her breakfast. \"How bad was it, Charlie?\" Alice asked softly, and at first I thought they were talking about the Clear waters. Charlie sighed. \"Real bad.\" \"Tell me about it. I want to know exactly what happened when we left.\" There was a pause while a cupboard door was closed and a dial on the stove was clicked off. I waited, cringing. \"I've never felt so helpless,\" Charlie began slowly. \"I didn't know what to do. That first week\u2014I thought I was going to have to hospitalize her. She wouldn't eat or drink, she wouldn't move. Dr. Gerandy was throwing around words like 'catatonic,' but I didn't let him up to see her. I was afraid it would scare her.\" \"She snapped out of it though?\" \"I had Renee come to take her to Florida. I just didn't want to be the one\u2026 if she had to go to a hospital or something. I hoped being with her mother would help. But when we started packing her clothes, she woke up with a vengeance. I've never seen Bella throw a fit like that. She was never one for the tantrums, but, boy, did she fly into a fury. She threw her clothes everywhere and screamed that we couldn't make her leave\u2014and then she finally started crying. I thought that would be the turning point. I didn't argue when she insisted on staying here\u2026 and she did seem to get better at first\u2026\" Charlie trailed off. It was hard listening to this, knowing how much pain I'd caused him. \"But?\" Alice prompted. \"She went back to school and work, she ate and slept and did her homework. She answered when someone asked her a direct question. But she was\u2026 empty. Her eyes were blank. There were lots of little things\u2014she wouldn't listen to music anymore; I found a bunch of CDs broken in the trash. She didn't read; she wouldn't be in the same room when the TV was on, not that she watched it so much before. I finally figured it out\u2014she was avoiding everything that might remind her of\u2026 him. \"We could hardly talk; I was so worried about saying something that would upset her\u2014the littlest things would make her flinch\u2014and she never volunteered anything. She would just answer if I asked her something. \"She was alone all the time. She didn't call her friends back, and after a while, they stopped calling. \"It was night of the living dead around here. I still hear her screaming in her sleep\u2026\" I could almost see him shuddering. I shuddered, too, remembering. And then I sighed. I hadn't fooled him at all, not for one second. \"I'm so sorry, Charlie,\" Alice said, voice glum. \"It's not your fault.\" The way he said it made it perfectly clear that he was holding someone responsible. \"You were always a good friend to her.\" \"She seems better now, though.\" \"Yeah. Ever since she started hanging out with Jacob Black, I've noticed a real improvement. She has some color in her cheeks when she comes home, some light in her eyes. She's happier.\" He paused, and his voice was different when he spoke again. \"He's a year or so younger than her, and I know she used to think of him as a friend, but I think maybe it's something more now, or headed that direction, anyway.\" Charlie said this in a tone that was almost belligerent. It was a warning, not for Alice, but for her to pass along. \"Jake's old for his years,\" he continued, still sounding defensive. \"He's taken care of his father physically the way Bella took care of her mother \u00a0emotionally. It matured him. He's a good-looking kid, too\u2014takes after his mom's side. He's good for Bella, you know,\" Charlie insisted.  \"Then it's good she has him,\" Alice agreed. Charlie sighed out a big gust of air, folding quickly to the lack of opposition. \"Okay, so I guess that's overstating things. I don't know\u2026 even with Jacob, now and then I see something in her eyes, and I wonder if I've ever grasped how much pain she's really in It's not normal, Alice, and it\u2026 it frightens me. Not normal at all. Not like someone\u2026 left her, but like someone died.\" His voice cracked. It was like someone had died\u2014like I had died. Because it had been more than just losing the truest of true loves, as if that were not enough to kill anyone. It was also losing a whole future, a whole family\u2014the whole life that I'd chosen\u2026 Charlie went on in a hopeless tone. \"I don't know if she's going to get over it\u2014I'm not sure if it's in her nature to heal from something like this. She's always been such a constant little thing. She doesn't get past things, change her mind.\" \"She's one of a kind,\" Alice agreed in a dry voice. \"And Alice\u2026\" Charlie hesitated. \"Now, you know how fond I am of you, and I can tell that she's happy to see you, but\u2026 I'm a little worried about what your visit will do to her.\" \"So am I, Charlie, so am I. I wouldn't have come if I'd had any idea. I'm sorry.\" \"Don't apologize, honey. Who knows? Maybe it will be good for her.\" \"I hope you're right.\" There was a long break while forks scraped plates and Charlie chewed. I wondered where Alice was hiding the food. \"Alice, I have to ask you something,\" Charlie said awkwardly. Alice was calm. \"Go ahead.\" \"He's not coming back to visit, too, is he?\" I could hear the suppressed anger in Charlie's voice. Alice answered in a soft, reassuring tone. \"He doesn't even know I'm here. The last time I spoke with him, he was in South America.\" I stiffened as I heard this new information, and listened harder. \"That's something, at least.\" Charlie snorted. \"Well, I hope he's enjoying himself.\" For the first time, Alice's voice had a bit of steel in it. \"I wouldn't make assumptions, Charlie.\" I knew how her eyes would flash when she used that tone. A chair scooted from the table, scraping loudly across the floor. I pictured Charlie getting up; there was no way Alice would make that kind of noise. The faucet ran, splashing against a dish. It didn't sound like they were going to say anything more about Edward, so I decided it was time to wake up. I turned over, bouncing against the springs to make them squeak. Then I yawned loudly. All was quiet in the kitchen. I stretched and groaned. \"Alice?\" I asked innocently; the soreness rasping in my throat added nicely to the charade. \"I'm in the kitchen, Bella,\" Alice called, no hint in her voice that she suspected my eavesdropping. But she was good at hiding things like that. Charlie had to leave then\u2014he was helping Sue Clearwater with the funeral arrangements. It would have been a very long day without Alice. She never spoke about leaving, and I didn't ask her. I knew it was inevitable, but I put it out of my mind. Instead, we talked about her family\u2014all but one. Carlisle was working nights in Ithaca and teaching part time at Cornell. Esme was restoring a seventeenth century house, a historical monument, in the forest north of the city. Emmett and Rosalie had gone to Europe for a few months on another honeymoon, but they were back now. Jasper was at Cornell, too, studying philosophy this time. And Alice had been doing some personal research, concerning the information I'd accidentally uncovered for her last spring. She'd successfully tracked down the asylum where she'd spent the last years of her human life. The life she had no memory of. \"My name was Mary Alice Brandon,\" she told me quietly. \"I had a little sister named Cynthia. Her daughter\u2014my niece\u2014is still alive in Biloxi.\" \"Did you find out why they put you in\u2026 that place?\" What would drive parents to that extreme? Even if their daughter saw visions of the future\u2026 She just shook her head, her topaz eyes thoughtful. \"I couldn't find much about them. I went through all the old newspapers on microfiche. My family wasn't mentioned often; they weren't part of the social circle that made the papers. My parents' engagement was there, and Cynthia's.\" The name fell uncertainly from her tongue. \"My birth was announced\u2026 and my death. I found my grave. I also filched my admissions sheet from the old asylum archives. The date on the admission and the date on my tombstone are the same.\" I didn't know what to say, and, after a short pause, Alice moved on to lighter topics. The Cullens were reassembled now, with the one exception, spending Cornell's spring break in Denali with Tanya and her family. I listened too eagerly to even the most trivial news. She never mentioned the one I was most interested in, and for that I was grateful. It was enough to listen to the stories of the family I'd once dreamed of belonging to. Charlie didn't get back until after dark, and he looked more worn than he had the night before. He would be headed back to the reservation first thing in the morning for Harry's funeral, so he turned in early. I stayed on the couch with Alice again. Charlie was almost a stranger when he came down the stairs before the sun was up, wearing an old suit I'd never seen him in before. The jacket hung open; I guessed it was too tight to fasten the buttons. His tie was a bit wide for the current style. He tiptoed to the door, trying not to wake us up. I let him go, pretending to sleep, as Alice did on the recliner. As soon as he was out the door, Alice sat up. Under the quilt, she was fully dressed. \"So, what are we doing today?\" she asked. \"I don't know\u2014do you see anything interesting happening?\" She smiled and shook her head. \"But it's still early.\" All the time I'd been spending in La Push meant a pile of things I'd been neglecting at home, and I decided to catch up on my chores. I wanted to do something, anything that might make life easier for Charlie\u2014maybe it would make him feel just a little better to come home to a clean, organized house. I started with the bathroom\u2014it showed the most signs of neglect. While I worked, Alice leaned against the doorjamb and asked nonchalant questions about my, well, our high school friends and what they been up to since she'd left. Her face stayed casual and emotionless, but I sensed her disapproval when she realized how little I could tell her. Or maybe I just had a guilty conscience after eavesdropping on her conversation with Charlie yesterday morning. I was literally up to my elbows in Comet, scrubbing the floor of the bathtub, when the doorbell rang. I looked to Alice at once, and her expression was perplexed, almost worried, which was strange; Alice was never taken by surprise. \"Hold on!\" I shouted in the general direction of the front door, getting up and hurrying to the sink to rinse my arms off. \"Bella,\" Alice said with a trace of frustration in her voice, \"I have a fairly good guess who that might be, and I think I'd better step out.\" \"Guess?\" I echoed. Since when did Alice have to guess anything? \"If this is a repeat of my egregious lapse in foresight yesterday, then it's most likely Jacob Black or one of his\u2026 friends.\" I stared at her, putting it together. \"You can't see werewolves?\" She grimaced. \"So it would seem.\" She was obviously annoyed by this fact\u2014very annoyed. The doorbell rang again\u2014buzzing twice quickly and impatiently. \"You don't have go anywhere, Alice. You were here first.\" She laughed her silvery little laugh\u2014it had a dark edge. \"Trust me\u2014it wouldn't be a good idea to have me and Jacob Black in a room together.\" She kissed my cheek swiftly before she vanished through Charlie's door\u2014and out his back window, no doubt. The doorbell rang again.",

            "en": "7          7. NIGHTMARE I told Charlie I had a lot of homework to do, and that I didn't want anything to eat. There was a basketball game on that he was excited about, though of course I had no idea what was special about it, so he wasn't aware of anything unusual in my face or tone. Once in my room, I locked the door. I dug through my desk until I found my old headphones, and I plugged them into my little CD player. I picked up a CD that Phil had given to me for Christmas. It was one of his favorite bands, but they used a little too much bass and shrieking for my tastes. I popped it into place and lay down on my bed. I put on the headphones, hit Play, and turned up the volume until it hurt my ears. I closed my eyes, but the light still <em>intruded</em>, so I added a pillow over the top half of my face. I concentrated very carefully on the music, trying to understand the lyrics, to unravel the complicated drum patterns. By the third time I'd listened through the CD, I knew all the words to the choruses, at least.  I was surprised to find that I really did like the band after all, once I got past the blaring noise. I'd have to thank Phil again.  And it worked. The shattering beats made it impossible for me to think \u2014 which was the whole purpose of the exercise. I listened to the CD again and again, until I was singing along with all the songs, until, finally, I fell asleep. I opened my eyes to a familiar place. Aware in some corner of my consciousness that I was dreaming, I recognized the green light of the forest. I could hear the waves crashing against the rocks somewhere nearby. And I knew that if I found the ocean, I'd be able to see the sun.  I was trying to follow the sound, but then Jacob Black was there, tugging on my hand, pulling me back toward the blackest part of the forest. \"Jacob? What's wrong?\" I asked. His face was frightened as he yanked with all his strength against my resistance; I didn't want to go into the dark. \"Run, Bella, you have to run!\" he whispered, terrified. \"This way, Bella!\" I recognized Mike's voice calling out of the gloomy heart of the trees, but I couldn't see him. \"Why?\" I asked, still pulling against Jacob's grasp, desperate now to find the sun. But Jacob let go of my hand and yelped, suddenly shaking, falling to the dim forest floor. He twitched on the ground as I watched in horror.  \"Jacob!\" I screamed. But he was gone. In his place was a large red-brown wolf with black eyes. The wolf faced away from me, pointing toward the shore, the hair on the back of his shoulders bristling, low growls issuing from between his exposed fangs. \"Bella, run!\" Mike cried out again from behind me. But I didn't turn. I was watching a light coming toward me from the beach. And then Edward stepped out from the trees, his skin faintly glowing, his eyes black and dangerous. He held up one hand and beckoned me to come to him. The wolf growled at my feet. I took a step forward, toward Edward. He smiled then, and his teeth were sharp, pointed. \"Trust me,\" he purred. I took another step. The wolf launched himself across the space between me and the vampire, fangs aiming for the jugular. \"No!\" I screamed, wrenching upright out of my bed. My sudden movement caused the headphones to pull the CD player off the bedside table, and it clattered to the wooden floor. My light was still on, and I was sitting fully dressed on the bed, with my shoes on. I glanced, disoriented, at the clock on my dresser. It was five-thirty in the morning. I groaned, fell back, and rolled over onto my face, kicking off my boots. I was too uncomfortable to get anywhere near sleep, though. I rolled back over and unbuttoned my jeans, yanking them off awkwardly as I tried to stay horizontal. I could feel the braid in my hair, an uncomfortable ridge along the back of my skull. I turned onto my side and ripped the rubber band out, quickly combing through the plaits with my fingers. I pulled the pillow back over my eyes.  It was all no use, of course. My subconscious had dredged up exactly the images I'd been trying so desperately to avoid. I was going to have to face them now. I sat up, and my head spun for a minute as the blood flowed downward. First things first, I thought to myself, happy to put it off as long as possible. I grabbed my bathroom bag. The shower didn't last nearly as long as I hoped it would, though. Even taking the time to blow-dry my hair, I was soon out of things to do in the bathroom. Wrapped in a towel, I crossed back to my room. I couldn't tell if Charlie was still asleep, or if he had already left. I went to look out my window, and the cruiser was gone. Fishing again. I dressed slowly in my most comfy sweats and then made my bed \u2014 something I never did. I couldn't put it off any longer. I went to my desk and switched on my old computer. I hated using the Internet here. My modem was sadly outdated, my free service substandard; just dialing up took so long that I decided to go get myself a bowl of cereal while I waited. I ate slowly, chewing each bite with care. When I was done, I washed the bowl and spoon, dried them, and put them away. My feet dragged as I climbed the stairs. I went to my CD player first, picking it up off the floor and placing it precisely in the center of the table. I pulled out the headphones, and put them away in the desk drawer. Then I turned the same CD on, turning it down to the point where it was background noise.  With another sigh, I turned to my computer. Naturally, the screen was covered in pop-up ads. I sat in my hard folding chair and began closing all the little windows. Eventually I made it to my favorite search engine. I shot down a few more pop-ups and then typed in one word. Vampire. It took an infuriatingly long time, of course. When the results came up, there was a lot to sift through \u2014 everything from movies and TV shows to role-playing games, underground metal, and gothic cosmetic companies. Then I found a promising site \u2014 Vampires A\u2014Z. I waited impatiently for it to load, quickly clicking closed each ad that flashed across the screen. Finally the screen was finished \u2014 simple white background with black text, academic-looking. Two quotes greeted me on the home page: Throughout the vast shadowy world of ghosts and demons there is no figure so terrible, no figure so dreaded and abhorred, yet dight with such fearful fascination, as the vampire, who is himself neither ghost nor demon, but yet who partakes the dark natures and possesses the mysterious and terrible qualities of both. \u2014 Rev. Montague Summers If there is in this world a well-attested account, it is that of the vampires. Nothing is lacking: official reports, affidavits of well-known people, of surgeons, of priests, of magistrates; the judicial proof is most complete. And with all that, who is there who believes in vampires? \u2014 Rousseau The rest of the site was an alphabetized listing of all the different myths of vampires held throughout the world. The first I clicked on, the Danag, was a Filipino vampire supposedly responsible for planting taro on the islands long ago. The myth continued that the Danag worked with humans for many years, but the partnership ended one day when a woman cut her finger and a Danag sucked her wound, enjoying the taste so much that it drained her body completely of blood. I read carefully through the descriptions, looking for anything that sounded familiar, let alone plausible. It seemed that most vampire myths centered around beautiful women as demons and children as victims; they also seemed like constructs created to explain away the high mortality rates for young children, and to give men an excuse for infidelity. Many of the stories involved bodiless spirits and warnings against improper burials. There wasn't much that sounded like the movies I'd seen, and only a very few, like the Hebrew Estrie and the Polish Upier, who were even preoccupied with drinking blood. Only three entries really caught my attention: the Romanian Varacolaci, a powerful undead being who could appear as a beautiful, pale-skinned human, the Slovak Nelapsi, a creature so strong and fast it could massacre an entire village in the single hour after midnight, and one other, the Stregoni benefici. About this last there was only one brief sentence.  Stregoni benefici: An Italian vampire, said to be on the side of goodness, and a mortal enemy of all evil vampires. It was a relief, that one small entry, the one myth among hundreds that claimed the existence of good vampires. Overall, though, there was little that coincided with Jacob's stories or my own observations. I'd made a little catalogue in my mind as I'd read and carefully compared it with each myth. Speed, strength, beauty, pale skin, eyes that shift color; and then Jacob's criteria: blood drinkers, enemies of the werewolf, cold-skinned, and immortal. There were very few myths that matched even one factor. And then another problem, one that I'd remembered from the small number of scary movies that I'd seen and was backed up by today's reading \u2014 vampires couldn't come out in the daytime, the sun would burn them to a cinder. They slept in coffins all day and came out only at night. Aggravated, I snapped off the computer's main power switch, not waiting to shut things down properly. Through my irritation, I felt overwhelming embarrassment. It was all so stupid. I was sitting in my room, researching vampires. What was wrong with me? I decided that most of the blame belonged on the doorstep of the town of Forks \u2014 and the entire sodden Olympic Peninsula, for that matter. I had to get out of the house, but there was nowhere I wanted to go that didn't involve a three-day drive. I pulled on my boots anyway, unclear where I was headed, and went downstairs. I shrugged into my raincoat without checking the weather and stomped out the door.  It was overcast, but not raining yet. I ignored my truck and started east on foot, angling across Charlie's yard toward the ever-encroaching forest. It didn't take long till I was deep enough for the house and the road to be invisible, for the only sound to be the squish of the damp earth under my feet and the sudden cries of the jays. There was a thin ribbon of a trail that led through the forest here, or I wouldn't risk wandering on my own like this. My sense of direction was hopeless; I could get lost in much less helpful surroundings. The trail wound deeper and deeper into the forest, mostly east as far as I could tell. It snaked around the Sitka spruces and the hemlocks, the yews and the maples. I only vaguely knew the names of the trees around me, and all I knew was due to Charlie pointing them out to me from the cruiser window in earlier days. There were many I didn't know, and others I couldn't be sure about because they were so covered in green parasites. I followed the trail as long as my anger at myself pushed me forward. As that started to ebb, I slowed. A few drops of moisture trickled down from the canopy above me, but I couldn't be certain if it was beginning to rain or if it was simply pools left over from yesterday, held high in the leaves above me, slowly dripping their way back to the earth. A recently fallen tree \u2014 I knew it was recent because it wasn't entirely carpeted in moss \u2014 rested against the trunk of one of her sisters, creating a sheltered little bench just a few safe feet off the trail. I stepped over the ferns and sat carefully, making sure my jacket was between the damp seat and my clothes wherever they\u00a0 touched, and leaned my hooded head back against the living tree. This was the wrong place to have come. I should have known, but where else was there to go? The forest was deep green and far too much like the scene in last night's dream to allow for peace of mind. Now that there was no longer the sound of my soggy footsteps, the silence was piercing.  The birds were quiet, too, the drops increasing in frequency, so it must be raining above. The ferns stood higher than my head, now that I was seated, and I knew someone could walk by on the path, three feet away, and not see me. Here in the trees it was much easier to believe the absurdities that embarrassed me indoors. Nothing had changed in this forest for thousands of years, and all the myths and legends of a hundred different lands seemed much more likely in this green haze than they had in my clear-cut bedroom. I forced myself to focus on the two most vital questions I had to answer, but I did so unwillingly.  First, I had to decide if it was possible that what Jacob had said about the Cullens could be true. Immediately my mind responded with a resounding negative. It was silly and morbid to entertain such ridiculous notions. But what, then? I asked myself. There was no rational explanation for how I was alive at this moment. I listed again in my head the things I'd observed myself: the impossible speed and strength, the eye color shifting from black to gold and back again, the inhuman beauty, the pale, frigid skin. And more \u2014 small things that registered slowly \u2014 how they never seemed to eat, the disturbing grace with which they moved. And the way be sometimes spoke, with unfamiliar cadences and phrases that better fit the style of a turn-of-the-century novel than that of a twenty-first-century classroom. He had skipped class the day we'd done blood typing. He hadn't said no to the beach trip till he heard where we were going. He seemed to know what everyone around him was thinking\u2026 except me. He had told me he was the villain, dangerous\u2026 Could the Cullens be vampires? Well, they were something. Something outside the possibility of rational justification was taking place in front of my incredulous eyes. Whether it be Jacob's cold ones or my own superhero theory, Edward Cullen was not\u2026 human. He was something more.  So then \u2014 maybe. That would have to be my answer for now.  And then the most important question of all. What was I going to do if it was true? If Edward was a vampire \u2014 I could hardly make myself think the words \u2014 then what should I do? Involving someone else was definitely out. I couldn't even believe myself; anyone I told would have me committed.  Only two options seemed practical. The first was to take his advice: to be smart, to avoid him as much as possible. To cancel our plans, to go back to ignoring him as far as I was able. To pretend there was an impenetrably thick glass wall between us in the one class where we were forced together. To tell him to leave me alone \u2014 and mean it this time.  I was gripped in a sudden agony of despair as I considered that alternative. My mind rejected the pain, quickly skipping on to the next option. I could do nothing different. After all, if he was something\u2026 sinister, he'd done nothing to hurt me so far. In fact, I would be a dent in Tyler's fender if he hadn't acted so quickly. So quickly, I argued with myself, that it might have been sheer reflexes. But if it was a reflex to save lives, how bad could he be? I retorted. My head spun around in answerless circles. There was one thing I was sure of, if I was sure of anything. The dark Edward in my dream last night was a reflection only of my fear of the word Jacob had spoken, and not Edward himself. Even so, when I'd screamed out in terror at the werewolf's lunge, it wasn't fear for the wolf that brought the cry of \"no\" to my lips. It was fear that he would be harmed \u2014 even as he called to me with sharp-edged fangs, I feared for him. And I knew in that I had my answer. I didn't know if there ever was a choice, really. I was already in too deep. Now that I knew \u2014 if I knew \u2014 I could do nothing about my frightening secret. Because when I thought of him, of his voice, his hypnotic eyes, the magnetic force of his personality, I wanted nothing more than to be with him right now. Even if\u2026 but I couldn't think it. Not here, alone in the darkening forest. Not while the rain made it dim as twilight under the canopy and pattered like footsteps across the matted earthen floor. I shivered and rose quickly from my place of concealment, worried that somehow the path would have disappeared with the rain. But it was there, safe and clear, winding its way out of the dripping green maze. I followed it hastily, my hood pulled close around my face, becoming surprised, as I nearly ran through the trees, at how far I had come. I started to wonder if I was heading out at all, or following the path farther into the confines of the forest. Before I could get too panicky, though, I began to glimpse some open spaces through the webbed branches. And then I could hear a car passing on the street, and I was free, Charlie's lawn stretched out in front of me, the house beckoning me, promising warmth and dry socks. It was just noon when I got back inside. I went upstairs and got dressed for the day, jeans and a t-shirt, since I was staying indoors. It didn't take too much effort to concentrate on my task for the day, a paper on Macbeth that was due Wednesday. I settled into outlining a rough draft contentedly, more serene than I'd felt since\u2026 well, since Thursday afternoon, if I was being honest.  That had always been my way, though. Making decisions was the painful part for me, the part I agonized over. But once the decision was made, I simply followed through \u2014 usually with relief that the choice was made. Sometimes the relief was tainted by despair, like my decision to come to Forks. But it was still better than wrestling with the alternatives.  This decision was ridiculously easy to live with. Dangerously easy.  And so the day was quiet, productive \u2014 I finished my paper before eight. Charlie came home with a large catch, and I made a mental note to pick up a book of recipes for fish while I was in Seattle next week. The chills that flashed up my spine whenever I thought of that trip were no different than the ones I'd felt before I'd taken my walk with Jacob Black. They should be different, I thought. I should be afraid \u2014 I knew I should be, but I couldn't feel the right kind of fear. I slept dreamlessly that night, exhausted from beginning my day so early, and sleeping so poorly the night before. I woke, for the second time since arriving in Forks, to the bright yellow light of a sunny day. I skipped to the window, stunned to see that there was hardly a cloud in the sky, and those there were just fleecy little white puffs that couldn't possibly be carrying any rain. I opened the window \u2014 surprised when it opened silently, without sticking, not having opened it in who knows how many years \u2014 and sucked in the relatively dry air. It was nearly warm and hardly windy at all. My blood was electric in my veins.  Charlie was finishing breakfast when I came downstairs, and he picked up on my mood immediately. \"Nice day out,\" he commented. \"Yes,\" I agreed with a grin. He smiled back, his brown eyes crinkling around the edges. When Charlie smiled, it was easier to see why he and my mother had jumped too quickly into an early marriage. Most of the young romantic he'd been in those days had faded before I'd known him, as the curly brown hair \u2014 the same color, if not the same texture, as mine \u2014 had dwindled, slowly revealing more and more of the shiny skin of his forehead. But when he smiled I could see a little of the man who had run away with Ren\u00e9e when she was just two years older than I was now. I ate breakfast cheerily, watching the dust moats stirring in the sunlight that streamed in the back window. Charlie called out a goodbye, and I heard the cruiser pull away from the house. I hesitated on my way out the door, hand on my rain jacket. It would be tempting fate to leave it home. With a sigh, I folded it over my arm and stepped out into the brightest light I'd seen in months. By dint of much elbow grease, I was able to get both windows in the truck almost completely rolled down. I was one of the first ones to school; I hadn't even checked the clock in my hurry to get outside. I parked and headed toward the seldom-used picnic benches on the south side of the cafeteria. The benches were still a little damp, so I sat on my jacket, glad to have a use for it. My homework was done \u2014 the product of a slow social life \u2014 but there were a few Trig problems I wasn't sure I had right. I took out my book industriously, but halfway through rechecking the first problem I was daydreaming, watching the sunlight play on the red-barked trees. I sketched inattentively along the margins of my homework. After a few minutes, I suddenly realized I'd drawn five pairs of dark eyes staring out of the page at me. I scrubbed them out with the eraser. \"Bella!\" I heard someone call, and it sounded like Mike. I looked around to realize that the school had become populated while I'd been sitting there, absentminded. Everyone was in t-shirts, some even in shorts though the temperature couldn't be over sixty. Mike was coming toward me in khaki shorts and a striped Rugby shirt, waving.  \"Hey, Mike,\" I called, waving back, unable to be halfhearted on a morning like this. He came to sit by me, the tidy spikes of his hair shining golden in the light, his grin stretching across his face. He was so delighted to see me, I couldn't help but feel gratified. \"I never noticed before \u2014 your hair has red in it,\" he commented, catching between his fingers a strand that was fluttering in the light breeze. \"Only in the sun.\" I became just a little uncomfortable as he tucked the lock behind my ear. \"Great day, isn't it?\" \"My kind of day,\" I agreed.  \"What did you do yesterday?\" His tone was just a bit too proprietary. \"I mostly worked on my essay.\" I didn't add that I was finished with it \u2014 no need to sound smug. He hit his forehead with the heel of his hand. \"Oh yeah \u2014 that's due Thursday, right?\" \"Um, Wednesday, I think.\" \"Wednesday?\" He frowned. \"That's not good\u2026 What are you writing yours on?\" \"Whether Shakespeare's treatment of the female characters is misogynistic.\" He stared at me like I'd just spoken in pig Latin. \"I guess I'll have to get to work on that tonight,\" he said, deflated. \"I was going to ask if you wanted to go out.\" \"Oh.\" I was taken off guard. Why couldn't I ever have a pleasant\u00a0 conversation with Mike anymore without it getting awkward? \"Well, we could go to dinner or something\u2026 and I could work on it later.\" He smiled at me hopefully. \"Mike\u2026\" I hated being put on the spot. \"I don't think that would be the best idea.\" His face fell. \"Why?\" he asked, his eyes guarded. My thoughts flickered to Edward, wondering if that's where his thoughts were as well. \"I think\u2026 and if you ever repeat what I'm saying right now I will cheerfully beat you to death,\" I threatened, \"but I think that would hurt Jessica's feelings.\" He was bewildered, obviously not thinking in that direction at all.  \"Jessica?\" \"Really, Mike, are you blind?\" \"Oh,\" he exhaled \u2014 clearly dazed. I took advantage of that to make my escape. \"It's time for class, and I can't be late again.\" I gathered my books up and stuffed them in my bag. We walked in silence to building three, and his expression was distracted. I hoped whatever thoughts he was immersed in were leading him in the right direction. When I saw Jessica in Trig, she was bubbling with enthusiasm. She, Angela, and Lauren were going to Port Angeles tonight to go dress shopping for the dance, and she wanted me to come, too, even though I didn't need one. I was indecisive. It would be nice to get out of town with some girlfriends, but Lauren would be there. And who knew what I could be doing tonight\u2026 But that was definitely the wrong path to let my mind wander down. Of course I was happy about the sunlight. But that wasn't completely responsible for the euphoric mood I was in, not even close. So I gave her a maybe, telling her I'd have to talk with Charlie first. She talked of nothing but the dance on the way to Spanish, continuing as if without an interruption when class finally ended, five minutes late, and we were on our way to lunch. I was far too lost in my own frenzy of anticipation to notice much of what she said. I was painfully eager to see not just him but all the Cullens \u2014 to compare them with the new suspicions that plagued my mind. As I crossed the threshold of the cafeteria, I felt the first true tingle of fear slither down my spine and settle in my stomach. Would they be able to know what I was thinking? And then a different feeling jolted through me \u2014 would Edward be waiting to sit with me again? As was my routine, I glanced first toward the Cullens' table. A shiver of panic trembled in my stomach as I realized it was empty. With dwindling hope, my eyes scoured the rest of the cafeteria, hoping to find him alone, waiting for me. The place was nearly filled \u2014 Spanish had made us late \u2014 but there was no sign of Edward or any of his family. Desolation hit me with crippling strength. I shambled along behind Jessica, not bothering to pretend to listen anymore. We were late enough that everyone was already at our table. I avoided the empty chair next to Mike in favor of one by Angela. I vaguely noticed that Mike held the chair out politely for Jessica, and that her face lit up in response. Angela asked a few quiet questions about the Macbeth paper, which I answered as naturally as I could while spiraling downward in misery. She, too, invited me to go with them tonight, and I agreed now, grasping at anything to distract myself. I realized I'd been holding on to a last shred of hope when I entered Biology, saw his empty seat, and felt a new wave of disappointment. The rest of the day passed slowly, dismally. In Gym, we had a lecture on the rules of badminton, the next torture they had lined up for me. But at least it meant I got to sit and listen instead of stumbling around on the court. The best part was the coach didn't finish, so I got another day off tomorrow. Never mind that the day after they would arm me with a racket before unleashing me on the rest of the class. I was glad to leave campus, so I would be free to pout and mope before I went out tonight with Jessica and company. But right after I walked in the door of Charlie's house, Jessica called to cancel our plans. I tried to be happy that Mike had asked her out to dinner \u2014 I really was relieved that he finally seemed to be catching on \u2014 but my enthusiasm sounded false in my own ears. She rescheduled our shopping trip for tomorrow night. Which left me with little in the way of distractions. I had fish marinating for dinner, with a salad and bread left over from the night before, so there was nothing to do there. I spent a focused half hour on homework, but then I was through with that, too. I checked my e-mail, reading the backlog of letters from my mother, getting snippier as they progressed to the present. I sighed and typed a quick response.  Mom, Sorry. I've been out. I went to the beach with some friends. And I had to write a paper. My excuses were fairly pathetic, so I gave up on that. It's sunny outside today - I know, I'm shocked, too - so I'm going to go outside and soak up as much vitamin D as I can. I love you, Bella. I decided to kill an hour with non-school-related reading. I had a small collection of books that came with me to Forks, the shabbiest volume being a compilation of the works of Jane Austen. I selected that one and headed to the backyard, grabbing a ragged old quilt from the linen cupboard at the top of the stairs on my way down. Outside in Charlie's small, square yard, I folded the quilt in half and laid it out of the reach of the trees' shadows on the thick lawn that would always be slightly wet, no matter how long the sun shone. I lay on my stomach, crossing my ankles in the air, flipping through the different novels in the book, trying to decide which would occupy my mind the most thoroughly. My favorites were Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility. I'd read the first most recently, so I started into Sense and Sensibility, only to remember after I began three that the hero of the story happened to be named Edward. Angrily, I turned to Mansfield Park, but the hero of that piece was named Edmund, and that was just too close. Weren't there any other names available in the late eighteenth century? I snapped the book shut, annoyed, and rolled over onto my back.  I pushed my sleeves up as high as they would go, and closed my eyes. I would think of nothing but the warmth on my skin, I told myself severely. The breeze was still light, but it blew tendrils of my hair around my face, and that tickled a bit. I pulled all my hair over my head, letting it fan out on the quilt above me, and focused again on the heat that touched my eyelids, my cheekbones, my nose, my lips, my forearms, my neck, soaked through my light shirt\u2026 The next thing I was conscious of was the sound of Charlie's cruiser turning onto the bricks of the driveway. I sat up in surprise, realizing the light was gone, behind the trees, and I had fallen asleep. I looked around, muddled, with the sudden feeling that I wasn't alone.  \"Charlie?\" I asked. But I could hear his door slamming in front of the house. I jumped up, foolishly edgy, gathering the now-damp quilt and my book. I ran inside to get some oil heating on the stove, realizing that dinner would be late. Charlie was hanging up his gun belt and stepping out of his boots when I came in. \"Sorry, Dad, dinner's not ready yet \u2014 I fell asleep outside.\" I stifled a yawn. \"Don't worry about it,\" he said. \"I wanted to catch the score on the game, anyway.\" I watched TV with Charlie after dinner, for something to do. There wasn't anything on I wanted to watch, but he knew I didn't like baseball, so he turned it to some mindless sitcom that neither of us enjoyed. He seemed happy, though, to be doing something together. And it felt good, despite my depression, to make him happy. \"Dad,\" I said during a commercial, \"Jessica and Angela are going to look at dresses for the dance tomorrow night in Port Angeles, and they wanted me to help them choose\u2026 do you mind if I go with them?\" \"Jessica Stanley?\" he asked. \"And Angela Weber.\" I sighed as I gave him the details. He was confused. \"But you're not going to the dance, right?\" \"No, Dad, but I'm helping them find dresses \u2014 you know, giving them constructive criticism.\" I wouldn't have to explain this to a woman. \"Well, okay.\" He seemed to realize that he was out of his depth with the girlie stuff. \"It's a school night, though.\" \"We'll leave right after school, so we can get back early. You'll be okay for dinner, right?\" \"Bells, I fed myself for seventeen years before you got here,\" he reminded me. \"I don't know how you survived,\" I muttered, then added more clearly, \"I'll leave some things for cold-cut sandwiches in the fridge, okay? Right on top.\" It was sunny again in the morning. I awakened with renewed hope that I grimly tried to suppress. I dressed for the warmer weather in a deep blue V-neck blouse \u2014 something I'd worn in the dead of winter in Phoenix.  I had planned my arrival at school so that I barely had time to make it to class. With a sinking heart, I circled the full lot looking for a space, while also searching for the silver Volvo that was clearly not there. I parked in the last row and hurried to English, arriving breathless, but subdued, before the final bell.  It was the same as yesterday \u2014 I just couldn't keep little sprouts of hope from budding in my mind, only to have them squashed painfully as I searched the lunchroom in vain and sat at my empty Biology table. The Port Angeles scheme was back on again for tonight and made all the more attractive by the fact that Lauren had other obligations. I was anxious to get out of town so I could stop glancing over my shoulder, hoping to see him appearing out of the blue the way he always did. I vowed to myself that I would be in a good mood tonight and not ruin Angela's or Jessica's enjoyment in the dress hunting. Maybe I could do a little clothes shopping as well. I refused to think that I might be shopping alone in Seattle this weekend, no longer interested in the earlier arrangement. Surely he wouldn't cancel without at least telling me. After school, Jessica followed me home in her old white Mercury so that I could ditch my books and truck. I brushed through my hair quickly when I was inside, feeling a slight lift of excitement as I contemplated getting out of Forks. I left a note for Charlie on the table, explaining again where to find dinner, switched my scruffy wallet from my school bag to a purse I rarely used, and ran out to join Jessica. We went to Angela's house next, and she was waiting for us. My excitement increased exponentially as we actually drove out of the town limits.",

            "en": "Ch\u1ea1ng V\u1ea1ng - Twilight            2. OPEN BOOK The next day was better\u2026 and worse. It was better because it wasn't raining yet, though the clouds were dense and opaque. It was easier because I knew what to expect of my day. Mike came to sit by me in English, and walked me to my next class, with Chess Club Eric glaring at him all the while; that was nattering. People didn't look at me quite as much as they had yesterday. I sat with a big group at lunch that included Mike, Eric, Jessica, and several other people whose names and faces I now remembered. I began to feel like I was treading water, instead of drowning in it.  It was worse because I was tired; I still couldn't sleep with the wind echoing around the\u00a0 house. It was worse because Mr. Varner called on me in Trig when my hand wasn't raised and I had the wrong answer. It was miserable because I had to play volleyball, and the one time I didn't cringe out of the way of the ball, I hit my teammate in the head with it. And it was worse because Edward Cullen wasn't in school at all. \u00a0All morning I was dreading lunch, fearing his bizarre glares. Part of me wanted to confront him and demand to know what his problem was. While I was lying sleepless in my bed, I even imagined what I would say. But I knew myself too well to think I would really have the guts to do it. I made the Cowardly Lion look like the terminator. But when I walked into the cafeteria with Jessica \u2014 trying to keep my eyes from sweeping the place for him, and failing entirely \u2014 I saw that his four siblings of sorts were sitting together at the same table, and he was not with them. Mike intercepted us and steered us to his table. Jessica seemed elated by the attention, and her friends quickly joined us. But as I tried to listen to their easy chatter, I was terribly uncomfortable, waiting nervously for the moment he would arrive. I hoped that he would simply ignore me when he came, and prove my suspicions false. He didn't come, and as time passed I grew more and more tense. I walked to Biology with more confidence when, by the end of lunch, he still hadn't showed. Mike, who was taking on the qualities of a golden retriever, walked faithfully by my side to class. I held my breath at the door, but Edward Cullen wasn't there, either. I exhaled and went to my seat. Mike followed, talking about an upcoming trip to the beach. He lingered by my desk till the bell rang. Then he smiled at me wistfully and went to sit by a girl with braces and a bad perm. It looked like I was going to have to do something about Mike, and it wouldn't be easy. In a town like this, where everyone lived on top of everyone else, diplomacy was essential. I had never been enormously tactful; I had no practice dealing with overly friendly boys. I was relieved that I had the desk to myself, that Edward was absent. I told myself that repeatedly. But I couldn't get rid of the nagging suspicion that I was the reason he wasn't there. It was ridiculous, and egotistical, to think that I could affect anyone that strongly. It was impossible. And yet I couldn't stop worrying that it was true. When the school day was finally done, and the blush was fading out of my cheeks from the volleyball incident, I changed quickly back into my jeans and navy blue sweater. I hurried from the girls' locker room, pleased to find that I had successfully evaded my retriever friend for the moment. I walked swiftly out to the parking lot. It was crowded now with fleeing students. I got in my truck and dug through my bag to make sure I had what I needed. Last night I'd discovered that Charlie couldn't cook much besides fried eggs and bacon. So I requested that I be assigned kitchen detail for the duration of my stay. He was willing enough to hand over the keys to the banquet hall. I also found out that he had no food in the house. So I had my shopping list and the cash from the jar in the cupboard labeled FOOD MONEY, and I was on my way to the Thriftway. I gunned my deafening engine to life, ignoring the heads that turned in my direction, and backed carefully into a place in the line of cars that were waiting to exit the parking lot. As I waited, trying to pretend that the earsplitting rumble was coming from someone else's car, I saw the two Cullens and the Hale twins getting into their car. It was the shiny new Volvo. Of course. I hadn't noticed their clothes before \u2014 I'd been too mesmerized by their faces. Now that I looked, it was obvious that they were all dressed exceptionally well; simply, but in clothes that subtly hinted at designer origins. With their remarkable good looks, the style with which they carried themselves, they could have worn dishrags and pulled it off. It seemed excessive for them to have both looks and money.  But as far as I could tell, life worked that way most of the time. It didn't look as if it bought them any acceptance here.  No, I didn't fully believe that. The isolation must be their desire; I couldn't imagine any door that wouldn't be opened by that degree of beauty. They looked at my noisy truck as I passed them, just like everyone else.  I kept my eyes straight forward and was relieved when I finally was free of the school grounds.  The Thriftway was not far from the school, just a few streets south, off the highway. It was nice to be inside the supermarket; it felt normal. I did the shopping at home, and I fell into the pattern of the familiar task gladly. The store was big enough inside that I couldn't hear the tapping of the rain on the roof to remind me where I was. When I got home, I unloaded all the groceries, stuffing them in wherever I could find an open space. I hoped Charlie wouldn't mind. I wrapped potatoes in foil and stuck them in the oven to bake, covered a steak in marinade and balanced it on top of a carton of eggs in the fridge.  When I was finished with that, I took my book bag upstairs. Before starting my homework, I changed into a pair of dry sweats, pulled my damp hair up into a pony-tail, and checked my e-mail for the first time. I had three messages. \"Bella,\" my mom wrote\u2026  Write me as soon as you get in. Tell me how your flight was. Is it raining? I miss you\u00a0 already. I'm almost finished packing for Florida, but I can't find my pink blouse. Do you know where I put it? Phil says hi.  Mom. I sighed and went to the next. It was sent eight hours after the first. \"Bella,\" she wrote\u2026 Why haven't you e-mailed me yet? What are you waiting for? Mom. The last was from this morning. Isabella, If I haven't heard from you by 5:30 p.m. today I'm calling Charlie. I checked the clock. I still had an hour, but my mom was well known for jumping the gun. Mom, Calm down. I'm writing right now. Don't do anything rash. Bella. I sent that, and began again. Mom, Everything is great. Of course it's raining. I was waiting for something to write about. School isn't bad, just a little repetitive. I met some nice kids who sit by me at lunch. Your blouse is at the dry cleaners - you were supposed to pick it up Friday. Charlie bought me a truck, can you believe it? I love it. It's old, but really sturdy, which is good, you know, for me. I miss you, too. I'll write again soon, but I'm not going to check my e-mail every five minutes. Relax, breathe. I love you. Bella. I had decided to read Wuthering Heights \u2014 the novel we were currently studying in English \u2014 yet again for the fun of it, and that's what I was doing when Charlie came home. I'd lost track of the time, and I hurried downstairs to take the potatoes out and put the steak in to broil. \"Bella?\" my father called out when he heard me on the stairs. Who else? I thought to myself. \"Hey, Dad, welcome home.\" \"Thanks.\" He hung up his gun belt and stepped out of his boots as I bustled about the kitchen. As far as I was aware, he'd never shot the gun on the job. But he kept it ready. When I came here as a child, he would always remove the bullets as soon as he walked in the door. I guess he considered me old enough now not to shoot myself by accident, and not depressed enough to shoot myself on purpose.  \"What's for dinner?\" he asked warily. My mother was an imaginative cook, and her experiments weren't always edible. I was surprised, and sad, that he seemed to remember that far back. \"Steak and potatoes,\" I answered, and he looked relieved. He seemed to feel awkward standing in the kitchen doing nothing; he lumbered into the living room to watch TV while I worked. We were both more comfortable that way. I made a salad while the steaks cooked, and set the table. I called him in when dinner was ready, and he sniffed appreciatively as he walked into the room. \"Smells good, Bell.\" \"Thanks.\" We ate in silence for a few minutes. It wasn't uncomfortable. Neither of us was bothered by the quiet. In some ways, we were well suited for living together. \"So, how did you like school? Have you made any friends?\" he asked as he was taking seconds. \"Well, I have a few classes with a girl named Jessica. I sit with her friends at lunch. And there's this boy, Mike, who's very friendly. Everybody seems pretty nice.\" With one outstanding exception. \"That must be Mike Newton. Nice kid \u2014 nice family. His dad owns the sporting goods store just outside of town. He makes a good living off all the backpackers who come through here.\" \" Do you know the Cullen family?\" I asked hesitantly.  \"Dr. Cullen's family? Sure. Dr. Cullen's a great man.\" \"They\u2026 the kids\u2026 are a little different. They don't seem to fit in very well at school.\" Charlie surprised me by looking angry. \"People in this town,\" he muttered.\u201dDr. Cullen is a brilliant surgeon who could probably work in any hospital in the world, make ten times the salary he gets here,\" he continued, getting louder.\u201dWe're lucky to have him \u2014 lucky that his wife wanted to live in a small town. He's an asset to the community, and all of those kids are well behaved and polite. I had my doubts, when they first moved in, with all those adopted teenagers. I thought we might have some problems with them. But they're all very mature \u2014 I haven't had one speck of trouble from any of them. That's more than I can say for the children of some folks who have lived in this town for generations. And they stick together the way a family should \u2014 camping trips every other weekend\u2026  Just because they're newcomers, people have to talk.\" It was the longest speech I'd ever heard Charlie make. He must feel strongly about whatever people were saying. I backpedaled.\u201dThey seemed nice enough to me. I just noticed they kept to themselves. They're all very attractive,\" I added, trying to be more complimentary. \"You should see the doctor,\" Charlie said, laughing.\u201dIt's a good thing he's happily married. A lot of the nurses at the hospital have a hard time concentrating on their work with him around.\" We lapsed back into silence as we finished eating. He cleared the table while I started on the dishes. He went back to the TV, and after I finished washing the dishes by hand \u2014 no\u00a0 dishwasher \u2014 I went upstairs unwillingly to work on my math homework. I could feel a tradition in the making. That night it was finally quiet. I fell asleep quickly, exhausted. The rest of the week was uneventful. I got used to the routine of my classes. By Friday I was able to recognize, if not name, almost all the students at school. In Gym, the kids on my team learned not to pass me the ball and to step quickly in front of me if the other team tried to take advantage of my weakness. I happily stayed out of their way. Edward Cullen didn't come back to school. Every day, I watched anxiously until the rest of the Cullens entered the cafeteria without him. Then I could relax and join in the lunchtime conversation. Mostly it centered around a trip to the La Push Ocean Park in two weeks that Mike was putting together. I was invited, and I had agreed to go, more out of politeness than desire. Beaches should be hot and dry. By Friday I was perfectly comfortable entering my Biology class, no longer worried that Edward would be there. For all I knew, he had dropped out of school. I tried not to think about him, but I couldn't totally suppress the worry that I was responsible for his continued absence, ridiculous as it seemed. My first weekend in Forks passed without incident. Charlie, unused to spending time in the usually empty house, worked most of the weekend. I cleaned the house, got ahead on my homework, and wrote my mom more bogusly cheerful e-mail. I did drive to the library Saturday, but it was so poorly stocked that I didn't bother to get a card; I would have to make a date to visit Olympia or Seattle soon and find a good bookstore. I wondered idly what kind of gas mileage the truck got\u2026 and shuddered at the thought. The rain stayed soft over the weekend, quiet, so I was able to sleep well. People greeted me in the parking lot Monday morning. I didn't know all their names, but I waved back and smiled at everyone. It was colder this morning, but happily not raining. In English, Mike took his accustomed seat by my side. We had a pop quiz on Wuthering Heights. It was straightforward, very easy. All in all, I was feeling a lot more comfortable than I had thought I would feel by this point. More comfortable than I had ever expected to feel here. When we walked out of class, the air was full of swirling bits of white. I could hear people shouting excitedly to each other. The wind bit at my cheeks, my nose. \"Wow,\" Mike said.\u201dIt's snowing.\" I looked at the little cotton fluffs that were building up along the sidewalk and swirling erratically past my face.  \"Ew.\" Snow. There went my good day. He looked surprised.\u201dDon't you like snow?\" \"No. That means it's too cold for rain.\" Obviously.\u201dBesides, I thought it was supposed to come down in flakes \u2014 you know, each one unique and all that. These just look like the ends of Q-tips.\" \"Haven't you ever seen snow fall before?\" he asked incredulously. \"Sure I have.\" I paused.\u201dOn TV.\" Mike laughed. And then a big, squishy ball of dripping snow smacked into the back of his head. We both turned to see where it came from. I had my suspicions about Eric, who was walking away, his back toward us \u2014 in the wrong direction for his next class. Mike appatently had the same notion.  He bent over and began scraping together a pile of the white mush. \"I'll see you at lunch, okay?\" I kept walking as I spoke.\u201dOnce people start throwing wet stuff, I go inside.\" He just nodded, his eyes on Eric's retreating figure. Throughout the morning, everyone chattered excitedly about the snow; apparently it was the first snowfall of the new year. I kept my mouth shut. Sure, it was drier than rain \u2014 until it melted in your socks. I walked alertly to the cafeteria with Jessica after Spanish. Mush balls were flying everywhere. I kept a binder in my hands, ready to use it as a shield if necessary. Jessica thought I was hilarious, but something in my expression kept her from lobbing a snowball at me herself. Mike caught up to us as we walked in the doors, laughing, with ice melting the spikes in his hair. He and Jessica were talking animatedly about the snow fight as we got in line to buy food. I glanced toward that table in the corner out of habit. And then I froze where I stood. There were five people at the table. Jessica pulled on my arm. \"Hello? Bella? What do you want?\" I looked down; my ears were hot. I had no reason to feel self-conscious, I reminded myself. I hadn't done anything wrong. \"What's with Bella?\" Mike asked Jessica. \"Nothing,\" I answered.\u201dI'll just get a soda today.\" I caught up to the end of the line. \"Aren't you hungry?\" Jessica asked. \"Actually, I feel a little sick,\" I said, my eyes still on the floor. I waited for them to get their food, and then followed them to a table, my eyes on my feet. I sipped my soda slowly, my stomach churning. Twice Mike asked, with unnecessary concern, how I was feeling. I told him it was nothing, but I was wondering if I should play it up and escape to the nurse's office for the next hour. Ridiculous. I shouldn't have to run away.  I decided to permit myself one glance at the Cullen family's table. If he was glaring at me, I would skip Biology, like the coward I was. I kept my head down and glanced up under my lashes. None of them were looking this way. I lifted my head a little. They were laughing. Edward, Jasper, and Emmett all had their hair entirely saturated with melting snow. Alice and Rosalie were leaning away as Emmett shook his dripping hair toward them. They were enjoying the snowy day, just like everyone else \u2014 only they looked more like a scene from a movie than the rest of us. But, aside from the laughter and playfulness, there was something different, and I couldn't quite pinpoint what that difference was. I examined Edward the most carefully. His skin was less pale, I decided \u2014 flushed from the snow fight maybe \u2014 the circles under his eyes much less noticeable. But there was something more. I pondered, staring, trying to isolate the change. \"Bella, what are you staring at?\" Jessica <em>intruded</em>, her eyes following my stare. At that precise moment, his eyes flashed over to meet mine. I dropped my head, letting my hair fall to conceal my face. I was sure, though, in the instant our eyes met, that he didn't look harsh or unfriendly as he had the last time I'd seen him. He looked merely curious again, unsatisfied in some way. \"Edward Cullen is staring at you,\" Jessica giggled in my ear. \"He doesn't look angry, does he?\" I couldn't help asking. \"No,\" she said, sounding confused by my question.\u201dShould he be?\" \"I don't think he likes me,\" I confided. I still felt queasy. I put my head down on my arm. \"The Cullens don't like anybody\u2026 well, they don't notice anybody enough to like them. But he's still staring at you.\" \"Stop looking at him,\" I hissed. She snickered, but she looked away. I raised my head enough to make sure that she did, contemplating violence if she resisted. Mike interrupted us then \u2014 he was planning an epic battle of the blizzard in the parking lot after school and wanted us to join. Jessica agreed enthusiastically. The way she looked at Mike left little doubt that she would be up for anything he suggested. I kept silent. I would have to hide in the gym until the parking lot cleared. For the rest of the lunch hour I very carefully kept my eyes at my own table. I decided to honor the bargain I'd made with myself. Since he didn't look angry, I would go to Biology. My stomach did frightened little flips at the thought of sitting next to him again. I didn't really want to walk to class with Mike as usual \u2014 he seemed to be a popular target for the snowball snipers \u2014 but when we went to the door, everyone besides me groaned in unison. It was raining, washing all traces of the snow away in clear, icy ribbons down the side of the walkway. I pulled my hood up, secretly pleased. I would be free to go straight home after Gym. Mike kept up a string of complaints on the way to building four. Once inside the classroom, I saw with relief that my table was still empty. Mr. Banner was walking around the room, distributing one microscope and box of slides to each table. Class didn't start for a few minutes, and the room buzzed with conversation. I kept my eyes away from the door, doodling idly on the cover of my notebook. I heard very clearly when the chair next to me moved, but my eyes stayed carefully focused on the pattern I was drawing. \"Hello,\" said a quiet, musical voice. I looked up, stunned that he was speaking to me. He was sitting as far away from me as the desk allowed, but his chair was angled toward me. His hair was dripping wet, disheveled \u2014 even so, he looked like he'd just finished shooting a commercial for hair gel. His dazzling face was friendly, open, a slight smile on his flawless lips. But his eyes were careful. \"My name is Edward Cullen,\" he continued.\u201dI didn't have a chance to introduce myself last week. You must be Bella Swan.\" My mind was spinning with confusion. Had I made up the whole thing? He was perfectly polite now. I had to speak; he was waiting. But I couldn't think of anything conventional to say. \"H-how do you know my name?\" I stammered.  He laughed a soft, enchanting laugh. \"Oh, I think everyone knows your name. The whole town's been waiting for you to arrive.\" I grimaced. I knew it was something like that. \"No,\" I persisted stupidly.\u201dI meant, why did you call me Bella?\" He seemed confused.\u201dDo you prefer Isabella?\" \"No, I like Bella,\" I said.\u201dBut I think Charlie \u2014 I mean my dad \u2014 must call me Isabella behind my back \u2014 that's what everyone here seems to know me as,\" I tried to explain, feeling like an utter moron. \"Oh.\" He let it drop. I looked away awkwardly.  Thankfully, Mr. Banner started class at that moment. I tried to concentrate as he explained the lab we would be doing today. The slides in the box were out of order. Working as lab partners, we had to separate the slides of onion root tip cells into the phases of mitosis they represented and label them accordingly. We weren't supposed to use our books. In twenty minutes, he would be coming around to see who had it right. \"Get started,\" he commanded. \"Ladies first, partner?\" Edward asked. I looked up to see him smiling a crooked smile so beautiful that I could only stare at him like an idiot. \"Or I could start, if you wish.\" The smile faded; he was obviously wondering if I was mentally competent. \"No,\" I said, flushing.\u201dI'll go ahead.\" I was showing off, just a little. I'd already done this lab, and I knew what I was looking for. It should be easy. I snapped the first slide into place under the microscope and adjusted it quickly to the 40X objective. I studied the slide briefly. My assessment was confident.\u201dProphase.\" \"Do you mind if I look?\" he asked as I began to remove the slide. His hand caught mine, to stop me, as he asked. His fingers were ice-cold, like he'd been holding them in a snowdrift before class. But that wasn't why I jerked my hand away so quickly. When he touched me, it stung my hand as if an electric current had passed through us. \"I'm sorry,\" he muttered, pulling his hand back immediately. However, he continued to reach for the microscope. I watched him, still staggered, as he examined the slide for an even shorter time than I had. \"Prophase,\" he agreed, writing it neatly in the first space on our worksheet. He swiftly switched out the first slide for the second, and then glanced at it cursorily. \"Anaphase,\" he murmured, writing it down as he spoke.  I kept my voice indifferent.\u201dMay I?\" He smirked and pushed the microscope to me. I looked through the eyepiece eagerly, only to be disappointed. Dang it, he was right. \"Slide three?\" I held out my hand without looking at him. He handed it to me; it seemed like he was being careful not to touch my skin again. I took the most fleeting look I could manage. \"Interphase.\" I passed him the microscope before he could ask for it. He took a swift peek, and then wrote it down. I would have written it while he looked, but his clear, elegant script intimidated me. I didn't want to spoil the page with my clumsy scrawl. We were finished before anyone else was close. I could see Mike and his partner comparing two slides again and again, and another group had their book open under the table. Which left me with nothing to do but try to not look at him\u2026 unsuccessfully. I glanced up, and he was staring at me, that same inexplicable look of frustration in his eyes. Suddenly I identified that subtle difference in his face. \"Did you get contacts?\" I blurted out unthinkingly. He seemed puzzled by my unexpected question.\u201dNo.\" \"Oh,\" I mumbled.\u201dI thought there was something different about your eyes.\" He shrugged, and looked away. In fact, I was sure there was something different. I vividly remembered the flat black color of his eyes the last time he'd glared at me \u2014 the color was striking against the background of his pale skin and his auburn hair. Today, his eyes were a completely different color: a strange ocher, darker than butterscotch, but with the same golden tone. I didn't understand how that could be, unless he was lying for some reason about the contacts. Or maybe Forks was making me crazy in the literal sense of the word. I looked down. His hands were clenched into hard fists again. Mr. Banner came to our table then, to see why we weren't working. He looked over our shoulders to glance at the completed lab, and then stared more intently to check the answers. \"So, Edward, didn't you think Isabella should get a chance with the microscope?\" Mr. Banner asked. \"Bella,\" Edward corrected automatically.\u201dActually, she identified three of the five.\" Mr. Banner looked at me now; his expression was skeptical. \"Have you done this lab before?\" he asked. I smiled sheepishly.\u201dNot with onion root.\" \"Whitefish blastula?\" \"Yeah.\" Mr. Banner nodded.\u201dWere you in an advanced placement program in Phoenix?\" \"Yes.\" \"Well,\" he said after a moment,\u201dI guess it's good you two are lab partners.\" He mumbled something else as he walked away. After he left, I began doodling on my notebook again. \"It's too bad about the snow, isn't it?\" Edward asked. I had the feeling that he was forcing himself to make small talk with me. Paranoia swept over me again. It was like he had heard my conversation with Jessica at lunch and was trying to prove me wrong. \"Not really,\" I answered honestly, instead of pretending to be normal like everyone else. I was still trying to dislodge the stupid feeling of suspicion, and I couldn't concentrate. \"You don't like the cold.\" It wasn't a question. \"Or the wet.\" \"Forks must be a difficult place for you to live,\" he mused. \"You have no idea,\" I muttered darkly. He looked fascinated by what I said, for some reason I couldn't imagine. His face was such a distraction that I tried not to look at it any more than courtesy absolutely demanded. \"Why did you come here, then?\" No one had asked me that \u2014 not straight out like he did, demanding. \"It's\u2026 complicated.\" \"I think I can keep up,\" he pressed. I paused for a long moment, and then made the mistake of meeting his gaze. His dark gold eyes confused me, and I answered without thinking. \"My mother got remarried,\" I said. \"That doesn't sound so complex,\" he disagreed, but he was suddenly sympathetic.\u201dWhen did that happen?\" \"Last September.\" My voice sounded sad, even to me. \"And you don't like him,\" Edward surmised, his tone still kind. \"No, Phil is fine. Too young, maybe, but nice enough.\" \"Why didn't you stay with them?\" I couldn't fathom his interest, but he continued to stare at me with penetrating eyes, as if my dull life's story was somehow vitally important. \"Phil travels a lot. He plays ball for a living.\" I half-smiled. \"Have I heard of him?\" he asked, smiling in response. \"Probably not. He doesn't play well. Strictly minor league. He moves around a lot.\" \"And your mother sent you here so that she could travel with him.\" He said it as an assumption again, not a question. My chin raised a fraction.\u201dNo, she did not send me here. I sent myself.\" His eyebrows knit together.\u201dI don't understand,\" he admitted, and he seemed unnecessarily frustrated by that fact. I sighed. Why was I explaining this to him? He continued to stare at me with obvious curiosity. \"She stayed with me at first, but she missed him. It made her unhappy\u2026 so I decided it was time to spend some quality time with Charlie.\" My voice was glum by the time I finished. \"But now you're unhappy,\" he pointed out.  \"And?\" I challenged. \"That doesn't seem fair.\" He shrugged, but his eyes were still intense. I laughed without humor.\u201dHasn't anyone ever told you? Life isn't fair.\" \"I believe I have heard that somewhere before,\" he agreed dryly. \"So that's all,\" I insisted, wondering why he was still staring at me that way. His gaze became appraising.\u201dYou put on a good show,\" he said slowly. \"But I'd be willing to bet that you're suffering more than you let anyone see.\" I grimaced at him, resisting the impulse to stick out my tongue like a five-year-old, and looked away. \"Am I wrong?\" I tried to ignore him. \"I didn't think so,\" he murmured smugly. \"Why does it matter to you?\" I asked, irritated. I kept my eyes away, watching the teacher make his rounds. \"That's a very good question,\" he muttered, so quietly that I wondered if he was talking to himself. However, after a few seconds of silence, I decided that was the only answer I was going to get. I sighed, scowling at the blackboard. \"Am I annoying you?\" he asked. He sounded amused. I glanced at him without thinking\u2026 and told the truth again.\u201dNot exactly. I'm more annoyed at myself. My face is so easy to read \u2014 my mother always calls me her open book.\" I frowned. \"On the contrary, I find you very difficult to read.\" Despite everything that I'd said and he'd guessed, he sounded like he meant it. \"You must be a good reader then,\" I replied. \"Usually.\" He smiled widely, flashing a set of perfect, ultrawhite teeth. Mr. Banner called the class to order then, and I turned with relief to listen. I was in disbelief that I'd just explained my dreary life to this bizarre, beautiful boy who may or may not despise me. He'd seemed engrossed in our conversation, but now I could see, from the corner of my eye, that he was leaning away from me again, his hands gripping the edge of the table with unmistakable tension. I tried to appear attentive as Mr. Banner illustrated, with transparencies on the overhead projector, what I had seen without difficulty through the microscope. But my thoughts were unmanageable. When the bell finally rang, Edward rushed as swiftly and as gracefully from the room as he had last Monday. And, like last Monday, I stared after him in amazement. Mike skipped quickly to my side and picked up my books for me. I imagined him with a wagging tail. \"That was awful,\" he groaned.\u201dThey all looked exactly the same. You're lucky you had Cullen for a partner.\" \"I didn't have any trouble with it,\" I said, stung by his assumption. I regretted the snub instantly.\u201dI've done the lab before, though,\" I added before he could get his feelings hurt. \"Cullen seemed friendly enough today,\" he commented as we shrugged into our raincoats. He didn't seem pleased about it. I tried to sound indifferent.\u201dI wonder what was with him last Monday.\" I couldn't concentrate on Mike's chatter as we walked to Gym, and RE. didn't do much to hold my attention, either. Mike was on my team today. He chivalrously covered my position as well as his own, so my woolgathering was only interrupted when it was my turn to serve; my team ducked warily out of the way every time I was up. The rain was just a mist as I walked to the parking lot, but I was happier when I was in the dry cab. I got the heater running, for once not caring about the mind-numbing roar of the engine. I unzipped my jacket, put the hood down, and fluffed my damp hair out so the heater could dry it on the way home. I looked around me to make sure it was clear. That's when I noticed the still, white figure. Edward Cullen was leaning against the front door of the Volvo, three cars down from me, and staring intently in my direction. I swiftly looked away and threw the truck into reverse, almost hitting a rusty Toyota Corolla in my haste. Lucky for the Toyota, I stomped on the brake in time. It was just the sort of car that my truck would make scrap metal of. I took a deep breath, still looking out the other side of my car, and cautiously pulled out again, with greater success. I stared straight ahead as I passed the Volvo, but from a peripheral peek, I would swear I saw him laughing.",
