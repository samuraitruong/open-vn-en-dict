Bayern's dreams of an unprecedented trophy treble were crushed in the Bernabeu as Diego Milito scored a goal in each half to earn Inter a 2-0 win. Though the German champions dominated possession in Madrid, bar a golden chance for Thomas Muller moments after half-time they struggled to find a way through Inter's stubborn defence. Van Gaal believes there was little to choose between the two teams, but acknowledged that Inter deserved a first European Cup success in 45 years. \"We were not good enough to impose our game,\" said Van Gaal. \"Inter only reacted, but they still won deservedly. \"The timing of the goals was decisive. The players learned today that it comes down to small details. \"I still have the feeling that we could have won. There were no great difference. \"We attacked, Inter defended, but you have to be in great shape to beat Inter and we were not today. I still think Inter merited the win.\" Bayern keeper Hans-Jorg Butt echoed Van Gaal's sentiments, saying: \"They deserved to win. They defended very well. \"We never found our game and could not get past their defence. They have great strikers.\" Captain Mark van Bommel believes Muller's opportunity, when the <em>youngster</em> shot straight at Julio Cesar, was a key moment in the game. Van Bommel commented: \"Not the better, but the more effective team won. \"Had Muller scored, it may have been different. These are decisive moments. But no reproaches, Muller has scored so many goals this season.\"",

            "en": "China tycoon pledges fortune to charity         US billionaires Bill Gates and Warren Buffett are hosting a dinner in Beijing for some of China's richest individuals. They are hoping to learn about philanthropy in China - and perhaps persuade some of their guests to give more to charity. The BBC's Michael Bristow spoke to one of those invited to dine. Businessman Chen Guangbiao has been inspired by the two US billionaires. The 42-year-old is a well-known philanthropist, but decided to go one step further when he got a call from Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. Mr Chen sat down and wrote them a letter declaring that all his money will go to charity after he dies. Perhaps surprisingly, the news was not greeted with universal approval in China, where giving to charity is not as established as in other countries. There was particular criticism when people found out that Mr Chen does not even give money to his own siblings. His sister earns 1,800 yuan ($270, \u00a3170) a month washing dishes in a hotel; his brother earns only slightly more working as a security guard. On that issue, Mr Chen is unrepentant. He said he had helped them in the past, but they had squandered his money. He said his brother gambled and his sister began a loan business that eventually failed. \"I'm determined never to help them again,\" he told the BBC in an interview at his plush Beijing apartment. Entrepreneurial spirit  Chen Guangbiao's story is a classic tale of rags to riches. He was born into a poor family in Anhui Province, where it was a constant battle to survive. He said two of his siblings died of starvation. But from an early age Mr Chen began to understand two things that have guided him throughout his adult life: business and charity. As a schoolboy he soon amassed what was to him a small fortune by selling anything he could - water, ice-cream - and doing odd jobs.  He has worked hard ever since, claiming never to have had a day off since he founded his company, Huangpu Renewable Resources, in 1998. His firm recycles waste material from the construction industry, and has allowed Mr Chen to amass a fortune estimated at $440m. Charity was the second idea that the businessman learned about early, mainly from the example set by his mother. \"When other people's kids had no milk, my mother would breastfeed them herself,\" said the businessman. She also invited beggars into their home to share their meagre meals. Mr Chen's first experience of helping others came as a <em>youngster</em> when he handed over his hard-earned money to pay for a neighbour's school fees. The father of two said giving was a habit he has maintained over the years. Inspired  A report on philanthropy in China published by the Shanghai-based Huran Research Institute earlier this year listed Mr Chen as the country's fourth-most-generous giver. It said he had donated $130m over the last five years to projects involved in health-care, disaster relief and education. But the Giving Pledge campaign started by Mr Gates and Mr Buffett has pushed Mr Chen to donate even more money. This campaign urges US billionaires to give away more than half their wealth to charitable causes. Mr Chen said this inspired him to announce he would give all his money away when he died. His philosophy can be summed up in a passage from the letter he wrote to the American philanthropists telling them of his intention. \"If you have only a glass of water then one person can drink. If you have a bucket a whole family can benefit.\" He added: \"If you have a river, then you should share it with everyone.\" Mr Chen is not shy about telling people about his charity work. \"Society needs hundreds of hundreds of thousands of Chen Guangbiaos,\" he wrote in another letter published on his company's website. He admits that he is brash - but he believes that is the only way to encourage more people to give to charity.",

            "en": "Promises to Keep       By Kris Hamm Rose  I'm a teacher. But there are days, like today, when I wonder why. It's been a tough day. The results of an English quiz taken by my fifth-graders were dismal. Despite my best efforts, the world of pronouns remains a mystery to them. How I wish there is a way to make the study of our language as exciting as a computer game, so the glazed looks would not appear in their eyes at the mention of the word \"grammar.\" I wanted to spend my lunch period thinking of a way to enrich the next day's lesson, but a child became sick and needed me to gather her assignments while she waited for her mother. It took longer than I thought so there wasn't time for lunch. Then an argument broke out at recess. Angry boys needed to be calmed and hurt feelings soothed before we could return to the classroom. We were all emotionally spent and found it hard to return to history books and Revolutionary War battles. Hunger had given me a nagging headache, lingering long after the last child filed out for car pool. Now, as I drive home, rubbing aching temples, I remember my husband's words, delivered like a lecture, after other days like this. \"Why don't you quit? You'd probably make more money doing something else, and you wouldn't have papers to grade every night.\" This late afternoon, I'm considering the wisdom of his words. I have a stack of papers to grade, which I promised my fifth-graders I would return tomorrow. But tonight a friend, whom I haven't seen in a year, is visiting from Belgium, and I told her I would keep this evening free. Frustration builds as traffic slows, and I realize it's rush hour. No matter how hard I try, I can't seem to get out of my classroom at this time. The world of my profession, a world filled with children, requires so much time. After school today, we had a faculty meeting. Events had to be planned, problems solved, new ideas discussed. So many details to remember. Just when I thought my day was over, a student peeked her head into the classroom to remind me I had promised to help her with a difficult assignment. The building was empty when I returned her to her waiting mother and wearily walked to my car. Sitting in traffic threaded behind a distant stoplight, it's hard not to replay the day and revisit the tension. I turn up the air conditioner, hoping the coolness will ease my frustration and aching head. The last notes of a familiar melody are interrupted by news from the real world. Stock prices are down. Crime is up. The sound of gunfire fills the car as a broadcaster reveals the horror of life in a distant country. A strained voice reports the body of a local <em>youngster</em>, missing for weeks, has been identified. Too much real world has invaded my space. This missing child has had a profound effect on my fifth-graders. Every morning since she was first reported missing, my children have discussed news reports about her and prayed for her safe return. Their concern was not only for her and her family but also for themselves. After all, she was one of them. A child believing herself to be safe and secure in her own neighborhood. My students, only one scant year younger than the tragic victim, wondered, \"If it happened to her, could it happen to me?\" Their thoughts and fears mirrored my own as I tried to find the right words to calm anxieties hoisted upon them by a world seemingly gone mad. There were no easy answers to quiet their apprehensions. How could I help them make sense out of senseless things and restore security to the small world of our classroom? My children, ever wise with the innocence of youth, had found the answer themselves. They got out their pencils, markers and Crayolas and made cards. Cards written with words of compassion and love for a mother and father they didn't know. Cards that spoke of faith and the promise of peace. Cards adorned with ruby red hearts, golden crosses, spring flowers and rosy-cheeked angels. No grammar book, no lesson, could ever teach the beauty of the thoughts drawn and expressed by these children. Their cards, intended to comfort others, comforted the children themselves by leading them past the anxiety, back into the world of security that should be theirs. As I sit in my car inching through the fumes of evening rush hour, I reflect on the strength of my students as they sought to right their world in the one way that made sense to them. I find myself smiling in spite of the heat, the traffic and the pile of ungraded tests. The rules of grammar might not have been learned today, but something bigger and better happened in my classroom. I just didn't recognize it at the time. And then I remember. I remember why I'm still teaching. It's the children. They're more important than a lifetime filled with quiet evenings and more valuable than a pocket filled with money. The world of noise, pronouns, recess and homework is my world. My classroom, a child-filled world of discovery, of kindness and of caring is the real world. And I'm so lucky to be in it. The traffic clears and I move past the stoplight, into the shady streets of my neighborhood. I'm glad to be home. It's time to call my friend and tell her I can't meet her tonight. I have promises to keep. She'll understand. After all, she's also a teacher.",
