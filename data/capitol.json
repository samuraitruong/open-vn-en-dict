            "en": "There were no reports of major damage or serious injuries from the 5.8 magnitude quake, which was centered in Mineral, Virginia. It was the largest quake in Virginia since 1897 and struck at a shallow depth, increasing its potency. The Pentagon, White House and <em>Capitol</em> were evacuated in Washington, and thousands of alarmed workers scurried into the streets up and down the East Coast as the lunchtime quake sent items crashing down from store and office shelves. \"We were rocking,\" said Larry Beach, who works at the U.S. Agency for International Development in downtown Washington, 83 miles from the quake's epicenter. \"It was definitely significant.\" Federal workers were sent home early. Washington's National Cathedral, host to state funerals and memorial services for many U.S. presidents, suffered damage with three spires in the central tower breaking off. The U.S. East Coast does not normally experience quakes as strong as Tuesday's. The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake was of 5.8 magnitude, downgrading an earlier estimate if 5.9. Earthquakes of magnitude 5.5 can cause damage to buildings and other structures. In addition to the Virginia earthquake, there were nine tremors in the area immediately around Cokedale, Colorado, near the border of New Mexico. \"Today we had two significant earthquakes shake large portions of the country,\" said David Wald, a geophysicist with the USGS. \"The Western earthquake, magnitude 5.3, within the last 24 hours, shook roughly four western states, primarily Colorado and New Mexico, but also parts of Kansas, Oklahoma as well as Texas -- large states, but probably experienced by tens of thousands of people,\" he said. <em>CAPITOL</em> SHAKEN As if a rare strong earthquake were not enough, the East Coast was also on alert for powerful Hurricane Irene which was heading up from the Caribbean and could hit at the weekend. The quake made chandeliers sway in the <em>Capitol</em> and the floor of the Senate shook before staff headed for the exits. Some minor damage could be seen in the rotunda, under the dome of the <em>Capitol</em>. Bits of paint and plaster fell from high on the walls and chunks of plaster fell from above a doorway in the Capitol's Statuary Hall. Congress is in recess so most members were away. \"I thought at first somebody was shaking my chair and then I thought maybe it was a bomb,\" said Senate aide Wendy Oscarson-Kirchner. Phone service was disrupted throughout the region as network congestion blocked cell phone users from making calls. There were also nuclear safety fears when one of four emergency diesel generators at the North Anna nuclear power plant in Virginia lost power due to the quake and automatically halted operations. The plant operated by Dominion Resources was designed to withstand an earthquake of magnitude up to 6.2, a company spokesman said. Dominion reported no major damage to the facility. Three generators were needed to kick in and keep the reactors' radioactive cores cool. A fourth diesel unit failed. In New York, the tremors prompted evacuations of courthouses, City Hall and halted work at the World Trade Center construction site. \"What a spooky, strange feeling,\" said Billy Simeonidis, the owner of BareBurger in Brooklyn. \"You just don't have any control. I don't know how they do it on the West Coast.\" Control towers at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City and Newark Liberty Airport in New Jersey were also evacuated, and flights were grounded briefly in Washington, Philadelphia and New York. The quake was felt as far away as Toronto. Buildings in Boston were evacuated, and some people who experienced swaying offices said they felt their stomachs turn. \"We see we had shaking from Canada and Maine all the way down to Georgia and in Michigan and Illinois. So this was over about 20 states,\" said the USGS's Wald. But saturation TV coverage of an East Coast quake that caused little damage drew smirks of amused disbelief from seismic-savvy Californians watching the news. \"East Coasters freak out, West Coasters roll their eyes,\" read one headline accompanying a story about Twitter reactions on the Hollywood website The Wrap.com.",

            "en": "Obama's Presidency a Living Example for African Americans        A majority of African-Americans also say that Mr. Obama's presidential win has improved race relations in America.  A new survey shows that African-Americans' assessment of progress and race relations in America has improved more dramatically than at any time in the last quarter century. And, President Barack Obama's move into the White House appears to be the spark that ignited this rise in optimism and hope.  African-American Nicole Cunningham says growing up in the southern state of Georgia was difficult.  It was a time of racial tension. The white supremacist group, the Ku Klux Klan, often terrorized black families, sometimes beating and murdering them. But, Nicole says seeing the inauguration of the first black president has shown her that times have changed. \"When I was in the fifth grade having the KKK [Ku Klux Klan] march on my school, and wanting to have all the black kids brought outside, I was thinking about all of that when I was looking up there. So we have definitely come a long way,\" she said. Nicole and her husband, Vurtis, took their two young children to the inauguration to witness the historic event. Their son Tarik says he is proud of Mr. Obama's victory.  \"And I know some people they didn't like the idea of having an African-American president and he persevered through all that,\" he said. \"It was a very emotional day,\" said Nicole. \"You know, I can look up there and see someone who looks like me.\" A new survey by the Pew Research Center shows that nearly twice as many African-Americans now than in 2007 say the situation of black people in the United States has improved over the last five years. This jump in optimism is the highest seen since 1984. A majority of African-Americans also say that Mr. Obama's presidential win has improved race relations in America.  But the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's Chairman Julian Bond says it was one moment in a long chain of events. \"It's arguable you could say, that we should have been able to do this years and years and years ago,\" said Bond. \"But perhaps it had to wait for the moment, for the man, for the moment-it did have to wait for the man and the moment and had to wait for an awful lot of work that had to be done leading up to this moment.\" The inauguration of Barack Obama at the steps of the <em>Capitol</em> was more than just a beginning to a new presidency. For the Cunninghams and many African-Americans, Mr. Obama was a living example of the endless possibilities. \"So to grow up, and to tell my kids that they can be anything they want to be in the world, there's no barriers anymore, you can go as far as you want to go, and to have this culminate before us, and we're there to see it, just unreal, surreal,\" said Vurtis.  For the next generation of Cunninghams, like their 11-year-old daughter Gwen, the realization of the first black president is already taking effect. \"It lets me know that I can run for president, because I am an African American and, and I can become the first female president,\" said Gwen. The Cunninghams' are still smiling over President Obama's successful jump over the race barrier. But they say the economy and the ongoing wars are tough problems he needs to tackle. \"There's still life going on, but we are still very excited. And we wish the president well,\" said Cunninghams. \"He definitely has his work cut out for him. He definitely does.\" Mr. Obama is trying a more hands-on approach to help address these problems and will present his plans later this month in his State of the Union address",
