They watched host South Africa battle Mexico to a 1-1 draw in the first game of the 32-nation, month-long tournament. \u00a0France and Uruguay play in the second game of the day. Later in the day, France and Uruguay played to a scoreless draw at a packed stadium in Cape Town. Earlier a spectacular opening ceremony featured singers and dancers in colorful costumes and body paint. South Africa's President Jacob Zuma and his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderon, sat side-by-side overlooking the festivities, each wearing their home team's scarf.  Television cameras also showed South African Nobel laureate and retired Archbishop Desmond Tutu wearing a team jersey and dancing in the stands. He was joined in the stands by U.S. Vice President Joe Biden who is representing the United States at the tournament. The excitement was tempered, though, by the absence of former president Nelson Mandela, who canceled a planned appearance after his great-granddaughter was killed in a car crash on her way home from Thursday's World Cup kickoff concert. In remarks before the start of the game, President Zuma said the 91-year-old Mr. Mandela had wanted to attend but could not because of the unexpected death of his 13-year-old great-granddaughter, Zenani. \u00a0 Mr. Zuma also lauded the tournament as the first ever hosted by an African nation, calling it \"the African World Cup.\" The World Cup is being played in 10 stadiums across South Africa, including Soccer City and Ellis Park in <em>Johannesburg</em>. \u00a0 In addition to an automatic qualification for the host team, five African countries qualified for this year's World Cup - Ivory Coast, Ghana, Cameroon, Nigeria and Algeria. Italy enters the World Cup as defending champion, but Spain, the reigning European champion, and five-time former world champion Brazil are considered the early favorites in South Africa. The first World Cup football tournament was played in 1930 in Montevideo with host nation Uruguay defeating Argentina for the championship.",

Dutch officials said Ruben van Assouw would return to the Netherlands with his aunt and uncle on Saturday morning.  The Afriqiyah Airways Airbus 330 crashed short of the runway at Tripoli airport on Wednesday.  The head Libyan investigator has said the pilot reported no problems during the plane's approach to land.  Ruben's aunt and uncle said their nine-year-old nephew was doing well under the circumstances.  \"We have explained to Ruben exactly what happened,\" they said in a statement to journalists in Tripoli.  \"He knows his parents and brother are dead. The whole family is going to bear the responsibility for Ruben's future,\" they said. Ruben had been on holiday in South Africa with his parents, Trudy and Patrick van Assouw, and his older brother, Enzo.  \"The time ahead will be a difficult period for us. We hope that the media will respect our privacy,\" they added.  The family had been celebrating the parents' twelve-and-a-half year wedding anniversary, a Dutch custom.  Dutch foreign ministry officials said the boy, accompanied by his aunt and uncle and a doctor, would return to the Netherlands on Saturday morning.  Sedig Benzala, the head of the team caring for him, said Ruben was recovering well after a four-and-a-half hour operation to repair multiple fractures to his legs.  The Airbus 330 - carrying 93 passengers and 11 crew - crashed on Wednesday morning as it arrived from <em>Johannesburg</em>, South Africa.  The plane's flight recorders have been sent to Paris for examination It is not clear what caused the plane to crash just short of the runway as it approached Tripoli airport.  The head of the investigation team said the pilot had not reported any problems.  \"Until the very last moment things were normal between the pilot and the control tower,\" Neji Dhaou told AFP news agency. Dutch, French, South African and US experts are helping Libya with the investigation.  Dutch forensic experts are helping to identify the bodies.  Most of the passengers on the flight were from the Netherlands.",

            "en": "Sorry Blatter to reconsider technology       Sepp Blatter revealed he has apologized to England and admitted FIFA will now be forced to look again at goal-line technology. Lampard's disallowed goal during England's 4-1 defeat to Germany has led to renewed calls for the introduction of technology. FIFA had ruled this out as recently as Saturday - the day before the controversy erupted - but Blatter conceded FIFA would have to make an about-turn on the issue. Sunday night's match between Argentina and Mexico had also thrown up a controversial incident, with Carlos Tevez scoring the opening goal from a blatantly offside position, but Blatter said only goal-line technology would be discussed and not video replays. The FIFA president told a media briefing in <em>Johannesburg</em>: \"It is obvious that after the experience so far in this World Cup it would be a nonsense to not reopen the file of technology at the business meeting of the International FA Board in July. \"Personally I deplore it when you see evident referee mistakes but it's not the end of a competition or the end of football, this can happen. \"They were not five-star games for the referees. The only thing I can do is yesterday I have spoken to the two federations [England and Mexico] directly concerned by referees mistakes. I have expressed to them apologies and I understand they are not happy and that people are criticising. \"We will naturally take on board the discussion on technology and will have the first opportunity in July at the business meeting.\" Blatter added: \"It happened in 1966 and then 44 years later - though it was not quite the same. \"I apologised to England and Mexico. The English said 'thank you and accepted that you can win [some] and you lose [some], and the Mexicans bowed their head and accepted it.\" The FIFA president added the IFAB would not consider video replays of all incidents. Blatter said: \"The only principle we are going to bring back for discussion is goal-line technology. \"Football is a game that never stops. For situations like the Mexico game you don't need technology.\" Blatter added that FIFA would launch a new drive to improve refereeing standards at the top level later this year. \"We will come out with a new model in November on how to improve high level referees,\" he added. \"We will start with a new concept of how to improve match control. I cannot disclose more of what we are doing but something has to be changed.\" Blatter also warned French president Nicolas Sarkozy France risks suspension from football if he interferes in the running of the game in that country. Sarkozy has promised to personally head an investigation into France's fiasco at the World Cup where the players boycotted training and failed to win a match. FIFA rules forbid government interference in the running of national associations and Blatter said: \"Political interference in the national associations will be dealt with by FIFA no matter the size of the country. \"French football can rely on FIFA in case of political interference even if it's at the presidential level. \"France made an 'affaire d'etat' of football but it remains in the hands of the federation.\" French Football Federation president Jean-Pierre Escalettes resigned his position yesterday as a result of the World Cup controversy.",

            "en": "2010 FIFA World Cup\u2122 - Key players          Claudia Wong spots three key players from each group at the 2010 FIFA World Cup\u2122. Group A South Africa Steven Pienaar Described as their \u2018best player by an absolute mile' by Everton Manager David Moyes, Steven Pienaar is the star player of the South African national team.  He brings not only his outstanding skills to the fore, but also his European experience at Everton.  Backed by the home crowd, the \u2018Mighty Peanut' is sure to deliver with his adept left foot and fast pace.  The pride of <em>Johannesburg</em>, he looks set to fly his country's colours at this year's World Cup on home soil. Uruguay Diego Forlan Born into a family of football stars, Diego Forlan's father and grandfather played for Uruguay and Independiente in Argentina.  As top scorer in 2005 with Villarreal and Atletico Madrid in 2009, Forlan scored a hat-trick against Peru in the South American qualifiers.  Uruguay's hopes will rely solely on this forward to showcase his two-footedness in South Africa. France William Gallas During his days as a Chelsea player, William Gallas formed an impregnable partnership with John Terry, before moving on to become a key player for Arsene Wenger's Arsenal side.  At the center of defense, any player seeking to sneak past France will have to face the experienced might of the Frenchman.  Group B Argentina Lionel Messi Debuting in the 2004-05 season, Lionel Messi broke the La Liga record for the youngest footballer to appear in a league game, and the youngest to score a league goal.  His power, balance, strength and versatility makes Messi an integral part of Barcelona's dominance in Spain and Europe over the last few seasons.  Living up to the Argentine number ten shirt, Messi wore this jersey for the first time in the FIFA World Cup\u2122 qualifier against Venezuela. Goals from Messi are sure to come in South Africa. Nigeria John Michael Ncekwube Obinna Carlo Ancelotti, Chelsea's current manager and a former Italian midfielder, claims that with regard to playing characteristics, John Michael Ncekwube Obinna, more commonly known as Mikel, plays like himself.  He impressed Jose Mourinho in the first week at Chelsea, and has exceeded expectations.  Able to disrupt attacks and spread play, Mikel's presence in the 2010 FIFA World Cup\u2122 will stir up and unite hopes in the hearts of Nigerians.   South Korea Park Ji-Sung Asia's pride, Park Ji-Sung was the star in the 2002 World Cup\u2122 where South Korea advanced to the semi-finals, scoring the match winner against Portugal.  Kick-starting his career as a defensive midfielder, Park is the only Korean to win the UEFA Champions League and the first Asian to ever play in a final of such a tournament.  His speed, skill and never-say-die attitude make him an indispensible and a legendary team captain of the gutsy South Korean side. Group C England John Terry John Terry led Chelsea to two Premier League titles in 2004-05 with an excellent defensive record ever in football League history. His experience in the centre-back role, ability to read the game well from the back and his flawless defensive skills made him the only English player to make the all-star squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup\u2122.  Although he will not be captaining the English side this World Cup\u2122, his sterling performance will be fundamental to the Three Lions hopes. United States of America Clinton Drew Dempsey Scored the only goal by a US player in the 2006 World Cup\u2122, Clinton Drew Dempsey portrays versatility and style in the midfield.  He brings his Fulham experience, tenacity in approaching goal, and excellent dribbling skills to the table.  His spirit of perseverance in playing games through injuries will only bring his team further in the World Cup\u2122. Slovenia Milivoje Novakovic Scoring five goals in qualifiers, Milivoje Novakovic is Slovenia's forward to mark.  He was remembered for his brilliant hat-trick against Trinidad and Tobago.  Slovenia will need Novakovic to be at his sharpest if they are to progress from Group C. Group D Germany Miroslav Klose All of Miroslav Klose's five goals in the 2002 World Cup\u2122 were headers, and he holds the only record for scoring five goals each in consecutive World Cups\u2122. Having won the golden boot in the 2006 World Cup\u2122, he was also one of the two players from the All-Star Team of 2002 to make it again to the All-Star Team of the 2006 World Cup\u2122.  Bayern Munich's heading machine, he also provides good assists and has an innate instinct to make the most of his chances. Serbia Nemanja Vidic Part of the \u2018Famous Four' of Serbia's defence, Nemanja Vidic's aggressiveness on the pitch and perfectly timed tackles caused his side to let in only one goal in the ten-game qualification of the 2006 World Cup\u2122.  In his 2008-09 season with Manchester United, he had a Premiership-record of 14 consecutive clean sheets.  His ability to turn defense into effective counter-attacks makes him an exceptional player. Ghana Michael Kojo Essien A formidable midfield presence, Michael Kojo Essien is Ghana's national hero.  Not afraid to unleash his shooting prowess from the distance, Essien is an all-rounder who excels in defensive play too.  His versatility has deployed him to several roles both defensively and offensively, and his opponents are often wary of him.  The energy, spirit and attitude he puts into every play is more than commendable. Group E Netherlands Dirk Kuyt Having boundless energy and a high work rate, Dirk Kuyt makes excellent assists with his crossing and angled runs in attack.  A selfless player, he tracks back to aid in defense and is always on his feet for any chance at goal.  Scoring three in the 2010 World Cup\u2122 qualifiers, he is a danger in the box to opposing defenders.  Denmark Christian Bager Poulsen Christian Bager Poulsen's two-footed passing ability and charismatic presence makes him a national team favourite.  His playmaking skills and determination on the pitch to destroy even the best attacks all reek of his talent.  He has his aggressive bouts of temper, including the infamous Rosenbeg punch, which have led to disciplinary records, but as a player, he has grown and matured.  He was also the first player to win Danish Player of the Year awards consecutively in 2005-06. Japan Shunsuke Nakamura The hopes of Japan in this World Cup\u2122 lie on the shoulders of Shunsuke Nakamura, famous for his trusty left-foot and accurate free-kick taking abilities.  Named the Most Valuable Player in the 2004 Asian Cup, he was the first Japanese player and second Asian to score in the UEFA Champions League.  Japan is by far the most successful Asian team having won the Asian Cup thrice, and is looking forward to doing Asian football proud in the World Cup\u2122. Group F Italy Gianluigi Buffon Awarded his first Italy cap at the age of 19, Gianluigi Buffon has kept five clean sheets and denied goals to any attacker in the 2006 World Cup\u2122 finals.  He is the epitome of all goalkeeping ability, skill and positional sense.  Guarding the goalmouth with his accuracy in stopping and blocking shots, knowing when to come off the line and when to stay back has led to him attaining Serie A Goalkeeper of the Year a record of nine times. Paraguay Roque Santa Cruz A tall and powerfully built physique gives Roque Santa Cruz the pace to whiz around and have an edge over any defender.  Ambitious with a winning attitude, Cruz's touch often converts into goals and victories.  This Manchester City striker's determination to score made him one of Paraguay's top scorers in the 2010 FIFA World Cup\u2122 qualifiers. New Zealand Ryan Nelsen Captaining the All Whites and as centre-back of Blackburn Rovers, Ryan Nelsen exudes outstanding defensive capabilities.  Five clean sheets in the qualification rounds all speak of his defensive resilience.  They have a relatively easy route than the other Asian World Cup\u2122 participants, and might possibly be this year's underdog team to root for. Group G Brazil Ricardo Izecson dos Santos Leite Kaka's speed, intelligence with the ball and mastery on both feet enables him to weave through midfield, slip past defenders, and find the back of the net repeatedly. Flashy footwork, composure, and an eye for goal are all part of his goal-scoring prowess. Successes at AC Milan and Real Madrid have caused many to rate him as the best player on the planet. Cote D'Ivoire Didier Yves Drogba Tebily Having a slightly later start in his football career, Didier Drogba has muscled his way into prominence with goalscoring determination.  Drogba's pace, strength, aerial accuracy contributes to his assists from both the left and right side of the pitch. An inspiring captain, he helped his team qualify for their first ever World Cup\u2122 in 2006 in Germany.  Named 2009 African Footballer of the Year, this was his second win of this award. Portugal Cristiano Ronaldo Cristiano Ronaldo's trademark stepovers, quick turning, and tricky bypasses leave his opponents tripping over their own feet.  In addition, Ronaldo is the most expensive player in the history of football. An asset to Real Madrid, the goals he contributed are certainly worth the price.  He has many awards to his name, including Manchester United's first Ballon d'Or in 40 years and FIFA World Player of the Year in 2008. Group H Spain Fernando Jose Torres Sanz El Nino, the hero that scored the winner for Spain in the Euro 2008 Final, is in the cream of the crop among today's football stars.  Whenever he plays he is bound to score, fully utilizing his lightning pace, sharp twists and turns, and overpowering skill.  Moving from Atletico Madrid to Liverpool, he is a star wherever he goes. This FIFA World Cup\u2122, Spain's number nine is one to look out for. Switzerland Alexander Frei Switzerland's captain and all-time top scorer, Alexander Frei currently plays for FC Basel.  A steady player who never fails to assist and contribute last-minute goals, Frei is an inspiring leader and an able team player at the same time.  Swiss Footballer of the Year in 2004 and 2007, his country will be depending on him to put in some goals. Chile Mark Gonzalez Burning down the left flanks, Mark Gonzalez is nicknamed \"Speedy Gonzalez\". Having stints at Real Betis, Liverpool and Club Deportivo Universidad Catolica, he has a wealth of experience, including being the highest-capped player in the squad. Born in South Africa but moving on to Chile later on, Gonzalez looks set to score in the country he was born in.",
