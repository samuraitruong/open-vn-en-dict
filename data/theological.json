According to the results of a new survey of 3,000 people, dream control, or \u201clucid dreaming\u201d may be a real thing. In fact, 64.9 percent of participants reported being aware they were dreaming within a dream, and 34 percent said they can sometimes control what happens in their dreams. Taking charge of the content of your dreams isn\u2019t a skill everyone has, but it can be developed, says Kelly Bulkeley, PhD, a dream researcher and visiting scholar at the Graduate <em>Theological</em> Union in Berkley, California. The technique is particularly useful for people who suffer from recurring nightmares, he says. Dr. Bulkeley suggests giving yourself a pep talk of sorts before you go to sleep by saying: \u201cIf I have that dream again, I\u2019m going to try to remember that\u2019s it\u2019s only a dream, and be aware of that.\u201d When you learn to be aware that you are dreaming - within a dream - you not only have the power to steer yourself away from the monster and into the arms of Brad Pitt, for instance, but you train your mind to avoid nightmares in the first place. \u201cLucid dreaming enhances your ability to learn from the dream state,\u201d says Dr. Bulkeley.",

            "en": "Teachers\u2019 Day           In some countries, Teachers' Days are intended to be special days for the appreciation of teachers. Some of them are holidays while others are celebrated during working days. A day that is dedicated to the hard work that is input by the teacher all year long, a day that is a complete tribute to the teachers all around India. In India teacher\u2019s day is celebrated on 5th of September. Teacher\u2019s Day is a dedication to Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, who was a staunch believer of education and was one of the most well known diplomat, scholar, president of India and above all a teacher. As a tribute to this great teacher, his birthday has been observed as teachers' day and this led to its origin.  This day is just a mere reflection of Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan's love for and attachment to the teaching profession. As a matter of fact Dr. Radhakrishnan himself asked his admirers to celebrate his birthday not as his birthday but as the teacher's day. His work varied on philosophical, <em>theological</em>, ethical, educational, social and cultural subjects. He contributed numerous articles to different well-known journals, which, are of immense value and seems to surprise various readers because of the depth in the meaning of the articles. Teacher's day is now one of the occasion that is looked forward by the teachers and students alike as on this occasion its not only when teachers are praised but also around various schools students dress up as a representation of their teachers and take various lectures that are assigned to the teachers they represent. On this day students realize what it means to be a teacher and what it means to control the future of several students in their classes and also teachers are reminded what it felt like when they were the students. Apart from the fun aspect everybody should pay their respects to the great Dr. Radhakrishnan. Since that day this event have become a regular event. Apart from the fun aspect of the day it is also a day when one can look back and admire and get inspired by Dr. Radhakrishnan, a small town cunning boy, who grew up to become one of the most respected politicians in the history of democracy of India. Teachers' Days Celebrated in Working Days India September 5 is Teacher's Day in India. It is the birthday of second President of India and teacher Dr. Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan. When Dr. Radhakrishnan became the president of India in 1962, some of his students and friends approached him and requested him to allow them to celebrate 5 September, his birthday. In reply, Dr. Radhakrishnan said, \"Instead of celebrating my birthday separately, it would be my proud privilege if September 5 is observed as \"Teachers Day\". This is not a holiday in India. It is considered a \"celebration\" day, where teachers and students report to school as usual but the usual activities and classes are replaced by activities of celebration, thanking and remembrance. At some schools on this day, the responsibility of teaching is taken up by the senior students as an appreciation for their teachers. Traditionally, people in India have given tremendous respect and honor to teachers. An old Indian saying (usually taught to children), ranks teacher in the third place, even before God: \"'Maata, Pitha, Guru, Daivam'\", meaning Mother, Father and Teacher is God.
