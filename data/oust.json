There are also reports of police casualties in the battle. The Taliban say they carried out the attack.  A number of men armed with rocket propelled grenades and automatic weapons stormed the centre. Tens of thousands of Afghan police and troops are being trained to assume full security control once Nato leaves. Afghan forces are frequently targeted by the Taliban and their allies who want to <em>oust</em> the Western-backed government of Hamid Karzai in Kabul.  Kandahar has experienced some of the worst of the violence in Afghanistan in recent years and is seen as the spiritual homeland of the Taliban. 'Fragile progress'  The gun battle inside the police training and recruitment centre lasted more than an hour.  Witnesses heard a number of explosions. Reports say one or more suicide bombers could have been involved. The area was sealed off and helicopters were seen flying overhead. Kandahar has seen a number of insurgent attacks on police in recent months.  In February, 19 people were killed in an assault on the city's police headquarters.  The BBC's Paul Wood in Kabul says Nato carried out a big operation in Kandahar and the surrounding area last year - halting and then reversing the Taliban's momentum, according to senior officers. Nato officers acknowledge, however, that progress is \"fragile\". Police and government officials are still regularly targeted.  The fighting season - as it is known - is also about to begin and all sides are expecting the level of violence to increase, our correspondent adds.",

When local people there came out to protest last week, they were fired on from a huge army base in the centre of the city with heavy artillery, including anti-aircraft guns. In response, they simply took on the army, with homemade petrol bombs. They loaded construction site vehicles with petrol and rammed them against the walls of the barracks, and ground down the troops inside. After two or three days of bitter fighting - with the aid of some defection from the government side - they took the base, defeating some of the country's most elite forces. It is now a kind of local tourist attraction, people are wandering around looking at what was inside. 'Gunfire all around'  By Monday, Benghazi was safely in opposition hands but it is tense because of the bitterness of the fighting. People say 300 protesters and 120 members of the government forces were killed.  There is also a worry that government supporters may be hunkered down here, hoping for better days, and that prisoners have escaped and may loot. Benghazi is now in the control of a committee of judges, lawyers, business people and academics. They are running the city from the local court house. They have put up signs everywhere urging people to go back to work - urging bakers and pharmacists, even government employees to get the place going again. And on the face of it, it does seem to be working. Someone joked that the traffic is running more smoothly, and people driving more carefully, than they were under Col Gaddafi. Some people from the city have armed themselves with looted weapons. Those people are now heading west, to <em>oust</em> Col Gaddafi's forces from their remaining strongholds in the rest of the country. Benghazi is also a big centre for the evacuation of foreign nationals. There are thousands and thousands of foreigners of all nationalities at the port. As word spread that the British Navy frigate HMS Cumberland was arriving there, British citizens began arriving from across Libya. Despite criticism of the British government's slow response to the crisis, the commander of the ship, Cpt Steve Dainton, said they had made all speed to get here. \"From all points of view we've reacted very quickly,\" he said.  \"In that time from three days ago we've managed to head up to Crete, take a suck of fuel, embark a whole heap of stores and extra personnel and be down here, which I think is a pretty fast response.\" Some workers had travelled hundreds of miles from remote desert compounds in southern Libya, some had just come from the city. All were delighted the Royal Navy had come to rescue them. Sue Rogers said she had been in Benghazi itself, and heard the battles. \"It was gunfire all around,\" she told the BBC. \"All the smoke was happening at the military installations all around. It started off just with simple gunfire and then it got worse, with heavy artillery fire.\" HMS Cumberland took around 200 British Nationals out of Libya.

            "en": "Suicide Bomber Attacks Afghan Defense Ministry         KABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 An insurgent wearing an Afghan Army uniform and a vest laced with explosives opened fire inside the heavily fortified Ministry of Defense headquarters on Monday, killing at least two soldiers, a ministry spokesman said.  A spokesman for the Taliban, which claimed responsibility for the attack, said the intended target was France\u2019s minister of defense, G\u00e9rard Longuet, who was scheduled to visit the compound later in the day. Soldiers shot the attacker before he could detonate his vest, said the Afghan military spokesman, Gen. Zahir Azimi.  The attack was the third in three days on government compounds by insurgents disguised as members of the Afghan national security forces. Their seemingly easy access to even the most heavily guarded locations has intensified concerns over Taliban infiltration of the police and military forces, just as they are preparing to take over security from the American-led coalition in some parts of the country this summer and the entire country by the end of 2014.  Zabiullah Mujaheed, a Taliban spokesman, said the insurgent was from Panjshir Province \u2014 the heartland of the Northern Alliance, which helped the United States <em>oust</em> the Taliban in 2001 \u2014 and had been serving in the Afghan Army for three years.  But General Azimi said such assertions were premature. \u201cWe don\u2019t know whether he was a member of the army or not,\u201d he said. \u201cAll I can say is that he was wearing an Afghan National Army uniform. It doesn\u2019t mean he was an army soldier. We are doing our investigation to find out.\u201d  General Azimi said the attacker entered the compound about 11:30 a.m. and opened fire, killing two soldiers and wounding seven close to the defense minister\u2019s office before being fatally shot. An explosives ordnance team then defused his vest. The defense minister, Abdul Rahim Wardak, was not present at the time, General Azimi said.  Soldiers continued searching the compound, which covers several city blocks in downtown Kabul, looking for other possible attackers late in the afternoon. Contrary to earlier reports, the general said no hostages had been taken. A doctor at Kabul\u2019s military hospital said three soldiers had been killed; there was no immediate explanation for the discrepancy in the death toll.  Mr. Longuet, who had arrived on Sunday to meet with French troops deployed here, was not in the ministry at the time of the attack, according to the military command in Paris. He had been scheduled to attend a joint news conference with Afghan military officials at 1:30 p.m.  It was the latest in a string of attacks aimed at Afghan government and military officials in what the Taliban has called the beginning of its spring offensive. On Saturday, a suicide bomber killed five NATO service members in eastern Afghanistan. A day earlier, a suicide bomber killed the police chief of Kandahar Province. In both attacks, the bombers were dressed in Afghan Army or police uniforms.  \u00a0\u201cUsing these kinds of attacks is very useful for us in recruiting someone and working inside Afghan forces,\u201d Mr. Mujaheed, the Taliban spokesman, said in a telephone interview after Saturday\u2019s attack. \u201cThis inflicts more casualties and does not cause any civilian casualties.\u201d  He added, \u201cWe have many more youths who are already in Afghan military ranks waiting for their chance to attack.\u201d  General Azimi said the government was working to root out insurgents from the army and police forces, but acknowledged that the task was daunting. \u201cWe have set up a security team who is watching suspicious people inside military forces, but it\u2019s hard to recognize them,\u201d he said.  Even when they are not in the military, insurgents have easy access to police and army uniforms, General Azimi said. An elder in a remote village in the eastern province of Paktika, along the Pakistan border, recently told a reporter for The New York Times that insurgents had been showing up in his village dressed in Afghan Army and police uniforms.  \u00a0\u201cYou know, finding uniforms is easy,\u201d General Azimi said. \u201cThey can find it anywhere, and they can make it. People sell military equipment in the bazaar. We have collected and confiscated uniforms several times, but again it\u2019s hard to collect all of them. Besides, you can find them in the provinces as well.\u201d  The attack on the Defense Ministry was just part of a bloody two days for Afghan security forces. In Ghazni Province, south of the capital, six police officers were killed when their vehicle struck a roadside bomb, said Musa Khan Akbar Zada, the provincial police chief.  Three more police officers were killed Sunday night in Oruzgan Province when their vehicle struck an improvised explosive device, said the provincial police chief, Fazal Ahmad Shirzad.",

Mr Correa remains in hospital amid reports of fresh violence outside and government claims that security forces will not allow the president to leave. Troops also took over Quito's airport, forcing it to close for hours.  Unrest has been reported across Ecuador amid anger at a new law cutting benefits for public servants. Supporters said security forces were not allowing the president to leave the police hospital, where he went for treatment after being hit by teargas. The minister responsible for security, Miguel Carvajal, said at least one person was killed and several others were injured during the unrest, but this could not be immediately confirmed.  Mr Correa has received strong support from governments throughout the Americas, with a string of Latin American nations and the US all speaking up for the embattled president. In other developments on Thursday:  Police officers erect road blocks in Quito, Guayaquil and Cuenca. Several government buildings are occupied  Looting is reported in the capital and Guayaquil. Banks are robbed, while schools and businesses close due to the lack of security The head of the armed forces declares its loyalty to the president \nVenezuela's president claims Mr Correa is \"in danger of being killed\" \n \nPeru and Colombia close their borders with Ecuador in solidarity.\n  The drama began on Thursday morning when members of the armed forces and police angry at the austerity measures occupied several barracks and set up road blocks across the country. TV stations showed images of police setting tyres on fire in the streets of Quito, Guayaquil and other cities. The National Assembly building was also occupied. In a speech to soldiers from Quito's main barracks, President Correa said: \"If you want to kill the president, here he is. Kill him, if you want to. Kill him if you are brave enough. \"If you want to seize the barracks, if you want to leave citizens undefended, if you want to betray the mission of the police force, go ahead. But this government will do what has to be done. This president will not take a step back.\" However, Mr Correa was forced to flee the barracks wearing a gas mask shortly afterwards when tear gas was fired by the protesters.  The president was later treated for the effects of the gas at a police hospital, from where he told local media that he had been \"attacked\". \"They threw tear gas at us. One exploded near my face. It stunned me and my wife for a few seconds, probably minutes,\" he said. \"I had to put on a gas mask and some cowards took it off me so I would suffocate. \"I mean they shot at the president - it's incredible - our security forces, our national police.\" \"It is a coup attempt led by the opposition and certain sections of the armed forces and the police,\" he added. \"Whatever happens to me I want to express my love for my family and my homeland.\" He blamed the Patriotic Society Party (PSP), led by Lucio Gutierrez, for fomenting the unrest, and said \"all bad elements\" in the police force would \"be removed\". 'Kidnapped'  Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez later reported that Mr Correa had told him by telephone from the hospital \"that once he had left he would be very happy to receive [the protesters], but that they had kidnapped him, and he would not give in to blackmail\". \"They are trying to <em>oust</em> President Correa. Wake up the people of the Bolivarian Alliance! Wake up the people of Unasur [Union of South American Nations]! Viva Correa!,\" Mr Chavez wrote in a message on Twitter. Police later fired tear gas at supporters of the president who tried to break up their protest at the hospital, witnesses said. Meanwhile, about 300 air force personnel and soldiers took control of the runway at Quito's Mariscal Sucre International Airport, causing flights to be grounded. The airport later re-opened, the mayor of Quito told reporters. The protesters were carrying signs demanding the government give more respect to the military over benefits, witnesses said. The US embassy said Guayaquil's airport was also closed and warned US citizens to \"stay in their homes or current location, if safe\". Despite the unrest, the head of Armed Forces Joint Command, Gen Luis Ernesto Gonzalez Villarreal, said the troops remained loyal. \"We live in a state which is governed by laws, and we are subordinate to the highest authority which is the president of the republic,\" he said. \"We will take whatever appropriate action the government decides on.\" Looting The country's central bank chief, Diego Borja, meanwhile urged its citizens not to withdraw money from banks amid reports of looting. Many schools and business were also closed because of the unrest. A BBC News website reader in Guayaquil, Andrea M, said: \"Thieves have taken advantage of this situation, and started attacking people in the streets. Now, most people are at their homes, waiting to see what happens with the government.\" Several leaders in the region expressed their support for Mr Correa, as did the Organisation of American States (OAS). Its Secretary-General Miguel Insulza called the situation \"a coup d'etat in the making\". Peru and Colombia both closed borders with Ecuador, while the US said it backed Mr Correa and was \"closely monitoring\" the situation. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said he was deeply concerned for the president and called for a peaceful resolution to the crisis. On Wednesday, one minister said President Correa was considering disbanding Congress because members of his Country Alliance had threatened to block proposals to shrink the bureaucracy. Ecuador's two-year-old constitution allows the president declare an impasse and rule by decree until new elections. However, such a move would have to be approved by the Constitutional Court.  Ecuador has a history of political instability. Protests toppled three presidents during economic turmoil in the decade before Mr Correa, a 47-year-old US-trained economist, took power in 2007. He was re-elected to a second term in 2009 despite a decision to default on $3.2bn of global bonds causing widespread fiscal problems for the government. Mr Correa declared the debt \"illegitimate\". http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11447519",
