But if it had to perish twice,  I think I know enough of hate  To say that for destruction ice  Is also great  And would suffice.  Robert Frost    PREFACE  All our attempts at subterfuge had been in vain.  With ice in my heart, I watched him prepare to defend me. His intense concentration betrayed no hint of doubt, though he was outnumbered. I knew that we could expect no help \u2014 at this moment, his family was fighting for their lives just as surely as he was for ours.    Would I ever learn the outcome of that other fight? Find out who the winners and the losers were?  Would I live long enough for that?  The odds of that didn\u2019t look so great.  Black eyes, wild with their fierce craving for my death, watched for the moment when my protector\u2019s attention would be diverted. The moment when I would surely die.  Somewhere, far, far away in the cold forest, a wolf howled.    1. ULTIMATUM  Bella,  I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re making Charlie carry notes to Billy like we\u2019re in second grade \u2014 if I wanted to talk to you I would answer them  You made the choice here, okay? You can\u2019t have it both ways when  What part of \u201cmortal enemies\u201d is too complicated for you to  Look, I know I\u2019m being a jerk, but there\u2019s just no way around  We can\u2019t be friends when you\u2019re spending all your time with a bunch of  It just makes it worse when I think about you too much, so don\u2019t write anymore  Yeah, I miss you, too. A lot. Doesn\u2019t change anything. Sorry.  Jacob     I ran my fingers across the page, feeling the dents where he had pressed the pen to the paper so hard that it had nearly broken through. I could picture him writing this \u2014 scrawling the angry letters in his rough handwriting, slashing through line after line when the words came out wrong, maybe even snapping the pen in his too-big hand; that would explain the ink splatters. I could imagine the frustration pulling his black eyebrows together and crumpling his forehead. If I\u2019d been there, I might have laughed. Don\u2019t give yourself a brain hemorrhage, Jacob, I would have told him. Just spit it out.     Laughing was the last thing I felt like doing now as I reread the words I\u2019d already memorized. His answer to my pleading note \u2014 passed from Charlie to Billy to him, just like second grade, as he\u2019d pointed out \u2014 was no surprise. I\u2019d known the essence of what it would say before I\u2019d opened it. What was surprising was how much each crossed-out line wounded me \u2014 as if the points of the letters had cutting edges. More than that, behind each angry beginning lurked a vast pool of hurt; Jacob\u2019s pain cut me deeper than my own.     While I was pondering this, I caught the unmistakable scent of a smoking burner rising from the kitchen. In another house, the fact that someone besides myself was cooking might not be a cause for panicking. I shoved the wrinkled paper into my back pocket and ran, making it downstairs in the nick of time. The jar of spaghetti sauce Charlie\u2019d stuck in the microwave was only on its first revolution when I yanked the door open and pulled it out.     \u201cWhat did I do wrong?\u201d Charlie demanded.  \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to take the lid off first, Dad. Metal\u2019s bad for microwaves.\u201d I swiftly removed the lid as I spoke, poured half the sauce into a bowl, and then put the bowl inside the microwave and the jar back in the fridge; I fixed the time and pressed start.  Charlie watched my adjustments with pursed lips. \u201cDid I get the noodles right?\u201d  I looked in the pan on the stove \u2014 the source of the smell that had alerted me. \u201cStirring helps,\u201d I said mildly. I found a spoon and tried to de-clump the mushy hunk that was scalded to the bottom.  Charlie sighed.     \u201cSo what\u2019s all this about?\u201d I asked him.  He folded his arms across his chest and glared out the back windows into the <em>sheeting</em> rain. \u201cDon\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d he grumbled.  I was mystified. Charlie cooking? And what was with the surly attitude? Edward wasn\u2019t here yet; usually my dad reserved this kind of behavior for my boyfriend\u2019s benefit, doing his best to illustrate the theme of \u201cunwelcome\u201d with every word and posture. Charlie\u2019s efforts were unnecessary \u2014 Edward knew exactly what my dad was thinking without the show.      The word boyfriend had me chewing on the inside of my cheek with a familiar tension while I stirred. It wasn\u2019t the right word, not at all. I needed something more expressive of eternal commitment. . . . But words like destiny and fate sounded hokey when you used them in casual conversation.     Edward had another word in mind, and that word was the source of the tension I felt. It put my teeth on edge just to think it to myself. Fianc\u00e9e. Ugh. I shuddered away from the thought.  \u201cDid I miss something? Since when do you make dinner?\u201d I asked Charlie. The pasta lump bobbed in the boiling water as I poked it. \u201cOr try to make dinner, I should say.\u201d  Charlie shrugged. \u201cThere\u2019s no law that says I can\u2019t cook in my own house.\u201d     \u201cYou would know,\u201d I replied, grinning as I eyed the badge pinned to his leather jacket.  \u201cHa. Good one.\u201d He shrugged out of the jacket as if my glance had reminded him he still had it on, and hung it on the peg reserved for his gear. His gun belt was already slung in place \u2014 he hadn\u2019t felt the need to wear that to the station for a few weeks. There had been no more disturbing disappearances to trouble the small town of Forks, Washington, no more sightings of the giant, mysterious wolves in the ever-rainy woods. . . .      I prodded the noodles in silence, guessing that Charlie would get around to talking about whatever was bothering him in his own time. My dad was not a man of many words, and the effort he had put into trying to orchestrate a sit-down dinner with me made it clear there were an uncharacteristic number of words on his mind.  I glanced at the clock routinely - something I did every few minutes around this time. Less than a half hour to go now.    Afternoons were the hardest part of my day. Ever since my former best friend (and werewolf), Jacob Black, had informed on me about the motorcycle I\u2019d been riding on the sly \u2014 a betrayal he had devised in order to get me grounded so that I couldn\u2019t spend time with my boyfriend (and vampire), Edward Cullen \u2014 Edward had been allowed to see me only from seven till nine-thirty p.m., always inside the confines of my home and under the supervision of my dad\u2019s unfailingly crabby glare.     This was an escalation from the previous, slightly less stringent grounding that I\u2019d earned for an unexplained three-day disappearance and one episode of cliff diving.     Of course, I still saw Edward at school, because there wasn\u2019t anything Charlie could do about that. And then, Edward spent almost every night in my room, too, but Charlie wasn\u2019t precisely aware of that. Edward\u2019s ability to climb easily and silently through my second-story window was almost as useful as his ability to read Charlie\u2019s mind.     Though the afternoon was the only time I spent away from Edward, it was enough to make me restless, and the hours always dragged. Still, I endured my punishment without complaining because \u2014 for one thing \u2014 I knew I\u2019d earned it, and \u2014 for another \u2014 because I couldn\u2019t bear to hurt my dad by moving out now, when a much more permanent separation hovered, invisible to Charlie, so close on my horizon.    My dad sat down at the table with a grunt and unfolded the damp newspaper there; within seconds he was clucking his tongue in disapproval.  \u201cI don\u2019t know why you read the news, Dad. It only ticks you off.\u201d  He ignored me, grumbling at the paper in his hands. \u201cThis is why everyone wants to live in a small town! Ridiculous.\u201d  \u201cWhat have big cities done wrong now?\u201d  \u201cSeattle\u2019s making a run for murder capital of the country. Five unsolved homicides in the last two weeks. Can you imagine living like that?\u201d      \u201cI think Phoenix is actually higher up the homicide list, Dad. I have lived like that.\u201d And I\u2019d never come close to being a murder victim until after I moved to his safe little town. In fact, I was still on several hit lists. . . . The spoon shook in my hands, making the water tremble. \u201cWell, you couldn\u2019t pay me enough,\u201d Charlie said.     I gave up on saving dinner and settled for serving it; I had to use a steak knife to cut a portion of spaghetti for Charlie and then myself, while he watched with a sheepish expression. Charlie coated his helping with sauce and dug in. I disguised my own clump as well as I could and followed his example without much enthusiasm. We ate in silence for a moment. Charlie was still scanning the news, so I picked up my much-abused copy of Wuthering Heights from where I\u2019d left it this morning at breakfast, and tried to lose myself in turn-of-the-century England while I waited for him to start talking.     I was just to the part where Heathcliff returns when Charlie cleared his throat and threw the paper to the floor.  \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Charlie said. \u201cI did have a reason for doing this.\u201d He waved his fork at the gluey spread.  \u201cI wanted to talk to you.\u201d  I laid the book aside; the binding was so destroyed that it slumped flat to the table. \u201cYou could have just asked.\u201d  He nodded, his eyebrows pulling together. \u201cYeah. I\u2019ll remember that next time. I thought taking dinner off your hands would soften you up.\u201d     I laughed. \u201cIt worked \u2014 your cooking skills have me soft as a marshmallow. What do you need, Dad?\u201d  \u201cWell, it\u2019s about Jacob.\u201d  I felt my face harden. \u201cWhat about him?\u201d I asked through stiff lips.  \u201cEasy, Bells. I know you\u2019re still upset that he told on you, but it was the right thing. He was being responsible.\u201d  \u201cResponsible,\u201d I repeated scathingly, rolling my eyes. \u201cRight. So, what about Jacob?\u201d  The careless question repeated inside my head, anything but trivial.What about Jacob? What was I going to do about him? My former best friend who was now . . . what? My enemy? I cringed.    Charlie\u2019s face was suddenly wary. \u201cDon\u2019t get mad at me, okay?\u201d  \u201cMad?\u201d  \u201cWell, it\u2019s about Edward, too.\u201d  My eyes narrowed.  Charlie\u2019s voice got gruffer. \u201cI let him in the house, don\u2019t I?\u201d  \u201cYou do,\u201d I admitted. \u201cFor brief periods of time. Of course, you might let me out of the house for brief periods now and then, too,\u201d I continued \u2014 only jokingly; I knew I was on lockdown for the duration of the school year. \u201cI\u2019ve been pretty good lately.\u201d  \u201cWell, that\u2019s kind of where I was heading with this. . . .\u201d And then Charlie\u2019s face stretched into an unexpected eye-crinkling grin; for a second he looked twenty years younger.     I saw a dim glimmer of possibility in that smile, but I proceeded slowly. \u201cI\u2019m confused, Dad. Are we talking about Jacob, or Edward, or me being grounded?\u201d  The grin flashed again. \u201cSort of all three.\u201d  \u201cAnd how do they relate?\u201d I asked, cautious.  \u201cOkay.\u201d He sighed, raising his hands as if in surrender. \u201cSo I\u2019m thinking maybe you deserve a parole for good behavior. For a teenager, you\u2019re amazingly non-whiney.\u201d  My voice and eyebrows shot up. \u201cSeriously? I\u2019m free?\u201d  Where was this coming from? I\u2019d been positive I would be under house arrest until I actually moved out, and Edward hadn\u2019t picked up any wavering in Charlie\u2019s thoughts. . . .     Charlie held up one finger. \u201cConditionally.\u201d  The enthusiasm vanished. \u201cFantastic,\u201d I groaned.  \u201cBella, this is more of a request than a demand, okay? You\u2019re free. But I\u2019m hoping you\u2019ll use that freedom . . . judiciously.\u201d  \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d  He sighed again. \u201cI know you\u2019re satisfied to spend all of your time with Edward \u2014\u201d  \u201cI spend time with Alice, too,\u201d I interjected. Edward\u2019s sister had no hours of visitation; she came and went as she pleased. Charlie was putty in her capable hands.  \u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you have other friends besides the Cullens, Bella. Or you used to.\u201d     We stared at each other for a long moment.  \u201cWhen was the last time you spoke to Angela Weber?\u201d he threw at me.  \u201cFriday at lunch,\u201d I answered immediately.  Before Edward\u2019s return, my school friends had polarized into two groups. I liked to think of those groups as good vs.evil. Us and them worked, too. The good guys were Angela, her steady boyfriend Ben Cheney, and Mike Newton; these three had all very generously forgiven me for going crazy when Edward left. Lauren Mallory was the evil core of the them side, and almost everyone else, including my first friend in Forks, Jessica Stanley, seemed content to go along with her anti-Bella agenda.     With Edward back at school, the dividing line had become even more distinct.  Edward\u2019s return had taken its toll on Mike\u2019s friendship, but Angela was unswervingly loyal, and Ben followed her lead. Despite the natural aversion most humans felt toward the Cullens, Angela sat dutifully beside Alice every day at lunch. After a few weeks, Angela even looked comfortable there. It was difficult not to be charmed by the Cullens \u2014 once one gave them the chance to be charming.  \u201cOutside of school?\u201d Charlie asked, calling my attention back.     \u201cI haven\u2019t seen anyone outside of school, Dad. Grounded, remember? And Angela has a boyfriend, too. She\u2019s always with Ben.If I\u2019m really free,\u201d I added, heavy on the skepticism, \u201cmaybe we could double.\u201d  \u201cOkay. But then . . .\u201d He hesitated. \u201cYou and Jake used to be joined at the hip, and now \u2014\u201d  I cut him off. \u201cCan you get to the point, Dad? What\u2019s your condition \u2014 exactly?\u201d  \u201cI don\u2019t think you should dump all your other friends for your boyfriend, Bella,\u201d he said in a stern voice.  \u201cIt\u2019s not nice, and I think your life would be better balanced if you kept some other people in it. What happened last September . . .\u201d  I flinched.      \u201cWell,\u201d he said defensively. \u201cIf you\u2019d had more of a life outside of Edward Cullen, it might not have been like that.\u201d  \u201cIt would have been exactly like that,\u201d I muttered.  \u201cMaybe, maybe not.\u201d  \u201cThe point?\u201d I reminded him.  \u201cUse your new freedom to see your other friends, too. Keep it balanced.\u201d  I nodded slowly. \u201cBalance is good. Do I have specific time quotas to fill, though?\u201d  He made a face, but shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make this complicated. Just don\u2019t forget your friends . . .\u201d      It was a dilemma I was already struggling with. My friends. People who, for their own safety, I would never be able to see again after graduation.  So what was the better course of action? Spend time with them while I could? Or start the separation now to make it more gradual? I quailed at the idea of the second option.  \u201c. . . particularly Jacob,\u201d Charlie added before I could think things through more than that. A greater dilemma than the first. It took me a moment to find the right words. \u201cJacob might be . . . difficult.\u201d  \u201cThe Blacks are practically family, Bella,\u201d he said, stern and fatherly again. \u201cAnd Jacob has been a very, very good friend to you.\u201d  \u201cI know that.\u201d  \u201cDon\u2019t you miss him at all?\u201d Charlie asked, frustrated.    My throat suddenly felt swollen; I had to clear it twice before I answered. \u201cYes, I do miss him,\u201d I admitted, still looking down. \u201cI miss him a lot.\u201d  \u201cThen why is it difficult?\u201d It wasn\u2019t something I was at liberty to explain. It was against the rules for normal people \u2014human people like me and Charlie \u2014 to know about the clandestine world full of myths and monsters that existed secretly around us. I knew all about that world \u2014 and I was in no small amount of trouble as a result. I wasn\u2019t about to get Charlie in the same trouble. \u201cWith Jacob there is a . . . conflict,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cA conflict about the friendship thing, I mean. Friendship doesn\u2019t always seem to be enough for Jake.\u201d      I wound my excuse out of details that were true but insignificant, hardly crucial compared to the fact that Jacob\u2019s werewolf pack bitterly hated Edward\u2019s vampire family \u2014 and therefore me, too, as I fully intended to join that family. It just wasn\u2019t something I could work out with him in a note, and he wouldn\u2019t answer my calls. But my plan to deal with the werewolf in person had definitely not gone over well with the vampires.    \u201cIsn\u2019t Edward up for a little healthy competition?\u201d Charlie\u2019s voice was sarcastic now.  I leveled a dark look at him. \u201cThere\u2019s no competition.\u201d  \u201cYou\u2019re hurting Jake\u2019s feelings, avoiding him like this. He\u2019d rather be just friends than nothing.\u201d  Oh, now I was avoiding him?  \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Jake doesn\u2019t want to be friends at all.\u201d The words burned in my mouth. \u201cWhere\u2019d you get that idea, anyway?\u201d  Charlie looked embarrassed now. \u201cThe subject might have come up today with Billy. . . .\u201d  \u201cYou and Billy gossip like old women,\u201d I complained, stabbing my fork viciously into the congealed spaghetti on my plate.     \u201cBilly\u2019s worried about Jacob,\u201d Charlie said. \u201cJake\u2019s having a hard time right now. . . . He\u2019s depressed.\u201d  I winced, but kept my eyes on the blob.  \u201cAnd then you were always so happy after spending the day with Jake.\u201d Charlie sighed.  \u201cI\u2019m happy now,\u201d I growled fiercely through my teeth.  The contrast between my words and tone broke through the tension. Charlie burst into laughter, and I had to join in.  \u201cOkay, okay,\u201d I agreed. \u201cBalance.\u201d  \u201cAnd Jacob,\u201d he insisted.  \u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d      \u201cGood. Find that balance, Bella. And, oh, yeah, you\u2019ve got some mail,\u201d Charlie said, closing the subject with no attempt at subtlety. \u201cIt\u2019s by the stove.\u201d  I didn\u2019t move, my thoughts twisting into snarls around Jacob\u2019s name. It was most likely junk mail; I\u2019d just gotten a package from my mom yesterday and I wasn\u2019t expecting anything else.  Charlie shoved his chair away from the table and stretched as he got to his feet. He took his plate to the sink, but before he turned the water on to rinse it, he paused to toss a thick envelope at me. The letter skidded across the table and thunked into my elbow.      \u201cEr, thanks,\u201d I muttered, puzzled by his pushiness. Then I saw the return address \u2014 the letter was from the University of Alaska Southeast. \u201cThat was quick. I guess I missed the deadline on that one, too.\u201d  Charlie chuckled.  I flipped the envelope over and then glared up at him. \u201cIt\u2019s open.\u201d  \u201cI was curious.\u201d  \u201cI\u2019m shocked, Sheriff. That\u2019s a federal crime.\u201d  \u201cOh, just read it.\u201d  I pulled out the letter, and a folded schedule of courses.  \u201cCongratulations,\u201d he said before I could read anything. \u201cYour first acceptance.\u201d  \u201cThanks, Dad.\u201d     \u201cWe should talk about tuition. I\u2019ve got some money saved up \u2014\u201d  \u201cHey, hey, none of that. I\u2019m not touching your retirement, Dad. I\u2019ve got my college fund.\u201d What was left of it \u2014 and there hadn\u2019t been much to begin with.  Charlie frowned. \u201cSome of these places are pretty pricey, Bells. I want to help. You don\u2019t have to go to all the way to Alaska just because it\u2019s cheaper.\u201d     It wasn\u2019t cheaper, not at all. But it was far away, and Juneau had an average of three hundred twenty-one overcast days per year. The first was my prerequisite, the second was Edward\u2019s.  \u201cI\u2019ve got it covered. Besides, there\u2019s lots of financial aid out there. It\u2019s easy to get loans.\u201d I hoped my bluff wasn\u2019t too obvious. I hadn\u2019t actually done a lot of research on the subject.     \u201cSo . . . ,\u201d Charlie began, and then he pursed his lips and looked away.  \u201cSo what?\u201d  \u201cNothing. I was just . . .\u201d He frowned. \u201cJust wondering what . . . Edward\u2019s plans are for next year?\u201d  \u201cOh.\u201d  \u201cWell?\u201d  Three quick raps on the door saved me. Charlie rolled his eyes and I jumped up.  \u201cComing!\u201d I called while Charlie mumbled something that sounded like, \u201cGo away.\u201d I ignored him and went to let Edward in.     I wrenched the door out of my way \u2014 ridiculously eager \u2014 and there he was, my personal miracle. Time had not made me immune to the perfection of his face, and I was sure that I would never take any aspect of him for granted. My eyes traced over his pale white features: the hard square of his jaw, the softer curve of his full lips \u2014 twisted up into a smile now, the straight line of his nose, the sharp angle of his cheekbones, the smooth marble span of his forehead \u2014 partially obscured by a tangle of rain-darkened bronze hair. . . .     I saved his eyes for last, knowing that when I looked into them I was likely to lose my train of thought. They were wide, warm with liquid gold, and framed by a thick fringe of black lashes. Staring into his eyes always made me feel extraordinary \u2014 sort of like my bones were turning spongy. I was also a little lightheaded, but that could have been because I\u2019d forgotten to keep breathing. Again.  It was a face any male model in the world would trade his soul for. Of course, that might be exactly the asking price: one soul.  No. I didn\u2019t believe that. I felt guilty for even thinking it, and was glad \u2014 as I was often glad \u2014 that I was the one person whose thoughts were a mystery to Edward.     I reached for his hand, and sighed when his cold fingers found mine. His touch brought with it the strangest sense of relief \u2014 as if I\u2019d been in pain and that pain had suddenly ceased.  \u201cHey.\u201d I smiled a little at my anticlimactic greeting.  He raised our interlaced fingers to brush my cheek with the back of his hand. \u201cHow was your afternoon?\u201d  \u201cSlow.\u201d  \u201cFor me, as well.\u201d  He pulled my wrist up to his face, our hands still twisted together. His eyes closed as his nose skimmed along the skin there, and he smiled gently without opening them. Enjoying the bouquet while resisting the wine, as he\u2019d once put it.    I knew that the scent of my blood \u2014 so much sweeter to him than any other person\u2019s blood, truly like wine beside water to an alcoholic \u2014 caused him actual pain from the burning thirst it engendered. But he didn\u2019t seem to shy away from it as much as he once had. I could only dimly imagine the Herculean effort behind this simple gesture.",

            "en": "5          5. BLOOD TYPE I made my way to English in a daze. I didn't even realize when I first walked in that class had already started. \"Thank you for joining us, Miss Swan,\" Mr. Mason said in a disparaging tone. I flushed and hurried to my seat. It wasn't till class ended that I realized Mike wasn't sitting in his usual seat next to me. I felt a twinge of guilt. But he and Eric both met me at the door as usual, so I figured I wasn't totally unforgiven. Mike seemed to become more himself as we walked, gaining enthusiasm as he talked about the weather report for this weekend. The rain was supposed to take a minor break, and so maybe his beach trip would be possible. I tried to sound eager, to make up for disappointing him yesterday. It was hard; rain or no rain, it would still only be in the high forties, if we were lucky. The rest of the morning passed in a blur. It was difficult to believe that I hadn't just imagined what Edward had said, and the way his eyes had looked. Maybe it was just a very convincing dream that I'd confused with reality. That seemed more probable than that I really appealed to him on any level. So I was impatient and frightened as Jessica and I entered the cafeteria. I wanted to see his face, to see if he'd gone back to the cold, indifferent person I'd known for the last several weeks. Or if, by some miracle, I'd really heard what I thought I'd heard this morning. Jessica babbled on and on about her dance plans \u2014 Lauren and Angela had asked the other boys and they were all going together \u2014 completely unaware of my inattention. Disappointment flooded through me as my eyes unerringly focused on his table. The other four were there, but he was absent. Had he gone home? I followed the still-babbling Jessica through the line, crushed. I'd lost my appetite \u2014 I bought nothing but a bottle of lemonade. I just wanted to go sit down and sulk. \"Edward Cullen is staring at you again,\" Jessica said, finally breaking through my abstraction with his name. \"I wonder why he's sitting alone today.\" My head snapped up. I followed her gaze to see Edward, smiling crookedly, staring at me from an empty table across the cafeteria from where he usually sat. Once he'd caught my eye, he raised one hand and motioned with his index finger for me to join him. As I stared in disbelief, he winked. \"Does he mean you?\" Jessica asked with insulting astonishment in her voice. \"Maybe he needs help with his Biology homework,\" I muttered for her benefit. \"Um, I'd better go see what he wants.\" I could feel her staring after me as I walked away. When I reached his table, I stood behind the chair across from him, unsure. \"Why don't you sit with me today?\" he asked, smiling. I sat down automatically, watching him with caution. He was still smiling. It was hard to believe that someone so beautiful could be real. I was afraid that he might disappear in a sudden puff of smoke, and I would wake up. He seemed to be waiting for me to say something. \"This is different,\" I finally managed. \"Well\u2026\" He paused, and then the rest of the words followed in a rush. \"I decided as long as I was going to hell, I might as well do it thoroughly.\" I waited for him to say something that made sense. The seconds ticked by. \"You know I don't have any idea what you mean,\" I eventually pointed out. \"I know.\" He smiled again, and then he changed the subject. \"I think your friends are angry with me for stealing you.\" \"They'll survive.\" I could feel their stares boring into my back. \"I may not give you back, though,\" he said with a wicked glint in his eyes. I gulped. He laughed. \"You look worried.\" \"No,\" I said, but, ridiculously, my voice broke. \"Surprised, actually\u2026 what brought all this on?\" \"I told you \u2014 I got tired of trying to stay away from you. So I'm giving up.\" He was still smiling, but his ocher eyes were serious. \"Giving up?\" I repeated in confusion. \"Yes \u2014 giving up trying to be good. I'm just going to do what I want now, and let the chips fall where they may.\" His smile faded as he explained, and a hard edge crept into his voice. \"You lost me again.\" The breathtaking crooked smile reappeared. \"I always say too much when I'm talking to you \u2014 that's one of the problems.\" \"Don't worry \u2014 I don't understand any of it,\" I said wryly. \"I'm counting on that.\" \"So, in plain English, are we friends now?\" \"Friends\u2026\" he mused, dubious. \"Or not,\" I muttered. He grinned. \"Well, we can try, I suppose. But I'm warning you now that I'm not a good friend for you.\" Behind his smile, the warning was real.  \"You say that a lot,\" I noted, trying to ignore the sudden trembling in my stomach and keep my voice even. \"Yes, because you're not listening to me. I'm still waiting for you to believe it. If you're smart, you'll avoid me.\" \"I think you've made your opinion on the subject of my intellect clear, too.\" My eyes narrowed. He smiled apologetically. \"So, as long as I'm being\u2026 not smart, we'll try to be friends?\" I struggled to sum up the confusing exchange. \"That sounds about right.\" I looked down at my hands wrapped around the lemonade bottle, not sure what to do now. \"What are you thinking?\" he asked curiously. I looked up into his deep gold eyes, became befuddled, and, as usual, blurted out the truth. \"I'm trying to figure out what you are.\" His jaw tightened, but he kept his smile in place with some effort. \"Are you having any luck with that?\" he asked in an offhand tone. \"Not too much,\" I admitted. He chuckled. \"What are your theories?\" I blushed. I had been vacillating during the last month between Bruce Wayne and Peter Parker. There was no way I was going to own up to that. \"Won't you tell me?\" he asked, tilting his head to one side with a shockingly tempting smile. I shook my head. \"Too embarrassing.\" \"That's really frustrating, you know,\" he complained. \"No,\" I disagreed quickly, my eyes narrowing, \"I can't imagine why that would be frustrating at all \u2014 just because someone refuses to tell you what they're thinking, even if all the while they're making cryptic little remarks specifically designed to keep you up at night wondering what they could possibly mean\u2026 now, why would that be frustrating?\" He grimaced. \"Or better,\" I continued, the pent-up annoyance flowing freely now, \"say that person also did a wide range of bizarre things \u2014 from saving your life under impossible circumstances one day to treating you like a pariah the next, and he never explained any of that, either, even after he promised. That, also, would be very non-frustrating.\" \"You've got a bit of a temper, don't you?\" \"I don't like double standards.\" We stared at each other, unsmiling. He glanced over my shoulder, and then, unexpectedly, he snickered. \"What?\" \"Your boyfriend seems to think I'm being unpleasant to you \u2014 he's debating whether or not to come break up our fight.\" He snickered again. \"I don't know who you're talking about,\" I said frostily. \"But I'm sure you're wrong, anyway.\" \"I'm not. I told you, most people are easy to read.\" \"Except me, of course.\" \"Yes. Except for you.\" His mood shifted suddenly; his eyes turned brooding. \"I wonder why that is.\" I had to look away from the intensity of his stare. I concentrated on unscrewing the lid of my lemonade. I took a swig, staring at the table without seeing it. \"Aren't you hungry?\" he asked, distracted. \"No.\" I didn't feel like mentioning that my stomach was already full \u2014 of butterflies. \"You?\" I looked at the empty table in front of him. \"No, I'm not hungry.\" I didn't understand his expression \u2014 it looked like he was enjoying some private joke. \"Can you do me a favor?\" I asked after a second of hesitation. He was suddenly wary. \"That depends on what you want.\" \"It's not much,\" I assured him. He waited, guarded but curious. \"I just wondered\u2026 if you could warn me beforehand the next time you decide to ignore me for my own good. Just so I'm prepared.\" I looked at the lemonade bottle as I spoke, tracing the circle of the opening with my pinkie finger. \"That sounds fair.\" He was pressing his lips together to keep from laughing when I looked up. \"Thanks.\" \"Then can I have one answer in return?\" he demanded. \"One.\" \"Tell me one theory.\" Whoops. \"Not that one.\" \"You didn't qualify, you just promised one answer,\" he reminded me. \"And you've broken promises yourself,\" I reminded him back. \"Just one theory \u2014 I won't laugh.\" \"Yes, you will.\" I was positive about that. He looked down, and then glanced up at me through his long black lashes, his ocher eyes scorching. \"Please?\" he breathed, leaning toward me. I blinked, my mind going blank. Holy crow, how did he do that? \"Er, what?\" I asked, dazed. \"Please tell me just one little theory.\" His eyes still smoldered at me. \"Um, well, bitten by a radioactive spider?\" Was he a hypnotist, too? Or was I just a hopeless pushover? \"That's not very creative,\" he scoffed. \"I'm sorry, that's all I've got,\" I said, miffed. \"You're not even close,\" he teased. \"No spiders?\" \"Nope.\" \"And no radioactivity?\" \"None.\" \"Dang,\" I sighed. \"Kryptonite doesn't bother me, either,\" he chuckled. \"You're not supposed to laugh, remember?\" He struggled to compose his face. \"I'll figure it out eventually,\" I warned him. \"I wish you wouldn't try.\" He was serious again. \"Because\u2026 ?\" \"What if I'm not a superhero? What if I'm the bad guy?\" He smiled playfully, but his eyes were impenetrable. \"Oh,\" I said, as several things he'd hinted fell suddenly into place. \"I see.\" \"Do you?\" His face was abruptly severe, as if he were afraid that he'd accidentally said too much. \"You're dangerous?\" I guessed, my pulse quickening as I intuitively realized the truth of my own words. He was dangerous. He'd been trying to tell me that all along. He just looked at me, eyes full of some emotion I couldn't comprehend. \"But not bad,\" I whispered, shaking my head. \"No, I don't believe that you're bad.\" \"You're wrong.\" His voice was almost inaudible. He looked down, stealing my bottle lid and then spinning it on its side between his fingers. I stared at him, wondering why I didn't feel afraid. He meant what he was saying \u2014 that was obvious. But I just felt anxious, on edge\u2026 and, more than anything else, fascinated. The same way I always felt when I was near him. The silence lasted until I noticed that the cafeteria was almost empty. I jumped to my feet. \"We're going to be late.\" \"I'm not going to class today,\" he said, twirling the lid so fast it was just a blur. \"Why not?\" \"It's healthy to ditch class now and then.\" He smiled up at me, but his eyes were still troubled. \"Well, I'm going,\" I told him. I was far too big a coward to risk getting caught. He turned his attention back to his makeshift top. \"I'll see you later, then.\" I hesitated, torn, but then the first bell sent me hurrying out the door \u2014 with a last glance confirming that he hadn't moved a centimeter. As I half-ran to class, my head was spinning faster than the bottle cap. So few questions had been answered in comparison to how many new questions had been raised. At least the rain had stopped. I was lucky; Mr. Banner wasn't in the room yet when I arrived. I settled quickly into my seat, aware that both Mike and Angela were staring at me. Mike looked resentful; Angela looked surprised, and slightly awed. Mr. Banner came in the room then, calling the class to order. He was juggling a few small cardboard boxes in his arms. He put them down on Mike's table, telling him to start passing them around the class. \"Okay, guys, I want you all to take one piece from each box,\" he said as he produced a pair of rubber gloves from the pocket of his lab jacket and pulled them on. The sharp sound as the gloves snapped into place against his wrists seemed ominous to me. \"The first should be an indicator card,\" he went on, grabbing a white card with four squares marked on it and displaying it. \"The second is a four-pronged applicator \u2014\" he held up something that looked like a nearly toothless hair pick \"\u2014 and the third is a sterile micro-lancet.\" He held up a small piece of blue plastic and split it open. The barb was invisible from this distance, but my stomach flipped. \"I'll be coming around with a dropper of water to prepare your cards, so please don't start until I get to you.\" He began at Mike's table again, carefully putting one drop of water in each of the four squares. \"Then I want you to carefully prick your finger with the lancet\u2026\" He grabbed Mike's hand and jabbed the spike into the tip of Mike's middle finger. Oh no. Clammy moisture broke out across my forehead. \"Put a small drop of blood on each of the prongs.\" He demonstrated, squeezing Mike's finger till the blood flowed. I swallowed convulsively, my stomach heaving. \"And then apply it to the card,\" he finished, holding up the dripping red card for us to see. I closed my eyes, trying to hear through the ringing\u00a0 in my ears. \"The Red Cross is having a blood drive in Port Angeles next weekend, so I thought you should all know your blood type.\" He sounded proud of himself. \"Those of you who aren't eighteen yet will need a parent's permission \u2014 I have slips at my desk.\" He continued through the room with his water drops. I put my cheek against the cool black tabletop and tried to hold on to my consciousness. All around me I could hear squeals, complaints, and giggles as my classmates skewered their fingers. I breathed slowly in and out through my mouth. \"Bella, are you all right?\" Mr. Banner asked. His voice was close to my head, and it sounded alarmed. \"I already know my blood type, Mr. Banner,\" I said in a weak voice. I was afraid to raise my head. \"Are you feeling faint?\" \"Yes, sir,\" I muttered, internally kicking myself for not ditching when I had the chance. \"Can someone take Bella to the nurse, please?\" he called. I didn't have to look up to know that it would be Mike who volunteered.  \"Can you walk?\" Mr. Banner asked. \"Yes,\" I whispered. Just let me get out of here, I thought. I'll crawl. Mike seemed eager as he put his arm around my waist and pulled my arm over his shoulder. I leaned against him heavily on the way out of the classroom. Mike towed me slowly across campus. When we were around the edge of the cafeteria, out of sight of building four in case Mr. Banner was watching, I stopped. \"Just let me sit for a minute, please?\" I begged. He helped me sit on the edge of the walk. \"And whatever you do, keep your hand in your pocket,\" I warned. I was still so dizzy. I slumped over on my side, putting my cheek against the freezing, damp cement of the sidewalk, closing my eyes. That seemed to help a little. \"Wow, you're green, Bella,\" Mike said nervously. \"Bella?\" a different voice called from the distance. No! Please let me be imagining that horribly familiar voice. \"What's wrong \u2014 is she hurt?\" His voice was closer now, and he sounded upset. I wasn't imagining it. I squeezed my eyes shut, hoping to die. Or, at the very least, not to throw up. Mike seemed stressed. \"I think she's fainted. I don't know what happened, she didn't even stick her finger.\" \"Bella.\" Edward's voice was right beside me, relieved now. \"Can you hear me?\" \"No,\" I groaned. \"Go away.\" He chuckled. \"I was taking her to the nurse,\" Mike explained in a defensive tone, \"but she wouldn't go any farther.\" \"I'll take her,\" Edward said. I could hear the smile still in his voice. \"You can go back to class.\" \"No,\" Mike protested. \"I'm supposed to do it.\" Suddenly the sidewalk disappeared from beneath me. My eyes flew open in shock. Edward had scooped me up in his arms, as easily as if I weighed ten pounds instead of a hundred and ten. \"Put me down!\" Please, please let me not vomit on him. He was walking before I was finished talking. \"Hey!\" Mike called, already ten paces behind us. Edward ignored him. \"You look awful,\" he told me, grinning. \"Put me back on the sidewalk,\" I moaned. The rocking movement of his walk was not helping. He held me away from his body, gingerly, supporting all my weight with just his arms \u2014 it didn't seem to bother him.  \"So you faint at the sight of blood?\" he asked. This seemed to entertain him. I didn't answer. I closed my eyes again and fought the nausea with all my strength, clamping my lips together. \"And not even your own blood,\" he continued, enjoying himself.  I don't know how he opened the door while carrying me, but it was suddenly warm, so I knew we were inside. \"Oh my,\" I heard a female voice gasp. \"She fainted in Biology,\" Edward explained. I opened my eyes. I was in the office, and Edward was striding past the front counter toward the nurse's door. Ms. Cope, the redheaded front office receptionist, ran ahead of him to hold it open. The grandmotherly nurse looked up from a novel, astonished, as Edward swung me into the room and placed me gently on the crackly paper that covered the brown vinyl mattress on the one cot. Then he moved to stand against the wall as far across the narrow room as possible. His eyes were bright, excited. \"She's just a little faint,\" he reassured the startled nurse. \"They're blood typing in Biology.\" The nurse nodded sagely. \"There's always one.\" He muffled a snicker. \"Just lie down for a minute, honey; it'll pass.\" \"I know,\" I sighed. The nausea was already fading. \"Does this happen a lot?\" she asked. \"Sometimes,\" I admitted. Edward coughed to hide another laugh. \"You can go back to class now,\" she told him. \"I'm supposed to stay with her.\" He said this with such assured authority that \u2014 even though she pursed her lips \u2014 the nurse didn't argue it further. \"I'll go get you some ice for your forehead, dear,\" she said to me, and then bustled out of the room. \"You were right,\" I moaned, letting my eyes close. \"I usually am \u2014 but about what in particular this time?\" \"Ditching is healthy.\" I practiced breathing evenly. \"You scared me for a minute there,\" he admitted after a pause. His tone made it sound like he was confessing a humiliating weakness. \"I thought Newton was dragging your dead body off to bury it in the woods.\" \"Ha ha.\" I still had my eyes closed, but I was feeling more normal every minute. \"Honestly \u2014 I've seen corpses with better color. I was concerned that I might have to avenge your murder.\" \"Poor Mike. I'll bet he's mad.\" \"He absolutely loathes me,\" Edward said cheerfully. \"You can't know that,\" I argued, but then I wondered suddenly if he could. \"I saw his face \u2014 I could tell.\" \"How did you see me? I thought you were ditching.\" I was almost fine now, though the queasiness would probably pass faster if I'd eaten something for lunch. On the other hand, maybe it was lucky my stomach was empty. \"I was in my car, listening to a CD.\" Such a normal response \u2014 it surprised me. I heard the door and opened my eyes to see the nurse with a cold compress in her hand. \"Here you go, dear.\" She laid it across my forehead. \"You're looking better,\" she added. \"I think I'm fine,\" I said, sitting up. Just a little ringing in my ears, no spinning. The mint green walls stayed where they should. I could see she was about to make me lie back down, but the door opened just then, and Ms. Cope stuck her head in. \"We've got another one,\" she warned. I hopped down to free up the cot for the next invalid. I handed the compress back to the nurse. \"Here, I don't need this.\" And then Mike staggered through the door, now supporting a sallow-looking Lee Stephens, another boy in our Biology class. Edward and I drew back against the wall to give them room. \"Oh no,\" Edward muttered. \"Go out to the office, Bella.\" I looked up at him, bewildered. \"Trust me \u2014 go.\" I spun and caught the door before it closed, darting out of the infirmary. I could feel Edward right behind me. \"You actually listened to me.\" He was stunned. \"I smelled the blood,\" I said, wrinkling my nose. Lee wasn't sick from watching other people, like me. \"People can't smell blood,\" he contradicted. \"Well, I can \u2014 that's what makes me sick. It smells like rust\u2026 and salt.\" He was staring at me with an unfathomable expression. \"What?\" I asked. \"It's nothing.\" Mike came through the door then, glancing from me to Edward. The look he gave Edward confirmed what Edward had said about loathing. He looked back at me, his eyes glum. \"You look better,\" he accused. \"Just keep your hand in your pocket,\" I warned him again. \"It's not bleeding anymore,\" he muttered. \"Are you going back to class?\" \"Are you kidding? I'd just have to turn around and come back.\" \"Yeah, I guess\u2026 So are you going this weekend? To the beach?\" While he spoke, he flashed another glare toward Edward, who was standing against the cluttered counter, motionless as a sculpture, staring off into space. I tried to sound as friendly as possible. \"Sure, I said I was in.\" \"We're meeting at my dad's store, at ten.\" His eyes flickered to Edward again, wondering if he was giving out too much information. His body language made it clear that it wasn't an open invitation. \"I'll be there,\" I promised. \"I'll see you in Gym, then,\" he said, moving uncertainly toward the door.  \"See you,\" I replied. He looked at me once more, his round face slightly pouting, and then as he walked slowly through the door, his shoulders slumped. A swell of sympathy washed over me. I pondered seeing his disappointed face again\u2026 in Gym.  \"Gym,\" I groaned. \"I can take care of that.\" I hadn't noticed Edward moving to my side, but he spoke now in my ear. \"Go sit down and look pale,\" he muttered. That wasn't a challenge; I was always pale, and my recent swoon had left a light sheen of sweat on my face. I sat in one of the creaky folding chairs and rested my head against the wall with my eyes closed. Fainting spells always exhausted me. I heard Edward speaking softly at the counter. \"Ms. Cope?\" \"Yes?\" I hadn't heard her return to her desk. \"Bella has Gym next hour, and I don't think she feels well enough. Actually, I was thinking I should take her home now. Do you think you could excuse her from class?\" His voice was like melting honey. I could imagine how much more overwhelming his eyes would be. \"Do you need to be excused, too, Edward?\" Ms. Cope fluttered. Why couldn't I do that? \"No, I have Mrs. Goff, she won't mind.\" \"Okay, it's all taken care of. You feel better, Bella,\" she called to me. I nodded weakly, hamming it up just a bit. \"Can you walk, or do you want me to carry you again?\" With his back to the receptionist, his expression became sarcastic. \"I'll walk.\" I stood carefully, and I was still fine. He held the door for me, his smile polite but his eyes mocking. I walked out into the cold, fine mist that had just begun to fall. It felt nice \u2014 the first time I'd enjoyed the constant moisture falling out of the sky \u2014 as it washed my face clean of the sticky perspiration. \"Thanks,\" I said as he followed me out. \"It's almost worth getting sick to miss Gym.\" \"Anytime.\" He was staring straight forward, squinting into the rain. \"So are you going? This Saturday, I mean?\" I was hoping he would, though it seemed unlikely. I couldn't picture him loading up to carpool with the rest of the kids from school; he didn't belong in the same world. But just hoping that he might gave me the first twinge of enthusiasm I'd felt for the outing. \"Where are you all going, exactly?\" He was still looking ahead, expressionless. \"Down to La Push, to First Beach.\" I studied his face, trying to read it. His eyes seemed to narrow infinitesimally. He glanced down at me from the corner of his eye, smiling wryly. \"I really don't think I was invited.\" I sighed. \"I just invited you.\" \"Let's you and I not push poor Mike any further this week. We don't want him to snap.\" His eyes danced; he was enjoying the idea more than he should. \"Mike-schmike.\" I muttered, preoccupied by the way he'd said \"you and I.\" I liked it more than I should.  We were near the parking lot now. I veered left, toward my truck. Something caught my jacket, yanking me back. \"Where do you think you're going?\" he asked, outraged. He was gripping a fistful of my jacket in one hand. I was confused. \"I'm going home.\" \"Didn't you hear me promise to take you safely home? Do you think I'm going to let you drive in your condition?\" His voice was still indignant. \"What condition? And what about my truck?\" I complained.  \"I'll have Alice drop it off after school.\" He was towing me toward his car now, pulling me by my jacket. It was all I could do to keep from falling backward. He'd probably just drag me along anyway if I did. \"Let go!\" I insisted. He ignored me. I staggered along sideways across the wet sidewalk until we reached the Volvo. Then he finally freed me \u2014 I stumbled against the passenger door. \"You are so pushy!\" I grumbled. \"It's open,\" was all he responded. He got in the driver's side. \"I am perfectly capable of driving myself home!\" I stood by the car, fuming. It was raining harder now, and I'd never put my hood up, so my hair was dripping down my back. He lowered the automatic window and leaned toward me across the seat. \"Get in, Bella.\" I didn't answer. I was mentally calculating my chances of reaching the truck before he could catch me. I had to admit, they weren't good. \"I'll just drag you back,\" he threatened, guessing my plan. I tried to maintain what dignity I could as I got into his car. I wasn't very successful \u2014 I looked like a half-drowned cat and my boots squeaked. \"This is completely unnecessary,\" I said stiffly. He didn't answer. He fiddled with the controls, turning the heater up and the music down. As he pulled out of the parking lot, I was preparing to give him the silent treatment \u2014 my face in full pout mode \u2014 but then I recognized the music playing, and my curiosity got the better of my intentions. \"Clair de Lune?\" I asked, surprised. \"You know Debussy?\" He sounded surprised, too. \"Not well,\" I admitted. \"My mother plays a lot of classical music around the house \u2014 I only know my favorites.\" \"It's one of my favorites, too.\" He stared out through the rain, lost in thought. I listened to the music, relaxing against the light gray leather seat. It was impossible not to respond to the familiar, soothing melody. The rain blurred everything outside the window into gray and green smudges. I began to realize we were driving very fast; the car moved so steadily, so evenly, though, I didn't feel the speed. Only the town flashing by gave it away. \"What is your mother like?\" he asked me suddenly. I glanced over to see him studying me with curious eyes. \"She looks a lot like me, but she's prettier,\" I said. He raised his eyebrows. \"I have too much Charlie in me. She's more outgoing than I am, and braver. She's irresponsible and slightly eccentric, and she's a very unpredictable cook. She's my best friend.\" I stopped. Talking about her was making me depressed. \"How old are you, Bella?\" His voice sounded frustrated for some reason I couldn't imagine. He'd stopped the car, and I realized we were at Charlie's house already. The rain was so heavy that I could barely see the house at all. It was like the car was submerged under a river. \"I'm seventeen,\" I responded, a little confused. \"You don't seem seventeen.\" His tone was reproachful; it made me laugh. \"What?\" he asked, curious again. \"My mom always says I was born thirty-five years old and that I get more middle-aged every year.\" I laughed, and then sighed. \"Well, someone has to be the adult.\" I paused for a second. \"You don't seem much like a junior in high school yourself,\" I noted. He made a face and changed the subject. \"So why did your mother marry Phil?\" I was surprised he would remember the name; I'd mentioned it just once, almost two months ago. It took me a moment to answer. \"My mother\u2026 she's very young for her age. I think Phil makes her feel even younger. At any rate, she's crazy about him.\" I shook my head. The attraction was a mystery to me. \"Do you approve?\" he asked. \"Does it matter?\" I countered. \"I want her to be happy\u2026 and he is who she wants.\" \"That's very generous\u2026 I wonder,\" he mused. \"What?\" \"Would she extend the same courtesy to you, do you think? No matter who your choice was?\" He was suddenly intent, his eyes searching mine. \"I-I think so,\" I stuttered. \"But she's the parent, after all. It's a little bit different.\" \"No one too scary then,\" he teased. I grinned in response. \"What do you mean by scary? Multiple facial piercings and extensive tattoos?\" \"That's one definition, I suppose.\" \"What's your definition?\" But he ignored my question and asked me another. \"Do you think that I could be scary?\" He raised one eyebrow, and the faint trace of a smile lightened his face. I thought for a moment, wondering whether the truth or a lie would go over better. I decided to go with the truth. \"Hmmm\u2026 I think you could be, if you wanted to.\" \"Are you frightened of me now?\" The smile vanished, and his heavenly face was suddenly serious. \"No.\" But I answered too quickly. The smile returned. \"So, now are you going to tell me about your family?\" I asked to distract him. \"It's got to be a much more interesting story than mine.\" He was instantly cautious. \"What do you want to know?\" \"The Cullens adopted you?\" I verified. \"Yes.\" I hesitated for a moment. \"What happened to your parents?\" \"They died many years ago.\" His tone was matter-of-fact. \"I'm sorry,\" I mumbled. \"I don't really remember them that clearly. Carlisle and Esme have been my parents for a long time now.\" \"And you love them.\" It wasn't a question. It was obvious in the way he spoke of them. \"Yes.\" He smiled. \"I couldn't imagine two better people.\" \"You're very lucky.\" \"I know I am.\" \"And your brother and sister?\" He glanced at the clock on the dashboard. \"My brother and sister, and Jasper and Rosalie for that matter, are going to be quite upset if they have to stand in the rain waiting for me.\" \"Oh, sorry, I guess you have to go.\" I didn't want to get out of the car. \"And you probably want your truck back before Chief Swan gets home, so you don't have to tell him about the Biology incident.\" He grinned at me. \"I'm sure he's already heard. There are no secrets in Forks.\" I sighed. He laughed, and there was an edge to his laughter. \"Have fun at the beach\u2026 good weather for sunbathing.\" He glanced out at the <em>sheeting</em> rain. \"Won't I see you tomorrow?\" \"No. Emmett and I are starting the weekend early.\" \"What are you going to do?\" A friend could ask that, right? I hoped the disappointment wasn't too apparent in my voice. \"We're going to be hiking in the Goat Rocks Wilderness, just south of Rainier.\" I remembered Charlie had said the Cullens went camping frequently. \"Oh, well, have fun.\" I tried to sound enthusiastic. I don't think I fooled him, though. A smile was playing around the edges of his lips. \"Will you do something for me this weekend?\" He turned to look me straight in the face, utilizing the full power of his burning gold eyes. I nodded helplessly. \"Don't be offended, but you seem to be one of those people who just attract accidents like a magnet. So\u2026 try not to fall into the ocean or get run over or anything, all right?\" He smiled crookedly. The helplessness had faded as he spoke. I glared at him.  \"I'll see what I can do,\" I snapped as I jumped out into the rain. I slammed the door behind me with excessive force. He was still smiling as he drove away.",

            "en": "Ch\u1ea1ng V\u1ea1ng - Twilight             I'd never given much thought to how I would die \u2014 though I'd had reason enough in the last few months \u2014 but even if I had, I would not have imagined it like this. I stared without breathing across the long room, into the dark eyes of the hunter, and he looked pleasantly back at me. Surely it was a good way to die, in the place of someone else, someone I loved. Noble, even. That ought to count for something. I knew that if I'd never gone to Forks, I wouldn't be facing death now. But, terrified as I was, I couldn't bring myself to regret the decision. When life offers you a dream so far beyond any of your expectations, it's not reasonable to grieve when it comes to an end. The hunter smiled in a friendly way as he sauntered forward to kill me. 1.\u00a0 FIRST SIGHT My mother drove me to the airport with the windows rolled down. It was seventy-five degrees in Phoenix, the sky a perfect, cloudless blue. I was wearing my favorite shirt \u2014 sleeveless, white eyelet lace; I was wearing it as a farewell gesture. My carry-on item was a parka. In the Olympic Peninsula of northwest Washington State, a small town named Forks exists under a near-constant cover of clouds. It rains on this inconsequential town more than any other place in the United States of America. It was from this town and its gloomy, omnipresent shade that my mother escaped with me when I was only a few months old. It was in this town that I'd been compelled to spend a month every summer until I was fourteen. That was the year I finally put my foot down; these past three summers, my dad, Charlie, vacationed with me in California for two weeks instead.  It was to Forks that I now exiled myself\u2014 an action that I took with great horror. I detested Forks. I loved Phoenix. I loved the sun and the blistering heat. I loved the vigorous, sprawling city. \"Bella,\" my mom said to me \u2014 the last of a thousand times \u2014 before I got on the plane.\u201d You don't have to do this.\" My mom looks like me, except with short hair and laugh lines. I felt a spasm of panic as I stared at her wide, childlike eyes. How could I leave my loving, erratic, harebrained mother to fend for herself? Of course she had Phil now, so the bills would probably get paid, there would be food in the refrigerator, gas in her car, and someone to call when she got lost, but still\u2026 \"I want to go,\" I lied. I'd always been a bad liar, but I'd been saying this lie so frequently lately that it sounded almost convincing now. \"Tell Charlie I said hi.\" \"I will.\" \"I'll see you soon,\" she insisted.\u201d You can come home whenever you want \u2014 I'll come right back as soon as you need me.\" But I could see the sacrifice in her eyes behind the promise.  \"Don't worry about me,\" I urged.\u201d It'll be great. I love you, Mom.\" She hugged me tightly for a minute, and then I got on the plane, and she was gone. It's a four-hour flight from Phoenix to Seattle, another hour in a small plane up to Port Angeles, and then an hour drive back down to Forks. Flying doesn't bother me; the hour in the car with Charlie, though, I was a little worried about. Charlie had really been fairly nice about the whole thing. He seemed genuinely pleased that I was coming to live with him for the first time with any degree of permanence. He'd already gotten me registered for high school and was going to help me get a car. But it was sure to be awkward with Charlie. Neither of us was what anyone would call verbose, and I didn't know what there was to say regardless. I knew he was more than a little confused by my decision \u2014 like my mother before me, I hadn't made a secret of my distaste for Forks. When I landed in Port Angeles, it was raining. I didn't see it as an omen \u2014 just unavoidable. I'd already said my goodbyes to the sun. Charlie was waiting for me with the cruiser. This I was expecting, too.  Charlie is Police Chief Swan to the good people of Forks. My primary motivation behind buying a car, despite the scarcity of my funds, was that I refused to be driven around town in a car with red and blue lights on top. Nothing slows down traffic like a cop. Charlie gave me an awkward, one-armed hug when I stumbled my way off the plane. \"It's good to see you, Bells,\" he said, smiling as he automatically caught and steadied me.\u201d You haven't changed much. How's Ren\u00e9e?\" \"Mom's fine. It's good to see you, too, Dad.\" I wasn't allowed to call him Charlie to his face. I had only a few bags. Most of my Arizona clothes were too permeable for Washington. My mom and I had pooled our resources to supplement my winter wardrobe, but it was still scanty. It all fit easily into the trunk of the cruiser. \"I found a good car for you, really cheap,\" he announced when we were strapped in. \"What kind of car?\" I was suspicious of the way he said \"good car for you\" as opposed to just \"good car.\" \"Well, it's a truck actually, a Chevy.\" \"Where did you find it?\" \"Do you remember Billy Black down at La Push?\" La Push is the tiny Indian reservation on the coast. \"No.\" \"He used to go fishing with us during the summer,\" Charlie prompted.  That would explain why I didn't remember him. I do a good job of blocking painful, unnecessary things from my memory. \"He's in a wheelchair now,\" Charlie continued when I didn't respond, \"so he can't drive anymore, and he offered to sell me his truck cheap.\" \"What year is it?\" I could see from his change of expression that this was the question he was hoping I wouldn't ask. \"Well, Billy's done a lot of work on the engine \u2014 it's only a few years old, really.\" I hoped he didn't think so little of me as to believe I would give up that easily.\u201d When did he buy it?\" \"He bought it in 1984, I think.\" \"Did he buy it new?\" \"Well, no. I think it was new in the early sixties \u2014 or late fifties at the earliest,\" he admitted sheepishly. \"Ch \u2014 Dad, I don't really know anything about cars. I wouldn't be able to fix it if anything went wrong, and I couldn't afford a mechanic\u2026\" \"Really, Bella, the thing runs great. They don't build them like that anymore.\" The thing, I thought to myself\u2026 it had possibilities \u2014 as a nickname, at the very least. \"How cheap is cheap?\" After all, that was the part I couldn't compromise on. \"Well, honey, I kind of already bought it for you. As a homecoming gift.\" Charlie peeked sideways at me with a hopeful expression. Wow. Free. \"You didn't need to do that, Dad. I was going to buy myself a car.\" \"I don't mind. I want you to be happy here.\" He was looking ahead at the road when he said this. Charlie wasn't comfortable with expressing his emotions out loud. I inherited that from him. So I was looking straight ahead as I responded. \"That's really nice, Dad. Thanks. I really appreciate it.\" No need to add that my being happy in Forks is an impossibility. He didn't need to suffer along with me. And I never looked a free truck in the mouth \u2014 or engine. \"Well, now, you're welcome,\" he mumbled, embarrassed by my thanks.  We exchanged a few more comments on the weather, which was wet, and that was pretty much it for Conversation. We stared out the windows in silence. It was beautiful, of course; I couldn't deny that. Everything was green: the trees, their trunks covered with moss, their branches hanging with a canopy of it, the ground covered with ferns. Even the air filtered down greenly through the leaves. Eventually we made it to Charlie's. He still lived in the small, two-bedroom house that he'd bought with my mother in the early days of their marriage. Those were the only kind of days their marriage had \u2014 the early ones. There, parked on the street in front of the house that never changed, was my new \u2014 well, new to me \u2014 truck. It was a faded red color, with big, rounded fenders and a bulbous cab. To my intense surprise, I loved it. I didn't know if it would run, but I could see myself in it. Plus, it was one of those solid iron affairs that never gets damaged \u2014 the kind you see at the scene of an accident, paint unscratched, surrounded by the pieces of the foreign car it had destroyed. \"Wow, Dad, I love it! Thanks!\" Now my horrific day tomorrow would be just that much less dreadful. I wouldn't be faced with the choice of either walking two miles in the rain to school or accepting a ride in the Chief's cruiser. \"I'm glad you like it,\" Charlie said gruffly, embarrassed again. It took only one trip to get all my stuff upstairs. I got the west bedroom that faced out over the front yard. The room was familiar; it had been belonged to me since I was born. The wooden floor, the light blue walls, the peaked ceiling, the yellowed lace curtains around the window \u2014 these were all a part of my childhood. The only changes Charlie had ever made were switching the crib for a bed and adding a desk as I grew. The desk now held a secondhand computer, with the phone line for the modem stapled along the floor to the nearest phone jack. This was a stipulation from my mother, so that we could stay in touch easily. The rocking chair from my baby days was still in the corner. There was only one small bathroom at the top of the stairs, which I would have to share with Charlie. I was trying not to dwell too much on that fact. One of the best things about Charlie is he doesn't hover. He left me alone to unpack and get settled, a feat that would have been altogether impossible for my mother. It was nice to be alone, not to have to smile and look pleased; a relief to stare dejectedly out the window at the <em>sheeting</em> rain and let just a few tears escape. I wasn't in the mood to go on a real crying jag. I would save that for bedtime, when I would have to think about the coming morning. Forks High School had a frightening total of only three hundred and fifty-seven \u2014 now fifty-eight \u2014 students; there were more than seven hundred people in my junior class alone back home. All of the kids here had grown up together \u2014 their grandparents had been toddlers together. I would be the new girl from the big city, a curiosity, a freak. Maybe, if I looked like a girl from Phoenix should, I could work this to my advantage. But physically, I'd never fit in anywhere. I should be tan, sporty, blond \u2014 a volleyball player, or a cheerleader, perhaps \u2014 all the things that go with living in the valley of the sun. Instead, I was ivory-skinned, without even the excuse of blue eyes or red hair, despite the constant sunshine. I had always been slender, but soft somehow, obviously not an athlete; I didn't have the necessary hand-eye coordination to play sports without humiliating myself \u2014 and harming both myself and anyone else who stood too close. When I finished putting my clothes in the old pine dresser, I took my bag of bathroom necessities and went to the communal bathroom to clean myself up after the day of travel. I looked at my face in the mirror as I brushed through my tangled, damp hair. Maybe it was the light, but already I looked sallower, unhealthy. My skin could be pretty \u2014 it was very clear, almost translucent-looking \u2014 but it all depended on color. I had no color here. Facing my pallid reflection in the mirror, I was forced to admit that I was lying to myself. It wasn't just physically that I'd never fit in. And if I couldn't find a niche in a school with three thousand people, what were my chances here? I didn't relate well to people my age. Maybe the truth was that I didn't relate well to people, period. Even my mother, who I was closer to than anyone else on the planet, was never in harmony with me, never on exactly the same page. Sometimes I wondered if I was seeing the same things through my eyes that the rest of the world was seeing through theirs. Maybe there was a glitch in my brain. But the cause didn't matter. All that mattered was the effect. And tomorrow would be just the beginning.  I didn't sleep well that night, even after I was done crying. The constant whooshing of the rain and wind across the roof wouldn't fade into the background. I pulled the faded old quilt over my head, and later added the pillow, too. But I couldn't fall asleep until after midnight, when the rain finally settled into a quieter drizzle. Thick fog was all I could see out my window in the morning, and I could feel the \u00a0claustrophobia creeping up on me. You could never see the sky here; it was like a cage. Breakfast with Charlie was a quiet event. He wished me good luck at school. I thanked him, knowing his hope was wasted. Good luck tended to avoid me. Charlie left first, off to the police station that was his wife and family. After he left, I sat at the old square oak table in one of the three unmatching chairs and examined his small kitchen, with its dark paneled walls, bright yellow cabinets, and white linoleum floor. Nothing was changed. My mother had painted the cabinets eighteen years ago in an attempt to bring some sunshine into the house. Over the small fireplace in the adjoining handkerchief-sized family room was a row of pictures. First a wedding picture of Charlie and my mom in Las Vegas, then one of the three of us in the hospital after I was born, taken by a helpful nurse, followed by the procession of my school pictures up to last year's. Those were embarrassing to look at \u2014 I would have to see what I could do to get Charlie to put them somewhere else, at least while I was living here. It was impossible, being in this house, not to realize that Charlie had never gotten over my mom. It made me uncomfortable. I didn't want to be too early to school, but I couldn't stay in the house anymore. I donned my jacket \u2014 which had the feel of a biohazard suit \u2014 and headed out into the rain. It was just drizzling still, not enough to soak me through immediately as I reached for the house key that was always hidden under the eaves by the door, and locked up. The sloshing of my new waterproof boots was unnerving. I missed the normal crunch of gravel as I walked. I couldn't pause and admire my truck again as I wanted; I was in a hurry to get out of the misty wet that swirled around my head and clung to my hair under my hood. Inside the truck, it was nice and dry. Either Billy or Charlie had obviously cleaned it up, but the tan upholstered seats still smelled faintly of tobacco, gasoline, and peppermint. The engine started quickly, to my relief, but loudly, roaring to life and then idling at top volume. Well, a truck this old was bound to have a flaw. The antique radio worked, a plus that I hadn't expected. Finding the school wasn't difficult, though I'd never been there before. The school was, like most other things, just off the highway. It was not obvious that it was a school; only the sign, which declared it to be the Forks High School, made me stop. It looked like a collection of matching houses, built with maroon-colored bricks. There were so many trees and shrubs I couldn't see its size at first. Where was the feel of the institution? I wondered nostalgically. Where were the chain-link fences, the metal detectors? I parked in front of the first building, which had a small sign over the door reading front office. No one else was parked there, so I was sure it was off limits, but I decided I would get directions inside instead of circling around in the rain like an idiot. I stepped unwillingly out of the toasty truck cab and walked down a little stone path lined with dark hedges. I took a deep breath before opening the door.  Inside, it was brightly lit, and warmer than I'd hoped. The office was small; a little waiting area with padded folding chairs, orange-flecked commercial carpet, notices and awards cluttering the walls, a big clock ticking loudly. Plants grew everywhere in large plastic pots, as if there wasn't enough greenery outside. The room was cut in half by a long counter, cluttered with wire baskets full of papers and brightly colored flyers taped to its front. There were three desks behind the counter, one of which was manned by a large, red-haired woman wearing glasses. She was wearing a purple t-shirt, which immediately made me feel overdressed. The red-haired woman looked up.\u201d Can I help you?\" \"I'm Isabella Swan,\" I informed her, and saw the immediate awareness light her eyes. I was expected, a topic of gossip no doubt. Daughter of the Chief's flighty ex-wife, come home at last. \"Of course,\" she said. She dug through a precariously stacked pile of documents on her desk till she found the ones she was looking for.\u201d I have your schedule right here, and a map of the school.\" She brought several sheets to the counter to show me. She went through my classes for me, highlighting the best route to each on the map, and gave me a slip to have each teacher sign, which I was to bring back at the end of the day. She smiled at me and hoped, like Charlie, that I would like it here in Forks. I smiled back as convincingly as I could. When I went back out to my truck, other students were starting to arrive. I drove around the school, following the line of traffic. I was glad to see that most of the cars were older like mine, nothing flashy. At home I'd lived in one of the few lower-income neighborhoods that were included in the Paradise Valley District. It was a common thing to see a new Mercedes or Porsche in the student lot. The nicest car here was a shiny Volvo, and it stood out. Still, I cut the engine as soon as I was in a spot, so that the thunderous volume wouldn't draw attention to me. I looked at the map in the truck, trying to memorize it now; hopefully I wouldn't have to walk around with it stuck in front of my nose all day. I stuffed everything in my bag, slung the strap over my shoulder, and sucked in a huge breath. I can do this, I lied to myself feebly. No one was going to bite me. I finally exhaled and stepped out of the truck.  I kept my face pulled back into my hood as I walked to the sidewalk, crowded with teenagers. My plain black jacket didn't stand out, I noticed with relief. Once I got around the cafeteria, building three was easy to spot. A large black \"3\" was painted on a white square on the east corner. I felt my breathing gradually creeping toward hyperventilation as I approached the door. I tried holding my breath as I followed two unisex raincoats through the door.  The classroom was small. The people in front of me stopped just inside the door to hang up their coats on a long row of hooks. I copied them.  They were two girls, one a porcelain-colored blonde, the other also pale, with light brown hair. At least my skin wouldn't be a standout here.  I took the slip up to the teacher, a tall, balding man whose desk had a nameplate identifying him as Mr. Mason. He gawked at me when he saw my name \u2014 not an encouraging response \u2014 and of course I flushed tomato red. But at least he sent me to an empty desk at the back without introducing me to the class. It was harder for my new classmates to stare at me in the back, but somehow, they managed. I kept my eyes down on the reading list the teacher had given me. It was fairly basic: Bronte, Shakespeare, Chaucer, Faulkner. I'd already read everything. That was comforting\u2026 and boring. I wondered if my mom would send me my folder of old essays, or if she would think that was cheating. I went through different arguments with her in my head while the teacher droned on. When the bell rang, a nasal buzzing sound, a gangly boy with skin problems and hair black as an oil slick leaned across the aisle to talk to me. \"You're Isabella Swan, aren't you?\" He looked like the overly helpful, chess club type. \"Bella,\" I corrected. Everyone within a three-seat radius turned to look at me. \"Where's your next class?\" he asked.  I had to check in my bag.\u201d Um, Government, with Jefferson, in building six.\" There was nowhere to look without meeting curious eyes.  \"I'm headed toward building four, I could show you the way\u2026\" Definitely over-helpful.\u201d I'm Eric,\" he added. I smiled tentatively.\u201d Thanks.\" We got our jackets and headed out into the rain, which had picked up. I could have sworn several people behind us were walking close enough to eavesdrop. I hoped I wasn't getting paranoid. \"So, this is a lot different than Phoenix, huh?\" he asked. \"Very.\" \"It doesn't rain much there, does it?\" \"Three or four times a year.\" \"Wow, what must that be like?\" he wondered. \"Sunny,\" I told him. \"You don't look very tan.\" \"My mother is part albino.\" He studied my face apprehensively, and I sighed. It looked like clouds and a sense of humor didn't mix. A few months of this and I'd forget how to use sarcasm. We walked back around the cafeteria, to the south buildings by the gym. Eric walked me right to the door, though it was clearly marked. \"Well, good luck,\" he said as I touched the handle.\u201d Maybe we'll have some other classes together.\" He sounded hopeful. I smiled at him vaguely and went inside.  The rest of the morning passed in about the same fashion. My Trigonometry teacher, Mr. Varner, who I would have hated anyway just because of the subject he taught, was the only one who made me stand in front of the class and introduce myself. I stammered, blushed, and tripped over my own boots on the way to my seat. After two classes, I started to recognize several of the faces in each class. There was always someone braver than the others who would introduce themselves and ask me questions about how I was liking Forks. I tried to be diplomatic, but mostly I just lied a lot. At least I never needed the map. One girl sat next to me in both Trig and Spanish, and she walked with me to the cafeteria for lunch. She was tiny, several inches shorter than my five feet four inches, but her wildly curly dark hair made up a lot of the difference between our heights. I couldn't remember her name, so I smiled and nodded as she prattled about teachers and classes. I didn't try to keep up. We sat at the end of a full table with several of her friends, who she introduced to me. I forgot all their names as soon as she spoke them. They seemed impressed by her bravery in speaking to me. The boy from English, Eric, waved at me from across the room. It was there, sitting in the lunchroom, trying to make conversation with seven curious strangers, that I first saw them. They were sitting in the corner of the cafeteria, as far away from where I sat as possible in the long room. There were five of them. They weren't talking, and they weren't eating, though they each had a tray of untouched food in front of them. They weren't gawking at me, unlike most of the other students, so it was safe to stare at them without fear of meeting an excessively interested pair of eyes. But it was none of these things that caught, and held, my attention. They didn't look anything alike. Of the three boys, one was big \u2014 muscled like a serious weight lifter, with dark, curly hair. Another was taller, leaner, but still muscular, and honey blond. The last was lanky, less bulky, with untidy, bronze-colored hair. He was more boyish than the others, who looked like they could be in college, or even teachers here rather than students. The girls were opposites. The tall one was statuesque. She had a beautiful figure, the kind you saw on the cover of the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue, the kind that made every girl around her take a hit on her self-esteem just by being in the same room. Her hair was golden, gently waving to the middle of her back. The short girl was pixielike, thin in the extreme, with small features. Her hair was a deep black, cropped short and pointing in every direction. And yet, they were all exactly alike. Every one of them was chalky pale, the palest of all the students living in this sunless town. Paler than me, the albino. They all had very dark eyes despite the range in hair tones. They also had dark shadows under those eyes \u2014 purplish, bruiselike shadows. As if they were all suffering from a sleepless night, or almost\u00a0 done recovering from a broken nose. Though their noses, all their features, were straight, perfect, angular.  But all this is not why I couldn't look away. I stared because their faces, so different, so similar, were all devastatingly, inhumanly beautiful. They were faces you never expected to see except perhaps on the airbrushed pages of a fashion magazine. Or painted by an old master as the face of an angel. It was hard to decide who was the most beautiful \u2014 maybe the perfect blond girl, or the bronze-haired boy. They were all looking away \u2014 away from each other, away from the other students, away from anything in particular as far as I could tell. As I watched, the small girl rose with her tray \u2014 unopened soda, unbitten apple \u2014 and walked away with a quick, graceful lope that belonged on a runway. I watched, amazed at her lithe dancer's step, till she dumped her tray and glided through the back door, faster than I would have thought possible. My eyes darted back to the others, who sat unchanging. \"Who are they?\" I asked the girl from my Spanish class, whose name I'd forgotten. As she looked up to see who I meant \u2014 though already knowing, probably, from my tone \u2014 suddenly he looked at her, the thinner one, the boyish one, the youngest, perhaps. He looked at my neighbor for just a fraction of a second, and then his dark eyes flickered to mine. He looked away quickly, more quickly than I could, though in a flush of embarrassment I dropped my eyes at once. In that brief flash of a glance, his face held nothing of interest \u2014 it was as if she had called his name, and he'd looked up in involuntary response, already having decided not to answer.  My neighbor giggled in embarrassment, looking at the table like I did.  \"That's Edward and Emmett Cullen, and Rosalie and Jasper Hale. The one who left was Alice Cullen; they all live together with Dr. Cullen and his wife.\" She said this under her breath. I glanced sideways at the beautiful boy, who was looking at his tray now, picking a bagel to pieces with long, pale fingers. His mouth was moving very quickly, his perfect lips barely opening.  The other three still looked away, and yet I felt he was speaking quietly to them. Strange, unpopular names, I thought. The kinds of names grandparents had.  But maybe that was in vogue here \u2014 small town names? I finally remembered that my neighbor was called Jessica, a perfectly common name. There were two girls named Jessica in my History class back home. \"They are\u2026 very nice-looking.\" I struggled with the conspicuous understatement. \"Yes!\" Jessica agreed with another giggle.\u201d They're all together though \u2014 Emmett and Rosalie, and Jasper and Alice, I mean. And they live together.\" Her voice held all the shock and condemnation of the small town, I thought critically. But, if I was being honest, I had to admit that even in Phoenix, it would cause gossip. \"Which ones are the Cullens?\" I asked.\u201d They don't look related\u2026\" \"Oh, they're not. Dr. Cullen is really young, in his twenties or early thirties. They're all adopted. The Hales are brother and sister, twins \u2014 the blondes \u2014 and they're foster children.\" \"They look a little old for foster children.\" \"They are now, Jasper and Rosalie are both eighteen, but they've been with Mrs. Cullen since they were eight. She's their aunt or something like that.\" \"That's really kind of nice \u2014 for them to take care of all those kids like that, when they're so young and everything.\" \"I guess so,\" Jessica admitted reluctantly, and I got the impression that she didn't like the doctor and his wife for some reason. With the glances she was throwing at their adopted children, I would presume the reason was jealousy.\u201d I think that Mrs. Cullen can't have any kids, though,\" she added, as if that lessened their kindness. Throughout all this conversation, my eyes flickered again and again to the table where the strange family sat. They continued to look at the walls and not eat. \"Have they always lived in Forks?\" I asked. Surely I would have noticed them on one of my summers here. \"No,\" she said in a voice that implied it should be obvious, even to a new arrival like me.\u201d They just moved down two years ago from somewhere in Alaska.\" I felt a surge of pity, and relief. Pity because, as beautiful as they were, they were outsiders, clearly not accepted. Relief that I wasn't the only newcomer here, and certainly not the most interesting by any standard. As I examined them, the youngest, one of the Cullens, looked up and met my gaze, this time with evident curiosity in his expression. As I looked swiftly away, it seemed to me that his glance held some kind of unmet expectation. \"Which one is the boy with the reddish brown hair?\" I asked. I peeked at him from the corner of my eye, and he was still staring at me, but not gawking like the other students had today \u2014 he had a slightly frustrated expression. I looked down again. \"That's Edward. He's gorgeous, of course, but don't waste your time. He doesn't date. Apparently none of the girls here are good-looking enough for him.\" She sniffed, a clear case of sour grapes. I wondered when he'd turned her down. I bit my lip to hide my smile. Then I glanced at him again. His face was turned away, but I thought his cheek appeared lifted, as if he were smiling, too. After a few more minutes, the four of them left the table together. They all were noticeably graceful \u2014 even the big, brawny one. It was unsettling to watch. The one named Edward didn't look at me again. I sat at the table with Jessica and her friends longer than I would have if I'd been sitting alone. I was anxious not to be late for class on my first day. One of my new acquaintances, who considerately reminded me that her name was Angela, had Biology II with me the next hour. We walked to class together in silence. She was shy, too. When we entered the classroom, Angela went to sit at a black-topped lab table exactly like the ones I was used to. She already had a neighbor. In fact, all the tables were filled but one. Next to the center aisle, I recognized Edward Cullen by his unusual hair, sitting next to that single open seat.  As I walked down the aisle to introduce myself to the teacher and get my slip signed, I was watching him surreptitiously. Just as I passed, he suddenly went rigid in his seat. He stared at me again, meeting my eyes with the strangest expression on his face \u2014 it was hostile, furious. I looked away quickly, shocked, going red again. I stumbled over a book in the walkway and had to catch myself on the edge of a table. The girl sitting there giggled. I'd noticed that his eyes were black \u2014 coal black. Mr. Banner signed my slip and handed me a book with no nonsense about introductions. I could tell we were going to get along. Of course, he had no choice but to send me to the one open seat in the middle of the room. I kept my eyes down as I went to sit by him, bewildered by the antagonistic stare he'd given me. I didn't look up as I set my book on the table and took my seat, but I saw his posture change from the corner of my eye. He was leaning away from me, sitting on the extreme edge of his chair and averting his face like he smelled something bad. Inconspicuously, I sniffed my hair. It smelled like strawberries, the scent of my favorite shampoo. It seemed an innocent enough odor. I let my hair fall over my right shoulder, making a dark curtain between us, and tried to pay attention to the teacher. Unfortunately the lecture was on cellular anatomy, something I'd already studied. I took notes carefully anyway, always looking down. I couldn't stop myself from peeking occasionally through the screen of my hair at the strange boy next to me. During the whole class, he never relaxed his stiff position on the edge of his chair, sitting as far from me as possible. I could see his hand on his left leg was clenched into a fist, tendons standing out under his pale skin. This, too, he never relaxed. He had the long sleeves of his white shirt pushed up to his elbows, and his forearm was surprisingly hard and muscular beneath his light skin. He wasn't nearly as slight as he'd looked next to his burly brother. The class seemed to drag on longer than the others. Was it because the day was finally coming to a close, or because I was waiting for his tight fist to loosen? It never did; he continued to sit so still it looked like he wasn't breathing. What was wrong with him? Was this his normal behavior? I questioned my judgment on Jessica's bitterness at lunch today. Maybe she was not as resentful as I'd thought.  It couldn't have anything to do with me. He didn't know me from Eve.  I peeked up at him one more time, and regretted it. He was glaring down at me again, his black eyes full of revulsion. As I flinched away from him, shrinking against my chair, the phrase if looks could kill suddenly ran through my mind. At that moment, the bell rang loudly, making me jump, and Edward Cullen was out of his seat. Fluidly he rose \u2014 he was much taller than I'd thought \u2014 his back to me, and he was out the door before anyone else was out of their seat. I sat frozen in my seat, staring blankly after him. He was so mean. It wasn't fair. I began gathering up my things slowly, trying to block the anger that filled me, for fear my eyes would tear up. For some reason, my temper was hardwired to my tear ducts. I usually cried when I was angry, a humiliating tendency. \"Aren't you Isabella Swan?\" a male voice asked. I looked up to see a cute, baby-faced boy, his pale blond hair carefully gelled into orderly spikes, smiling at me in a friendly way. He obviously didn't think I smelled bad. \"Bella,\" I corrected him, with a smile. \"I'm Mike.\" \"Hi, Mike.\" \"Do you need any help finding your next class?\" \"I'm headed to the gym, actually. I think I can find it.\" \"That's my next class, too.\" He seemed thrilled, though it wasn't that big of a coincidence in a school this small. We walked to class together; he was a chatterer \u2014 he supplied most of the conversation, which made it easy for me. He'd lived in California till he was ten, so he knew how I felt about the sun. It turned out he was in my English class also. He was the nicest person I'd met today. But as we were entering the gym, he asked, \"So, did you stab Edward Cullen with a pencil or what? I've never seen him act like that.\" I cringed. So I wasn't the only one who had noticed. And, apparently, that wasn't Edward Cullen's usual behavior. I decided to play dumb. \"Was that the boy I sat next to in Biology?\" I asked artlessly. \"Yes,\" he said.\u201d He looked like he was in pain or something.\" \"I don't know,\" I responded.\u201d I never spoke to him.\" \"He's a weird guy.\" Mike lingered by me instead of heading to the dressing room.\u201d If I were lucky enough to sit by you, I would have talked to you.\" I smiled at him before walking through the girls' locker room door. He was friendly and clearly admiring. But it wasn't enough to ease my irritation. The Gym teacher, Coach Clapp, found me a uniform but didn't make me dress down for today's class. At home, only two years of RE. were required. Here, P.E. was mandatory all four years. Forks was literally my personal hell on Earth. I watched four volleyball games running simultaneously. Remembering how many injuries I had sustained \u2014 and inflicted \u2014 playing volleyball, I felt faintly nauseated. The final bell rang at last. I walked slowly to the office to return my paperwork. The rain had drifted away, but the wind was strong, and colder. I wrapped my arms around myself. When I walked into the warm office, I almost turned around and walked back out. Edward Cullen stood at the desk in front of me. I recognized again that tousled bronze hair. He didn't appear to notice the sound of my entrance. I stood pressed against the back wall, waiting for the receptionist to be free. He was arguing with her in a low, attractive voice. I quickly picked up the gist of the argument. He was trying to trade from sixth-hour Biology to another time \u2014 any other time. I just couldn't believe that this was about me. It had to be something else, something that happened before I entered the Biology room. The look on his face must have been about another aggravation entirely. It was impossible that this stranger could take such a sudden, intense dislike to me. The door opened again, and the cold wind suddenly gusted through the room, rustling the papers on the desk, swirling my hair around my face. The girl who came in merely stepped to the desk, placed a note in the wire basket, and walked out again. But Edward Cullen's back stiffened, and he turned slowly to glare at me \u2014 his face was absurdly handsome \u2014 with piercing, hate-filled eyes. For an instant, I felt a thrill of genuine fear, raising the hair on my arms. The look only lasted a second, but it chilled me more than the freezing wind. He turned back to the receptionist. \"Never mind, then,\" he said hastily in a voice like velvet.\u201d I can see that it's impossible. Thank you so much for your help.\" And he turned on his heel without another look at me, and disappeared out the door. I went meekly to the desk, my face white for once instead of red, and handed her the signed slip. \"How did your first day go, dear?\" the receptionist asked maternally. \"Fine,\" I lied, my voice weak. She didn't look convinced. When I got to the truck, it was almost the last car in the lot. It seemed like a haven, already the closest thing to home I had in this damp green hole. I sat inside for a while, just staring out the windshield blankly. But soon I was cold enough to need the heater, so I turned the key and the engine roared to life. I headed back to Charlie's house, fighting tears the whole way there.",
