I stared without breathing across the long room, into the dark eyes of the hunter, and he looked pleasantly back at me. Surely it was a good way to die, in the place of someone else, someone I loved. Noble, even. That ought to count for something. I knew that if I'd never gone to Forks, I wouldn't be facing death now. But, terrified as I was, I couldn't bring myself to regret the decision. When life offers you a dream so far beyond any of your expectations, it's not reasonable to grieve when it comes to an end. The hunter smiled in a friendly way as he sauntered forward to kill me. 1.\u00a0 FIRST SIGHT My mother drove me to the airport with the windows rolled down. It was seventy-five degrees in Phoenix, the sky a perfect, cloudless blue. I was wearing my favorite shirt \u2014 sleeveless, white eyelet lace; I was wearing it as a farewell gesture. My carry-on item was a parka. In the Olympic Peninsula of northwest Washington State, a small town named Forks exists under a near-constant cover of clouds. It rains on this inconsequential town more than any other place in the United States of America. It was from this town and its gloomy, omnipresent shade that my mother escaped with me when I was only a few months old. It was in this town that I'd been compelled to spend a month every summer until I was fourteen. That was the year I finally put my foot down; these past three summers, my dad, Charlie, vacationed with me in California for two weeks instead.  It was to Forks that I now exiled myself\u2014 an action that I took with great horror. I detested Forks. I loved Phoenix. I loved the sun and the blistering heat. I loved the vigorous, sprawling city. \"Bella,\" my mom said to me \u2014 the last of a thousand times \u2014 before I got on the plane.\u201d You don't have to do this.\" My mom looks like me, except with short hair and laugh lines. I felt a spasm of panic as I stared at her wide, childlike eyes. How could I leave my loving, erratic, harebrained mother to fend for herself? Of course she had Phil now, so the bills would probably get paid, there would be food in the refrigerator, gas in her car, and someone to call when she got lost, but still\u2026 \"I want to go,\" I lied. I'd always been a bad liar, but I'd been saying this lie so frequently lately that it sounded almost convincing now. \"Tell Charlie I said hi.\" \"I will.\" \"I'll see you soon,\" she insisted.\u201d You can come home whenever you want \u2014 I'll come right back as soon as you need me.\" But I could see the sacrifice in her eyes behind the promise.  \"Don't worry about me,\" I urged.\u201d It'll be great. I love you, Mom.\" She hugged me tightly for a minute, and then I got on the plane, and she was gone. It's a four-hour flight from Phoenix to Seattle, another hour in a small plane up to Port Angeles, and then an hour drive back down to Forks. Flying doesn't bother me; the hour in the car with Charlie, though, I was a little worried about. Charlie had really been fairly nice about the whole thing. He seemed genuinely pleased that I was coming to live with him for the first time with any degree of permanence. He'd already gotten me registered for high school and was going to help me get a car. But it was sure to be awkward with Charlie. Neither of us was what anyone would call verbose, and I didn't know what there was to say regardless. I knew he was more than a little confused by my decision \u2014 like my mother before me, I hadn't made a secret of my distaste for Forks. When I landed in Port Angeles, it was raining. I didn't see it as an omen \u2014 just unavoidable. I'd already said my goodbyes to the sun. Charlie was waiting for me with the cruiser. This I was expecting, too.  Charlie is Police Chief Swan to the good people of Forks. My primary motivation behind buying a car, despite the scarcity of my funds, was that I refused to be driven around town in a car with red and blue lights on top. Nothing slows down traffic like a cop. Charlie gave me an awkward, one-armed hug when I stumbled my way off the plane. \"It's good to see you, Bells,\" he said, smiling as he automatically caught and steadied me.\u201d You haven't changed much. How's Ren\u00e9e?\" \"Mom's fine. It's good to see you, too, Dad.\" I wasn't allowed to call him Charlie to his face. I had only a few bags. Most of my Arizona clothes were too permeable for Washington. My mom and I had pooled our resources to supplement my winter wardrobe, but it was still scanty. It all fit easily into the trunk of the cruiser. \"I found a good car for you, really cheap,\" he announced when we were strapped in. \"What kind of car?\" I was suspicious of the way he said \"good car for you\" as opposed to just \"good car.\" \"Well, it's a truck actually, a Chevy.\" \"Where did you find it?\" \"Do you remember Billy Black down at La Push?\" La Push is the tiny Indian reservation on the coast. \"No.\" \"He used to go fishing with us during the summer,\" Charlie prompted.  That would explain why I didn't remember him. I do a good job of blocking painful, unnecessary things from my memory. \"He's in a wheelchair now,\" Charlie continued when I didn't respond, \"so he can't drive anymore, and he offered to sell me his truck cheap.\" \"What year is it?\" I could see from his change of expression that this was the question he was hoping I wouldn't ask. \"Well, Billy's done a lot of work on the engine \u2014 it's only a few years old, really.\" I hoped he didn't think so little of me as to believe I would give up that easily.\u201d When did he buy it?\" \"He bought it in 1984, I think.\" \"Did he buy it new?\" \"Well, no. I think it was new in the early sixties \u2014 or late fifties at the earliest,\" he admitted sheepishly. \"Ch \u2014 Dad, I don't really know anything about cars. I wouldn't be able to fix it if anything went wrong, and I couldn't afford a mechanic\u2026\" \"Really, Bella, the thing runs great. They don't build them like that anymore.\" The thing, I thought to myself\u2026 it had possibilities \u2014 as a nickname, at the very least. \"How cheap is cheap?\" After all, that was the part I couldn't compromise on. \"Well, honey, I kind of already bought it for you. As a homecoming gift.\" Charlie peeked sideways at me with a hopeful expression. Wow. Free. \"You didn't need to do that, Dad. I was going to buy myself a car.\" \"I don't mind. I want you to be happy here.\" He was looking ahead at the road when he said this. Charlie wasn't comfortable with expressing his emotions out loud. I inherited that from him. So I was looking straight ahead as I responded. \"That's really nice, Dad. Thanks. I really appreciate it.\" No need to add that my being happy in Forks is an impossibility. He didn't need to suffer along with me. And I never looked a free truck in the mouth \u2014 or engine. \"Well, now, you're welcome,\" he mumbled, embarrassed by my thanks.  We exchanged a few more comments on the weather, which was wet, and that was pretty much it for Conversation. We stared out the windows in silence. It was beautiful, of course; I couldn't deny that. Everything was green: the trees, their trunks covered with moss, their branches hanging with a canopy of it, the ground covered with ferns. Even the air filtered down greenly through the leaves. Eventually we made it to Charlie's. He still lived in the small, two-bedroom house that he'd bought with my mother in the early days of their marriage. Those were the only kind of days their marriage had \u2014 the early ones. There, parked on the street in front of the house that never changed, was my new \u2014 well, new to me \u2014 truck. It was a faded red color, with big, rounded fenders and a bulbous cab. To my intense surprise, I loved it. I didn't know if it would run, but I could see myself in it. Plus, it was one of those solid iron affairs that never gets damaged \u2014 the kind you see at the scene of an accident, paint unscratched, surrounded by the pieces of the foreign car it had destroyed. \"Wow, Dad, I love it! Thanks!\" Now my horrific day tomorrow would be just that much less dreadful. I wouldn't be faced with the choice of either walking two miles in the rain to school or accepting a ride in the Chief's cruiser. \"I'm glad you like it,\" Charlie said gruffly, embarrassed again. It took only one trip to get all my stuff upstairs. I got the west bedroom that faced out over the front yard. The room was familiar; it had been belonged to me since I was born. The wooden floor, the light blue walls, the peaked ceiling, the yellowed lace curtains around the window \u2014 these were all a part of my childhood. The only changes Charlie had ever made were switching the crib for a bed and adding a desk as I grew. The desk now held a secondhand computer, with the phone line for the modem stapled along the floor to the nearest phone jack. This was a stipulation from my mother, so that we could stay in touch easily. The rocking chair from my baby days was still in the corner. There was only one small bathroom at the top of the stairs, which I would have to share with Charlie. I was trying not to dwell too much on that fact. One of the best things about Charlie is he doesn't hover. He left me alone to unpack and get settled, a feat that would have been altogether impossible for my mother. It was nice to be alone, not to have to smile and look pleased; a relief to stare dejectedly out the window at the sheeting rain and let just a few tears escape. I wasn't in the mood to go on a real crying jag. I would save that for bedtime, when I would have to think about the coming morning. Forks High School had a frightening total of only three hundred and fifty-seven \u2014 now fifty-eight \u2014 students; there were more than seven hundred people in my junior class alone back home. All of the kids here had grown up together \u2014 their grandparents had been toddlers together. I would be the new girl from the big city, a curiosity, a freak. Maybe, if I looked like a girl from Phoenix should, I could work this to my advantage. But physically, I'd never fit in anywhere. I should be tan, sporty, blond \u2014 a volleyball player, or a cheerleader, perhaps \u2014 all the things that go with living in the valley of the sun. Instead, I was ivory-skinned, without even the excuse of blue eyes or red hair, despite the constant sunshine. I had always been slender, but soft somehow, obviously not an athlete; I didn't have the necessary hand-eye coordination to play sports without humiliating myself \u2014 and harming both myself and anyone else who stood too close. When I finished putting my clothes in the old pine dresser, I took my bag of bathroom necessities and went to the communal bathroom to clean myself up after the day of travel. I looked at my face in the mirror as I brushed through my tangled, damp hair. Maybe it was the light, but already I looked sallower, unhealthy. My skin could be pretty \u2014 it was very clear, almost translucent-looking \u2014 but it all depended on color. I had no color here. Facing my pallid reflection in the mirror, I was forced to admit that I was lying to myself. It wasn't just physically that I'd never fit in. And if I couldn't find a niche in a school with three thousand people, what were my chances here? I didn't relate well to people my age. Maybe the truth was that I didn't relate well to people, period. Even my mother, who I was closer to than anyone else on the planet, was never in harmony with me, never on exactly the same page. Sometimes I wondered if I was seeing the same things through my eyes that the rest of the world was seeing through theirs. Maybe there was a glitch in my brain. But the cause didn't matter. All that mattered was the effect. And tomorrow would be just the beginning.  I didn't sleep well that night, even after I was done crying. The constant whooshing of the rain and wind across the roof wouldn't fade into the background. I pulled the faded old quilt over my head, and later added the pillow, too. But I couldn't fall asleep until after midnight, when the rain finally settled into a quieter drizzle. Thick fog was all I could see out my window in the morning, and I could feel the \u00a0claustrophobia creeping up on me. You could never see the sky here; it was like a cage. Breakfast with Charlie was a quiet event. He wished me good luck at school. I thanked him, knowing his hope was wasted. Good luck tended to avoid me. Charlie left first, off to the police station that was his wife and family. After he left, I sat at the old square oak table in one of the three unmatching chairs and examined his small kitchen, with its dark paneled walls, bright yellow cabinets, and white linoleum floor. Nothing was changed. My mother had painted the cabinets eighteen years ago in an attempt to bring some sunshine into the house. Over the small fireplace in the adjoining handkerchief-sized family room was a row of pictures. First a wedding picture of Charlie and my mom in Las Vegas, then one of the three of us in the hospital after I was born, taken by a helpful nurse, followed by the procession of my school pictures up to last year's. Those were embarrassing to look at \u2014 I would have to see what I could do to get Charlie to put them somewhere else, at least while I was living here. It was impossible, being in this house, not to realize that Charlie had never gotten over my mom. It made me uncomfortable. I didn't want to be too early to school, but I couldn't stay in the house anymore. I donned my jacket \u2014 which had the feel of a biohazard suit \u2014 and headed out into the rain. It was just drizzling still, not enough to soak me through immediately as I reached for the house key that was always hidden under the eaves by the door, and locked up. The sloshing of my new waterproof boots was unnerving. I missed the normal crunch of gravel as I walked. I couldn't pause and admire my truck again as I wanted; I was in a hurry to get out of the misty wet that swirled around my head and clung to my hair under my hood. Inside the truck, it was nice and dry. Either Billy or Charlie had obviously cleaned it up, but the tan upholstered seats still smelled faintly of tobacco, gasoline, and peppermint. The engine started quickly, to my relief, but loudly, roaring to life and then idling at top volume. Well, a truck this old was bound to have a flaw. The antique radio worked, a plus that I hadn't expected. Finding the school wasn't difficult, though I'd never been there before. The school was, like most other things, just off the highway. It was not obvious that it was a school; only the sign, which declared it to be the Forks High School, made me stop. It looked like a collection of matching houses, built with maroon-colored bricks. There were so many trees and shrubs I couldn't see its size at first. Where was the feel of the institution? I wondered nostalgically. Where were the chain-link fences, the metal detectors? I parked in front of the first building, which had a small sign over the door reading front office. No one else was parked there, so I was sure it was off limits, but I decided I would get directions inside instead of circling around in the rain like an idiot. I stepped unwillingly out of the toasty truck cab and walked down a little stone path lined with dark hedges. I took a deep breath before opening the door.  Inside, it was brightly lit, and warmer than I'd hoped. The office was small; a little waiting area with padded folding chairs, orange-flecked commercial carpet, notices and awards cluttering the walls, a big clock ticking loudly. Plants grew everywhere in large plastic pots, as if there wasn't enough greenery outside. The room was cut in half by a long counter, cluttered with wire baskets full of papers and brightly colored flyers taped to its front. There were three desks behind the counter, one of which was manned by a large, red-haired woman wearing glasses. She was wearing a purple t-shirt, which immediately made me feel overdressed. The red-haired woman looked up.\u201d Can I help you?\" \"I'm Isabella Swan,\" I informed her, and saw the immediate awareness light her eyes. I was expected, a topic of gossip no doubt. Daughter of the Chief's flighty ex-wife, come home at last. \"Of course,\" she said. She dug through a precariously stacked pile of documents on her desk till she found the ones she was looking for.\u201d I have your schedule right here, and a map of the school.\" She brought several sheets to the counter to show me. She went through my classes for me, highlighting the best route to each on the map, and gave me a slip to have each teacher sign, which I was to bring back at the end of the day. She smiled at me and hoped, like Charlie, that I would like it here in Forks. I smiled back as convincingly as I could. When I went back out to my truck, other students were starting to arrive. I drove around the school, following the line of traffic. I was glad to see that most of the cars were older like mine, nothing flashy. At home I'd lived in one of the few lower-income neighborhoods that were included in the Paradise Valley District. It was a common thing to see a new Mercedes or Porsche in the student lot. The nicest car here was a shiny Volvo, and it stood out. Still, I cut the engine as soon as I was in a spot, so that the thunderous volume wouldn't draw attention to me. I looked at the map in the truck, trying to memorize it now; hopefully I wouldn't have to walk around with it stuck in front of my nose all day. I stuffed everything in my bag, slung the strap over my shoulder, and sucked in a huge breath. I can do this, I lied to myself feebly. No one was going to bite me. I finally exhaled and stepped out of the truck.  I kept my face pulled back into my hood as I walked to the sidewalk, crowded with teenagers. My plain black jacket didn't stand out, I noticed with relief. Once I got around the cafeteria, building three was easy to spot. A large black \"3\" was painted on a white square on the east corner. I felt my breathing gradually creeping toward hyperventilation as I approached the door. I tried holding my breath as I followed two unisex raincoats through the door.  The classroom was small. The people in front of me stopped just inside the door to hang up their coats on a long row of hooks. I copied them.  They were two girls, one a porcelain-colored blonde, the other also pale, with light brown hair. At least my skin wouldn't be a standout here.  I took the slip up to the teacher, a tall, balding man whose desk had a nameplate identifying him as Mr. Mason. He gawked at me when he saw my name \u2014 not an encouraging response \u2014 and of course I flushed tomato red. But at least he sent me to an empty desk at the back without introducing me to the class. It was harder for my new classmates to stare at me in the back, but somehow, they managed. I kept my eyes down on the reading list the teacher had given me. It was fairly basic: Bronte, Shakespeare, Chaucer, Faulkner. I'd already read everything. That was comforting\u2026 and boring. I wondered if my mom would send me my folder of old essays, or if she would think that was cheating. I went through different arguments with her in my head while the teacher droned on. When the bell rang, a nasal buzzing sound, a gangly boy with skin problems and hair black as an oil slick leaned across the aisle to talk to me. \"You're Isabella Swan, aren't you?\" He looked like the overly helpful, chess club type. \"Bella,\" I corrected. Everyone within a three-seat radius turned to look at me. \"Where's your next class?\" he asked.  I had to check in my bag.\u201d Um, Government, with Jefferson, in building six.\" There was nowhere to look without meeting curious eyes.  \"I'm headed toward building four, I could show you the way\u2026\" Definitely over-helpful.\u201d I'm Eric,\" he added. I smiled tentatively.\u201d Thanks.\" We got our jackets and headed out into the rain, which had picked up. I could have sworn several people behind us were walking close enough to eavesdrop. I hoped I wasn't getting paranoid. \"So, this is a lot different than Phoenix, huh?\" he asked. \"Very.\" \"It doesn't rain much there, does it?\" \"Three or four times a year.\" \"Wow, what must that be like?\" he wondered. \"Sunny,\" I told him. \"You don't look very tan.\" \"My mother is part <em>albino</em>.\" He studied my face apprehensively, and I sighed. It looked like clouds and a sense of humor didn't mix. A few months of this and I'd forget how to use sarcasm. We walked back around the cafeteria, to the south buildings by the gym. Eric walked me right to the door, though it was clearly marked. \"Well, good luck,\" he said as I touched the handle.\u201d Maybe we'll have some other classes together.\" He sounded hopeful. I smiled at him vaguely and went inside.  The rest of the morning passed in about the same fashion. My Trigonometry teacher, Mr. Varner, who I would have hated anyway just because of the subject he taught, was the only one who made me stand in front of the class and introduce myself. I stammered, blushed, and tripped over my own boots on the way to my seat. After two classes, I started to recognize several of the faces in each class. There was always someone braver than the others who would introduce themselves and ask me questions about how I was liking Forks. I tried to be diplomatic, but mostly I just lied a lot. At least I never needed the map. One girl sat next to me in both Trig and Spanish, and she walked with me to the cafeteria for lunch. She was tiny, several inches shorter than my five feet four inches, but her wildly curly dark hair made up a lot of the difference between our heights. I couldn't remember her name, so I smiled and nodded as she prattled about teachers and classes. I didn't try to keep up. We sat at the end of a full table with several of her friends, who she introduced to me. I forgot all their names as soon as she spoke them. They seemed impressed by her bravery in speaking to me. The boy from English, Eric, waved at me from across the room. It was there, sitting in the lunchroom, trying to make conversation with seven curious strangers, that I first saw them. They were sitting in the corner of the cafeteria, as far away from where I sat as possible in the long room. There were five of them. They weren't talking, and they weren't eating, though they each had a tray of untouched food in front of them. They weren't gawking at me, unlike most of the other students, so it was safe to stare at them without fear of meeting an excessively interested pair of eyes. But it was none of these things that caught, and held, my attention. They didn't look anything alike. Of the three boys, one was big \u2014 muscled like a serious weight lifter, with dark, curly hair. Another was taller, leaner, but still muscular, and honey blond. The last was lanky, less bulky, with untidy, bronze-colored hair. He was more boyish than the others, who looked like they could be in college, or even teachers here rather than students. The girls were opposites. The tall one was statuesque. She had a beautiful figure, the kind you saw on the cover of the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue, the kind that made every girl around her take a hit on her self-esteem just by being in the same room. Her hair was golden, gently waving to the middle of her back. The short girl was pixielike, thin in the extreme, with small features. Her hair was a deep black, cropped short and pointing in every direction. And yet, they were all exactly alike. Every one of them was chalky pale, the palest of all the students living in this sunless town. Paler than me, the <em>albino</em>. They all had very dark eyes despite the range in hair tones. They also had dark shadows under those eyes \u2014 purplish, bruiselike shadows. As if they were all suffering from a sleepless night, or almost\u00a0 done recovering from a broken nose. Though their noses, all their features, were straight, perfect, angular.  But all this is not why I couldn't look away. I stared because their faces, so different, so similar, were all devastatingly, inhumanly beautiful. They were faces you never expected to see except perhaps on the airbrushed pages of a fashion magazine. Or painted by an old master as the face of an angel. It was hard to decide who was the most beautiful \u2014 maybe the perfect blond girl, or the bronze-haired boy. They were all looking away \u2014 away from each other, away from the other students, away from anything in particular as far as I could tell. As I watched, the small girl rose with her tray \u2014 unopened soda, unbitten apple \u2014 and walked away with a quick, graceful lope that belonged on a runway. I watched, amazed at her lithe dancer's step, till she dumped her tray and glided through the back door, faster than I would have thought possible. My eyes darted back to the others, who sat unchanging. \"Who are they?\" I asked the girl from my Spanish class, whose name I'd forgotten. As she looked up to see who I meant \u2014 though already knowing, probably, from my tone \u2014 suddenly he looked at her, the thinner one, the boyish one, the youngest, perhaps. He looked at my neighbor for just a fraction of a second, and then his dark eyes flickered to mine. He looked away quickly, more quickly than I could, though in a flush of embarrassment I dropped my eyes at once. In that brief flash of a glance, his face held nothing of interest \u2014 it was as if she had called his name, and he'd looked up in involuntary response, already having decided not to answer.  My neighbor giggled in embarrassment, looking at the table like I did.  \"That's Edward and Emmett Cullen, and Rosalie and Jasper Hale. The one who left was Alice Cullen; they all live together with Dr. Cullen and his wife.\" She said this under her breath. I glanced sideways at the beautiful boy, who was looking at his tray now, picking a bagel to pieces with long, pale fingers. His mouth was moving very quickly, his perfect lips barely opening.  The other three still looked away, and yet I felt he was speaking quietly to them. Strange, unpopular names, I thought. The kinds of names grandparents had.  But maybe that was in vogue here \u2014 small town names? I finally remembered that my neighbor was called Jessica, a perfectly common name. There were two girls named Jessica in my History class back home. \"They are\u2026 very nice-looking.\" I struggled with the conspicuous understatement. \"Yes!\" Jessica agreed with another giggle.\u201d They're all together though \u2014 Emmett and Rosalie, and Jasper and Alice, I mean. And they live together.\" Her voice held all the shock and condemnation of the small town, I thought critically. But, if I was being honest, I had to admit that even in Phoenix, it would cause gossip. \"Which ones are the Cullens?\" I asked.\u201d They don't look related\u2026\" \"Oh, they're not. Dr. Cullen is really young, in his twenties or early thirties. They're all adopted. The Hales are brother and sister, twins \u2014 the blondes \u2014 and they're foster children.\" \"They look a little old for foster children.\" \"They are now, Jasper and Rosalie are both eighteen, but they've been with Mrs. Cullen since they were eight. She's their aunt or something like that.\" \"That's really kind of nice \u2014 for them to take care of all those kids like that, when they're so young and everything.\" \"I guess so,\" Jessica admitted reluctantly, and I got the impression that she didn't like the doctor and his wife for some reason. With the glances she was throwing at their adopted children, I would presume the reason was jealousy.\u201d I think that Mrs. Cullen can't have any kids, though,\" she added, as if that lessened their kindness. Throughout all this conversation, my eyes flickered again and again to the table where the strange family sat. They continued to look at the walls and not eat. \"Have they always lived in Forks?\" I asked. Surely I would have noticed them on one of my summers here. \"No,\" she said in a voice that implied it should be obvious, even to a new arrival like me.\u201d They just moved down two years ago from somewhere in Alaska.\" I felt a surge of pity, and relief. Pity because, as beautiful as they were, they were outsiders, clearly not accepted. Relief that I wasn't the only newcomer here, and certainly not the most interesting by any standard. As I examined them, the youngest, one of the Cullens, looked up and met my gaze, this time with evident curiosity in his expression. As I looked swiftly away, it seemed to me that his glance held some kind of unmet expectation. \"Which one is the boy with the reddish brown hair?\" I asked. I peeked at him from the corner of my eye, and he was still staring at me, but not gawking like the other students had today \u2014 he had a slightly frustrated expression. I looked down again. \"That's Edward. He's gorgeous, of course, but don't waste your time. He doesn't date. Apparently none of the girls here are good-looking enough for him.\" She sniffed, a clear case of sour grapes. I wondered when he'd turned her down. I bit my lip to hide my smile. Then I glanced at him again. His face was turned away, but I thought his cheek appeared lifted, as if he were smiling, too. After a few more minutes, the four of them left the table together. They all were noticeably graceful \u2014 even the big, brawny one. It was unsettling to watch. The one named Edward didn't look at me again. I sat at the table with Jessica and her friends longer than I would have if I'd been sitting alone. I was anxious not to be late for class on my first day. One of my new acquaintances, who considerately reminded me that her name was Angela, had Biology II with me the next hour. We walked to class together in silence. She was shy, too. When we entered the classroom, Angela went to sit at a black-topped lab table exactly like the ones I was used to. She already had a neighbor. In fact, all the tables were filled but one. Next to the center aisle, I recognized Edward Cullen by his unusual hair, sitting next to that single open seat.  As I walked down the aisle to introduce myself to the teacher and get my slip signed, I was watching him surreptitiously. Just as I passed, he suddenly went rigid in his seat. He stared at me again, meeting my eyes with the strangest expression on his face \u2014 it was hostile, furious. I looked away quickly, shocked, going red again. I stumbled over a book in the walkway and had to catch myself on the edge of a table. The girl sitting there giggled. I'd noticed that his eyes were black \u2014 coal black. Mr. Banner signed my slip and handed me a book with no nonsense about introductions. I could tell we were going to get along. Of course, he had no choice but to send me to the one open seat in the middle of the room. I kept my eyes down as I went to sit by him, bewildered by the antagonistic stare he'd given me. I didn't look up as I set my book on the table and took my seat, but I saw his posture change from the corner of my eye. He was leaning away from me, sitting on the extreme edge of his chair and averting his face like he smelled something bad. Inconspicuously, I sniffed my hair. It smelled like strawberries, the scent of my favorite shampoo. It seemed an innocent enough odor. I let my hair fall over my right shoulder, making a dark curtain between us, and tried to pay attention to the teacher. Unfortunately the lecture was on cellular anatomy, something I'd already studied. I took notes carefully anyway, always looking down. I couldn't stop myself from peeking occasionally through the screen of my hair at the strange boy next to me. During the whole class, he never relaxed his stiff position on the edge of his chair, sitting as far from me as possible. I could see his hand on his left leg was clenched into a fist, tendons standing out under his pale skin. This, too, he never relaxed. He had the long sleeves of his white shirt pushed up to his elbows, and his forearm was surprisingly hard and muscular beneath his light skin. He wasn't nearly as slight as he'd looked next to his burly brother. The class seemed to drag on longer than the others. Was it because the day was finally coming to a close, or because I was waiting for his tight fist to loosen? It never did; he continued to sit so still it looked like he wasn't breathing. What was wrong with him? Was this his normal behavior? I questioned my judgment on Jessica's bitterness at lunch today. Maybe she was not as resentful as I'd thought.  It couldn't have anything to do with me. He didn't know me from Eve.  I peeked up at him one more time, and regretted it. He was glaring down at me again, his black eyes full of revulsion. As I flinched away from him, shrinking against my chair, the phrase if looks could kill suddenly ran through my mind. At that moment, the bell rang loudly, making me jump, and Edward Cullen was out of his seat. Fluidly he rose \u2014 he was much taller than I'd thought \u2014 his back to me, and he was out the door before anyone else was out of their seat. I sat frozen in my seat, staring blankly after him. He was so mean. It wasn't fair. I began gathering up my things slowly, trying to block the anger that filled me, for fear my eyes would tear up. For some reason, my temper was hardwired to my tear ducts. I usually cried when I was angry, a humiliating tendency. \"Aren't you Isabella Swan?\" a male voice asked. I looked up to see a cute, baby-faced boy, his pale blond hair carefully gelled into orderly spikes, smiling at me in a friendly way. He obviously didn't think I smelled bad. \"Bella,\" I corrected him, with a smile. \"I'm Mike.\" \"Hi, Mike.\" \"Do you need any help finding your next class?\" \"I'm headed to the gym, actually. I think I can find it.\" \"That's my next class, too.\" He seemed thrilled, though it wasn't that big of a coincidence in a school this small. We walked to class together; he was a chatterer \u2014 he supplied most of the conversation, which made it easy for me. He'd lived in California till he was ten, so he knew how I felt about the sun. It turned out he was in my English class also. He was the nicest person I'd met today. But as we were entering the gym, he asked, \"So, did you stab Edward Cullen with a pencil or what? I've never seen him act like that.\" I cringed. So I wasn't the only one who had noticed. And, apparently, that wasn't Edward Cullen's usual behavior. I decided to play dumb. \"Was that the boy I sat next to in Biology?\" I asked artlessly. \"Yes,\" he said.\u201d He looked like he was in pain or something.\" \"I don't know,\" I responded.\u201d I never spoke to him.\" \"He's a weird guy.\" Mike lingered by me instead of heading to the dressing room.\u201d If I were lucky enough to sit by you, I would have talked to you.\" I smiled at him before walking through the girls' locker room door. He was friendly and clearly admiring. But it wasn't enough to ease my irritation. The Gym teacher, Coach Clapp, found me a uniform but didn't make me dress down for today's class. At home, only two years of RE. were required. Here, P.E. was mandatory all four years. Forks was literally my personal hell on Earth. I watched four volleyball games running simultaneously. Remembering how many injuries I had sustained \u2014 and inflicted \u2014 playing volleyball, I felt faintly nauseated. The final bell rang at last. I walked slowly to the office to return my paperwork. The rain had drifted away, but the wind was strong, and colder. I wrapped my arms around myself. When I walked into the warm office, I almost turned around and walked back out. Edward Cullen stood at the desk in front of me. I recognized again that tousled bronze hair. He didn't appear to notice the sound of my entrance. I stood pressed against the back wall, waiting for the receptionist to be free. He was arguing with her in a low, attractive voice. I quickly picked up the gist of the argument. He was trying to trade from sixth-hour Biology to another time \u2014 any other time. I just couldn't believe that this was about me. It had to be something else, something that happened before I entered the Biology room. The look on his face must have been about another aggravation entirely. It was impossible that this stranger could take such a sudden, intense dislike to me. The door opened again, and the cold wind suddenly gusted through the room, rustling the papers on the desk, swirling my hair around my face. The girl who came in merely stepped to the desk, placed a note in the wire basket, and walked out again. But Edward Cullen's back stiffened, and he turned slowly to glare at me \u2014 his face was absurdly handsome \u2014 with piercing, hate-filled eyes. For an instant, I felt a thrill of genuine fear, raising the hair on my arms. The look only lasted a second, but it chilled me more than the freezing wind. He turned back to the receptionist. \"Never mind, then,\" he said hastily in a voice like velvet.\u201d I can see that it's impossible. Thank you so much for your help.\" And he turned on his heel without another look at me, and disappeared out the door. I went meekly to the desk, my face white for once instead of red, and handed her the signed slip. \"How did your first day go, dear?\" the receptionist asked maternally. \"Fine,\" I lied, my voice weak. She didn't look convinced. When I got to the truck, it was almost the last car in the lot. It seemed like a haven, already the closest thing to home I had in this damp green hole. I sat inside for a while, just staring out the windshield blankly. But soon I was cold enough to need the heater, so I turned the key and the engine roared to life. I headed back to Charlie's house, fighting tears the whole way there.",

            "en": "7 REPETITION        7 REPETITION I wasn't sure what the hell i was doing here. Was I trying to push myself back into the zombie stupor? Had I turned masochistic \u2014 developed a taste for torture? I should have gone straight down to La Push I felt much, much healthier around Jacob. This was not a healthy thing to do. But I continued to drive slowly down the overgrown lane, twisting through the trees that arched over me like a green, living tunnel. My hands were shaking, so I tightened my grip on the steering wheel. I knew that part of the reason I did this was the nightmare, now that I was really awake, the nothingness of the dream gnawed on my nerves, a dog worrying a bone. There was something to search for. Unattainable and impossible, uncaring and\u00a0\u00a0 distracted\u2026 but he was out there, somewhere. I had to believe that. The other part was the strange sense of repetition I'd felt at school today, the coincidence of the date. The feeling that I was starting over\u2014perhaps the way my first day would have gone if I'd really been the most unusual person in the cafeteria that afternoon. The words ran through my head, tonelessly, like I was reading them rather than hearing them spoken: It will be as if I'd never existed. I was lying to myself by splitting my reason for coming here into just two parts. I didn't want to admit the strongest motivation. Because it was mentally unsound. The truth was that I wanted to hear his voice again, like I had in the strange delusion Friday night. For that brief moment, when his voice came from some other part of me than my conscious memory, when his voice was perfect and honey smooth rather than the pale echo my memories usually produced, I was able to remember without pain. It hadn't lasted; the pain had caught up with me, as I was sure it would for this fool's errand. But those precious moments when I could hear him again were an irresistible lure. I had to find some way to repeat the experience\u2026 or maybe the better word was episode. I was hoping that d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu was the key. So I was going to his home, a place I hadn't been since my ill-fated birthday party, so many months ago. The thick, almost jungle-like growth crawled slowly past my windows. The drive wound on and on. I started to go faster, getting edgy. How long had I been driving? Shouldn't I have reached the house yet? The lane was so overgrown that it did not look familiar. What if I couldn't find it? I shivered. What if there was no tangible proof at all? Then there was the break in the trees that I was looking for, only it was not so\u00a0 pronounced as before. The flora here did not wait long to reclaim any land that was left unguarded. The tall ferns had infiltrated the meadow around the house, crowding against the trunks of the cedars, even the wide porch. It was like the lawn had been flooded\u2014waist-high\u2014with green, feathery waves. And the house was there, but it was not the same. Though nothing had changed on the outside, the emptiness screamed from the blank windows. It was creepy. For the first time since I'd seen the beautiful house, it looked like a fitting haunt for vampires. I hit the brakes, looking away. I was afraid to go farther. But nothing happened. No voice in my head. So I left the engine running and jumped out into the fern sea. Maybe, like Friday night, if I walked forward\u2026 I approached the barren, vacant face slowly, my truck rumbling out a comforting roar behind me. I stopped when I got to the porch stairs, because there was nothing here. No lingering sense of their presence\u2026 of his presence. The house was solidly here, but it meant little. Its concrete reality would not counteract the nothingness of the nightmares. I didn't go any closer. I didn't want to look in the windows. I wasn't sure which would be harder to see. If the rooms were bare, echoing empty from floor to ceiling, that would certainly hurt. Like my grandmother's funeral, when my mother had insisted that I stay outside during the viewing. She had said that I didn't need to see Gran that way, to remember her that way, rather than alive. But wouldn't it be worse if there were no change? If the couches sat just as I'd last seen them, the paintings on the walls\u2014worse still, the piano on its low platform? It would be second only to the house disappearing all together, to see that there was no physical possession that tied them in anyway. That everything remained, untouched and forgotten, behind them. Just like me. I turned my back on the gaping emptiness and hurried to my truck. I nearly ran. I was anxious to be gone, to get back to the human world. I felt hideously empty, and I wanted to see Jacob. Maybe I was developing a new kind of sickness, another addiction, like the numbness before. I didn't care. I pushed my truck as fast as it would go as I barreled toward my fix. Jacob was waiting for me. My chest seemed to relax as soon as I saw him, making it easier to breathe. \"Hey, Bella,\" he called. I smiled in relief. \"Hey, Jacob,\" I waved at Billy, who was looking out the window. \"Let's get to work,\" Jacob said in a low but eager voice. I was somehow able to laugh. \"You seriously aren't sick of me yet?\" I wondered. He must be starting to ask himself how desperate I was for company. Jacob led the way around the house to his garage. \"Nope. Not yet.\" \"Please let me know when I start getting on your nerves. I don't want to be a pain.\" \"Okay.\" He laughed, a throaty sound. \"I wouldn't hold your breath for that, though.\" When I walked into the garage, I was shocked to see the red bike standing up, looking like a motorcycle rather than a pile of jagged metal. \"Jake, you're amazing,\" I breathed. He laughed again. \"I get obsessive when I have a project.\" He shrugged. \"If I had any brains I'd drag it out a little bit.\" \"Why?\" He looked down, pausing for so long that I wondered if he hadn't heard my question. Finally, he asked me, \"Bella, if I told you that I couldn't fix these bikes, what would you say?\" I didn't answer right away, either, and he glanced up to check my expression. \"I would say\u2026 that's too bad, but I'll bet we could figure out something else to do. If we got really desperate, we could even do homework.\" Jacob smiled, and his shoulders relaxed. He sat down next to the bike and picked up a wrench. \"So you think you'll still come over when I'm done, then?\" \"Is that what you meant?\" I shook my head. \"I guess I am taking advantage of your very underpriced mechanical skills. But as long as you let me come over, I'll be here.\" \"Hoping to see Quil again?\" he teased. \"You caught me.\" He chuckled. \"You really like spending time with me?\" he asked, marveling. \"Very, very much. And I'll prove it. I have to work tomorrow, but Wednesday we'll do something nonmechanical.\" \"Like what?\" \"I have no idea. We can go to my place so you won't be tempted to be obsessive. You could bring your schoolwork\u2014you have to be getting behind, because I know I am.\" \"Homework might be a good idea.\" He made a face, and I wondered how much he was leaving undone to be with me. \"Yes,\" I agreed. \"We'll have to start being responsible occasionally, or Billy and Charlie aren't going to be so easygoing about this.\" I made a gesture indicating the two of us as a single entity. He liked that\u2014he beamed. \"Homework once a week?\" he proposed. \"Maybe we'd better go with twice,\" I suggested, thinking of the pile I'd just been assigned today. He sighed a heavy sigh. Then he reached over his toolbox to a paper grocery sack. He pulled out two cans of soda, cracking one open and handing it to me. He opened the second, and held it up ceremoniously. \"Here's to responsibility,\" he toasted. \"Twice a week.\" \"And recklessness every day in between,\" I emphasized. He grinned and touched his can to mine. I got home later than I'd planned and found Charlie had ordered a pizza rather than wait for me. He wouldn't let me apologize. \"I don't mind,\" he assured me. \"You deserve a break from all the cooking, anyway.\" I knew he was just relieved that I was still acting like a normal person, and he was not about to rock the boat. I checked my e-mail before I started on my homework, and there was a long one from Renee. She gushed over every detail I'd provided her with, so I sent back another exhaustive description of my day. Everything but the motorcycles. Even happy-go-lucky Renee was likely to be alarmed by that. School Tuesday had its ups and downs. Angela and Mike seemed ready to welcome me back with open arms\u2014to kindly overlook my few months of aberrant behavior. Jess was more resistant. I wondered if she needed a formal written apology for the Port Angeles incident. Mike was animated and chatty at work. It was like he'd stored up the semester's worth of talk, and it was all spilling out now. I found that I was able to smile and laugh with him, though it wasn't as effortless as it was with Jacob. It seemed harmless enough, until quitting time. Mike put the closed sign in the window while I folded my vest and shoved it under the counter. \"This was fun tonight,\" Mike said happily. \"Yeah,\" I agreed, though I'd much rather have spent the afternoon in the garage. \"It's too bad that you had to leave the movie early last week.\" I was a little confused by his train of thought. I shrugged. \"I'm just a wimp, I guess.\" \"What I mean is, you should go to a better movie, something you'd enjoy,\" he explained. \"Oh,\" I muttered, still confused. \"Like maybe this Friday. With me. We could go see something that isn't scary at all.\" I bit my lip. I didn't want to screw things up with Mike, not when he was one of the only people ready to forgive me for being crazy. But this, again, felt far too familiar. Like the last year had never happened. I wished I had Jess as an excuse this time. \"Like a date?\" I asked. Honesty was probably the best policy at this point. Get it over with. He processed the tone of my voice \"If you want. But it doesn't have to be like that.\" \"I don't date,\" I said slowly, realizing how true that was. That whole world seemed impossibly distant. \"Just as friends?\" he suggested. His clear blue eyes were not as eager now. I hoped he really meant that we could be friends anyway. \"That would be fun. But I actually have plans already this Friday, so maybe next week?\" \"What are you doing?\" he asked, less casually than I think he wanted to sound. \"Homework. I have a\u2026 study session planned with a friend.\" \"Oh. Okay. Maybe next week.\" He walked me to my car, less exuberant than before. It reminded me so clearly of my first months in Forks. I'd come full circle, and now everything felt like an echo\u2014an empty echo, devoid of the interest it used to have. The next night, Charlie didn't seem the smallest bit surprised to find Jacob and me sprawled across the living room floor with our books scattered around us, so I guessed that he and Billy were talking behind our backs. \"Hey, kids,\" he said, his eyes straying to the kitchen. The smell of the lasagna I'd spent the afternoon making\u2014while Jacob watched and occasionally sampled\u2014wafted down the hall; I was being good, trying to atone for all the pizza. Jacob stayed for dinner, and took a plate home for Billy. He grudgingly added another year to my negotiable age for being a good cook. Friday was the garage, and Saturday, after my shift at Newton's, was homework again. Charlie felt secure enough in my sanity to spend the day fishing with Harry. When he got back, we were all done\u2014feeling very sensible and mature about it, too\u2014and watching Monster Garage on the Discovery Channel. \"I probably ought to go.\" Jacob sighed. \"It's later than I thought.\" \"Okay, fine,\" I grumbled. \"I'll take you home.\" He laughed at my unwilling expression\u2014it seemed to please him. \"Tomorrow, back to work,\" I said as soon as we were safe in the truck. \"What time do you want me to come up?\" There was an unexplained excitement in his answering smile. \"I'll call you first, okay?\" \"Sure.\" I frowned to myself, wondering what was up. His smile widened. I cleaned the house the next morning\u2014waiting for Jacob to call and trying to shake off the Litest nightmare. The scenery had changed. Last night I'd wandered in a wide sea of ferns interspersed with huge hemlock trees. There was nothing else there, and I was lost, wandering aimless and alone, searching for nothing. I wanted to kick myself for the stupid field trip last week. I shoved the dream out of my conscious mind, hoping it would stay locked up somewhere and not escape again. Charlie was outside washing the cruiser, so when the phone rang, I dropped the toilet brush and ran downstairs to answer it. \"Hello?\" I asked breathlessly. \"Bella,\" Jacob said, a strange, formal tone to his voice. \"Hey, Jake.\" \"I believe that\u2026 we have a date\" he said, his tone thick with implications. It took me a second before I got it. \"They're done? I can't believe it!\" What perfect timing. I needed something to distract me from nightmares and nothingness. \"Yeah, they run and everything.\" \"Jacob, you are absolutely, without a doubt, the most talented and wonderful person I know. You get ten years for this one.\" \"Cool! I'm middle-aged now.\" I laughed. \"I'm on my way up!\" I threw the cleaning supplies under the bathroom counter and grabbed my jacket. \"Headed to see Jake,\" Charlie said when I ran past him. It wasn't really a question. \"Yep,\" I replied as I jumped in my truck. \"I'll be at the station later,\" Charlie called after me. \"Okay,\" I yelled back, turning the key. Charlie said something else, but I couldn't hear him clearly over the roar of the engine. It sounded sort of like, \"Where's the fire?\" I parked my truck off to the side of the Blacks' house, close to the trees, to make it easier for us to sneak the bikes out. When I got out, a splash of color caught my eye\u2014two shiny motorcycles, one red, one black, were hidden under a spruce, invisible from the house. Jacob was prepared. There was a piece of blue ribbon tied in a small bow around each of the handlebars. I was laughing at that when Jacob ran out of the house. \"Ready?\" he asked in a low voice, his eyes sparkling. I glanced over his shoulder, and there was no sign of Billy. \"Yeah,\" I said, but I didn't feel quite as excited as before; I was trying to imagine myself actually on the motorcycle. Jacob loaded the bikes into the bed of the truck with ease, laying them carefully on their sides so they didn't show. \"Let's go,\" he said, his voice higher than usual with excitement. \"I know the perfect spot\u2014no one will catch us there.\" We drove south out of town. The dirt road wove in and out of the forest\u2014sometimes there was nothing but trees, and then there would suddenly be a breathtaking glimpse of the Pacific Ocean, reaching to the horizon, dark gray under the clouds. We were above the shore, on top of the cliffs that bordered the beach here and the view seemed to stretch on forever. I was driving slowly, so that I could safely stare out across the ocean now and then, as the road wound closer to the sea cliffs. Jacob was talking about finishing the bikes, but his descriptions were getting technical, so I wasn't paying close attention. That was when I noticed four figures standing on a rocky ledge, much too close to the precipice. I couldn't tell from the distance how old they were, but I assumed they were men. Despite the chill in the air today, they seemed to be wearing only shorts. As I watched, the tallest person stepped closer to the brink. I slowed automatically, my foot hesitating over the brake pedal. And then he threw himself off the edge. \"No!\" I shouted, stomping down on the brake. \"What's wrong?\" Jacob shouted back, alarmed.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \"That guy\u2014he just jumped off the cliff! Why didn't they stop him? We've got to call an ambulance!\" I threw open my door and started to get out, which made no sense at all. The fastest way to a phone was to drive back to Billy's. But I couldn't believe what I'd just seen. Maybe, subconsciously, I hoped I would see something different without the glass of the windshield in the way. Jacob laughed, and I spun to stare at him wildly. How could he be so calloused, so cold-blooded? \"They're just cliff diving, Bella. Recreation. La Push doesn't have a mall, you know.\" He was teasing, but there was a strange note of irritation in his voice. \"Cliff diving?\" I repeated, dazed. I stared in disbelief as a second figure stepped to the edge, paused, and then very gracefully leaped into space. He fell for what seemed like an eternity to me, finally cutting smoothly into the dark gray waves below. \"Wow. It's so high.\" I slid back into my seat, still staring wide-eyed at the two remaining divers. \"It must be a hundred feet.\" \"Well, yeah, most of us jump from lower down, that rock that juts out from the cliff about halfway.\" He pointed out his window. The place he indicated did seem much more reasonable. \"Those guys are insane. Probably showing off how tough they are. I mean, really, it's freezing today. That water can't feel good.\" He made a disgruntled face, as if the stunt personally offended him. It surprised me a little. I would have thought Jacob was nearly impossible to upset. \"You jump off the cliff?\" I hadn't missed the \"us.\" \"Sure, sure.\" He shrugged and grinned. \"It's fun. A little scary, kind of a rush.\" I looked back at the cliffs, where the third figure was pacing the edge. I'd never witnessed anything so reckless in all my life. My eyes widened, and I smiled. \"Jake, you have to take me cliff diving.\" He frowned back at me, his face disapproving. \"Bella, you just wanted to call an ambulance for Sam,\" he reminded me. I was surprised that he could tell who it was from this distance. \"I want to try,\" I insisted, start ing to get out of the car again. Jacob grabbed my wrist. \"Not today, all right? Can we at least wait for a warmer day?\" \"Okay, fine,\" I agreed. With the door open, the glacial breeze was raising goose bumps on my arm. \"But I want to go soon.\" \"Soon.\" He rolled his eyes. \"Sometimes you're a little strange, Bella. Do you know that?\" I sighed. \"Yes.\" \"And we're not jumping off the top.\" I watched, fascinated, as the third boy made a running start and flung himself farther into the empty air than the other two. He twisted and cart wheeled through space as he fell, like he was skydiving. He looked absolutely free\u2014 unthinking and utterly irresponsible. \"Fine,\" I agreed. \"Not the first time, anyway.\" Now Jacob sighed. \"Are we going to try out the bikes or not?\" he demanded. \"Okay, okay,\" I said, tearing my eyes away from the last person waiting on the cliff. I put my seat belt back on and closed the door. The engine was still running, roaring as it idled. We started down the road again. \"So who were those guys\u2014the crazy ones?\" I wondered. He made a disgusted sound in the back of his throat. \"The La Push gang.\" \"You have a gang?\" I asked. I realized that I sounded impressed. He laughed once at my reaction. \"Not like that. I swear, they're like hall monitors gone bad. They don't start fights, they keep the peace.\" He snorted. \"There was this guy from up somewhere by the Makah rez, big guy too, scary-looking. Well, word got around that he was selling meth to kids, and Sam Uley and his disciples ran him off our land. They're all about our land, and tribe pride\u2026 it's getting ridiculous. The worst part is that the council takes them seriously. Embry said that the council actually meets with Sam.\" He shook his head, face full of resentment. \"Embry also heard from Leah Clearwater that they call themselves 'protectors' or something like that.\" Jacob's hands were clenched into fists, as if he'd like to hit something. I'd never seen this side of him.  I was surprised to hear Sam Uley's name. I didn't want it to bring back the images from my nightmare, so I made a quick observation to distract myself. \"You don't like them very much.\" \"Does it show?\" he asked sarcastically. \"Well\u2026 It doesn't sound like they're doing anything bad.\" I tried to soothe him, to make him cheerful again. \"Just sort of annoyingly goody-two-shoes for a gang.\" \u201cYeah. Annoying is a good word. They're always showing off\u2014like the cliff thing. They act like\u2026 like, I don't know. Like tough guys. I was hanging out at the store with Embry and Quil once, last semester, and Sam came by with his followers, Jared and Paul. Quil said something, you know how he's got a big mouth, and it pissed Paul off. His eyes got all dark, and he sort of smiled\u2014no, he showed his teeth but he didn't smile\u2014and it was like he was so mad he was shaking or something. But Sam put his hand against Paul's chest and shook his head. Paul looked at him for a minute and calmed down. Honestly, it was like Sam was holding him back\u2014like Paul was going to tear us up if Sam didn't stop him.\" He groaned. \"Like a bad western. You know, Sam's a pretty big guy, he's twenty. But Paul's just sixteen, too, shorter than me and not as beefy as Quil. I think any one of us could take him.\" \"Tough guys,\" I agreed. I could see it in my head as he described it, and it reminded me of something\u2026 a trio of tall, dark men standing very still and close together in my father's living room. The picture was sideways, because my head was lying against the couch while Dr. Gerandy and Charlie leaned over me\u2026 Had that been Sam's gang? I spoke quickly again to divert myself from the bleak memories. \"Isn't Sam a little too old for this kind of thing?\" \"Yeah. He was supposed to go to college, but he stayed. And no one gave him any crap about it, either.\u00a0 The whole council pitched a fit when my sister turned down a partial scholarship and got married. But, oh no, Sam Uley can do no wrong.\" His face was set in unfamiliar lines of outrage\u2014outrage and something else I didn't recognize at first. \"It all sounds really annoying and\u2026 strange. But I don't get why you're taking it so personally.\" I peeked over at his face, hoping I hadn't offended him. He was suddenly calm, staring out the side window. \"You just missed the turn,\" he said in an even voice. I executed a very wide U-turn, nearly hitting a tree as my circle ran the truck halfway off the road. \"Thanks for the heads-up,\" I muttered as I started up the side road. \"Sorry, I wasn't paying attention.\" It was quiet for a brief minute. \"You can stop anywhere along here,\" he said softly. I pulled over and cut the engine. My ears rang in the silence that followed. We both got out, and Jacob headed around to the back to get the bikes. I tried to read his expression. Something more was bothering him. I'd hit a nerve. He smiled halfheartedly as he pushed the red bike to my side. \"Happy late birthday. Are you ready for this?\" \"I think so.\" The bike suddenly looked intimidating, frightening, as I realized I would soon be astride it. \"We'll take it slow,\" he promised. I gingerly leaned the motorcycle against the truck's fender while he went to get his. \"Jake\u2026\"I hesitated as he came back around the truck. \"Yeah?\" \"What's really bothering you? About the Sam thing, I mean? Is there something else?\" I watched his face. He grimaced, but he didn't seem angry. He looked at the dirt and kicked his shoe against the front tire of his bike again and again, like he was keeping time. He sighed. \"It's just\u2026 the way they treat me. It creeps me out.\" The words started to rush out now. \"You know, the council is supposed to be made up of equals, but if there was a leader, it would be my dad. I've never been able to figure out why people treat him the way they do. Why his opinion counts the most. It's got something to do with his father and his father's father. My great-grandpa, Ephraim Black, was sort of the last chief we had, and they still listen to Billy, maybe because of that.\u201d  \"But I'm just like everyone else. Nobody treats me special\u2026 until now.\" That caught me off guard. \"Sam treats you special?\" \"Yeah,\" he agreed, looking up at me with troubled eyes. \"He looks at me like he's waiting for something\u2026 like I'm going to join his stupid gang someday. He pays more attention to me than any of the other guys. I hate it.\" \"You don't have to join anything.\" My voice was angry. This was really upsetting Jacob, and that infuriated me. Who did these \"protectors\" think they were? \"Yeah.\" His foot kept up its rhythm against the tire. \"What?\" I could tell there was more.  He frowned, his eyebrows pulling up in a way that looked sad and worried rather than angry. \"It's Embry. He's been avoiding me lately.\" The thoughts didn't seem connected, but I wondered if I was to blame for the problems with his friend. \"You've been hanging out with me a lot,\" I reminded him, feeling selfish. I'd been monopolizing him. \"No, that's not it. It's not just me\u2014it's Quil, too, and everyone. Embry missed a week of school, but he was never home when we tried to see him. And when he came back, he looked\u2026 he looked freaked out. Terrified. Quil and I both tried to get him to tell us what was wrong, but he wouldn't talk to either one of us.\" I stared at Jacob, biting my lip anxiously\u2014he was really frightened. But he didn't look at me. He watched his own foot kicking the rubber as if it belonged to someone else. The tempo increased. \"Then this week, out of nowhere, Embry's hanging out with Sam and the rest of them. He was out on the cliffs today.\" His voice was low and tense. He finally looked at me. \"Bella, they bugged him even more than they bother me. He didn't want anything to do with them. And now Embry's following Sam around like he's joined a cult. \"And that's the way it was with Paul. Just exactly the same. He wasn't friends with Sam at all. Then he stopped coming to school for a few weeks, and, when he came back, suddenly Sam owned him. I don't know what it means. I can't figure it out, and I feel like I have to, because Embry's my friend and\u2026 Sam's looking at me funny.. and\u2026\" He trailed off. \"Have you talked to Billy about this?\" I asked. His horror was spreading to me. I had chills running on the back of my neck. Now there was anger on his face. \"Yes,\" he snorted. \"That was helpful.\" \"What did he say?\" Jacob's expression was sarcastic, and when he spoke, his voice mocked the deep tones of his father's voice. \"It's nothing you need to worry about now, Jacob. In a few years, if you don't\u2026 well, I'll explain later.\" And then his voice was his own. \"What am I supposed to get from that? Is he trying to say it's some stupid puberty, coming-of-age thing? This is something else. Something wrong.\" He was biting his lower lip and clenching his hands. He looked like he was about to cry. I threw my arms around him instinctively, wrapping them around his waist and pressing my face against his chest. He was so big, I felt like I was a child hugging a grown-up. \"Oh, Jake, it'll be okay!\" I promised. \"If it gets worse you can come live with me and Charlie. Don't be scared, we'll think of something!\" He was frozen for a second, and then his long arms wrapped hesitantly around me. \"Thanks, Bella.\" His voice was huskier than usual. We stood like that for a moment, and it didn't upset me; in fact, I felt comforted by the contact. This didn't feel anything like the last time someone had embraced me this way. This was friendship. And Jacob was very warm. It was strange for me, being this close\u2014emotionally rather than physically, though the physical was strange for me, too\u2014to another human being. It wasn't my usual style. I didn't normally relate to people so easily, on such a basic level. Not human beings. \"If this is how you're going to react, I'll freak out more often.\" Jacob's voice was light, normal again, and his laughter rumbled against my ear. His fingers touched my hair, soft and tentative. Well, it was friendship for me. I pulled away quickly, laughing with him, but determined to put things back in perspective at once. \"It's hard to believe I'm two years older than you,\" I said, emphasizing the word older. \"You make me feel like a dwarf.\" Standing this close to him, I really had to crane my neck to see his face. \"You're forgetting I'm in my forties, of course.\" \"Oh, that's right.\" He patted my head. \"You're like a little doll,\" he teased. \"A porcelain doll.\" I rolled my eyes, taking another step away. \"Let's not start with the <em>albino</em> cracks.\" \"Seriously, Bella, are you sure you're not?\" He stretched his russet arm out next to mine. The difference wasn't flattering. \"I've never seen anyone paler than you\u2026 well, except for\u2014\" He broke off, and I looked away, trying to not understand what he had been about to say. \"So are we going to ride or what?\" \"Let's do it,\" I agreed, more enthusiastic than I would have been half a minute ago. His unfinished sentence reminded me of why I was here.",
