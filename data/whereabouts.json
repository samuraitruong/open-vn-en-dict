            "en": "The sons of Osama Bin Laden have criticised the US authorities for carrying out his \"arbitrary killing\". A statement given to the New York Times newspaper said the family wanted to know why the al-Qaeda leader had not been captured alive. Relatives who survived the 2 May raid in Pakistan should be freed, it said. Another statement appeared on a jihadist website saying the burial of Bin Laden at sea \"demeans and humiliates his family\". Osama Bin Laden was shot dead by US special forces during a raid on his home in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad. The statement printed by the New York Times was attributed to Bin Laden's fourth son, Omar Bin Laden, who has repeatedly distanced himself from his father's ideology. The statement said that in absence of a body or photographic evidence, the family were not convinced he was dead. But if he was dead, it said, they were questioning \"why an unarmed man was not arrested and tried in a court of law so that truth is revealed to the people of the world\".  Humiliation  They argue Bin Laden's killing had broken international law and that figures such as former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic had been given the chance to stand trial. \"We maintain that arbitrary killing is not a solution to political problems and crime's adjudication as justice must be seen to be done.\" The family said they were demanding a enquiry into why Bin Laden was \"summarily executed without a court of law\" and demanded the release of his three wives and several children, who are believed to be in Pakistani custody. The statement also said the US decision to bury Bin Laden's corpse at sea had deprived the family of performing religious rites. A slightly different version of the report was published on a jihadist websites, said the SITE Intelligence Group.  It said US President Barack Obama was \"legally responsible\" for clarifying \"the fate of our father\" and that the sea burial \"demeans and humiliates his family and his supporters\". US President Barack Obama has urged Pakistan to investigate how the al-Qaeda leader could live in the garrison city of Abbottabad undetected and to find out if any officials knew of his <em>whereabouts</em>. Pakistan's PM Yousuf Raza Gilani has insisted that allegations of Pakistani complicity and incompetence are \"absurd\".",

            "en": "He turned up in a government vehicle at a hotel held by loyalists, a day after the rebels said they had detained him. A BBC correspondent said Saif al-Islam seemed confident and full of adrenalin. On Monday the rebels met strong resistance from pro-Gaddafi forces as they continued their push. Both sides say they control most of Tripoli. Saif al-Islam Gaddafi turned up at Hotel Rixos in the early hours of Tuesday. He told the BBC's Matthew Price: \"We have broken the backbone of the rebels.\" He added that by moving into Tripoli, the rebels had fallen into \"a trap\". \"We gave them a hard time, so we're winning,\" he said. Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, 39, had been widely regarded as a likely successor to his father. On Sunday the rebels claimed they had captured him, along with other members of his family. Asked if Col Gaddafi was safe and in Tripoli, Saif al-Islam replied: \"Of course.\" The Libyan leader's <em>whereabouts</em> are still unclear. His sprawling Bab al-Azizia compound is being defended by loyalist troops A diplomatic source told AFP news agency that Col Gaddafi could still be there. He has not been seen in public for months, although he has broadcast audio messages from undisclosed locations.  In a broadcast late on Sunday, he urged residents to \"save Tripoli\" from the rebels. In other developments: \u009f Pro-Gaddafi forces fire a suspected Scud missile from near their stronghold city of Sirte, US defence officials tell Reuters news agency  \u009f Col Gaddafi's eldest son Muhammad reportedly escaped from rebel custody hours after being detained  \u009f China and Russia issue statements urging Gaddafi forces to stop fighting  \u009f UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon says leaders of regional blocs will meet in New York later this week  \u009f Egypt formally recognises the rebel National Transitional Council as the legitimate representative of the Libyan people Ambush  The rebels swept into Tripoli from several direction following an uprising in the capital at the weekend. They who were greeted by jubilant crowds in central Green Square when they arrived on Sunday. Rebel fighters have set up checkpoints in parts of the city, and say reinforcements are arriving by boat. But they have met stiff resistance in a number of areas. There was sustained gunfire near the Bab al-Azizia compound in western Tripoli throughout Monday. Gaddafi loyalists also remain in control of the area further south around the Rixos Hotel, where many Western journalists are based. A rebel convoy coming in from the west was ambushed by Gaddafi loyalists using anti-aircraft fire on Monday. The convoy forced to pull out of the city. As night fell the fighting appeared to die down in many areas. Both sides insist they have the upper hand. Government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim claimed late pro-Gaddafi had control of at least 75% of the city, while the rebels said they were holding about 80%. Our correspondents says it is impossible to determine who is telling the truth. World leaders have urged Col Gaddafi to step down. US President Barack Obama said elements of the Gaddafi regime continued to pose a threat. \"But this much is clear: the Gaddafi regime is coming to an end and the future of Libya is in the hands of its people,\" he said. He appealed to Col Gaddafi to reduce further bloodshed by \"explicitly relinquishing power to the people of Libya and calling on those forces that continue to fight to lay down their arms\".",
