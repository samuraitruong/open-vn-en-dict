Thousands of people are likely to gather at the Los Angeles cemetery where the musician is at rest, along with members of his family. Jackson's mother Katherine is expected at the family home in Gary, Indiana, where tributes will be paid. A monument has also been dedicated to the star at London's Lyric Theatre In New York, the Apollo Theatre - where Jackson and his brothers won a talent contest and were subsequently signed to Motown Records - there will be a commemoration of his life. Flowers have been left in tribute to the late star in Tokyo, where 50 fans will have the chance to spend the night in an exhibition of his possessions. Jackson devotees gathering at the Forest Lawn Cemetery in Glendale, California said they had come to both grieve and celebrate his life. Evdokia Sofianu, who had travelled from Greece, told the Associated Press: \"I came because I love Michael very much.\" \"I'm just hoping to embrace the fans from everywhere,\" added Julia Thomas. Prisoners' tribute Michael's brother Randy said he would also be at the cemetery to pay his respects. The star's three children are expected to mark the anniversary along with their grandmother and guardian Katherine at the former family home in Indiana. The house in Gary is likely to become a major focal point for fans to remember the star one year after his death. Meanwhile, prisoners in the Philippines are marking the anniversary by staging a version of Thriller for invited members of the public on Saturday. The <em>inmates</em> of Cebu jail became an internet phenomenon when they were filmed performing the dance in 2007. Meanwhile, Jackson has been named as the biggest selling artist in the UK since his death last year, with 4.3 million sales. That exceeds his chart performance during his 1980s heyday, the Official Chart Company has said.",
