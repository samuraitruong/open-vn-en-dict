One of the remarkable advantages of surviving any brush with death is that one assumes a more profound appreciation for every moment of life. As our denial of death is stripped away, we gain a deeper appreciation for the richness that is in every moment of life. I wrote my book Hope so you do not have to suffer to fully learn these things. Here's a similar message written by Erma Bombeck as she was dying from kidney transplant complications.\" -----\u00a0 Joel Rothschild\u00a0  If I had my life to live over by Erma Bombeck The following was written by the late Erma Bombeck after she found out she had a fatal disease. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If I had my life to live over, I would have talked less and listened more. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I would have invited friends over to dinner even if the carpet was stained and the sofa faded. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I would have eaten the popcorn in the 'good' living room and worried much less about the dirt when someone wanted to light a fire in the fireplace. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I would have taken the time to listen to my grandfather ramble about his youth. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I would never have insisted the car windows be rolled up on a summer day because my hair had just been teased and sprayed.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I would have burned the pink candle sculpted like a rose before it melted in storage. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I would have sat on the lawn with my children and not worried about grass stains. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I would have cried and laughed less while watching television - and more while watching life. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I would have shared more of the responsibility carried by my husband. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I would have gone to bed when I was sick instead of pretending the earth would go into a holding pattern if I weren't there for the day. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I would never have bought anything just because it was practical, wouldn't show soil or was guaranteed to last a lifetime. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Instead of wishing away nine months of pregnancy, I'd have cherished every moment and realized that the wonderment growing inside me was the only chance in life to assist God in a miracle. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0When my kids kissed me impetuously, I would never have said, \"Later. Now go get washed up for dinner.\" \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There would have been more \"I love you's\".. More \"I'm sorrys\" ... But mostly, given another shot at life, I would seize every minute... look at it and really see it ... live it...and never give it back. Stop sweating the small stuff. Don't worry about who doesn't like you, who has more, or who's doing what. Instead, let's cherish the relationships we have with those who do love us. Let's think about what God has blessed us with. And what we are doing each day to promote ourselves mentally, physically, emotionally, as well as <em>spiritually</em>. Life is too short to let it pass you by.
