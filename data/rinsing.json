            "en": "At least two otherwise healthy men appear to have acquired a rare bacterial skin infection that is hard to treat with antibiotics after receiving tattoos at a parlor in Seattle in the state of Washington in the US, according to a report in the Emerging Infectious Diseases journal that was e-published ahead of print on 10 August by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Although no evidence was found to link the use of tap water to the infections, the report authors recommend that tattoo operators avoid using tap water and use sterilized water throughout their procedures. One case is confirmed, the other is as yet unconfirmed say the CDC. The confirmed case is of a healthy 44-year-old man who received a tattoo on his left forearm at a commercial tattoo parlor in August 2009. He has tested positive for Mycobacterium haemophilum, a bacterium that rarely affects people with a healthy immune system, write lead author Meagan K. Kay of the CDC in Atlanta, and colleagues.  The yet to be confirmed case is of a healthy 35-year-old man who received his tattoo at the same parlor two months later. His tests were inconclusive, and the CDC are treating him as a \"suspected\" case of infection. The authors write that although rare, difficult-to-treat bacterial infections have been reported even in healthy people who receive tattoos.\nIn the case of the man with the confirmed Mycobacterium haemophilum infection, he developed a painless rash at the tattoo site three days after visiting the parlor in August 2009. 12 days later he sought medical help. By then the rash had developed into bumpy, red nodules with pus (erythematous nodules) about 3 to 5 mm in diameter. By the following February, after several visits and treatment with various antibiotics, the rash eventually improved although some traces of infection remained. The man stopped treatment in March because of nausea, and by May the lesions had healed. The source of the bacteria has not been traced. An investigation of the tattoo parlor by local authorities in December 2009 found all the procedures complied with Washington State safety and sanitation standards, although they did instruct the owner to switch to sterilized water instead of tap water for rinse solutions and diluting tattoo dyes. None of the samples taken from various sites in the parlor, including the source of tap water, the tip of a reusable black ink container, various bits of equipment, the soap dispenser, and so on, showed traces of mycobacteria when tested by the CDC.  However, the authors note that although water has been suspected as a reservoir for M. haemophilum for various reasons, when investigators come to test environmental samples, using culture tests, as in this case, they are usually negative. They suggest that perhaps the interval of more than four months between the man visiting the parlor and the local authority investigation further reduced the chance of recovering any M. haemophilum. They suggest tattoo operators probably use tap water because:\n\"No tattoo industry standards exist for the practice of diluting tattoo ink. Washington State does not specifically require tattoo artists to use steam-distilled or sterile water when <em>rinsing</em> needles or diluting ink.\" But they refer to legislation, brought in in July 2010, that \"prohibits mixing ink and pigments with improper ingredients\". So their conclusion, and recommendation is that despite the fact infections due to water appear uncommon, operators should not use tap water for tattoo procedures.

            "en": "If you've ever had dandruff, with its easily seen white flakes, you probably know that it can be a little embarrassing. This is especially true for kids and teenagers, who may already be self-conscious about their looks. Fortunately, dandruff is harmless and can almost always be controlled, often with simple over-the-counter remedies. About dandruff Dandruff is another name for a condition called seborrheic dermatitis, or seborrhea, specifically seborrhea that occurs on the scalp. It's a very common condition in kids and adults alike, regardless of age or race. Dandruff causes flaky, white, or yellowish skin to form on the scalp and other oily parts of the body. Other areas that can get seborrhea include the eyebrows, eyelids, ears, crease of the nose, back of the neck, armpits, groin, and bellybutton. In some cases, dandruff can cause redness in the affected area and may appear crusty and start to itch, sometimes pretty badly. On rare occasions, dandruff can even lead to hair loss if it isn't treated. Any lost hair should grow back once the dandruff is treated, though. Dandruff is not contagious or an indication of poor hygiene, and it often can be controlled by daily shampooing with a gentle shampoo. In more severe cases, a doctor may recommend a medicated shampoo or cream. Causes The exact cause of seborrhea isn't known, although some researchers believe it can be caused by an overproduction of skin oil (sebum) in the oil glands and hair follicles. A type of yeast (fungus) called malassezia can grow in the sebum along with bacteria. This may be another factor in the development of seborrhea. The flakes associated with dandruff sometimes can be caused by conditions other than seborrhea, including:  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * dry skin, such as the kind caused by cold, dry winter air \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * other skin conditions like eczema, acne, or psoriasis that can cause dead skin cells to build up on the scalp \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * shampooing too often or not often enough \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * using hair-care products or hair dye that leave a dry, flaky residue or having a bad reaction to these products Dandruff often runs in families and the risk of dandruff can be increased by certain biological factors, such as being a man, being overweight, having oily skin, or having a neurological condition such as Parkinson's disease or a condition like HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) that harms the body's immune system. Symptoms Often, the first symptom someone with dandruff will notice are white flakes of dead skin in the hair or on the shoulders. The scalp may also become itchy and scaly. Other signs of seborrhea: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * dry, flaky skin that gets worse in cold weather \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * dry skin on the face, forehead, ears, or eyebrows \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * flaky skin on the chest or other parts of the body  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * greasy or oily areas of skin on the scalp or other parts of the body \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * mild redness in the affected area \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * temporary hair loss When to call the doctor Most cases of dandruff won't require a doctor's visit and can be treated with special dandruff shampoos available without a prescription. But if your child's dandruff doesn't get better after a few weeks of using dandruff shampoo, or if the skin becomes red or swollen, you should contact your doctor. Also call if your child's seborrhea gets worse, spreads to other parts of the body, or causes hair loss. Treatment Many cases of mild dandruff can be treated just by shampooing every day with a gentle shampoo. This will reduce oiliness and keep dead skin cells from building up. Moderate cases of dandruff usually can be treated with an over-the-counter dandruff shampoo. Many types are available and not every one works for every person, so you may need to experiment until you find the one that works for your child. The different types of dandruff shampoos include: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Selenium sulfide shampoos. These help slow the rate at which skin cells die and may combat the fungus that can cause seborrhea. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Tar-based shampoos. Made from coal tar, these also slow down the rate at which skin cells die and flake off. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Zinc pyrithione shampoos. These tackle the fungus on the scalp that can cause seborrhea. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Salicylic acid shampoos. These help remove flaky skin from the scalp but may leave it dry, which can lead to more flaking. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Ketoconazole shampoos. These shampoos, available in stronger doses with a prescription, are designed to reduce fungus on the scalp. At first, kids with dandruff may need to use one of these shampoos every day to get their dandruff under control. After that, they can generally cut back to once or twice a week. Have your child massage the shampoo into his or her scalp and let it sit for at least 5 minutes before <em>rinsing</em> it out. After the dandruff shampoo has been rinsed away, kids can use regular shampoo or conditioner. If your child's dandruff doesn't respond to over-the-counter dandruff shampoos, or if seborrhea develops in places other than the scalp, talk to a doctor. You may need to get your child a prescription-strength shampoo or an antifungal lotion or cream containing steroids. After treatment, some people will notice that areas of skin that had seborrhea will be lighter in color than the rest of their skin. This is more common in those with darker skin. This color difference will fade over time and the skin's color will eventually return to normal. Dandruff is a chronic condition, meaning it can't be cured, but it can almost always be kept under control. Once it's under control, it's usually impossible to detect. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0",

            "en": "Cooking with kids    The kitchen can be a fascinating place for young children. They see grown-ups working briskly in there, watch the steam rise from pots on the stove, and smell what's on the menu that night. Even older kids might be intrigued by how baked goods and meals come together. It isn't always convenient to invite them into the kitchen to help, but consider doing so when time allows. Younger kids can watch what you're doing and help out with small tasks, like stirring something or setting the table. Older kids can be taught how to crack eggs or measure ingredients. Even teens might be lured into the kitchen if you tell them they can choose the dish and you'll help prepare it with them. To the kids, it will seem like fun, but there are other benefits to this time together: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Preschoolers see how the dishes they eat are put together \u2014 and they get hands-on experience, which is a great way to learn and feel like they are helping out. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * School-age kids can learn some cooking basics and use their math skills as they help combine ingredients for recipes. You also can use the time to talk about good nutrition and why you chose the ingredients you're using. It can lay the groundwork for healthy eating later on.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Teens might appreciate the chance to improve their cooking skills \u2014 good preparation for when they'll need to cook for themselves. Teens also might be interested in trying different cuisines. Do they love Asian food? Visit an Asian market and put together something authentic. Here are some tips for having fun and staying safe while you're cooking with kids. Choose the right time If you're going to have kids helping you in the kitchen, you don't want to be on a tight time schedule. Instead of involving them in a dinner you have to cook lightning-fast, enlist their help on a weekend afternoon when you don't feel crunched. With younger kids, choose a time when they're well-rested and not easily frustrated. It's also a smart idea to have another adult in the kitchen to help you keep an eye on your junior chef. Choose the right tasks Plan ahead a little when deciding what you'll prepare together. For younger kids, consider starting with simple dishes with fewer than five ingredients. Then your child won't have to wait it out while you tackle a complicated step. A tossed salad or easy muffin recipe can be good starter projects. You also might set up a pizza-making assembly line where kids can choose their own mini-crusts, sauces, cheeses, and toppings. Older kids can take cooking to the next level and work with you on more challenging recipes. When you've chosen a recipe, think about which steps your child can do independently. For instance, kids who can read can call out the ingredients from the recipe card while you put them out on the counter. A younger child can help you pour ingredients into a bowl. An older child might be able to measure out ingredients and add them unassisted. Doing some prep work in advance, such as <em>rinsing</em> the berries for muffins, will make the process move more swiftly. If there's a lull in the action, you might consider giving your child a well-deserved break. Then you can call him or her back in when there's another kid-friendly task to do, or when it's time to taste what you made. Stress safety Children need supervision when they're in the kitchen. Preschoolers must learn not to touch whirring electric beaters, hot pans, and stovetops. Here are some safety tips: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Give frequent reminders about what's OK to touch and which items can hurt them. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Talk about which kitchen tasks are for grown-ups and which are for kids. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Establish kitchen rules, such as washing hands and not touching stove knobs or knives. Even older kids will need safety reminders, especially if they're working with appliances and knives, or at the stove. Loosen up Kids cannot be counted on to be neat in the kitchen. Even adults have trouble with that. To make your experience together more enjoyable, allow for some extra mess and try to be patient. To prevent cooking disasters, be sure your child isn't measuring ingredients over the bowl \u2014 risking a big oops. Instead, you might measure them separately and put them in small bowls, like they do on TV cooking shows. Even if everything doesn't go perfectly, try to keep the mood light. If the egg gets smashed, offer some guidance and let your child try again. Little by little, kids will gain these skills \u2014 and feel great once they're mastered. Last, but not least, be sure to compliment your assistant chefs on a job well done. Offer them first taste of whatever you cooked together \u2014 and ask what you should make together next time. Bon appetit!",

            "en": "8 Things in Your Home That May Be Harming You        Home sweet home, right? Well, sort of. You may be unaware of the potential health dangers lurking in your abode \u2014 from critters in the kitchen to bugs in the bedroom. Here\u2019s what you need to know and what to do. By Sarah Jio v Your kitchen sponge Maybe you\u2019ve heard about the germs on your kitchen sponge (gross news flash\u2014there may be as many as 20 million microbes on it right now). But here\u2019s the deal: Your method for \u201ccleaning\u201d that sponge may be leaving it loaded with potentially hazardous bacteria that can make you ill. Researchers at the USDA\u2019s Agricultural Research Service found that some common cleaning methods for sponges\u2014soaking them in a bleach solution, lemon juice or water\u2014did not eradicate the germs. What to do The best ways to clean a dirty sponge, they say, are in the microwave (on high for one minute) and in the dishwasher, which will kill 99.9 percent of all germs. v Your bed Have you been on a trip recently? If so, you may have brought home some hitchhikers\u2014of the creepy-crawly variety. Bedbugs, tiny bloodthirsty insects, are hosts to organisms that cause hepatitis B and Chagas disease, say health experts. But the real problem seems to be the infections and allergic reactions that can sometimes result from bedbug bites. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, bedbugs are on the rise and becoming an increasing health problem. The insects, which hide in the crevices of mattresses and bedding, are showing up everywhere, from hostels to the swankiest hotels, and they often find their way into people\u2019s luggage, transporting themselves to unsuspecting homes. What to do If you\u2019ve done some traveling recently, and especially if you\u2019ve noticed any mysterious bug bites, wash everything in your luggage and consider scrubbing your suitcase with a stiff brush before giving it a good vacuuming. v Your laptop You\u2019re the only one who uses it, so how dirty can it be? In a word: filthy. A study by researchers at the University of North Carolina Health Care System found that keyboards were loaded with germs. Even more disgusting, the average public toilet bowl contains 41 germs per square inch. The average personal keyboard? Some 21,000 germs per square inch. \u201cToilet bowls get cleaned,\u201d says Philip M. Tierno Jr., Ph.D., director of clinical microbiology and immunology at New York University Langone Medical Center, \u201cbut keyboards rarely do.\u201d What to do Tierno says the best way to keep your laptop or computer\u2019s keyboard clean is to gently wipe it down daily with disinfecting wipes. v Your shower curtain According to research by the Center for Health, Environment & Justice, shower curtains and liners made from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) may be harmful to your health. Their study suggests that PVC releases potentially harmful chemicals into your bathroom. While there is still some debate among health experts about how much of these chemicals could be deemed harmful, many believe that limiting your exposure to chemicals, wherever possible, makes sense. What to do Check your shower curtain\u2019s label to see if it\u2019s made of vinyl or PVC. While not all manufacturers disclose this information, some retailers, like Ikea, have banned PVC shower curtains altogether, and Target has promised to phase out the material in its shower-curtain products in the months ahead. v Your laundry Nobody thinks of the washing machine as a germ magnet\u2014that\u2019s where clothes get clean, right? Not if you\u2019re using a public machine, and especially if that machine uses water that\u2019s not hot enough, says Tierno. Here\u2019s why: Lower temperatures can encourage the spread of germs. Researchers at the University of Arizona found that intestinal viruses such as hepatitis A can be easily transferred from underwear to other garments during the washing process. Even worse, some germs can lurk in public washing machines and find their way to your clothes. What to do Wash your underwear and towels separately, using bleach if possible, and wash all towels in water that\u2019s at least 155 degrees, which will kill most germs. Not sure if your apartment\u2019s water temperature is hot enough? Talk to the building manager. v Your humidifier Watch out for the humidifier, say germ experts. \u201cIf it\u2019s not cleaned properly, a humidifier can become a repository for legionella and other pathogens that cause respiratory infections,\u201d says Tierno. What to do If you like sleeping with a humidifier in your room, be sure to clean it often\u2014at least a few times a week\u2014by mixing a solution of one-part bleach to 19 parts water (for most humidifiers, this would equal about a half or full cup of bleach) and letting it sit for a few minutes before <em>rinsing</em> well.  v Your doorknob Think of the people who have touched your front doorknob in the past 48 hours: the UPS man, a neighbor, a solicitor, your friends\u2014it\u2019s easy to lose count. Now think of all the places they\u2019ve been\u2014the subway, public restrooms, grocery stores. Those germs are all on your doorknob right now, says Tierno. Most people let their guard down when it comes to their own door handles, he says, but we shouldn\u2019t: \u201cViruses can survive for days on doorknobs, and you can easily get cross contamination from them,\u201d he says. What to do Make a habit of wiping down your doorknob frequently with sanitizing wipes or sprays. Have a copper doorknob? You may be in luck. Researchers in England found that copper door handles had 95 percent fewer microorganisms on them compared with other doorknobs. Scientists believe that many germs, including MRSA, may not be able to survive on copper. v Your salt and pepper shakers When\u2019s the last time you cleaned your salt and pepper shakers? Exactly. These unassuming little items get touched in all parts of the meal-prep process. Example: You give your sauce a dash of salt after touching raw chicken and then later set the shaker on the table. What to do Nobody thinks of cleaning their salt and pepper shakers, says Elizabeth Scott, Ph.D., assistant professor and co-director Simmons Center for Hygiene and Health in Home and Community at Simmons College, but to avoid cross-contamination and food poisoning, you should. \u201cBest to wipe them with an EPA-registered disinfectant,\u201d she says. \u201cBut better still, always wash your hands after handling raw foods and before touching anything else.\u201d Ngu\u1ed3n: http://health.msn.com/health-topics/slideshow.aspx?cp-documentid=100243934&imageindex=1",

            "en": "20 best kept hair secrets    Boost thin hair with Silicone Thin, lifeless hair is one of the most common hair complaints, yet few women know the best remedy. Heavy conditioners just leave hair limp. A better bet is to use products with silicone, such as dimethicone or cyclomethicone. These coat the strands with a thin film, creating fuller hair that doesn't look greasy. The silicone stays put even after you rinse. Eat fish and nuts for healthy hair The same nutritious foods that are good for your body promote stronger, healthier hair. The protein and omega-3 fatty acids in salmon and nuts produce a healthier scalp. Nutrients found in leafy vegetables, beans, and carrots are also good for your hair. Beware of fad diets aimed at quick weight loss. Deficiency of some nutrients, such as zinc, biotin, or protein, can lead to brittle hair or hair loss. Protect shine with lukewarm water Hot water can strip the sebum of scalp, which is the protective oil that acts as a natural conditioner and gives hair its shine. This doesn't mean you have to suffer through cold showers to avoid dull hair. Instead, use lukewarm water to wash your hair. Pamper the scalp by massaging it while you shampoo. Mend split ends with protein Frequent hair styling, coloring, bleaching, or perming can damage hair's protective outer layer, known as the cuticle. The result is what we call \"split ends.\" Thankfully, there are hair products to help mend the damage. Look for conditioners that contain protein. They actually penetrate the hair shaft and repair split ends. The fix only lasts until the next shampoo, so you'll need to use it regularly. Get that \"Redhead Bounce\" The fullness of your hair is in your genes \u2013 and your styling technique. Natural redheads have thicker hair, while blondes have the thinnest but greatest number of hairs. Luckily, you can enhance your hair's volume whatever its color. Use a leave-in conditioner or mousse and dry the root area first. If your hair is very fine, use a low-heat setting when drying, curling, or straightening.  Don't treat dandruff with oils Dandruff isn't caused by a dry scalp, but by an inflammatory process that affects the scalp. Rubbing oil into the scalp can make the inflammation worse, resulting in more unsightly white flakes. That's why medicated shampoos \u2013 either over-the-counter or from a dermatologist \u2013 can best treat dandruff. Just be sure to rinse thoroughly after using medicated shampoo. Skip high-powered blow dryers You might expect a blow dryer with higher wattage to slice a few precious minutes off your styling routine. But in a comparison of blow dryers, Consumer Reports found they all dried hair in about the same amount of time. Some are much noisier than others, though. The consumer research group found the more expensive dryers were the quietest, and the noisiest were as loud as a lawn mower. Brush less to limit hair loss Too much brushing will snap off hairs. Some hair loss is normal \u2013 most people lose an average of 50 to 100 hairs every day. These are hairs that have stopped growing and have reached the resting stage. To minimize additional hair loss, use a brush with ball-tipped bristles and avoid brushing while the hair is wet. Avoid styles that damage hair Tight ponytails and braids can break off hair and damage the hair follicle. Continuous pulling can even lead to hair loss. Extensions add weight to the hair and also put pressure on the follicle. Dermatologists recommend wearing extensions for no more than three months. Also, be aware that wet hair is more fragile, so you shouldn't put your hair in braids or a ponytail while it's wet. Don't let brands clean your wallet What are you really getting for extra money spent on specialty products? They may contain natural botanicals, but that may not mean better style. Consumer Reports tested products on 1,700 ponytail samples and found that the more expensive shampoos didn't perform better than cheaper ones. What is important: Choose shampoos and conditioners designed for your hair type, such as those for oily, fine, or color-treated hair. Use gentle color to cover grays Hair doesn't only go gray as we get older \u2013 it also becomes weaker and grows more slowly. That means damaged hair won't develop quickly anymore. Chemicals used on \"mature\" hair should be weaker to avoid damage, says dermatologist Zoe Draelos, MD editor of the Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology. Neutralize frizz in winter, too Humidity gets the rap for causing frizzy bad hair days. But there's more static electricity in low humidity. This means frizz also flies in winter months and in the desert climates of the Southwest. Use conditioner to neutralize the static electricity. Shampoos that are pH-balanced also can calm the frizz of chemically treated hair. Keep brushes away from your curls Curly hair is more likely to break and become dry and brittle. Gently using a pick keeps curls looking better than combing or brushing. Conditioners with polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone can smooth hair and make it more manageable. Don't overdo the use of flat-irons and relaxers, which can damage hair.  Avoid extreme color changes Perhaps you're a brunette who always wanted to be a blonde, or a blonde who wants to go darker. Be aware that you're risking damage to your hair with more extreme color changes. Some dermatologists recommend staying within three shades of your natural color. Get the facts about hair dye Frequent dying can damage the hair, but it does not appear to harm your health. Most studies indicate no link between cancer and hair dyes, and in other studies the evidence is weak, the American Cancer Society says. Consider using acetate-based dyes or natural dyes such as henna. Give the blow dryer a rest Frequent blow-drying is hard on your hair and can actually lead to hair loss. When you do blow dry, turn down the heat. Finer hair is especially sensitive to damage from heat, but even thick manes need some tender care. Protect your hair before styling by using a conditioner. Protect hair from the sun The sun is no kinder to your hair than it is to your skin. Sun exposure can dry out hair, especially if it's color-treated. Use a light hair spray with SPF protection \u2013 or wear a hat when the sun is strongest. Frequent summer trims can keep your ends looking healthy. Shower before you swim Avoid chlorine damage by <em>rinsing</em> your hair before entering the pool. If your hair is already saturated with water, it won't absorb as much from the chemical-laden pool. Use a pH-balancing hair product to further protect your hair. Take a time out from styling For better hair days, the best thing you can do is \u2013 nothing. All the tugging, combing, brushing, drying, and chemically treating of hair damages the shafts. Even vigorous towel-drying can damage hair. If you have damaged hair, take a break from styling. As the damaged hair grows out, the new growth will be healthy. Be aware of changes in your hair Sudden changes in your hair, such as brittle hair or hair loss, could be a sign of a health problem. For example, hair loss can be caused by thyroid disease, iron deficiency, or an autoimmune disease. Some medications can cause hair loss, too. If you have a concern about changes in the condition of your hair, see a dermatologist.",

            "en": "Causes of dandruff    The skin of the scalp (and also of the whole body) is constantly renews itself by shedding the outer layer of skin cells. Most of the time this shedding is unnoticeable. But when this shedding becomes noticeable on the scalp, it is called dandruff. Mild dandruff occurs not due to dryness of the scalp but usually is a result of too much oiliness of the skin. If you have large size flakes together with symptoms around your nose, eyebrows, ears, around your navel or genitals, it may be due to seborrheic dermatitis or seborrhea. Severe dandruff may be the result of psoriasis of the scalp. Seborrheic dermatitis may be caused by an increased number of a yeast-like organism (pityrosporum ovale) found on healthy scalp in low numbers. Dandruff can occur to anybody at any age. It should not be left untreated. Zinc and essential fatty acids (pumpkin seeds, nuts, vegetable oils) prevent dandruff. Home cure & remedy of dandruff For good hair without dandruff, drink at least 2 liters of water daily, eat lots of salads, green vegetables, and fresh fruits. Combs must be washed as frequently and hair should be brushed regularly. Dandruff is a scalp condition that can be controlled. Too little oil or too much oil can result in dandruff. Try the following: \u00a0\u00a0 1. Mix 2 teaspoons of pure vinegar in 6 teaspoons of water and apply it on the scalp before going to bed. Tie a towel around the head. Wash your head next morning. After shampooing, rinse again with vinegar water. Treat your hair like this once a week for at least three months. \u00a0\u00a0 2. Mix 1 teaspoon of lemon juice with 2 teaspoons of vinegar and massage on the scalp. Wash your hair with an egg shampoo. \u00a0\u00a0 3. Take 1 part of almond oil, 1 part of pure sulphur powder, 2 parts of 'surgical spirit' and 4 parts of distilled water or rose water and mix well. Rub on the scalp. \u00a0\u00a0 4. Take 2 cups of water, add 4-5 tablespoons of dried thyme and boil for 10 minutes. Cool, strain, and use the mixture to massage scalp. Keep for half an hour. \u00a0\u00a0 5. Dissolve 2 aspirins in any dandruff shampoo and wash your hair. \u00a0\u00a0 6. Massage the scalp with almond oil. Dip a towel in boiling water and wrap it around the hair. Repeat it thrice or four times when the towel gets cold. \u00a0\u00a0 7. Make a shampoo by mixing 100g of amla (Indian goose berry), reetha, and shikakai, and boil in two liters of water until the liquid reduces to half. Use this shampoo for one month. Dandruff will vanish and your hair will become thick.  \u00a0\u00a0 8. Fenugreek seeds are also useful in the removal of dandruff. Grind fenugreek (methi) seeds soaked in water overnight. Massage this paste on scalp and hair and leave it for 15-20 minutes. Wash it off with a mild shampoo. \u00a0\u00a0 9. Wash your hair with warm apple cider vinegar. Then cover your head with a towel or a shower cap and leave for about 30-40 minutes. Rinse with plain water. Repeat 2 times a week until your dandruff goes away. \u00a0 10. Take a palm full of baking soda and rub it on your wet hair. Wash it off with water. The baking soda should relieve the itching and help in reducing the problem of dandruff. \u00a0 11. Mix 100g of witch hazel and 1 tablespoon of fresh lemon juice in 200ml of water. Shampoo your hair and apply with cotton to the scalp when the hair are still wet. Repeat several times until the dandruff is treated. \u00a0 12. Try a shampoo with selenium sulfide or salicylic acid. \u00a0 13. Try Zest soap once a week. It may work for oily hair. It leaves your hair dry, so use conditioner to your hair only but try not to get it on your scalp. It has worked to get rid of dandruff for some people.  How to prevent and treat dandruff Dandruff, a condition characterized by flaking, itchy scalp, is one of the most common dermatological conditions. Fortunately, while the exact cause of dandruff is not known, there are some things you can do to reduce your risk of getting it, and effective treatments are available.  Steps \u00a0\u00a0 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Eat a healthy, balanced diet. A healthy diet may ward off the flakes. Make sure to get plenty of zinc, Omega-3 fatty acids, E and B-vitamins, and avoid excessive yeast and sugar. Research suggests that dandruff is at least in part caused by a fungus that thrives in yeasty, fatty, sugary environments. Though this does not necessarily directly affect the conditions of your skin, your overall health will help with how your body responds to the fungus causing the dandruff.\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Don't worry, be happy. Stress challenges the body's defenses and encourages all sorts of ailments, including dandruff, so relax now and don't worry about wearing a black shirt tomorrow. \u00a0\u00a0 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Limit your use of hair styling products. Hairspray, mousse, and gel may contribute to dandruff in some people. They may also cause excessive drying of the skin, which can cause flaking - or trigger allergic reactions. If you notice dandruff soon after you begin to use a new product, chances are the product is to blame. The exception to this would be using a therapeutic styling gel or spray formulated with tea tree oil.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0 4. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wash your hair regularly. Dandruff seems to thrive in oily hair, so regular shampooing can help you fight it off. If you already have dandruff, washing your hair may help you keep the symptoms (the flakes) under control until it goes away. Massage your scalp so that you clean your skin, as well as your hair. Wash your hair many times. The first washing breaks up the waxy sebum, and the second washing helps rinse it all away.  \u00a0\u00a0 5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Use a shampoo designed to treat dandruff. If dandruff persists despite regular shampooing, you may need something stronger. There are a variety of anti-dandruff shampoos available at your pharmacy or grocery store, and they usually work. Be sure to follow the instructions carefully, and make a little extra time to shower, as most of these recommend that you leave them in for 5-10 minutes and lather twice. \u00a0\u00a0 6.\u00a0 Oil your hair with herbal oils or use special herbal gels. Do this on a regular basis, at least twice a week for improvements. \u00a0\u00a0 7.\u00a0 Be aware that there are different active ingredients in dandruff shampoos. If one does not work for you try another. Ketoconazole (brand name Nizoral\u00ae) is extremely effective against certain types of dandruff that are caused by a fungus. 1% Ketoconazole is available without prescription in the US, 2% requires a prescription. The 2% is available without a prescription in Canada. \u00a0\u00a0 8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Be patient. While anti-dandruff shampoos may produce results, it can take a week or two to see the difference. \u00a0\u00a0 9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Switch it up. If one type of anti-dandruff shampoo doesn't seem to work, or if it works for a time but then doesn't, switch to a product with another active ingredient (the active ingredient will be labeled on the bottle). 10. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0See your doctor if the problem persists after more than a couple weeks of treatment. There are prescription shampoos available, and steroid creams may also help. Tips \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Try using a softer shampoo. Several barbers have said that the cause is often a harsh shampoo which kills or dries out the skin.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Another possible remedy consists of pouring a generous amount of table salt into your hand before showering. Gently rub it in your whole scalp. Rinse it out in the shower, and shampoo normally.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * It's best to get your vitamins from food, rather than nutritional supplements. A quick Internet search will turn up foods you can integrate into your diet that are rich in zinc, Omega-3s, and B-vitamins. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * If anti-dandruff shampoos aren't working, or if you notice redness on the scalp or silvery or yellow flakes, you may not have dandruff at all. A number of other conditions can lead to flaking skin and itchy scalp. See your primary care physician or dermatologist. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * A quick internet search will turn up all kinds of home remedies for dandruff. While some of these may indeed work, anti-dandruff shampoos are inexpensive enough to be adequate for most people. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Wear light-colored clothing (especially tops) while you have dandruff. Most people won't even notice. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * If you have hay fever, eczema, or other skin or respiratory allergies, your dandruff may be caused in part by an allergic reaction. In this situation, you may find it helpful to shampoo LESS frequently, so the natural oils that protect your scalp aren't stripped away. Allergic people may also react to dandruff shampoos by generating more dandruff. If you think this may be the case for you, try washing your hair with conditioner only, or washing less frequently. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Try the condition only treatment first during a vacation or a time when you will be less publicly visible, since your scalp will be very oily at first. It will take two weeks to a month for the balance of oils on your hair and scalp to adjust itself. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * <em>Rinsing</em> your scalp with a rinse of 1/4 cup of white vinegar and 3/4 cup of water may help the problem. The natural acids will help loosen any sebum (dead skin and oils) that clings to your scalp and flakes to form dandruff. Rinse thoroughly with WARM, not hot, water. If you don't rinse well, you will smell like vinegar. While white vinegar is the gold standard of home remedies and apple cider vinegar or lemon juice should work as well. Lemon juice may lighten dark hair. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Tea tree oil has antiseptic qualities that may help kill the fungus, and keep your scalp moisturized. You can buy a small bottle at many groceries and health food stores, and add 5-6 drops to your regular shampoo. Or just purchase a shampoo that contains tea tree oil. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Buy and use two or three different types of regular shampoo and don't use the same one two days in a row. For some reason this gets rid of lesser cases of dandruff. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Scalpicin\u00ae may be useful for particularly itchy scalps. They contain either anti-inflammatory ingredients (like hydrocortisone) or one of the active anti-dandruff ingredients. Usually these treatments also contain menthol, which provides a cooling effect that reduces the sensation of itching. Warnings \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Some anti-dandruff shampoos, such as those containing selenium sulfide or coal tar may discolor dyed hair. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Discontinue use of any anti-dandruff shampoo or medication if the condition worsens or spreads, or if you notice side effects. Consult your primary care physician or dermatologist if the problem doesn't go away. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Watch out for shampoos that are packaged to look like dandruff shampoos but only say that they will rinse away loose dandruff. Any shampoo will rinse away loose dandruff. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Using more than one anti-dandruff product may cause redness and irritation.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 * Avoid Sodium Lauryl Sulphate (SLS). It's a foaming compound that's a mild irritant. Some people find that using specialist soap without SLS as a shampoo for a couple of weeks makes their dandruff go away. You'll probably get it back if you switch back to ordinary shampoo. Shampoo with one of these anti-dandruff ingredients: ketoconazole, zinc pyrithione, selenium sulfide, salicylic acid, coal tar extract, or sulfur. If one doesn't work try another.",

            "en": "11        11. COMPLICATIONS Everyone watched us as we walked together to our lab table. I noticed that he no longer angled the chair to sit as far from me as the desk would allow. Instead, he sat quite close beside me, our arms almost touching. Mr. Banner backed into the room then \u2014 what superb timing the man had \u2014 pulling a tall metal frame on wheels that held a heavy-looking, outdated TV and VCR. A movie day \u2014 the lift in the class atmosphere was almost tangible. Mr. Banner shoved the tape into the reluctant VCR and walked to the wall to turn off the lights. And then, as the room went black, I was suddenly hyperaware that Edward was sitting less than an inch from me. I was stunned by the unexpected electricity that flowed through me, amazed that it was possible to be more aware of him than I already was. A crazy impulse to reach over and touch him, to stroke his perfect face just once in the darkness, nearly overwhelmed me. I crossed my arms tightly across my chest, my hands balling into fists. I was losing my mind. The opening credits began, lighting the room by a token amount. My eyes, of their own accord, flickered to him. I smiled sheepishly as I realized his posture was identical to mine, fists clenched under his arms, right down to the eyes, peering sideways at me. He grinned back, his eyes somehow managing to smolder, even in the dark. I looked away before I could start hyperventilating. It was absolutely ridiculous that I should feel dizzy. The hour seemed very long. I couldn't concentrate on the movie \u2014 I didn't even know what subject it was on. I tried unsuccessfully to relax, but the electric current that seemed to be originating from somewhere in his body never slackened. Occasionally I would permit myself a quick glance in his direction, but he never seemed to relax, either. The overpowering craving to touch him also refused to fade, and I crushed my fists safely against my ribs until my fingers were aching with the effort. I breathed a sigh of relief when Mr. Banner flicked the lights back on at the end of class, and stretched my arms out in front of me, flexing my stiff fingers. Edward \u00a0chuckled beside me. \"Well, that was interesting,\" he murmured. His voice was dark and his eyes were cautious. \"Umm,\" was all I was able to respond. \"Shall we?\" he asked, rising fluidly. I almost groaned. Time for Gym. I stood with care, worried my balance might have been affected by the strange new intensity between us. He walked me to my next class in silence and paused at the door; I turned to say goodbye. His face startled me \u2014 his expression was torn, almost pained, and so fiercely beautiful that the ache to touch him flared as strong as before. My goodbye stuck in my throat. He raised his hand, hesitant, conflict raging in his eyes, and then swiftly brushed the length of my cheekbone with his fingertips. His skin was as icy as ever, but the trail his fingers left on my skin was alarmingly warm \u2014 like I'd been burned, but didn't feel the pain of it yet. He turned without a word and strode quickly away from me. I walked into the gym, lightheaded and wobbly. I drifted to the locker room, changing in a trance like state, only vaguely aware that there were other people surrounding me. Reality didn't fully set in until I was handed a racket. It wasn't heavy, yet it felt very unsafe in my hand. I could see a few of the other kids in class eyeing me furtively. Coach Clapp ordered us to pair up into teams. Mercifully, some vestiges of Mike's chivalry still survived; he came to stand beside me. \"Do you want to be a team?\" \"Thanks, Mike \u2014 you don't have to do this, you know.\" I grimaced apologetically. \"Don't worry, I'll keep out of your way.\" He grinned. Sometimes it was so easy to like Mike. It didn't go smoothly. I somehow managed to hit myself in the head with my racket and clip Mike's shoulder on the same swing. I spent the rest of the hour in the back corner of the court, the racket held safely behind my back. Despite being handicapped by me, Mike was pretty good; he won three games out of four single handedly. He gave me an unearned high five when the coach finally blew the whistle ending class. \"So,\" he said as we walked off the court. \"So what?\" \"You and Cullen, huh?\" he asked, his tone rebellious. My previous feeling of affection disappeared. \"That's none of your business, Mike,\" I warned, internally cursing Jessica straight to the fiery pits of Hades. \"I don't like it,\" he muttered anyway. \"You don't have to,\" I snapped. \"He looks at you like\u2026 like you're something to eat,\" he continued, ignoring me. I choked back the hysteria that threatened to explode, but a small giggle managed to get out despite my efforts. He glowered at me. I waved and fled to the locker room. I dressed quickly, something stronger than butterflies battering recklessly against the walls of my stomach, my argument with Mike already a distant memory. I was wondering if Edward would be waiting, or if I should meet him at his car. What if his family was there? I felt a wave of real terror. Did they know that I knew? Was I supposed to know that they knew that I knew, or not? By the time I walked out of the gym, I had just about decided to walk straight home without even looking toward the parking lot. But my worries were unnecessary. Edward was waiting, leaning casually against the side of the gym, his breathtaking face untroubled now. As I walked to his side, I felt a peculiar sense of release. \"Hi,\" I breathed, smiling hugely. \"Hello.\" His answering smile was brilliant. \"How was Gym?\" My face fell a tiny bit. \"Fine,\" I lied. \"Really?\" He was unconvinced. His eyes shifted their focus slightly, looking over my shoulder and narrowing. I glanced behind me to see Mike's back as he walked away. \"What?\" I demanded. His eyes slid back to mine, still tight. \"Newton's getting on my nerves.\" \"You weren't listening again?\" I was horror-struck. All traces of my sudden good humor vanished. \"How's your head?\" he asked innocently. \"You're unbelievable!\" I turned, stomping away in the general direction of the parking lot, though I hadn't ruled out walking at this point. He kept up with me easily. \"You were the one who mentioned how I'd never seen you in Gym \u2014 it made me curious.\" He didn't sound repentant, so I ignored him. We walked in silence \u2014 a furious, embarrassed silence on my part \u2014 to his car. But I had to stop a few steps away \u2014 a crowd of people, all boys, were surrounding it. Then I realized they weren't surrounding the Volvo, they were actually circled around Rosalie's red convertible, unmistakable lust in their eyes. None of them even looked up as Edward slid between them to open his door. I climbed quickly in the passenger side, also unnoticed. \"Ostentatious,\" he muttered. \"What kind of car is that?\" I asked. \"An M3.\" \"I don't speak Car and Driver.\" \"It's a BMW.\" He rolled his eyes, not looking at me, trying to back out without running over the car enthusiasts. I nodded \u2014 I'd heard of that one. \"Are you still angry?\" he asked as he carefully maneuvered his way out. \"Definitely.\" He sighed. \"Will you forgive me if I apologize?\" \"Maybe\u2026 if you mean it. And if you promise not to do it again,\" I insisted. His eyes were suddenly shrewd. \"How about if I mean it, and I agree to let you drive Saturday?\" he countered my conditions. I considered, and decided it was probably the best offer I would get. \"Deal,\" I agreed. \"Then I'm very sorry I upset you.\" His eyes burned with sincerity for a protracted moment \u2014 playing havoc with the rhythm of my heart \u2014 and then turned playful. \"And I'll be on your doorstep bright and early Saturday morning.\" \"Um, it doesn't help with the Charlie situation if an unexplained Volvo is left in the driveway.\" His smile was condescending now. \"I wasn't intending to bring a car.\" \"How \u2014\" He cut me off. \"Don't worry about it. I'll be there, no car.\" I let it go. I had a more pressing question. \"Is it later yet?\" I asked significantly. He frowned. \"I supposed it is later.\" I kept my expression polite as I waited. He stopped the car. I looked up, surprised \u2014 of course we were already at Charlie's house, parked behind the truck. It was easier to ride with him if I only looked when it was over. When I looked back at him, he was staring at me, measuring with his eyes.  \"And you still want to know why you can't see me hunt?\" He seemed solemn, but I thought I saw a trace of humor deep in his eyes. \"Well,\" I clarified, \"I was mostly wondering about your reaction.\" \"Did I frighten you?\" Yes, there was definitely humor there. \"No,\" I lied. He didn't buy it. \"I apologize for scaring you,\" he persisted with a slight smile, but then all evidence of teasing disappeared. \"It was just the very thought of you being there\u2026 while we hunted.\" His jaw tightened. \"That would be bad?\" He spoke from between clenched teeth. \"Extremely.\" \"Because\u2026 ?\" He took a deep breath and stared through the windshield at the thick, rolling clouds that seemed to press down, almost within reach. \"When we hunt,\" he spoke slowly, unwillingly, \"we give ourselves over to our senses\u2026 govern less with our minds. Especially our sense of smell. If you were anywhere near me when I lost control that way\u2026\" He shook his head, still gazing morosely at the heavy clouds. I kept my expression firmly under control, expecting the swift flash of his eyes to judge my reaction that soon followed. My face gave nothing away. But our eyes held, and the silence deepened \u2014 and changed. Flickers of the electricity I'd felt this afternoon began to charge the atmosphere as he gazed unrelentingly into my eyes. It wasn't until my head started to swim that I realized I wasn't breathing. When I drew in a jagged breath, breaking the stillness, he closed his eyes. \"Bella, I think you should go inside now.\" His low voice was rough, his eyes on the clouds again. I opened the door, and the arctic draft that burst into the car helped clear my head. Afraid I might stumble in my woozy state, I stepped carefully out of the car and shut the door behind me without looking back. The whir of the automatic window unrolling made me turn. \"Oh, Bella?\" he called after me, his voice more even. He leaned toward the open window with a faint smile on his lips. \"Yes?\" \"Tomorrow it's my turn.\" \"Your turn to what?\" He smiled wider, flashing his gleaming teeth. \"Ask the questions.\" And then he was gone, the car speeding down the street and disappearing around the corner before I could even collect my thoughts. I smiled as I walked to the house. It was clear he was planning to see me tomorrow, if nothing else. That night Edward starred in my dreams, as usual. However, the climate of my unconsciousness had changed. It thrilled with the same electricity that had charged the afternoon, and I tossed and turned restlessly, waking often. It was only in the early hours of the morning that I finally sank into an exhausted, dreamless sleep. When I woke I was still tired, but edgy as well. I pulled on my brown turtleneck and the inescapable jeans, sighing as I daydreamed of spaghetti straps and shorts. Breakfast was the usual, quiet event I expected. Charlie fried eggs for himself; I had my bowl of cereal. I wondered if he had forgotten about this Saturday. He answered my unspoken question as he stood up to take his plate to the sink. \"About this Saturday\u2026\" he began, walking across the kitchen and turning on the faucet. I cringed. \"Yes, Dad?\" \"Are you still set on going to Seattle?\" he asked. \"That was the plan.\" I grimaced, wishing he hadn't brought it up so I wouldn't have to compose careful half-truths. He squeezed some dish soap onto his plate and swirled it around with the brush. \"And you're sure you can't make it back in time for the dance?\" \"I'm not going to the dance, Dad.\" I glared. \"Didn't anyone ask you?\" he asked, trying to hide his concern by focusing on <em>rinsing</em> the plate. I sidestepped the minefield. \"It's a girl's choice.\" \"Oh.\" He frowned as he dried his plate. I sympathized with him. It must be a hard thing, to be a father; living in fear that your daughter would meet a boy she liked, but also having to worry if she didn't. How ghastly it would be, I thought, shuddering, if Charlie had even the slightest inkling of exactly what I did like. Charlie left then, with a goodbye wave, and I went upstairs to brush my teeth and gather my books. When I heard the cruiser pull away, I could only wait a few seconds before I had to peek out of my window. The silver car was already there, waiting in Charlie's spot on the driveway. I bounded down the stairs and out the front door, wondering how long this bizarre routine would continue. I never wanted it to end.  He waited in the car, not appearing to watch as I shut the door behind me without bothering to lock the dead-bolt. I walked to the car, pausing shyly before opening the door and stepping in. He was smiling, relaxed \u2014 and, as usual, perfect and beautiful to an excruciating degree. \"Good morning.\" His voice was silky. \"How are you today?\" His eyes roamed over my face, as if his question was something more than simple courtesy. \"Good, thank you.\" I was always good \u2014 much more than good \u2014 when I was near him. His gaze lingered on the circles under my eyes. \"You look tired.\" \"I couldn't sleep,\" I confessed, automatically swinging my hair around my shoulder to provide some measure of cover. \"Neither could I,\" he teased as he started the engine. I was becoming used to the quiet purr. I was sure the roar of my truck would scare me, whenever I got to drive it again. I laughed. \"I guess that's right. I suppose I slept just a little bit more than you did.\" \"I'd wager you did.\" \"So what did you do last night?\" I asked. He chuckled. \"Not a chance. It's my day to ask questions.\" \"Oh, that's right. What do you want to know?\" My forehead creased. I couldn't imagine anything about me that could be in any way interesting to him. \"What's your favorite color?\" he asked, his face grave. I rolled my eyes. \"It changes from day to day.\" \"What's your favorite color today?\" He was still solemn. \"Probably brown.\" I tended to dress according to my mood. He snorted, dropping his serious expression. \"Brown?\" he asked skeptically. \"Sure. Brown is warm. I miss brown. Everything that's supposed to be brown \u2014 tree trunks, rocks, dirt \u2014 is all covered up with squashy green stuff here,\" I complained. He seemed fascinated by my little rant. He considered for a moment, staring into my eyes. \"You're right,\" he decided, serious again. \"Brown is warm.\" He reached over, swiftly, but somehow still hesitantly, to sweep my hair back behind my shoulder. We were at the school by now. He turned back to me as he pulled into a parking space. \"What music is in your CD player right now?\" he asked, his face as somber as if he'd asked for a murder confession. I realized I'd never removed the CD Phil had given me. When I said the name of the band, he smiled crookedly, a peculiar expression in his eyes. He flipped open a compartment under his car's CD player, pulled out one of thirty or so CDs that were jammed into the small space, and handed it to me, \"Debussy to this?\" He raised an eyebrow. It was the same CD. I examined the familiar cover art, keeping my eyes down. It continued like that for the rest of the day. While he walked me to English, when he met me after Spanish, all through the lunch hour, he questioned me relentlessly about every insignificant detail of my existence. Movies I'd liked and hated, the few places I'd been and the many places I wanted to go, and books \u2014 endlessly books. I couldn't remember the last time I'd talked so much. More often than not, I felt self-conscious, certain I must be boring him. But the absolute absorption of his face, and his never-ending stream of questions, compelled me to continue. Mostly his questions were easy, only a very few triggering my easy blushes. But when I did flush, it brought on a whole new round of questions. Such as the time he asked my favorite gemstone, and I blurted out topaz before thinking. He'd been flinging questions at me with such speed that I felt like I was taking one of those psychiatric tests where you answer with the first word that comes to mind. I was sure he would have continued down whatever mental list he was following, except for the blush. My face reddened because, until very recently, my favorite gemstone was garnet. It was impossible, while staring back into his topaz eyes, not to remember the reason for the switch. And, naturally, he wouldn't rest until I'd admitted why I was embarrassed. \"Tell me,\" he finally commanded after persuasion failed \u2014 failed only because I kept my eyes safely away from his face. \"It's the color of your eyes today,\" I sighed, surrendering, staring down at my hands as I fiddled with a piece of my hair. \"I suppose if you asked me in two weeks I'd say onyx.\" I'd given more information than necessary in my unwilling honesty, and I worried it would provoke the strange anger that flared whenever I slipped and revealed too clearly how obsessed I was. But his pause was very short. \"What kinds of flowers do you prefer?\" he fired off. I sighed in relief, and continued with the psychoanalysis. Biology was a complication again. Edward had continued with his quizzing up until Mr. Banner entered the room, dragging the audiovisual frame again. As the teacher approached the light switch, I noticed Edward slide his chair slightly farther away from mine. It didn't help. As soon as the room was dark, there was the same electric spark, the same restless craving to stretch my hand across the short space and touch his cold skin, as yesterday. I leaned forward on the table, resting my chin on my folded arms, my hidden fingers gripping the table's edge as I fought to ignore the irrational longing that unsettled me. I didn't look at him, afraid that if he was looking at me, it would only make self-control that much harder. I sincerely tried to watch the movie, but at the end of the hour I had no idea what I'd just seen. I sighed in relief again when Mr. Banner turned the lights on, finally glancing at Edward; he was looking at me, his eyes ambivalent. He rose in silence and then stood still, waiting for me. We walked toward the gym in silence, like yesterday. And, also like yesterday, he touched my face wordlessly \u2014 this time with the back of his cool hand, stroking once from my temple to my jaw \u2014 before he turned and walked away. Gym passed quickly as I watched Mike's one-man badminton show. He didn't speak to me today, either in response to my vacant expression or because he was still angry about our squabble yesterday. Somewhere, in a corner of my mind, I felt bad about that. But I couldn't concentrate on him. I hurried to change afterward, ill at ease, knowing the faster I moved, the sooner I would be with Edward. The pressure made me more clumsy than usual, but eventually I made it out the door, feeling the same release when I saw him standing there, a wide smile automatically spreading across my face. He smiled in reaction before launching into more cross-examination. His questions were different now, though, not as easily answered. He wanted to know what I missed about home, insisting on descriptions of anything he wasn't familiar with. We sat in front of Charlie's house for hours, as the sky darkened and rain plummeted around us in a sudden deluge. I tried to describe impossible things like the scent of creosote \u2014 bitter, slightly resinous, but still pleasant \u2014 the high, keening sound of the cicadas in July, the feathery barrenness of the trees, the very size of the sky, extending white-blue from horizon to horizon, barely interrupted by the low mountains covered with purple volcanic rock. The hardest thing to explain was why it was so beautiful to me \u2014 to justify a beauty that didn't depend on the sparse, spiny vegetation that often looked half dead, a beauty that had more to do with the exposed shape of the land, with the shallow bowls of valleys between the craggy hills, and the way they held on to the sun. I found myself using my hands as I tried to describe it to him. His quiet, probing questions kept me talking freely, forgetting, in the dim light of the storm, to be embarrassed for monopolizing the conversation. Finally, when I had finished detailing my cluttered room at home, he paused instead of responding with another question.  \"Are you finished?\" I asked in relief. \"Not even close \u2014 but your father will be home soon.\" \"Charlie!\" I suddenly recalled his existence, and sighed. I looked out at the rain-darkened sky, but it gave nothing away. \"How late is it?\" I wondered out loud as I glanced at the clock. I was surprised by the time \u2014 Charlie would be driving home now. \"It's twilight,\" Edward murmured, looking at the western horizon, obscured as it was with clouds. His voice was thoughtful, as if his mind were somewhere far away. I stared at him as he gazed unseeingly out the windshield. I was still staring when his eyes suddenly shifted back to mine. \"It's the safest time of day for us,\" he said, answering the unspoken question in my eyes. \"The easiest time. But also the saddest, in a way\u2026 the end of another day, the return of the night. Darkness is so predictable, don't you think?\" He smiled wistfully. \"I like the night. Without the dark, we'd never see the stars.\" I frowned. \"Not that you see them here much.\" He laughed, and the mood abruptly lightened. \"Charlie will be here in a few minutes. So, unless you want to tell him that you'll be with me Saturday\u2026\" He raised one eyebrow. \"Thanks, but no thanks.\" I gathered my books, realizing I was stiff from sitting still so long. \"So is it my turn tomorrow, then?\" \"Certainly not!\" His face was teasingly outraged. \"I told you I wasn't done, didn't I?\" \"What more is there?\" \"You'll find out tomorrow.\" He reached across to open my door for me, and his sudden proximity sent my heart into frenzied palpitations. But his hand froze on the handle. \"Not good,\" he muttered. \"What is it?\" I was surprised to see that his jaw was clenched, his eyes disturbed. He glanced at me for a brief second. \"Another complication,\" he said glumly. He flung the door open in one swift movement, and then moved, almost cringed, swiftly away from me. The flash of headlights through the rain caught my attention as a dark car pulled up to the curb just a few feet away, facing us. \"Charlie's around the corner,\" he warned, staring through the downpour at the other vehicle. I hopped out at once, despite my confusion and curiosity. The rain was louder as it glanced off my jacket. I tried to make out the shapes in the front seat of the other car, but it was too dark. I could see Edward illuminated in the glare of the new car's headlights; he was still staring ahead, his gaze locked on something or someone I couldn't see. His expression was a strange mix of frustration and defiance. Then he revved the engine, and the tires squealed against the wet pavement. The Volvo was out of sight in seconds. \"Hey, Bella,\" called a familiar, husky voice from the driver's side of the little black car. \"Jacob?\" I asked, squinting through the rain. Just then, Charlie's cruiser swung around the corner, his lights shining on the occupants of the car in front of me. Jacob was already climbing out, his wide grin visible even through the darkness. In the passenger seat was a much older man, a heavyset man with a memorable face \u2014 a face that overflowed, the cheeks resting against his shoulders, with creases running through the russet skin like an old leather jacket. And the surprisingly familiar eyes, black eyes that seemed at the same time both too young and too ancient for the broad face they were set in. Jacob's father, Billy Black. I knew him immediately, though in the more than five years since I'd seen him last I'd managed to forget his name when Charlie had spoken of him my first day here. He was staring at me, scrutinizing my face, so I smiled tentatively at him. His eyes were wide, as if in shock or fear, his nostrils flared. My smile faded. Another complication, Edward had said. Billy still stared at me with intense, anxious eyes. I groaned internally. Had Billy recognized Edward so easily? Could he really believe the impossible legends his son had scoffed at? The answer was clear in Billy's eyes. Yes. Yes, he could.",
