            "en": "9      9. THEORY \"Can I ask just one more?\" I pleaded as Edward accelerated much too quickly down the quiet street. He didn't seem to be paying any attention to the road. He sighed. \"One,\" he agreed. His lips pressed together into a cautious line. \"Well\u2026 you said you knew I hadn't gone into the bookstore, and that I had gone south. I was just wondering how you knew that.\" He looked away, deliberating. \"I thought we were past all the evasiveness,\" I grumbled. He almost smiled. \"Fine, then. I followed your scent.\" He looked at the road, giving me time to compose my face. I couldn't think of an acceptable response to that, but I filed it carefully away for future study. I tried to refocus. I wasn't ready to let him be finished, now that he was finally explaining things. \"And then you didn't answer one of my first questions\u2026\" I stalled. He looked at me with disapproval. \"Which one?\" \"How does it work \u2014 the mind-reading thing? Can you read anybody's mind, anywhere? How do you do it? Can the rest of your family\u2026 ?\" I felt silly, asking for clarification on make-believe. \"That's more than one,\" he pointed out. I simply intertwined my fingers and gazed at him, waiting. \"No, it's just me. And I can't hear anyone, anywhere. I have to be fairly close. The more familiar someone's\u2026 'voice' is, the farther away I can hear them. But still, no more than a few miles.\" He paused thoughtfully. \"It's a little like being in a huge hall filled with people, everyone talking at once. It's just a hum \u2014 a buzzing of voices in the background. Until I focus on one voice, and then what they're thinking is clear. \u00a0\"Most of the time I tune it all out \u2014 it can be very distracting. And then it's easier to seem normal\" \u2014 he frowned as he said the word \u2014 \"when I'm not accidentally answering someone's thoughts rather than their words.\" \"Why do you think you can't hear me?\" I asked curiously. He looked at me, his eyes enigmatic. \"I don't know,\" he murmured. \"The only guess I have is that maybe your mind doesn't work the same way the rest of theirs do. Like your thoughts are on the AM frequency and I'm only getting FM.\" He grinned at me, suddenly amused. \"My mind doesn't work right? I'm a freak?\" The words bothered me more than they should \u2014 probably because his speculation hit home. I'd always suspected as much, and it embarrassed me to have it confirmed. \"I hear voices in my mind and you're worried that you're the freak,\" he laughed. \"Don't worry, it's just a theory\u2026\" His face tightened. \"Which brings us back to you.\" I sighed. How to begin? \"Aren't we past all the evasions now?\" he reminded me softly. I looked away from his face for the first time, trying to find words. I happened to notice the speedometer. \"Holy crow!\" I shouted. \"Slow down!\" \"What's wrong?\" He was startled. But the car didn't decelerate. \"You're going a hundred miles an hour!\" I was still shouting. I shot a panicky glance out the window, but it was too dark to see much. The road was only visible in the long patch of bluish brightness from the headlights. The forest along both sides of the road was like a black wall \u2014 as hard as a wall of steel if we veered off the road at this speed. \"Relax, Bella.\" He rolled his eyes, still not slowing. \"Are you trying to kill us?\" I demanded. \"We're not going to crash.\" I tried to modulate my voice. \"Why are you in such a hurry?\" \"I always drive like this.\" He turned to smile crookedly at me. \"Keep your eyes on the road!\" \"I've never been in an accident, Bella \u2014 I've never even gotten a ticket.\" He grinned and tapped his forehead. \"Built-in radar detector.\" \"Very funny.\" I fumed. \"Charlie's a cop, remember? I was raised to abide by traffic laws. Besides, if you turn us into a Volvo pretzel around a tree trunk, you can probably just walk away.\" \"Probably,\" he agreed with a short, hard laugh. \"But you can't.\" He sighed, and I watched with relief as the needle gradually drifted toward eighty. \"Happy?\" \"Almost.\" \"I hate driving slow,\" he muttered. \"This is slow?\" \"Enough commentary on my driving,\" he snapped. \"I'm still waiting for your latest theory.\" I bit my lip. He looked down at me, his honey eyes unexpectedly gentle. \"I won't laugh,\" he promised. \"I'm more afraid that you'll be angry with me.\" \"Is it that bad?\" \"Pretty much, yeah.\" He waited. I was looking down at my hands, so I couldn't see his expression. \"Go ahead.\" His voice was calm. \"I don't know how to start,\" I admitted. \"Why don't you start at the beginning\u2026 you said you didn't come up with this on your own.\" \"No.\" \"What got you started \u2014 a book? A movie?\" he probed. \"No \u2014 it was Saturday, at the beach.\" I risked a glance up at his face. He looked puzzled. \"I ran into an old family friend \u2014Jacob Black,\" I continued. \"His dad and Charlie have been friends since I was a baby.\" He still looked confused. \"His dad is one of the Quileute elders.\" I watched him carefully. His confused expression froze in place. \"We went for a walk \u2014\" I edited all my scheming out of the story \"\u2014 and he was telling me some old legends \u2014 trying to scare me, I think. He told me one\u2026\" I hesitated. \"Go on,\" he said. \"About vampires.\" I realized I was whispering. I couldn't look at his face now. But I saw his knuckles tighten convulsively on the wheel. \"And you immediately thought of me?\" Still calm. \"No. He\u2026 mentioned your family.\" He was silent, staring at the road. I was worried suddenly, worried about protecting Jacob. \"He just thought it was a silly superstition,\" I said quickly. \"He didn't expect me to think anything of it.\" It didn't seem like enough; I had to confess. \"It was my fault, I forced him to tell me.\" \"Why?\" \"Lauren said something about you \u2014 she was trying to provoke me. And an older boy from the tribe said your family didn't come to the reservation, only it sounded like he meant something different. So I got Jacob alone and I tricked it out of him,\" I admitted, hanging my head.  He startled me by laughing. I glared up at him. He was laughing, but his eyes were fierce, staring ahead. \"Tricked him how?\" he asked. \"I tried to flirt \u2014 it worked better than I thought it would.\" Disbelief colored my tone as I remembered. \"I'd like to have seen that.\" He chuckled darkly. \"And you accused me of dazzling people \u2014 poor Jacob Black.\" I blushed and looked out my window into the night. \"What did you do then?\" he asked after a minute. \"I did some research on the Internet.\" \"And did that convince you?\" His voice sounded barely interested. But his hands were clamped hard onto the steering wheel. \"No. Nothing fit. Most of it was kind of silly. And then\u2026\" I stopped. \"What?\" \"I decided it didn't matter,\" I whispered. \"It didn't matter?\" His tone made me look up \u2014 I had finally broken through his carefully composed mask. His face was incredulous, with just a hint of the anger I'd feared. \"No,\" I said softly. \"It doesn't matter to me what you are.\" A hard, mocking edge entered his voice. \"You don't care if I'm a monster? If I'm not human!\" \"No.\" He was silent, staring straight ahead again. His face was bleak and cold. \"You're angry,\" I sighed. \"I shouldn't have said anything.\" \"No,\" he said, but his tone was as hard as his face. \"I'd rather know what you're thinking \u2014 even if what you're thinking is insane.\" \"So I'm wrong again?\" I challenged. \"That's not what I was referring to. 'It doesn't matter'!\" he quoted, gritting his teeth together.  \"I'm right?\" I gasped. \"Does it matter?\" I took a deep breath. \"Not really.\" I paused. \"But I am curious.\" My voice, at least, was composed. He was suddenly resigned. \"What are you curious about?\" \"How old are you?\" \"Seventeen,\" he answered promptly. \"And how long have you been seventeen?\" His lips twitched as he stared at the road. \"A while,\" he admitted at last. \"Okay.\" I smiled, pleased that he was still being honest with me. He stared down at me with watchful eyes, much as he had before, when he was worried I would go into shock. I smiled wider in encouragement, and he frowned. \"Don't laugh \u2014 but how can you come out during the daytime?\" He laughed anyway. \"Myth.\" \"Burned by the sun?\" \"Myth.\" \"Sleeping in coffins?\" \"Myth.\" He hesitated for a moment, and a peculiar tone entered his voice. \"I can't sleep.\" It took me a minute to absorb that. \"At all?\" \"Never,\" he said, his voice nearly inaudible. He turned to look at me with a wistful expression. The golden eyes held mine, and I lost my train of thought. I stared at him until he looked away. \"You haven't asked me the most important question yet.\" His voice was hard now, and when he looked at me again his eyes were cold. I blinked, still dazed. \"Which one is that?\" \"You aren't concerned about my diet?\" he asked sarcastically. \"Oh,\" I murmured, \"that.\" \"Yes, that.\" His voice was bleak. \"Don't you want to know if I drink blood?\" I flinched. \"Well, Jacob said something about that.\" \"What did Jacob say?\" he asked flatly. \"He said you didn't\u2026 hunt people. He said your family wasn't supposed to be dangerous because you only hunted animals.\" \"He said we weren't dangerous?\" His voice was deeply skeptical. \"Not exactly. He said you weren't supposed to be dangerous. But the Quileutes still didn't want you on their land, just in case.\" He looked forward, but I couldn't tell if he was watching the road or not. \"So was he right? About not hunting people?\" I tried to keep my voice as even as possible. \"The Quileutes have a long memory,\" he whispered. I took it as a confirmation. \"Don't let that make you complacent, though,\" he warned me. \"They're right to keep their distance from us. We are still dangerous.\" \"I don't understand.\" \"We try,\" he explained slowly. \"We're usually very good at what we do. Sometimes we make mistakes. Me, for example, allowing myself to be alone with you.\" \"This is a mistake?\" I heard the sadness in my voice, but I didn't know if he could as well. \"A very dangerous one,\" he murmured. We were both silent then. I watched the headlights twist with the curves of the road. They moved too fast; it didn't look real, it looked like a video game. I was aware of the time slipping away so quickly, like the black road beneath us, and I was hideously afraid that I would never have another chance to be with him like this again \u2014 openly, the walls between us gone for once. His words hinted at an end, and I recoiled from the idea. I couldn't waste one minute I had with him. \"Tell me more,\" I asked desperately, not caring what he said, just so I could hear his voice again. He looked at me quickly, startled by the change in my tone. \"What more do you want to know?\" \"Tell me why you hunt animals instead of people,\" I suggested, my voice still tinged with desperation. I realized my eyes were wet, and I fought against the grief that was trying to overpower me. \"I don't want to be a monster.\" His voice was very low. \"But animals aren't enough?\" He paused. \"I can't be sure, of course, but I'd compare it to living on tofu and soy milk; we call ourselves vegetarians, our little inside joke. It doesn't completely satiate the hunger \u2014 or rather thirst. But it keens us strong enough to resist. Most of the time.\" His tone turned ominous. \"Sometimes it's more difficult than others.\" \"Is it very difficult for you now?\" I asked. He sighed. \"Yes.\" \"But you're not hungry now,\" I said confidently \u2014 stating, not asking. \"Why do you think that?\" \"Your eyes. I told you I had a theory. I've noticed that people \u2014 men in particular \u2014 are crabbier when they're hungry.\" He chuckled. \"You are observant, aren't you?\" I didn't answer; I just listened to the sound of his laugh, committing it to memory. \"Were you hunting this weekend, with Emmett?\" I asked when it was quiet again. \"Yes.\" He paused for a second, as if deciding whether or not to say something. \"I didn't want to leave, but it was necessary. It's a bit easier to be around you when I'm not thirsty.\" \"Why didn't you want to leave?\" \"It makes me\u2026 anxious\u2026 to be away from you.\" His eyes were gentle but intense, and they seemed to be making my bones turn soft. \"I wasn't joking when I asked you to try not to fall in the ocean or get run over last Thursday. I was distracted all weekend, worrying about you. And after what happened tonight, I'm surprised that you did make it through a whole weekend unscathed.\" He shook his head, and then seemed to remember something. \"Well, not totally unscathed.\" \"What?\" \"Your hands,\" he reminded me. I looked down at my palms, at the almost-healed scrapes across the heels of my hands. His eyes missed nothing. \"I fell,\" I sighed. \"That's what I thought.\" His lips curved up at the corners. \"I suppose, being you, it could have been much worse \u2014 and that possibility tormented me the entire time I was away. It was a very long three days. I really got on Emmett's nerves.\" He smiled ruefully at me. \"Three days? Didn't you just get back today?\" \"No, we got back Sunday.\" \"Then why weren't any of you in school?\" I was frustrated, almost angry as I thought of how much disappointment I had suffered because of his absence. \"Well, you asked if the sun hurt me, and it doesn't. But I can't go out in the sunlight \u2014 at least, not where anyone can see.\" \"Why?\" \"I'll show you sometime,\" he promised.  I thought about it for a moment. \"You might have called me,\" I decided. He was puzzled. \"But I knew you were safe.\" \"But I didn't know where you were. I \u2014\" I hesitated, dropping my eyes. \"What?\" His velvety voice was compelling. \"I didn't like it. Not seeing you. It makes me anxious, too.\" I blushed to be saying this out loud. He was quiet. I glanced up, apprehensive, and saw that his expression was pained. \"Ah,\" he groaned quietly. \"This is wrong.\" I couldn't understand his response. \"What did I say?\" \"Don't you see, Bella? It's one thing for me to make myself miserable, but a wholly other thing for you to be so involved.\" He turned his anguished eyes to the road, his words flowing almost too fast for me to understand. \"I don't want to hear that you feel that way.\" His voice was low but urgent. His words cut me. \"It's wrong. It's not safe. I'm dangerous, Bella \u2014 please, grasp that.\" \" No.\" I tried very hard not to look like a sulky child. \"I'm serious,\" he growled. \"So am I. I told you, it doesn't matter what you are. It's too late.\" His voice whipped out, low and harsh. \"Never say that.\" I bit my lip and was glad he couldn't know how much that hurt. I stared out at the road. We must be close now. He was driving much too fast.  \"What are you thinking?\" he asked, his voice still raw. I just shook my head, not sure if I could speak. I could feel his gaze on my face, but I kept my eyes forward. \"Are you crying?\" He sounded appalled. I hadn't realized the moisture in my eyes had brimmed over. I quickly rubbed my hand across my cheek, and sure enough, traitor tears were there, betraying me.  \"No,\" I said, but my voice cracked. I saw him reach toward me hesitantly with his right hand, but then he stopped and placed it slowly back on the steering wheel. \"I'm sorry.\" His voice burned with regret. I knew he wasn't just apologizing for the words that had upset me. The darkness slipped by us in silence. \"Tell me something,\" he asked after another minute, and I could hear him struggle to use a lighter tone. \"Yes?\" \"What were you thinking tonight, just before I came around the corner? I couldn't understand your expression \u2014 you didn't look that scared, you looked like you were concentrating very hard on something.\" \"I was trying to remember how to incapacitate an attacker \u2014 you know, self-defense. I was going to smash his nose into his brain.\" I thought of the dark-haired man with a surge of hate. \"You were going to fight them?\" This upset him. \"Didn't you think about running?\" \"I fall down a lot when I run,\" I admitted. \"What about screaming for help?\" \"I was getting to that part.\" He shook his head. \"You were right \u2014 I'm definitely fighting fate trying to keep you alive.\" I sighed. We were slowing, passing into the boundaries of Forks. It had taken less than twenty minutes. \"Will I see you tomorrow?\" I demanded. \"Yes \u2014 I have a paper due, too.\" He smiled. \"I'll save you a seat at lunch.\" It was silly, after everything we'd been through tonight, how that little promise sent flutters through my stomach, and made me unable to speak. We were in front of Charlie's house. The lights were on, my truck in its place, everything utterly normal. It was like waking from a dream. He stopped the car, but I didn't move. \"Do you promise to be there tomorrow?\" \"I promise.\" I considered that for a moment, then nodded. I pulled his jacket off, taking one last whiff. \"You can keep it \u2014 you don't have a jacket for tomorrow,\" he reminded me. I handed it back to him. \"I don't want to have to explain to Charlie.\" \"Oh, right.\" He grinned. I hesitated, my hand on the door handle, trying to prolong the moment. \"Bella?\" he asked in a different tone \u2014 serious, but hesitant. \"Yes?\" I turned back to him too eagerly. \"Will you promise me something?\" \"Yes,\" I said, and instantly regretted my unconditional agreement. What if he asked me to stay away from him? I couldn't keep that promise. \"Don't go into the woods alone.\" I stared at him in blank confusion. \"Why?\" He frowned, and his eyes were tight as he stared past me out the window. \"I'm not always the most dangerous thing out there. Let's leave it at that.\" I shuddered slightly at the sudden bleakness in his voice, but I was relieved. This, at least, was an easy promise to honor. \"Whatever you say.\" \"I'll see you tomorrow,\" he sighed, and I knew he wanted me to leave now. \"Tomorrow, then.\" I opened the door unwillingly. \"Bella?\" I turned and he was leaning toward me, his pale, glorious face just inches from mine. My heart stopped beating. \"Sleep well,\" he said. His breath blew in my face, stunning me. It was the same exquisite scent that clung to his jacket, but in a more concentrated form. I blinked, thoroughly dazed. He leaned away. I was unable to move until my brain had somewhat unscrambled itself. Then I stepped out of the car awkwardly, having to use the frame for support. I thought I heard him chuckle, but the sound was too quiet for me to be certain. He waited till I had stumbled to the front door, and then I heard his engine quietly rev. I turned to watch the silver car disappear around the corner. I realized it was very cold. I reached for the key mechanically, unlocked the door, and stepped inside. Charlie called from the living room. \"Bella?\" \"Yeah, Dad, it's me.\" I walked in to see him. He was watching a baseball game. \"You're home early.\" \"Am I?\" I was surprised. \"It's not even eight yet,\" he told me. \"Did you girls have fun?\" \"Yeah \u2014 it was lots of fun.\" My head was spinning as I tried to remember all the way back to the girls' night out I had planned. \"They both found dresses.\" \"Are you all right?\" \"I'm just tired. I did a lot of walking.\" \"Well, maybe you should go lie down.\" He sounded concerned. I wondered what my face looked like. \"I'm just going to call Jessica first.\" \"Weren't you just with her?\" he asked, surprised. \"Yes \u2014 but I left my jacket in her car. I want to make sure she brings it tomorrow.\" \"Well, give her a chance to get home first.\" \"Right,\" I agreed. I went to the kitchen and fell, exhausted, into a chair. I was really feeling dizzy now. I wondered if I was going to go into shock after all. Get a grip, I told myself. The phone rang suddenly, startling me. I yanked it off the hook. \"Hello?\" I asked breathlessly. \"Bella?\" \"Hey, Jess, I was just going to call you.\" \"You made it home?\" Her voice was relieved\u2026 and surprised. \"Yes. I left my jacket in your car \u2014 could you bring it to me tomorrow?\" \"Sure. But tell me what happened!\" she demanded. \"Um, tomorrow \u2014 in Trig, okay?\" She caught on quickly. \"Oh, is your dad there?\" \"Yes, that's right.\" \"Okay, I'll talk to you tomorrow, then. Bye!\" I could hear the impatience in her voice. \"Bye, Jess.\" I walked up the stairs slowly, a heavy stupor clouding my mind. I went through the motions of getting ready for bed without paying any attention to what I was doing. It wasn't until I was in the shower \u2014 the water too hot, burning my skin \u2014 that I realized I was freezing. I shuddered violently for several minutes before the steaming spray could finally relax my rigid muscles. Then I stood in the shower, too tired to move, until the hot water began to run out. I stumbled out, wrapping myself securely in a towel, trying to hold the heat from the water in so the aching shivers wouldn't return. I dressed for bed swiftly and climbed under my quilt, curling into a ball, hugging myself to keep warm. A few small shudders trembled through me. My mind still swirled dizzily, full of images I couldn't understand, and some I fought to <em>repress</em>. Nothing seemed clear at first, but as I fell gradually closer to unconsciousness, a few certainties became evident. About three things I was absolutely positive. First, Edward was a vampire. Second, there was part of him \u2014 and I didn't know how potent that part might be \u2014 that thirsted for my blood. And third, I was unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him.",

            "en": "24           24. AN IMPASSE My eyes opened to a bright, white light. I was in an unfamiliar room, a white room. The wall beside me was covered in long vertical blinds; over my head, the glaring lights blinded me. I was propped up on a hard, uneven bed \u2014 a bed with rails. The pillows were flat and lumpy. There was an annoying beeping sound somewhere close by. I hoped that meant I was still alive. Death shouldn't be this uncomfortable.  My hands were all twisted up with clear tubes, and something was taped across my face, under my nose. I lifted my hand to rip it off. \"No, you don't.\" And cool fingers caught my hand. \"Edward?\" I turned my head slightly, and his exquisite face was just inches from mine, his chin resting on the edge of my pillow. I realized again that I was alive, this time with gratitude and elation. \"Oh, Edward, I'm so sorry!\" \"Shhhh,\" he shushed me. \"Everything's all right now.\" \"What happened?\" I couldn't remember clearly, and my mind rebelled against me as I tried to recall. \"I was almost too late. I could have been too late,\" he whispered, his voice tormented. \"I was so stupid, Edward. I thought he had my mom.\" \"He tricked us all.\" \"I need to call Charlie and my mom,\" I realized through the haze. \"Alice called them. Ren\u00e9e is here \u2014 well, here in the hospital. She's getting something to eat right now.\" \"She's here?\" I tried to sit up, but the spinning in my head accelerated, and his hand pushed me gently down onto the pillows. \"She'll be back soon,\" he promised. \"And you need to stay still.\" \"But what did you tell her?\" I panicked. I had no interest in being soothed. My mom was here and I was recovering from a vampire attack. \"Why did you tell her I'm here?\" \"You fell down two flights of stairs and through a window.\" He paused.\u00a0 \"You have to admit, it could happen.\" I sighed, and it hurt. I stared down at my body under the sheet, the huge lump that was my leg. \"How bad am I?\" I asked. \"You have a broken leg, four broken ribs, some cracks in your skull, bruises covering every inch of your skin, and you've lost a lot of blood.  They gave you a few transfusions. I didn't like it \u2014 it made you smell all wrong for a while.\" \"That must have been a nice change for you.\" \"No, I like how you smell.\" \"How did you do it?\" I asked quietly. He knew what I meant at once. \"I'm not sure.\" He looked away from my wondering eyes, lifting my gauze-wrapped hand from the bed and holding it gently in his, careful not to disrupt the wire connecting me to one of the monitors. I waited patiently for the rest. He sighed without returning my gaze. \"It was impossible\u2026 to stop,\" he whispered. \"Impossible. But I did.\" He looked up finally, with half a smile. \"I must love you.\" \"Don't I taste as good as I smell?\" I smiled in response. That hurt my face. \"Even better \u2014 better than I'd imagined.\" \"I'm sorry,\" I apologized. He raised his eyes to the ceiling. \"Of all the things to apologize for.\" \"What should I apologize for?\" \"For very nearly taking yourself away from me forever.\" \"I'm sorry,\" I apologized again. \"I know why you did it.\" His voice was comforting. \"It was still irrational, of course. You should have waited for me, you should have told me.\" \"You wouldn't have let me go.\" \"No,\" he agreed in a grim tone, \"I wouldn't.\" Some very unpleasant memories were beginning to come back to me. I shuddered, and then winced. He was instantly anxious. \"Bella, what's wrong?\" \"What happened to James?\" \"After I pulled him off you, Emmett and Jasper took care of him.\" There was a fierce note of regret in his voice. This confused me. \"I didn't see Emmett and Jasper there.\" \"They had to leave the room\u2026 there was a lot of blood.\" \"But you stayed.\" \"Yes, I stayed.\" \"And Alice, and Carlisle\u2026\" I said in wonder. \"They love you, too, you know.\" A flash of painful images from the last time I'd seen Alice reminded me of something. \"Did Alice see the tape?\" I asked anxiously. \"Yes.\" A new sound darkened his voice, a tone of sheer hatred. \"She was always in the dark, that's why she didn't remember.\" \"I know. She understands now.\" His voice was even, but his face was black with fury. I tried to reach his face with my free hand, but something stopped me. I glanced down to see the IV pulling at my hand. \"Ugh.\" I winced. \"What is it?\" he asked anxiously \u2014 distracted, but not enough. The bleakness did not entirely leave his eyes. \"Needles,\" I explained, looking away from the one in my hand. I concentrated on a warped ceiling tile and tried to breathe deeply despite the ache in my ribs. \"Afraid of a needle,\" he muttered to himself under his breath, shaking his head. \"Oh, a sadistic vampire, intent on torturing her to death, sure, no problem, she runs off to meet him. An IV, on the other hand\u2026\" I rolled my eyes. I was pleased to discover that this reaction, at least, was pain-free. I decided to change the subject. \"Why are you here?\" I asked. He stared at me, first confusion and then hurt touching his eyes. His brows pulled together as he frowned. \"Do you want me to leave?\" \"No!\" I protested, horrified by the thought. \"No, I meant, why does my mother think you're here? I need to have my story straight before she gets back.\" \"Oh,\" he said, and his forehead smoothed back into marble. \"I came to Phoenix to talk some sense into you, to convince you to come back to Forks.\" His wide eyes were so earnest and sincere, I almost believed him myself. \"You agreed to see me, and you drove out to the hotel where I was staying with Carlisle and Alice \u2014 of course I was here with parental supervision,\" he inserted virtuously, \"but you tripped on the stairs on the way to my room and\u2026 well, you know the rest. You don't need to remember any details, though; you have a good excuse to be a little muddled about the finer points.\" I thought about it for a moment. \"There are a few flaws with that story. Like no broken windows.\" \"Not really,\" he said. \"Alice had a little bit too much fun fabricating evidence. It's all been taken care of very convincingly \u2014 you could probably sue the hotel if you wanted to. You have nothing to worry about,\" he promised, stroking my cheek with the lightest of touches. \"Your only job now is to heal.\" I wasn't so lost to the soreness or the fog of medication that I didn't respond to his touch. The beeping of the monitor jumped around erratically \u2014 now he wasn't the only one who could hear my heart misbehave. \"That's going to be embarrassing,\" I muttered to myself. He chuckled, and a speculative look came into his eye. \"Hmm, I wonder\u2026\" He leaned in slowly; the beeping noise accelerated wildly before his lips even touched me. But when they did, though with the most gentle of pressure, the beeping stopped altogether. He pulled back abruptly, his anxious expression turning to relief as the monitor reported the restarting of my heart. \"It seems that I'm going to have to be even more careful with you than usual.\" He frowned. \"I was not finished kissing you,\" I complained. \"Don't make me come over there.\" He grinned, and bent to press his lips lightly to mine. The monitor went wild. But then his lips were taut. He pulled away. \"I think I hear your mother,\" he said, grinning again. \"Don't leave me,\" I cried, an irrational surge of panic flooding through me. I couldn't let him go \u2014 he might disappear from me again. He read the terror in my eyes for a short second. \"I won't,\" he promised solemnly, and then he smiled. \"I'll take a nap.\" He moved from the hard plastic chair by my side to the turquoise faux-leather recliner at the foot of my bed, leaning it all the way back, and closing his eyes. He was perfectly still. \"Don't forget to breathe,\" I whispered sarcastically. He took a deep breath, his eyes still closed. I could hear my mother now. She was talking to someone, maybe a nurse, and she sounded tired and upset. I wanted to jump out of the bed and run to her, to calm her, promise that everything was fine. But I wasn't in any sort of shape for jumping, so I waited impatiently. The door opened a crack, and she peeked through. \"Mom!\" I whispered, my voice full of love and relief. She took in Edward's still form on the recliner, and tiptoed to my bedside. \"He never leaves, does he?\" she mumbled to herself. \"Mom, I'm so glad to see you!\" She bent down to hug me gently, and I felt warm tears falling on my cheeks. \"Bella, I was so upset!\" \"I'm sorry, Mom. But everything's fine now, it's okay,\" I comforted her. \"I'm just glad to finally see your eyes open.\" She sat on the edge of my bed. I suddenly realized I didn't have any idea when it was. \"How long have they been closed?\" \"It's Friday, hon, you've been out for a while.\" \"Friday?\" I was shocked. I tried to remember what day it had been when\u2026 but I didn't want to think about that. \"They had to keep you sedated for a while, honey \u2014 you've got a lot of injuries.\" \"I know.\" I could feel them. \"You're lucky Dr. Cullen was there. He's such a nice man\u2026 very young, though. And he looks more like a model than a doctor\u2026\" \"You met Carlisle?\" \"And Edward's sister Alice. She's a lovely girl.\" \"She is,\" I agreed wholeheartedly. She glanced over her shoulder at Edward, lying with his eyes closed in the chair. \"You didn't tell me you had such good friends in Forks.\" I cringed, and then moaned. \"What hurts?\" she demanded anxiously, turning back to me. Edward's eyes flashed to my face. \"It's fine,\" I assured them. \"I just have to remember not to move.\" He lapsed back into his phony slumber. I took advantage of my mother's momentary distraction to keep the subject from returning to my less-than-candid behavior. \"Where's Phil?\" I asked quickly. \"Florida \u2014 oh, Bella! You'll never guess! Just when we were about to leave, the best news!\" \"Phil got signed?\" I guessed. \"Yes! How did you guess! The Suns, can you believe it?\" \"That's great, Mom,\" I said as enthusiastically as I could manage, though I had little idea what that meant. \"And you'll like Jacksonville so much,\" she gushed while I stared at her vacantly. \"I was a little bit worried when Phil started talking about Akron, what with the snow and everything, because you know how I hate the cold, but now Jacksonville! It's always sunny, and the humidity really isn't that bad. We found the cutest house, yellow, with white trim, and a porch just like in an old movie, and this huge oak tree, and it's just a few minutes from the ocean, and you'll have your own bathroom \u2014\" \"Wait, Mom!\" I interrupted. Edward still had his eyes closed, but he looked too tense to pass as asleep. \"What are you talking about? I'm not going to Florida. I live in Forks.\" \"But you don't have to anymore, silly,\" she laughed. \"Phil will be able to be around so much more now\u2026 we've talked about it a lot, and what I'm going to do is trade off on the away games, half the time with you, half the time with him.\" \"Mom.\" I hesitated, wondering how best to be diplomatic about this. \"I want to live in Forks. I'm already settled in at school, and I have a couple of girlfriends\" \u2014 she glanced toward Edward again when I reminded her of friends, so I tried another direction \u2014 \"and Charlie needs me. \u00a0He's just all alone up there, and he can't cook at all.\" \"You want to stay in Forks?\" she asked, bewildered. The idea was inconceivable to her. And then her eyes flickered back toward Edward.  \"Why?\" \"I told you \u2014 school, Charlie \u2014 ouch!\" I'd shrugged. Not a good idea. .  Her hands fluttered helplessly over me, trying to find a safe place to pat. She made do with my forehead; it was unbandaged. \"Bella, honey, you hate Forks,\" she reminded me. \"It's not so bad.\" She frowned and looked back and forth between Edward and me, this time very deliberately. \"Is it this boy?\" she whispered. I opened my mouth to lie, but her eyes were scrutinizing my face, and I knew she would see through that. \"He's part of it,\" I admitted. No need to confess how big a part. \"So, have you had a chance to talk with Edward?\" I asked. \"Yes.\" She hesitated, looking at his perfectly still form. \"And I want to talk to you about that.\" Uh-oh. \"What about?\" I asked. \"I think that boy is in love with you,\" she accused, keeping her voice low. \"I think so, too,\" I confided. \"And how do you feel about him?\" She only poorly concealed the raging curiosity in her voice. I sighed, looking away. As much as I loved my mom, this was not a conversation I wanted to have with her. \"I'm pretty crazy about him.\" There \u2014 that sounded like something a teenager with her first boyfriend might say. \"Well, he seems very nice, and, my goodness, he's incredibly good-looking, but you're so young, Bella\u2026\" Her voice was unsure; as far as I could remember, this was the first time since I was eight that she'd come close to trying to sound like a parental authority. I recognized the reasonable-but-firm tone of voice from talks I'd had with her about men. \"I know that, Mom. Don't worry about it. It's just a crush,\" I soothed her. \"That's right,\" she agreed, easily pleased. Then she sighed and glanced guiltily over her shoulder at the big, round clock on the wall. \"Do you need to go?\" She bit her lip. \"Phil's supposed to call in a little while\u2026 I didn't know you were going to wake up\u2026\" \"No problem, Mom.\" I tried to tone down the relief so she wouldn't get her feelings hurt. \"I won't be alone.\" \"I'll be back soon. I've been sleeping here, you know,\" she announced, proud of herself. \"Oh, Mom, you don't have to do that! You can sleep at home \u2014 I'll never notice.\" The swirl of painkillers in my brain was making it hard to concentrate even now, though, apparently, I'd been sleeping for days. \"I was too nervous,\" she admitted sheepishly. \"There's been some crime in the \u00a0neighborhood, and I don't like being there alone.\" \"Crime?\" I asked in alarm. \"Someone broke into that dance studio around the corner from the house and burned it to the ground \u2014 there's nothing left at all! And they left a stolen car right out front. Do you remember when you used to dance there, honey?\" \"I remember.\" I shivered, and winced. \"I can stay, baby, if you need me.\" \"No, Mom, I'll be fine. Edward will be with me.\" She looked like that might be why she wanted to stay. \"I'll be back tonight.\" It sounded as much like a warning as it sounded like a promise, and she glanced at Edward again as she said it. \"I love you, Mom.\" \"I love you, too, Bella. Try to be more careful when you walk, honey, I don't want to lose you.\" Edward's eyes stayed closed, but a wide grin flashed across his face. A nurse came bustling in then to check all my tubes and wires. My mother kissed my forehead, patted my gauze-wrapped hand, and left. The nurse was checking the paper readout on my heart monitor. \"Are you feeling anxious, honey? Your heart rate got a little high there.\" \"I'm fine,\" I assured her. \"I'll tell your RN that you're awake. She'll be in to see you in a minute.\" As soon as she closed the door, Edward was at my side. \"You stole a car?\" I raised my eyebrows. He smiled, unrepentant. \"It was a good car, very fast.\" \"How was your nap?\" I asked. \"Interesting.\" His eyes narrowed. \"What?\" He looked down while he answered. \"I'm surprised. I thought Florida\u2026 and your mother\u2026 well, I thought that's what you would want.\" I stared at him uncomprehendingly. \"But you'd be stuck inside all day in Florida. You'd only be able to come out at night, just like a real vampire.\" He almost smiled, but not quite. And then his face was grave. \"I would stay in Forks, Bella. Or somewhere like it,\" he explained. \"Someplace where I couldn't hurt you anymore.\" It didn't sink in at first. I continued to stare at him blankly as the words one by one clicked into place in my head like a ghastly puzzle. I was barely conscious of the sound of my heart accelerating, though, as my breathing became hyperventilation, I was aware of the sharp aching in my protesting ribs. He didn't say anything; he watched my face warily as the pain that had nothing to do with broken bones, pain that was infinitely worse, threatened to crush me. And then another nurse walked purposefully into the room. Edward sat still as stone as she took in my expression with a practiced eye before turning to the monitors. \"Time for more pain meds, sweetheart?\" she asked kindly, tapping the IV feed. \"No, no,\" I mumbled, trying to keep the agony out of my voice. \"I don't need anything.\" I couldn't afford to close my eyes now. \"No need to be brave, honey. It's better if you don't get too stressed out; you need to rest.\" She waited, but I just shook my head. \"Okay,\" she sighed. \"Hit the call button when you're ready.\" She gave Edward a stern look, and threw one more anxious glance at the machinery, before leaving. His cool hands were on my face; I stared at him with wild eyes. \"Shhh, Bella, calm down.\" \"Don't leave me,\" I begged in a broken voice. \"I won't,\" he promised. \"Now relax before I call the nurse back to sedate you.\" But my heart couldn't slow. \"Bella.\" He stroked my face anxiously. \"I'm not going anywhere. I'll be right here as long as you need me.\" \"Do you swear you won't leave me?\" I whispered. I tried to control the gasping, at least. My ribs were throbbing. He put his hands on either side of my face and brought his face close to mine. His eyes were wide and serious. \"I swear.\" The smell of his breath was soothing. It seemed to ease the ache of my breathing. He continued to hold my gaze while my body slowly relaxed and the beeping returned to a normal pace. His eyes were dark, closer to black than gold today. \"Better?\" he asked. \"Yes,\" I said cautiously. He shook his head and muttered something unintelligible. I thought I picked out the word \"overreaction.\" \"Why did you say that?\" I whispered, trying to keep my voice from shaking. \"Are you tired of having to save me all the time? Do you want me to go away?\" \"No, I don't want to be without you, Bella, of course not. Be rational.  And I have no problem with saving you, either \u2014 if it weren't for the fact that I was the one putting you in danger\u2026 that I'm the reason that you're here.\" \"Yes, you are the reason.\" I frowned. \"The reason I'm here \u2014 alive.\" \"Barely.\" His voice was just a whisper. \"Covered in gauze and plaster and hardly able to move.\" \"I wasn't referring to my most recent near-death experience,\" I said, growing irritated. \"I was thinking of the others \u2014 you can take your pick. If it weren't for you, I would be rotting away in the Forks cemetery.\" He winced at my words, but the haunted look didn't leave his eyes. \"That's not the worst part, though,\" he continued to whisper. He acted as if I hadn't spoken. \"Not seeing you there on the floor\u2026 crumpled and broken.\" His voice was choked. \"Not thinking I was too late. Not even hearing you scream in pain \u2014 all those unbearable memories that I'll carry with me for the rest of eternity. No, the very worst was feeling\u2026 knowing that I couldn't stop. Believing that I was going to kill you myself.\" \"But you didn't.\" \"I could have. So easily.\" I knew I needed to stay calm\u2026 but he was trying to talk himself into leaving me, and the panic fluttered in my lungs, trying to get out.  \"Promise me,\" I whispered. \"What?\" \"You know what.\" I was starting to get angry now. He was so stubbornly determined to dwell on the negative. He heard the change in my tone. His eyes tightened. \"I don't seem to be strong enough to stay away from you, so I suppose that you'll get your way\u2026 whether it kills you or not,\" he added roughly. \"Good.\" He hadn't promised, though \u2014 a fact that I had not missed. The panic was only barely contained; I had no strength left to control the anger. \"You told me how you stopped\u2026 now I want to know why,\" I demanded. \"Why?\" he repeated warily. \"Why you did it. Why didn't you just let the venom spread? By now I would be just like you.\" Edward's eyes seemed to turn flat black, and I remembered that this was something he'd never intended me to know. Alice must have been preoccupied by the things she'd learned about herself\u2026 or she'd been very careful with her thoughts around him \u2014 clearly, he'd had no idea that she'd filled me in on the mechanics of vampire conversions. He was surprised, and infuriated. His nostrils flared, his mouth looked as if it was chiseled from stone. He wasn't going to answer, that much was clear. \"I'll be the first to admit that I have no experience with relationships,\" I said. \"But it just seems logical\u2026 a man and woman have to be somewhat equal\u2026 as in, one of them can't always be swooping in and saving the other one. They have to save each other equally.\" He folded his arms on the side of my bed and rested his chin on his arms. His expression was smooth, the anger reined in. Evidently he'd decided he wasn't angry with me. I hoped I'd get a chance to warn Alice before he caught up with her. \"You have saved me,\" he said quietly. \"I can't always be Lois Lane,\" I insisted. \"I want to be Superman, too.\" \"You don't know what you're asking.\" His voice was soft; he stared intently at the edge of the pillowcase. \"I think I do.\" \"Bella, you don't know. I've had almost ninety years to think about this, and I'm still not sure.\" \"Do you wish that Carlisle hadn't saved you?\" \"No, I don't wish that.\" He paused before continuing. \"But my life was over. I wasn't giving anything up.\" \"You are my life. You're the only thing it would hurt me to lose.\" I was getting better at this. It was easy to admit how much I needed him. He was very calm, though. Decided. \"I can't do it, Bella. I won't do that to you.\" \"Why not?\" My throat rasped and the words weren't as loud as I'd meant them to be. \"Don't tell me it's too hard! After today, or I guess it was a few days ago\u2026 anyway, after that, it should be nothing.\" He glared at me. \"And the pain?\" he asked. I blanched. I couldn't help it. But I tried to keep my expression from showing how clearly I remembered the feeling\u2026 the fire in my veins. \"That's my problem,\" I said. \"I can handle it.\" \"It's possible to take bravery to the point where it becomes insanity.\" \"It's not an issue. Three days. Big deal.\" Edward grimaced again as my words reminded him that I was more informed than he had ever intended me to be. I watched him <em>repress</em> the anger, watched as his eyes grew speculative. \"Charlie?\" he asked curtly. \"Ren\u00e9e?\" Minutes passed in silence as I struggled to answer his question. I opened my mouth, but no sound came out. I closed it again. He waited, and his expression became triumphant because he knew I had no true answer. \"Look, that's not an issue either,\" I finally muttered; my voice was as unconvincing as it always was when I lied. \"Ren\u00e9e has always made the choices that work for her \u2014 she'd want me to do the same. And Charlie's resilient, he's used to being on his own. I can't take care of them forever. I have my own life to live.\" \"Exactly,\" he snapped. \"And I won't end it for you.\" \"If you're waiting for me to be on my deathbed, I've got news for you! I was just there!\" \"You're going to recover,\" he reminded me. I took a deep breath to calm myself, ignoring the spasm of pain it triggered. I stared at him, and he stared back. There was no compromise in his face. \"No,\" I said slowly. \"I'm not.\" His forehead creased. \"Of course you are. You may have a scar or two\u2026\" \"You're wrong,\" I insisted. \"I'm going to die.\" \"Really, Bella.\" He was anxious now. \"You'll be out of here in a few days. Two week at most.\" I glared at him. \"I may not die now\u2026 but I'm going to die sometime. Every minute of the day, I get closer. And I'm going to get old.\" He frowned as what I was saying sunk in, pressing his long fingers to his temples and closing his eyes. \"That's how it's supposed to happen. How it should happen. How it would have happened if I didn't exist \u2014 and I shouldn't exist.\" I snorted. He opened his eyes in surprise. \"That's stupid. That's like going to someone who's just won the lottery, taking their money, and saying, 'Look, let's just go back to how things should be. It's better that way.' And I'm not buying it.\" \"I'm hardly a lottery prize,\" he growled. \"That's right. You're much better.\" He rolled his eyes and set his lips. \"Bella, we're not having this discussion anymore. I refuse to damn you to an eternity of night and that's the end of it.\" \"If you think that's the end, then you don't know me very well,\" I warned him. \"You're not the only vampire I know.\" His eyes went black again. \"Alice wouldn't dare.\" And for a moment he looked so frightening that I couldn't help but believe it \u2014 I couldn't imagine someone brave enough to cross him. \"Alice already saw it, didn't she?\" I guessed. \"That's why the things she says upset you. She knows I'm going to be like you\u2026 someday.\" \"She's wrong. She also saw you dead, but that didn't happen, either.\" \"You'll never catch me betting against Alice.\" We stared at each other for a very long time. It was quiet except for the whirring of the machines, the beeping, the dripping, the ticking of the big clock on the wall. Finally, his expression softened. \"So where does that leave us?\" I wondered. He chuckled humorlessly. \"I believe it's called an impasse.\" I sighed. \"Ouch,\" I muttered. \"How are you feeling?\" he asked, eyeing the button for the nurse. \"I'm fine,\" I lied. \"I don't believe you,\" he said gently. \"I'm not going back to sleep.\" \"You need rest. All this arguing isn't good for you.\" \"So give in,\" I hinted. \"Nice try.\" He reached for the button. \"No!\" He ignored me. \"Yes?\" the speaker on the wall squawked. \"I think we're ready for more pain medication,\" he said calmly, ignoring my furious expression. \"I'll send in the nurse.\" The voice sounded very bored. \"I won't take it,\" I promised. He looked toward the sack of fluids hanging beside my bed. \"I don't think they're going to ask you to swallow anything.\" My heart rate started to climb. He read the fear in my eyes, and sighed in frustration. \"Bella, you're in pain. You need to relax so you can heal. Why are you being so difficult?  They're not going to put any more needles in you now.\" \"I'm not afraid of the needles,\" I mumbled. \"I'm afraid to close my eyes.\" Then he smiled his crooked smile, and took my face between his hands. \"I told you I'm not going anywhere. Don't be afraid. As long as it makes you happy, I'll be here.\" I smiled back, ignoring the ache in my cheeks. \"You're talking about forever, you know.\" \"Oh, you'll get over it \u2014 it's just a crush.\" I shook my head in disbelief\u2014 it made me dizzy. \"I was shocked when Ren\u00e9e swallowed that one. I know you know better.\" \"That's the beautiful thing about being human,\" he told me. \"Things change.\" My eyes narrowed. \"Don't hold your breath.\" He was laughing when the nurse came in, brandishing a syringe. \"Excuse me,\" she said brusquely to Edward. He got up and crossed to the end of the small room, leaning against the wall. He folded his arms and waited. I kept my eyes on him, still apprehensive. He met my gaze calmly. \"Here you go, honey.\" The nurse smiled as she injected the medicine into my tube. \"You'll feel better now.\" \"Thanks,\" I mumbled, unenthusiastic. It didn't take long. I could feel the drowsiness trickling through my bloodstream almost immediately. \"That ought to do it,\" she muttered as my eyelids drooped. She must have left the room, because something cold and smooth touched my face. \"Stay.\" The word was slurred. \"I will,\" he promised. His voice was beautiful, like a lullaby. \"Like I said, as long as it makes you happy\u2026 as long as it's what's best for you.\" I tried to shake my head, but it was too heavy. \"S not the same thing,\" I mumbled. He laughed. \"Don't worry about that now, Bella. You can argue with me when you wake up.\" I think I smiled. '\"Kay.\" I could feel his lips at my ear. \"I love you,\" he whispered. \"Me, too.\" \"I know,\" he laughed quietly. I turned my head slightly\u2026 searching. He knew what I was after. His lips touched mine gently. \"Thanks,\" I sighed. \"Anytime.\" I wasn't really there at all anymore. But I fought against the stupor weakly. There was just one more thing I wanted to tell him. \"Edward?\" I struggled to pronounce his name clearly. \"Yes?\" \"I'm betting on Alice,\" I mumbled. And then the night closed over me.",

            "en": "2      2. EVASION I felt oddly buoyant as I walked from Spanish toward the cafeteria, and it wasn\u2019t just because I was holding hands with the most perfect person on the planet, though that was certainly part of it. Maybe it was the knowledge that my sentence was served and I was a free woman again. Or maybe it wasn\u2019t anything to do with me specifically. Maybe it was the atmosphere of freedom that hung over the entire campus. School was winding down, and, for the senior class especially, there was a perceptible thrill in the air. Freedom was so close it was touchable, taste-able. Signs of it were everywhere. Posters crowded together on the cafeteria walls, and the trashcans wore a colorful skirt of spilled-over fliers: reminders to buy yearbooks, class rings, and announcements; deadlines to order graduation gowns, hats, and tassels; neon-bright sales pitches \u2014 the juniors campaigning for class office; ominous, rose-wreathed advertisements for this year\u2019s prom.  The big dance was this coming weekend, but I had an ironclad promise from Edward that I would not be subjected to that again. After all, I\u2019d already had that human experience. No, it must be my personal freedom that lightened me today. The ending of the school year did not give me the pleasure it seemed to give the other students. Actually, I felt nervous to the point of nausea whenever I thought of it. I tried to not think of it. But it was hard to escape such an omnipresent topic as graduation. \u201cHave you sent your announcements, yet?\u201d Angela asked when Edward and I sat down at our table. She had her light brown hair pulled back into a sloppy ponytail instead of her usual smooth hairdo, and there was a slightly frantic look about her eyes. Alice and Ben were already there, too, on either side of Angela. Ben was intent over a comic book, his glasses sliding down his narrow nose.  Alice was scrutinizing my boring jeans-and-a-t-shirt outfit in a way that made me self-conscious. Probably plotting another makeover. I sighed. My indifferent attitude to fashion was a constant thorn in her side. If I\u2019d allow it, she\u2019d love to dress me every day \u2014 perhaps several times a day \u2014 like some oversized three-dimensional paper doll. \u00a0\u201cNo,\u201d I answered Angela. \u201cThere\u2019s no point, really. Ren\u00e9e knows when I\u2019m graduating. Who else is there?\u201d \u201cHow about you, Alice?\u201d Alice smiled. \u201cAll done.\u201d \u201cLucky you.\u201d Angela sighed. \u201cMy mother has a thousand cousins and she expects me to hand-address one to everybody. I\u2019m going to get carpal tunnel. I can\u2019t put it off any longer and I\u2019m just dreading it.\u201d \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll help you,\u201d I volunteered. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind my awful handwriting.\u201d Charlie would like that. From the corner of my eye, I saw Edward smile. He must like that, too \u2014 me fulfilling Charlie\u2019s conditions without involving werewolves. Angela looked relieved. \u201cThat\u2019s so nice of you. I\u2019ll come over any time you want.\u201d \u201cActually, I\u2019d rather go to your house if that\u2019s okay \u2014 I\u2019m sick of mine. Charlie un-grounded me last night.\u201d I grinned as I announced my good news. \u201cReally?\u201d Angela asked, mild excitement lighting her always-gentle brown eyes. \u201cI thought you said you were in for life.\u201d \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m more surprised than you are. I was sure I would at least have finished high school before he set me free.\u201d \u201cWell, this is great, Bella! We\u2019ll have to go out to celebrate.\u201d \u00a0\u201cYou have no idea how good that sounds.\u201d \u201cWhat should we do?\u201d Alice mused, her face lighting up at the possibilities. Alice\u2019s ideas were usually a little grandiose for me, and I could see it in her eyes now \u2014 the tendency to take things too far kicking into action. \u201cWhatever you\u2019re thinking, Alice, I doubt I\u2019m that free.\u201d \u201cFree is free, right?\u201d she insisted. \u201cI\u2019m sure I still have boundaries \u2014 like the continental U.S., for example.\u201d Angela and Ben laughed, but Alice grimaced in real disappointment. \u201cSo what are we doing tonight?\u201d she persisted. \u201cNothing. Look, let\u2019s give it a couple of days to make sure he wasn\u2019t joking. It\u2019s a school night, anyway.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll celebrate this weekend, then.\u201d Alice\u2019s enthusiasm was impossible to <em>repress</em>. \u00a0\u201cSure,\u201d I said, hoping to placate her. I knew I wasn\u2019t going to do anything too outlandish; it would be safer to take it slow with Charlie. Give him a chance to appreciate how trustworthy and mature I was before I asked for any favors. Angela and Alice started talking about options; Ben joined the conversation, setting his comics aside. My attention drifted. I was surprised to find that the subject of my freedom was suddenly not as gratifying as it had been just a moment ago. While they discussed things to do in Port Angeles or maybe Hoquiam, I began to feel disgruntled. It didn\u2019t take long to determine where my restlessness stemmed from. Ever since I\u2019d said goodbye to Jacob Black in the forest outside my home, I\u2019d been plagued by a persistent, uncomfortable intrusion of a specific mental picture. It popped into my thoughts at regular intervals like some annoying alarm clock set to sound every half hour, filling my head with the image of Jacob\u2019s face crumpled in pain. This was the last memory I had of him. As the disturbing vision struck again, I knew exactly why I was dissatisfied with my liberty. Because it was incomplete. Sure, I was free to go to anywhere I wanted \u2014 except La Push; free to do anything I wanted \u2014 except see Jacob. I frowned at the table. There had to be some kind of middle ground. \u201cAlice? Alice!\u201d  Angela\u2019s voice yanked me from my reverie. She was waving her hand back and forth in front of Alice\u2019s blank, staring face. Alice\u2019s expression was something I recognized \u2014 an expression that sent an automatic shock of panic through my body. The vacant look in her eyes told me that she was seeing something very different from the mundane lunchroom scene that surrounded us, but something that was every bit as real in its own way. Something that was coming, something that would happen soon. I felt the blood slither from my face. Then Edward laughed, a very natural, relaxed sound. Angela and Ben looked toward him, but my eyes were locked on Alice. She jumped suddenly, as if someone had kicked her under the table. \u201cIs it naptime already, Alice?\u201d Edward teased. Alice was herself again. \u201cSorry, I was daydreaming, I guess.\u201d \u201cDaydreaming\u2019s better than facing two more hours of school,\u201d Ben said. Alice threw herself back into the conversation with more animation than before \u2014 just a little bit too much. Once I saw her eyes lock with Edward\u2019s, only for a moment, and then she looked back to Angela before anyone else noticed. Edward was quiet, playing absentmindedly with a strand of my hair. I waited anxiously for a chance to ask Edward what Alice had seen in her vision, but the afternoon passed without one minute of alone time. It felt odd to me, almost deliberate. After lunch, Edward slowed his pace to match Ben\u2019s, talking about some assignment I knew he\u2019d already finished. Then there was always someone else there between classes, though we usually had a few minutes to ourselves. When the final bell rang, Edward struck up a conversation with Mike Newton of all people, falling into step beside him as Mike headed for the parking lot. I trailed behind, letting Edward tow me along. I listened, confused, while Mike answered Edward\u2019s unusually friendly queries. It seemed Mike was having car troubles. \u00a0\u201c. . . but I just replaced the battery,\u201d Mike was saying. His eyes darted ahead and then back to Edward warily. Mystified, just like I was. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s the cables?\u201d Edward offered. \u201cMaybe. I really don\u2019t know anything about cars,\u201d Mike admitted. \u201cI need to have someone look at it, but I can\u2019t afford to take it to Dowling\u2019s.\u201d I opened my mouth to suggest my mechanic, and then snapped it shut again. My mechanic was busy these days \u2014 busy running around as a giant wolf. \u201cI know a few things \u2014 I could take a look, if you like,\u201d Edward offered. \u201cJust let me drop Alice and Bella at home.\u201d Mike and I both stared at Edward with our mouths hanging open. \u201cEr . . . thanks,\u201d Mike mumbled when he recovered. \u201cBut I have to get to work. Maybe some other time.\u201d \u00a0\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d \u201cSee ya.\u201d Mike climbed into his car, shaking his head in disbelief. Edward\u2019s Volvo, with Alice already inside, was just two cars away. \u201cWhat was that about ?\u201d I muttered as Edward held the passenger door for me. \u201cJust being helpful,\u201d Edward answered. And then Alice, waiting in the backseat, was babbling at top speed. \u201cYou\u2019re really not that good a mechanic, Edward. Maybe you should have Rosalie take a look at it tonight, just so you look good if Mike decides to let you help, you know. \u00a0\u00a0Not that it wouldn\u2019t be fun to watch his face if Rosalie showed up to help. But since Rosalie is supposed to be across the country attending college, I guess that\u2019s not the best idea. Too bad. Though I suppose, for Mike\u2019s car, you\u2019ll do. It\u2019s only within the finer tunings of a good Italian sports car that you\u2019re out of your depth. And speaking of Italy and sports cars that I stole there, you still owe me a yellow Porsche. I don\u2019t know that I want to wait for Christmas. . . .\u201d I stopped listening after a minute, letting her quick voice become just a hum in the background as I settled into my patient mode. It looked to me like Edward was trying to avoid my questions. Fine. He would have to be alone with me soon enough. It was only a matter of time. Edward seemed to realize that, too. He dropped Alice at the mouth of the Cullens\u2019 drive as usual, though by this point I half expected him to drive her to the door and walk her in. As she got out, Alice threw a sharp look at his face. Edward seemed completely at ease. \u201cSee you later,\u201d he said. And then, ever so slightly, he nodded. Alice turned to disappear into the trees. He was quiet as he turned the car around and headed back to Forks. I waited, wondering if he would bring it up himself. He didn\u2019t, and this made me tense. What had Alice seen today at lunch? Something he didn\u2019t want to tell me, and I tried to think of a reason why he would keep secrets. Maybe it would be better to prepare myself before I asked. I didn\u2019t want to freak out and have him think I couldn\u2019t handle it, whatever it was. So we were both silent until we got to back to Charlie\u2019s house. \u00a0\u201cLight homework load tonight,\u201d he commented. \u201cMmm,\u201d I assented. \u201cDo you suppose I\u2019m allowed inside again?\u201d \u201cCharlie didn\u2019t throw a fit when you picked me up for school.\u201d But I was sure Charlie was going to turn sulky fast when he got home and found Edward here. Maybe I should make something extra-special for dinner. Inside, I headed up the stairs, and Edward followed. He lounged on my bed and gazed out the window, seeming oblivious to my edginess. I stowed my bag and turned the computer on. There was an unanswered e-mail from my mom to attend to, and she got panicky when I took too long. I drummed my fingers as I waited for my decrepit computer to wheeze awake; they snapped against the desk, staccato and anxious. And then his fingers were on mine, holding them still. \u201cAre we a little impatient today?\u201d he murmured. I looked up, intending to make a sarcastic remark, but his face was closer than I\u2019d expected. His golden eyes were smoldering, just inches away, and his breath was cool against my open lips. I could taste his scent on my tongue. I couldn\u2019t remember the witty response I\u2019d been about to make. I couldn\u2019t remember my name. He didn\u2019t give me a chance to recover. If I had my way, I would spend the majority of my time kissing Edward. There wasn\u2019t anything I\u2019d experienced in my life that compared to the feeling of his cool lips, marble hard but always so gentle, moving with mine. I didn\u2019t often get my way. So it surprised me a little when his fingers braided themselves into my hair, securing my face to his. My arms locked behind his neck, and I wished I was stronger \u2014 strong enough to keep him prisoner here. One hand slid down my back, pressing me tighter against his stone chest. Even through his sweater, his skin was cold enough to make me shiver \u2014 it was a shiver of pleasure, of happiness, but his hands began to loosen in response. I knew I had about three seconds before he would sigh and slide me deftly away, saying something about how we\u2019d risked my life enough for one afternoon. Making the most of my last seconds, I crushed myself closer, molding myself to the shape of him. The tip of my tongue traced the curve of his lower lip; it was as flawlessly smooth as if it had been polished, and the taste \u2014 He pulled my face away from his, breaking my hold with ease \u2014 he probably didn\u2019t even realize that I was using all my strength. He chuckled once, a low, throaty sound. His eyes were bright with the excitement he so rigidly disciplined. \u00a0\u201cAh, Bella.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI\u2019d say I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m not.\u201d \u201cAnd I should feel sorry that you\u2019re not sorry, but I don\u2019t. Maybe I should go sit on the bed.\u201d I exhaled a little dizzily. \u201cIf you think that\u2019s necessary. . . .\u201d  He smiled crookedly and disentangled himself. I shook my head a few times, trying to clear it, and turned back to my computer. It was all warmed up and humming now. Well, not as much humming as groaning. \u201cTell Ren\u00e9e I said hello.\u201d \u201cSure thing.\u201d I scanned through Ren\u00e9e\u2019s e-mail, shaking my head now and then at some of the dippier things she\u2019d done. I was just as entertained and horrified as the first time I\u2019d read this. It was so like my mother to forget exactly how paralyzed she was by heights until she was already strapped to a parachute and a dive instructor. I felt a little frustrated with Phil, her husband of almost two years, for allowing that one. I would have taken better care of her. I knew her so much better. You have to let them go their own way eventually, I reminded myself. You have to let them have their own life. . . . I\u2019d spent most of my life taking care of Ren\u00e9e, patiently guiding her away from her craziest plans, good-naturedly enduring the ones I couldn\u2019t talk her out of. I\u2019d always been indulgent with my mom, amused by her, even a little condescending to her. I saw her cornucopia of mistakes and laughed privately to myself. Scatterbrained Ren\u00e9e. I was a very different person from my mother. Someone thoughtful and cautious. The responsible one, the grown-up. That\u2019s how I saw myself. That was the person I knew. With the blood still pounding in my head from Edward\u2019s kiss, I couldn\u2019t help but think of my mother\u2019s most life-altering mistake. Silly and romantic, getting married fresh out of high school to a man she barely knew, then producing me a year later. She\u2019d always promised me that she had no regrets, that I was the best gift her life had ever given her. And yet she\u2019d drilled it into me over and over \u2014 smart people took marriage seriously. Mature people went to college and started careers before they got deeply involved in a relationship. She knew I would never be as thoughtless and goofy and small-town as she\u2019d been. . . . I gritted my teeth and tried to concentrate as I answered her letter. Then I hit her parting line and remembered why I\u2019d neglected to write sooner. You haven\u2019t said anything about Jacob in a long time, she\u2019d written. What\u2019s he up to these days? Charlie was prompting her, I was sure. I sighed and typed quickly, tucking the answer to her question between two less sensitive paragraphs. Jacob is fine, I guess. I don\u2019t see him much; he spends most of his time with a pack of his friends down at La Push these days. Smiling wryly to myself, I added Edward\u2019s greeting and hit \u201csend.\u201d I didn\u2019t realize that Edward was standing silently behind me again until after I\u2019d turned off the computer and shoved away from the desk. I was about to scold him for reading over my shoulder when I realized that he wasn\u2019t paying any attention to me. He was examining a flat black box with wires curling crookedly away from the main square in a way that didn\u2019t look healthy for whatever it was. After a second, I recognized the car stereo Emmett, Rosalie, and Jasper had given me for my last birthday. I\u2019d forgotten about the birthday presents hiding under a growing pile of dust on the floor of my closet. \u00a0\u201cWhat did you do to this?\u201d he asked in a horrorstruck voice. \u201cIt didn\u2019t want to come out of the dashboard.\u201d \u201cSo you felt the need to torture it?\u201d \u201cYou know how I am with tools. No pain was inflicted intentionally.\u201d He shook his head, his face a mask of faux tragedy. \u201cYou killed it.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cOh, well.\u201d \u201cIt would hurt their feelings if they saw this,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess it\u2019s a good thing that you\u2019ve been on house arrest. I\u2019ll have to get another one in place before they notice.\u201d \u201cThanks, but I don\u2019t need a fancy stereo.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not for your sake that I\u2019m going to replace it.\u201d I sighed. \u201cYou didn\u2019t get much good out of your birthday presents last year,\u201d he said in a disgruntled voice. Suddenly, he was fanning himself with a stiff rectangle of paper. I didn\u2019t answer, for fear my voice would shake. My disastrous eighteenth birthday \u2014 with all its far-reaching consequences \u2014 wasn\u2019t something I cared to remember, and I was surprised that he would bring it up. He was even more sensitive about it than I was. \u201cDo you realize these are about to expire?\u201d he asked, holding the paper out to me. It was another present \u2014 the voucher for airplane tickets that Esme and Carlisle had given me so that I could visit Ren\u00e9e in Florida. I took a deep breath and answered in a flat voice. \u201cNo. I\u2019d forgotten all about them, actually.\u201d His expression was carefully bright and positive; there was no trace of any deep emotion as he continued. \u201cWell, we still have a little time. You\u2019ve been liberated . . . and we have no plans this weekend, as you refuse to go to the prom with me.\u201d He grinned. \u201cWhy not celebrate your freedom this way?\u201d I gasped. \u201cBy going to Florida?\u201d \u201cYou did say something about the continental U.S. being allowable.\u201d I glared at him, suspicious, trying to understand where this had come from. \u201cWell?\u201d he demanded. \u201cAre we going to see Ren\u00e9e or not?\u201d \u201cCharlie will never allow it.\u201d \u201cCharlie can\u2019t keep you from visiting your mother. She still has primary custody.\u201d \u201cNobody has custody of me. I\u2019m an adult.\u201d He flashed a brilliant smile. \u201cExactly.\u201d I thought it over for a short minute before deciding that it wasn\u2019t worth the fight. Charlie would be furious \u2014 not that I was going to see Ren\u00e9e, but that Edward was going with me. Charlie wouldn\u2019t speak to me for months, and I\u2019d probably end up grounded again. It was definitely smarter not to even bring it up. Maybe in a few weeks, as a graduation favor or something. But the idea of seeing my mother now , not weeks from now, was hard to resist. It had been so long since I\u2019d seen Ren\u00e9e. And even longer since I\u2019d seen her under pleasant circumstances. The last time I\u2019d been with her in Phoenix, I\u2019d spent the whole time in a hospital bed. The last time she\u2019d come here, I\u2019d been more or less catatonic. Not exactly the best memories to leave her with. And maybe, if she saw how happy I was with Edward, she would tell Charlie to ease up. Edward scrutinized my face while I deliberated. I sighed. \u201cNot this weekend.\u201d \u201cWhy not?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to fight with Charlie. Not so soon after he\u2019s forgiven me.\u201d His eyebrows pulled together. \u201cI think this weekend is perfect,\u201d he muttered. I shook my head. \u201cAnother time.\u201d \u00a0\u201cYou aren\u2019t the only one who\u2019s been trapped in this house, you know.\u201d He frowned at me. Suspicion returned. This kind of behavior was unlike him. He was always so impossibly selfless; I knew it was making me spoiled. \u201cYou can go anywhere you want,\u201d I pointed out. \u201cThe outside world holds no interest for me without you.\u201d I rolled my eyes at the hyperbole. \u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s take the outside world slowly, all right? For example, we could start with a movie in Port Angeles. . . .\u201d He groaned. \u201cNever mind. We\u2019ll talk about it later.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s nothing left to talk about.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cOkay, then, new subject,\u201d I said. I\u2019d almost forgotten my worries about this afternoon \u2014 had that been his intention? \u201cWhat did Alice see today at lunch?\u201d My eyes were fixed on his face as I spoke, measuring his reaction. His expression was composed; there was only the slightest hardening of his topaz eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s been seeing Jasper in a strange place, somewhere in the southwest, she thinks, near his former . . . family. But he has no conscious intentions to go back.\u201d He sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s got her worried.\u201d \u00a0\u201cOh.\u201d That was nothing close to what I\u2019d been expecting. But of course it made sense that Alice would be watching out for Jasper\u2019s future. He was her soul mate, her true other half, though they weren\u2019t as flamboyant about their relationship as Rosalie and Emmett were. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me before?\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t realize you\u2019d noticed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably nothing important, in any case.\u201d My imagination was sadly out of control. I\u2019d taken a perfectly normal afternoon and twisted it until it looked like Edward was going out of his way to keep things from me. I needed therapy. We went downstairs to work on our homework, just in case Charlie showed up early. Edward finished in minutes; I slogged laboriously through my calculus until I decided it was time to fix Charlie\u2019s dinner. Edward helped, making faces every so often at the raw ingredients \u2014 human food was mildly repulsive to him. I made stroganoff from Grandma Swan\u2019s recipe, because I was sucking up. It wasn\u2019t one of my favorites, but it would please Charlie. Charlie seemed to already be in a good mood when he got home. He didn\u2019t even go out of his way to be rude to Edward. Edward excused himself from eating with us, as usual. The sound of the nightly news drifted from the front room, but I doubted Edward was really watching. After forcing down three helpings, Charlie kicked his feet up on the spare chair and folded his hands contentedly across his distended stomach. \u00a0\u201cThat was great, Bells.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m glad you liked it. How was work?\u201d He\u2019d been eating with too much concentration for me to make conversation before. \u201cSort of slow. Well, dead slow really. Mark and I played cards for a good part of the afternoon,\u201d he admitted with a grin. \u201cI won, nineteen hands to seven. And then I was on the phone with Billy for a while.\u201d I tried to keep my expression the same. \u201cHow is he?\u201d \u201cGood, good. His joints are bothering him a little.\u201d \u00a0\u201cOh. That\u2019s too bad.\u201d \u201cYeah. He invited us down to visit this weekend. He was thinking of having the Clearwaters and the Uleys over too. Sort of a playoff party. . . .\u201d \u201cHuh,\u201d was my genius response. But what could I say? I knew I wouldn\u2019t be allowed to hit a werewolf party, even with parental supervision. I wondered if Edward would have a problem with Charlie hanging out in La Push. Or would he suppose that, since Charlie was mostly spending time with Billy, who was only human, my father wouldn\u2019t be in danger? I got up and piled the dishes together without looking at Charlie. I dumped them into the sink and started the water. Edward appeared silently and grabbed a dishtowel. Charlie sighed and gave up for the moment, though I imagined he would revisit the subject when we were alone again. He heaved himself to his feet and headed for the TV, just like every other night. \u201cCharlie,\u201d Edward said in a conversational tone. Charlie stopped in the middle of his little kitchen. \u201cYeah?\u201d \u201cDid Bella ever tell you that my parents gave her airplane tickets on her last birthday, so that she could visit Ren\u00e9e?\u201d I dropped the plate I was scrubbing. It glanced off the counter and clattered noisily to the floor. It didn\u2019t break, but it spattered the room, and all three of us, with soapy water. Charlie didn\u2019t even seem to notice. \u201cBella?\u201d he asked in a stunned voice.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  I kept my eyes on the plate as I retrieved it. \u201cYeah, they did.\u201d Charlie swallowed loudly, and then his eyes narrowed as he turned back to Edward. \u201cNo, she never mentioned it.\u201d \u201cHmm,\u201d Edward murmured. \u201cWas there a reason you brought it up?\u201d Charlie asked in a hard voice. Edward shrugged. \u201cThey\u2019re about to expire. I think it might hurt Esme\u2019s feelings if Bella doesn\u2019t use her gift. Not that she\u2019d say anything.\u201d I stared at Edward in disbelief. Charlie thought for a minute. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a good idea for you to visit your mom, Bella. She\u2019d love that. I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t say anything about this, though.\u201d \u201cI forgot,\u201d I admitted. He frowned. \u201cYou forgot that someone gave you plane tickets?\u201d \u201cMmm,\u201d I murmured vaguely, and turned back to the sink. \u201cI noticed that you said they\u2019re about to expire, Edward,\u201d Charlie went on. \u201cHow many tickets did your\u00a0 parents give her?\u201d \u201cJust one for her . . . and one for me.\u201d The plate I dropped this time landed in the sink, so it didn\u2019t make as much noise. I could easily hear the sharp huff as my father exhaled. The blood rushed into my face, fueled by irritation and chagrin. Why was Edward doing this? I glared at the bubbles in the sink, panicking. \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s out of the question!\u201d Charlie was abruptly in a rage, shouting the words. \u201cWhy?\u201d Edward asked, his voice saturated with innocent surprise. \u201cYou just said it was a good idea for her to see her mother.\u201d Charlie ignored him. \u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere with him, young lady!\u201d he yelled. I spun around and he was jabbing a finger at me. Anger pulsed through me automatically, an instinctive reaction to his tone.  \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not a child, Dad. And I\u2019m not grounded anymore, remember?\u201d \u201cOh yes, you are. Starting now.\u201d \u201cFor what?!\u201d \u201cBecause I said so.\u201d \u201cDo I need to remind you that I\u2019m a legal adult, Charlie?\u201d \u201cThis is my house \u2014 you follow my rules!\u201d My glare turned icy. \u201cIf that\u2019s how you want it. Do you want me to move out tonight? Or can I have a few days to pack?\u201d Charlie\u2019s face went bright red. I instantly felt horrible for playing the move-out card. I took a deep breath and tried to make my tone more reasonable. \u201cI\u2019ll do my time without complaining when I\u2019ve done something wrong, Dad, but I\u2019m not going to put up with your prejudices.\u201d He sputtered, but managed nothing coherent. \u201cNow, I know that you know that I have every right to see Mom for the weekend. You can\u2019t honestly tell me you\u2019d object to the plan if I was going with Alice or Angela.\u201d \u201cGirls,\u201d he grunted, with a nod. \u201cWould it bother you if I took Jacob?\u201d I\u2019d only picked the name because I knew of my father\u2019s preference for Jacob, but I quickly wished I hadn\u2019t; Edward\u2019s teeth clenched together with an audible snap. My father struggled to compose himself before he answered. \u201cYes,\u201d he said in an unconvincing voice. \u201cThat would bother me.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re a rotten liar, Dad.\u201d \u201cBella \u2014\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m headed off to Vegas to be a showgirl or anything. I\u2019m going to see Mom ,\u201d I reminded him. \u201cShe\u2019s just as much my parental authority as you are.\u201d He threw me a withering look. \u201cAre you implying something about Mom\u2019s ability to look after me?\u201d Charlie flinched at the threat implicit in my question. \u201cYou\u2019d better hope I don\u2019t mention this to her,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019d better not,\u201d he warned. \u201cI\u2019m not happy about this, Bella.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for you to be upset.\u201d He rolled his eyes, but I could tell the storm was over. I turned to pull the plug out of the sink. \u201cSo my homework is done, your dinner is done, the dishes are done, and I\u2019m not grounded. I\u2019m going out. I\u2019ll be back before ten-thirty.\u201d \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d His face, almost back to normal, flushed light red again. \u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d I admitted. \u201cI\u2019ll keep it within a ten-mile radius, though. Okay?\u201d He grunted something that did not sound like approval, and stalked out of the room. Naturally, as soon as I\u2019d won the fight, I began to feel guilty. \u201cWe\u2019re going out?\u201d Edward asked, his voice low but enthusiastic. I turned to glower at him. \u201cYes. I think I\u2019d like to speak to you alone .\u201d He didn\u2019t look as apprehensive as I thought he should. I waited to begin until we were safely in his car. \u201cWhat was that ?\u201d I demanded. \u201cI know you want to see your mother, Bella \u2014 you\u2019ve been talking about her in your sleep. Worrying actually.\u201d \u201cI have?\u201d He nodded. \u201cBut, clearly, you were too much of a coward to deal with Charlie, so I interceded on your behalf.\u201d \u201cInterceded? You threw me to the sharks!\u201d He rolled his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t think you were in any danger.\u201d \u201cI told you I didn\u2019t want to fight with Charlie.\u201d \u201cNobody said that you had to.\u201d I glowered at him. \u201cI can\u2019t help myself when he gets all bossy like that \u2014 my natural teenage instincts overpower me.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cWell, that\u2019s not my fault.\u201d I stared at him, speculating. He didn\u2019t seem to notice. His face was serene as he gazed out the windshield. Something was off, but I couldn\u2019t put my finger on it. Or maybe it was just my imagination again, running wild like it had this afternoon. \u00a0\u201cDoes this sudden urge to see Florida have anything to do with the party at Billy\u2019s place?\u201d His jaw flexed. \u201cNothing at all. It wouldn\u2019t matter if you were here or on the other side of the world, you still wouldn\u2019t be going.\u201d It was just like with Charlie before \u2014 just like being treated as a misbehaving child. I gritted my teeth together so I wouldn\u2019t start shouting. I didn\u2019t want to fight with Edward, too. Edward sighed, and when he spoke his voice was warm and velvet again. \u201cSo what do you want to do tonight?\u201d he asked. \u201cCan we go to your house? I haven\u2019t seen Esme in so long.\u201d He smiled. \u201cShe\u2019ll like that. Especially when she hears what we\u2019re doing this weekend.\u201d I groaned in defeat. We didn\u2019t stay out late, as I\u2019d promised. I was not surprised to see the lights still on when we pulled up in front of the house \u2014 I knew Charlie would be waiting to yell at me some more. \u201cYou\u2019d better not come inside,\u201d I said. \u201cIt will only make things worse.\u201d \u201cHis thoughts are relatively calm,\u201d Edward teased. His expression made me wonder if there was some additional joke I was missing. The corners of his mouth twitched, fighting a smile. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later,\u201d I muttered glumly. He laughed and kissed the top of my head. \u201cI\u2019ll be back when Charlie\u2019s snoring.\u201d The TV was loud when I got inside. I briefly considered trying to sneak past him. \u201cCould you come in here, Bella?\u201d Charlie called, sinking that plan. My feet dragged as I took the five necessary steps. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Dad?\u201d \u201cDid you have a nice time tonight?\u201d he asked. He seemed ill at ease. I looked for hidden meanings in his words before I answered. \u201cYes,\u201d I said hesitantly. \u00a0\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d I shrugged. \u201cHung out with Alice and Jasper. Edward beat Alice at chess, and then I played Jasper. He buried me.\u201d I smiled. Edward and Alice playing chess was one of the funniest things I\u2019d ever seen. They\u2019d sat there nearly motionless, staring at the board, while Alice foresaw the moves he would make and he picked the moves she would make in return out of her head. They played most of the game in their minds; I think they\u2019d each moved two pawns when Alice suddenly flicked her king over and surrendered. It took all of three minutes. Charlie hit the mute button \u2014 an unusual action. \u201cLook, there\u2019s something I need to say.\u201d He frowned, looking very uncomfortable. I sat still, waiting. He met my gaze for a second before shifting his eyes to the floor. He didn\u2019t say anything more. \u201cWhat is it, Dad?\u201d He sighed. \u201cI\u2019m not good at this kind of thing. I don\u2019t know how to start. . . .\u201d I waited again. \u201cOkay, Bella. Here\u2019s the thing.\u201d He got up from the couch and started pacing back and forth across the room, looking as his feet all the time. \u201cYou and Edward seem pretty serious, and there are some things that you need to be careful about. I know you\u2019re an adult now, but you\u2019re still young, Bella, and there are a lot of important things you need to know when you . . . well, when you\u2019re physically involved with \u2014\u201d \u201cOh, please, please no!\u201d I begged, jumping to my feet. \u201cPlease tell me you are not trying to have a sex talk with me, Charlie.\u201d He glared at the floor. \u201cI am your father. I have responsibilities. Remember, I\u2019m just as embarrassed as you are.\u201d \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s humanly possible. Anyway, Mom beat you to the punch about ten years ago.\u00a0 You\u2019re off the hook.\u201d \u201cTen years ago you didn\u2019t have a boyfriend,\u201d he muttered unwillingly. I could tell he was battling with his desire to drop the subject. We were both standing up, looking at the floor, and facing away from each other. \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t think the essentials have changed that much,\u201d I mumbled, and my face had to be as red as his. This was beyond the seventh circle of Hades; even worse was realizing that Edward had known this was coming. No wonder he\u2019d seemed so smug in the car. \u00a0\u201cJust tell me that you two are being responsible,\u201d Charlie pled, obviously wishing a pit would open in the floor so that he could fall in. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Dad, it\u2019s not like that.\u201d \u201cNot that I don\u2019t trust you, Bella, but I know you don\u2019t want to tell me anything about this, and you know I don\u2019t really want to hear it. I will try to be open-minded, though. I know the times have changed.\u201d I laughed awkwardly. \u201cMaybe the times have, but Edward is very old-fashioned. You have nothing to worry about.\u201d Charlie sighed. \u201cSure he is,\u201d he muttered. \u201cUgh!\u201d I groaned. \u201cI really wish you were not forcing me to say this out loud, Dad. Really. But . . . I am a . . . virgin, and I have no immediate plans to change that status.\u201d We both cringed, but then Charlie\u2019s face smoothed out. He seemed to believe me. \u201cCan I go to bed, now? Please. \u201d \u201cIn a minute,\u201d he said. \u201cAw, please, Dad? I\u2019m begging you.\u201d \u201cThe embarrassing part\u2019s over, I promise,\u201d he assured me. I shot a glance at him, and was grateful to see that he looked more relaxed, that his face was back to its regular color. He sank down onto the sofa, sighing with relief that he was past the sex speech. \u201cWhat now?\u201d \u201cI just wanted to know how the balance thing is coming along.\u201d \u201cOh. Good, I guess. I made plans with Angela today. I\u2019m going to help her with her graduation announcements. Just us girls.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s nice. And what about Jake?\u201d I sighed. \u201cI haven\u2019t figured that one out yet, Dad.\u201d \u201cKeep trying, Bella. I know you\u2019ll do the right thing. You\u2019re a good person.\u201d Nice. So if I didn\u2019t figure out some way to make things right with Jacob, then I was a bad person? That was below the belt. \u00a0\u201cSure, sure,\u201d I agreed. The automatic response almost made me smile \u2014 it was something I\u2019d picked up from Jacob. I even said it in the same patronizing tone he used with his own father. Charlie grinned and turned the sound back on. He slumped lower into the cushions, pleased with his night\u2019s work. I could tell he would be up with the game for a while. \u201c\u2019Night, Bells.\u201d \u201cSee you in the morning!\u201d I sprinted for the stairs. Edward was long gone and he wouldn\u2019t be back until Charlie was asleep \u2014 he was probably out hunting or something to pass the time \u2014 so I was in no hurry to undress for bed. I wasn\u2019t in the mood to be alone, but I certainly wasn\u2019t going to go back downstairs to hang out with my Dad, just in case he thought of some topic of sex education that he hadn\u2019t touched on before; I shuddered. So, thanks to Charlie, I was wound up and anxious.  My homework was done and I didn\u2019t feel mellow enough for reading or just listening to music. I considered calling Ren\u00e9e with the news of my visit, but then I realized that it was three hours later in Florida, and she would be asleep.  I could call Angela, I supposed. But suddenly I knew that it wasn\u2019t Angela that I wanted to talk to. That I needed to talk to. I stared at the blank black window, biting my lip. I don\u2019t know how long I stood there weighing the pros against the cons \u2014 doing the right thing by Jacob, seeing my closest friend again, being a good person, versus making Edward furious with me. Ten minutes maybe. Long enough to decide that the pros were valid while the cons were not. Edward was only concerned about my safety, and I knew that there was really no problem on that count. The phone wasn\u2019t any help; Jacob had refused to answer my phone calls since Edward\u2019s return. Besides, I needed to see him \u2014 see him smiling again the way he used to. I needed to replace that awful last memory of his face warped and twisted by pain if I was ever going to have any peace of mind. I had an hour probably. I could make a quick run down to La Push and be back before Edward realized I had gone. It was past my curfew, but would Charlie really care about that when Edward wasn\u2019t involved? One way to find out. I grabbed my jacket and shoved my arms through the sleeves as I ran down the stairs. Charlie looked up from the game, instantly suspicious. \u201cYou care if I go see Jake tonight?\u201d I asked breathlessly. \u201cI won\u2019t stay long.\u201d As soon as I said Jake\u2019s name, Charlie\u2019s expression relaxed into a smug smile. He didn\u2019t seem surprised at all that his lecture had taken effect so quickly. \u201cSure, kid. No problem. Stay as long as you like.\u201d \u201cThanks, Dad,\u201d I said as I darted out the door. Like any fugitive, I couldn\u2019t help looking over my shoulder a few times while I jogged to my truck, but the night was so black that there really was no point. I had to feel my way along the side of the truck to the handle. My eyes were just beginning to adjust as I shoved my keys in the ignition. I twisted them hard to the left, but instead of roaring deafeningly to life, the engine just clicked. I tried it again with the same results. And then a small motion in my peripheral vision made me jump. \u201cGah!\u201d I gasped in shock when I saw that I was not alone in the cab. Edward sat very still, a faint bright spot in the darkness, only his hands moving as he turned a mysterious black object around and around. He stared at the object as he spoke. \u201cAlice called,\u201d he murmured. Alice! Damn. I\u2019d forgotten to account for her in my plans. He must have her watching me. \u201cShe got nervous when your future rather abruptly disappeared five minutes ago.\u201d My eyes, already wide with surprise, popped wider. \u201cBecause she can\u2019t see the wolves, you know,\u201d he explained in the same low murmur. \u201cHad you forgotten that? When you decide to mingle your fate with theirs, you disappear, too. You couldn\u2019t know that part, I realize that. But can you understand why that might make me a little . . . anxious? Alice saw you disappear, and she couldn\u2019t even tell if you\u2019d come home or not. Your future got lost, just like theirs. \u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re not sure why this is. Some natural defense they\u2019re born with?\u201d He spoke as if he were talking to himself now, still looking at the piece of my truck\u2019s engine as he twirled it in his hands. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t seem entirely likely, since I haven\u2019t had any trouble reading their thoughts. The Blacks\u2019 at least. Carlisle theorizes that it\u2019s because their lives are so ruled by their transformations. It\u2019s more an involuntary reaction than a decision. Utterly unpredictable, and it changes everything about them. In that instant when they shift from one form to the other, they don\u2019t really even exist. The future can\u2019t hold them. . . .\u201d I listened to his musing in stony silence. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll put your car back together in time for school, in case you\u2019d like to drive yourself,\u201d he assured me after a minute. With my lips mashed together, I retrieved my keys and stiffly climbed out of the truck. \u201cShut your window if you want me to stay away tonight. I\u2019ll understand,\u201d he whispered just before I slammed the door. I stomped into the house, slamming that door, too. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Charlie demanded from the couch. \u201cTruck won\u2019t start,\u201d I growled. \u00a0\u201cWant me to look at it?\u201d \u201cNo. I\u2019ll try it in the morning.\u201d \u00a0\u201cWant to use my car?\u201d I wasn\u2019t supposed to drive his police cruiser. Charlie must be really desperate to get me to La Push. Nearly as desperate as I was. \u201cNo. I\u2019m tired,\u201d I grumbled. \u201c\u2019Night.\u201d I stamped my way up the stairs, and went straight to my window. I shoved the metal frame roughly \u2014 it crashed shut and the glass trembled. I stared at the shivering black glass for a long moment, until it was still. Then I sighed, and opened the window as wide as it would go.",
