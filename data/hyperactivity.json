            "en": "Too much TV psychologically harms children: study        WASHINGTON (AFP) \u2013 Hiding the TV remote and games console controller is a good thing to do to kids if it's the only way to limit the time they spend in front of a screen, according to a study published Monday. The study, conducted by researchers from the University of Bristol, found that youngsters who spend hours each day in front of the TV or games console have more psychological difficulties like problems relating to peers, emotional issues, <em>hyperactivity</em> or conduct challenges, than those who don't. And contrary to what earlier studies have indicated, the negative impact of screen time was not remedied by increasing a child's physical activity levels, says the study, published in the US journal Pediatrics. The researchers got 1,013 children between the ages of 10 and 11 to self-report average daily hours spent watching television or playing -- not doing homework -- on a computer. Responses ranged from zero to around five hours per day. The children also completed a 25-point questionnaire to assess their psychological state, and the time they spent in moderate to vigorous activity was measured using a device called an accelerometer, which was worn around the waist for seven days. The researchers found that children who spent two hours or more a day watching television or playing on a computer were more likely to get high scores on the questionnaire, indicating they had more psychological difficulties than kids who did not spend a lot of time in front of a screen. Even children who were physically active but spent more than two hours a day in front of a screen were at increased risk of psychological difficulties, indicating that screen time might be the chief culprit. Earlier studies have found that while more time spent in front of a screen led to lower well-being, physical activity improved one's state of mind. That led researchers to believe that upping physical activity levels could counteract the negative impact of watching TV or playing on the computer. And many parents and children think that spending a lot of time on the computer or in front of the television is OK if it's part of a \"balanced lifestyle\", the study in Pediatrics says. \"Excessive use of electronic media is not a concern if children are physically active,\" the study says. But its findings indicate that might not be the case, and the researchers advise parents to limit their children's computer use and TV viewing time to ensure their \"optimal well-being.\"",

            "en": "Back To School - Kids, Ask Your Teachers Again If You Can Use Pen This Year         There is no safe exposure to lead. A report by the EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) in this week's edition of the Lancet reiterates this not so well known or publicized fact. Maybe pencils should be replaced by pens in schools?   Dr.Philippe Grandjean, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark and Harvard School of Public Health, Boston states: We now know that lead exposure increases the risk of diminished intelligence, attention deficit <em>hyperactivity</em> disorder (ADHD), school failure, and criminal behaviour... EFSA also emphasises that lead is associated with ailments that are common in elderly people, such as hypertension, renal dysfunction, and neurocognitive decline, possibly at exposure levels only slightly above those that affect brain development in children. Previously, there has been a lack of sufficient evidence proving that any level of lead exposure can potentially cause damage.  Grandjean is convinced that current World Health Organization and EFSA laws regarding lead levels in drinking water, air and food will have to be revised and reviewed immediately.  Aside, the colossal lead industry has always been willing to control lead pollution, but has refrained due to the lack of undeniable evidence that these wastes are extremely harmful. To date, this evidence has been slow in coming.  Regulatory strategies need to be revised in view of new scientific knowledge, but the insights we have gained should also be applied to a wider perspective beyond lead as a single toxicant. Before the ESFA report, absence of evidence was often considered to be evidence of absence of adverse effects. So, a chemical hazard was innocent until proven otherwise. Although we now know better, a whole generation of children paid the price for us to obtain insights into lead pollution. Future risk assessments should not ignore risks of low-level toxicity in susceptible populations because convincing evidence is not available. \"Even low-dose lead exposure is hazardous\" Philippe Grandjean The Lancet, Volume 376, Issue 9744, Pages 855 - 856, 11 September 2010 doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60745-3  Written by: Sy Kraft, B.A. - Journalism - California State University, Northridge (CSUN)  Copyright: Medical News Today",

            "en": "Teens With Psychosocial Disorders Prone to Internet Addiction         By: Madeline Ellis Published: Thursday, 8 October 2009 In recent years, there has been an explosion of Internet use, and it\u2019s easy to understand why. The Internet provides affordable up-to-date information on almost any topic imaginable, around-the-clock entertainment, social networking sites that allow for both public and anonymous communication, and email or online chat that lets us keep in contact with family and friends, even if they\u2019re in another time zone. Most people are able to integrate online time into their lives in a balanced healthy manner, but others develop a stronger dependency, often replacing work, school, friends and even family with countless hours surfing the Web, instant messaging and blogging, or playing Internet video games. In fact, it is estimated that as many as 10 percent of Internet users may be considered addicted. Experts say that people who abuse the Internet are typically struggling with other problems, like anxiety or depression, and new research lends credence to that theory. To access the risk factors for Internet addiction, Cheng-Fang Yen, MD, PhD, of Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital in Taiwan, and colleagues conducted a prospective study of 2,293 seventh-graders, whose average age was 12, from 10 junior high schools in southern Taiwan in September of 2005. The students were asked to fill out questionnaires that assessed whether they had attention-deficit <em>hyperactivity</em> disorder (ADHD), depression, social phobia or abnormal feelings of hostility. Then, 6, 12 and 24 months later, they were asked about their Internet usage, including the number of hours they spent on the Internet and the sorts of sites they frequented.  After two years, roughly 11 percent of the students were addicted to the Internet. Males, those who spent more than 20 hours a week on the Internet and teens who played online games were more likely to be deemed addicted. But the greatest risk factors were found to be ADHD and hostility. Boys and girls with ADHD had a 72 percent increased risk of developing unhealthy dependence on the Internet and those who exhibited significant hostility had a 67 percent increased risk. Girls with social phobias and those suffering depression were also at greater risk, though these factors did not affect boys. Michael Gilbert, senior fellow at the Center for the Digital Future at University of Southern California's Annenberg School for Communication, says it makes perfect sense why the Internet would appeal to children with these issues. \u201cIf you have a child that is hyperactive, the Internet can move at their pace. If you have a child that is depressed or has social phobia, they can get in touch with other kids dealing with the same kinds of issues,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can go into artificial worlds, like \u2018Second Life,\u2019 where they can live out fantasies or take on different personas. For kids who have anger or hostility, the Internet gives them a chance to play out their aggression there.\u201d The study authors say that because computer use is a way of life in the United States, the potential exists for childhood computer addiction to become a major public health problem, a sentiment echoed by the authors of an editorial accompanying the study in the October Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine. \u201cWoven as it is into the fabric of today\u2019s society, the potential for Internet use to lead to overuse and ultimately to addiction is concerning,\u201d wrote Drs. Dimitri A. Christakis and Megan A. Moreno of the University of Washington in Seattle. As the Internet becomes more intertwined in everyday life, eliminating its use is unrealistic, making prevention all the more critical. Experts say parents of teens should monitor the time their children spend on the Internet and the sites they visit and pediatricians and mental health professionals should ask their teenage patients about their Internet usage. This is especially important for children with mental health conditions. Internet addiction is not currently recognized as a separate disorder by the American Psychiatric Association. There is debate about whether to include Internet addiction as a separate illness in the next edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, due in 2012, which determines which mental illnesses are covered by insurance.",
