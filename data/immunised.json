Red Nose Day money in Africa has educated people about HIV and AIDS, taught women to read, <em>immunised</em> children and helped people rebuild their communities. Across the UK it has helped disabled people challenge prejudice and discrimination, supported older people in their fight to get their rights recognised and provided escape routes for women living with domestic violence.",
