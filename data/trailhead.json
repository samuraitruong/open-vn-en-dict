            "en": "7 REPETITION        8. ADRENALINE \"Okay, where's your clutch?\" I pointed to the lever on my left handlebar. Letting go of the grip was a mistake. The heavy bike wobbled underneath me, threatening to knock me sidewise. I grabbed the handle again, trying to hold it straight. \"Jacob, it won't stay up,\u201dI complained. \"It will when you're moving,\u201dhe promised. \"Now where's your brake?\" \"Behind my right foot.\" \"Wrong.\" He grabbed my right hand and curled my fingers around the lever over the throttle. \"But you said\u2014\u201d \"This is the brake you want. Don't use the back brake now, that's for later, when you know what you're doing.\" \"That doesn't sound right,\u201dI said suspiciously. \"Aren't both brakes kind of important?\" \"Forget the back brake, okay? Here\u2014\u201dHe wrapped his hand around mine and made me squeeze the lever down. \"That is how you brake. Don't forget.\u201dHe squeezed my hand another time. \"Fine,\u201dI agreed. \"Throttle?\" I twisted the right grip. \"Gearshift?\" I nudged it with my left calf. \"Very good. I think you've got all the parts down. Now you just have to get it moving.\" \"Uh-huh,\u201dI muttered, afraid to say more. My stomach was contorting strangely and I thought my voice might crack. I was terrified. I tried to tell myself that the fear was pointless. I'd already lived through the worst thing possible. In comparison with that, why should anything frighten me now? I should be able to look death in the face and laugh. My stomach wasn't buying it. I stared down the long stretch of dirt road, bordered by thick misty green on every side. The road was sandy and damp. Better than mud. \"I want you to hold down the clutch,\u201dJacob instructed. I wrapped my fingers around the clutch. \"Now this is crucial, Bella,\u201dJacob stressed. \"Don't let go of that, okay? I want you to pretend that I've handed you a live grenade. The pin is out and you are holding down the spoon.\" I squeezed tighter. \"Good. Do you think you can kick-start it?\" \"If I move my foot, I will fall over,\u201dI told him through gritted teeth, my fingers tight around my live grenade. \"Okay, I'll do it. Don't let go of the clutch.\" He took a step back, and then suddenly slammed his foot down on the pedal. There was a short ripping noise, and the force of his thrust rocked the bike. I started to fall sideways, but Jake caught the bike before it knocked me to the ground. \"Steady there,\u201dhe encouraged. \"Do you still have the clutch?\" \"Yes,\u201dI gasped. \"Plant your feet\u2014I'm going to try again.\u201dBut he put his hand on the back of the seat, too, just to be safe. It took four more kicks before the ignition caught. I could feel the bike rumbling beneath me like an angry animal. I gripped the clutch until my fingers ached. \"Try out the throttle,\u201dhe suggested. \"Very lightly. And don't let go of the clutch.\" Hesitantly, I twisted the right handle. Though the movement was tiny, the bike snarled beneath me. It sounded angry and hungry now. Jacob smiled in deep satisfaction. \"Do you remember how to put it into first gear?\u201dhe asked. \"Yes.\" \"Well, go ahead and do it.\" \"Okay.\" He waited for a few seconds. \"Left foot,\u201dhe prompted. \"I know,\u201dI said, taking a deep breath. \"Are you sure you want to do this?\u201dJacob asked. \"You look scared.\" \"I'm fine,\u201dI snapped. I kicked the gearshift down one notch. \"Very good,\u201dhe praised me. \"Now, very gently, ease up on the clutch.\" He took a step away from the bike. \"You want me to let go of the grenade?\u201dI asked in disbelief. No wonder he was moving back. \"That's how you move, Bella. Just do it little by little.\" As I began to loosen my grip, I was shocked to be interrupted by a voice that did not belong to the boy standing next to me. \"This is reckless and childish and idiotic, Bella,\u201dthe velvet voice fumed. \"Oh!\u201dI gasped, and my hand fell off the clutch. The bike bucked under me, yanking me forward and then collapsing to the ground half on top of me. The growling engine choked to a stop. \"Bella?\u201dJacob jerked the heavy bike off me with ease. \"Are you hurt?\" But I wasn't listening. \"I told you so,\u201dthe perfect voice murmured, crystal clear. \"Bella?\u201dJacob shook my shoulder. \"I'm fine,\u201dI mumbled, dazed. More than fine. The voice in my head was back. It still rang in my ears\u2014soft, velvety echoes. My mind ran swiftly through the possibilities. There was no familiarity here\u2014on a road I'd never seen, doing something I'd never done before\u2014no d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\u00a0 So the hallucinations must be triggered by something else\u2026 I felt the adrenaline coursing through my veins again, and I thought I had the answer. Some combination of adrenaline and danger, or maybe just stupidity. Jacob was pulling me to my feet. \"Did you hit your head?\u201dhe asked. \"I don't think so.\u201dI shook it back and forth, checking. \"I didn't hurt the bike, did I?\u201d This thought worried me. I was anxious to try again, right away. Being reckless was paying off better than I'd thought. Forget cheating. Maybe I'd found a way to generate the\u00a0 hallucinations\u2014that was much more important. \"No. You just stalled the engine,\u201dJacob said, interrupting my quick speculations. \"You let go of the clutch too fast.\" I nodded. \"Let's try again.\" \"Are you sure?\u201dJacob asked. \"Positive.\" This time I tried to get the kick-start myself. It was complicated; I had to jump a little to slam down on the pedal with enough force, and every time I did that, the bike tried to knock me over. Jacob's hand hovered over the handlebars, ready to catch me if I needed him. It took several good tries, and even more poor tries, before the engine caught and roared to life under me. Remembering to hold on to the grenade, I revved the throttle experimentally. It snarled at the slightest touch. My smile mirrored Jacob's now. \"Easy on the clutch,\u201dhe reminded me. \"Do you want to kill yourself, then? Is that what this is about?\u201dthe other voice spoke again, his tone severe. I smiled tightly\u2014it was still working\u2014and ignored the questions. Jacob wasn't going to let anything serious happen to me. \"Go home to Charlie,\u201dthe voice ordered. The sheer beauty of it amazed me. I couldn't allow my memory to lose it, no matter the price. \"Ease off slowly,\u201dJacob encouraged me. \"I will,\u201dI said. It bothered me a bit when I realized I was answering both of them. The voice in my head growled against the roar of the motorcycle. Trying to focus this time, to not let the voice startle me again, I relaxed my hand by tiny degrees. Suddenly, the gear caught and wrenched me forward. And I was flying. There was wind that wasn't there before, blowing my skin against my skull and flinging my hair back behind me with enough force that it felt like someone was tugging on it. I'd left my stomach back at the starting point; the adrenaline coursed through my body, tingling in my veins. The trees raced past me, blurring into a wall of green. But this was only first gear. My foot itched toward the gearshift as I twisted for more gas. \"No, Bella!\u201dthe angry, honey-sweet voice ordered in my ear. \"Watch what you're doing!\" It distracted me enough from the speed to realize that the road was starting a slow curve to the left, and I was still going straight. Jacob hadn't told me how to turn. \"Brakes, brakes,\u201dI muttered to myself, and I instinctively slammed down with my right foot, like I would in my truck. The bike was suddenly unstable underneath me, shivering first to one side and then the other. It was dragging me toward the green wall, and I was going too fast. I tried to turn the handlebar the other direction, and the sudden shift of my weight pushed the bike toward the ground, still spinning toward the trees. The motorcycle landed on top of me again, roaring loudly, pulling me across the wet sand until it hit something stationary. I couldn't see. My face was mashed into the moss. I tried to lift my head, but there was something in the way. I was dizzy and confused. It sounded like there were three things snarling\u2014the bike over me, the voice in my head, and something else\u2026 \"Bella!\u201dJacob yelled, and I heard the roar of the other bike cut off. The motorcycle no longer pinned me to the ground, and I rolled over to breathe. All the growling went silent. \"Wow,\u201dI murmured. I was thrilled. This had to be it, the recipe for a hallucination\u2014adrenaline plus clanger plus stupidity. Something close to that, anyway. \"Bella!\u201dJacob was crouching over me anxiously. \"Bella, are you alive?\" \"I'm great!\u201dI enthused. I flexed my arms and legs. Everything seemed to be working correctly. \"Let's do it again.\" \"I don't think so.\u201dJacob still sounded worried. \"I think I'd better drive you to the hospital first.\" \"I'm fine.\" \"Um, Bella? You've got a huge cut on your forehead, and it's gushing blood,\u201dhe informed me. I clapped my hand over my head. Sure enough, it was wet and sticky. I could smell nothing but the damp moss on my face, and that held off the nausea. \"Oh, I'm so sorry, Jacob.\u201dI pushed hard against the gash, as if I could force the blood back inside my head. \"Why are you apologizing for bleeding?\u201dhe wondered as he wrapped a long arm around my waist and pulled me to my feet. \"Let's go. I'll drive.\u201dHe held out his hand for the keys. \"What about the bikes?\u201dI asked, handing them over. He thought for a second. \"Wait here. And take this.\u201dHe pulled off his T-shirt, already spotted with blood, and threw it to me. I wadded it up and held it tightly to my forehead. I was starting to smell the blood; I breathed deeply through my mouth and tried to concentrate on something else. Jacob jumped on the black motorcycle, kicked it to a start in one try, and raced back down the road, spraying sand and pebbles behind him. He looked athletic and professional as he leaned over the handlebars, head low, face forward, his shiny hair whipping against the russet skin of his back. My eyes narrowed enviously. I was sure I hadn't looked like that on my motorcycle. I was surprised at how far I'd gone. I could barely see Jacob in the distance when he finally got to the truck. He threw the bike into the bed and sprinted to the driver's side. I really didn't feel bad at all as he coaxed my truck to a deafening roar in his hurry to get back to me. My head stung a little, and my stomach was uneasy, but the cut wasn't serious. Head wounds just bled more than most. His urgency wasn't necessary. Jacob left the truck running as he raced back to me, wrapping his arm around my waist again. \"Okay, let's get you in the truck.\" \"I'm honestly fine,\u201dI assured him as he helped me in. \"Don't get worked up. It's just a little blood.\" \"Just a lot of blood,\u201dI heard him mutter as he went back for my bike. \"Now, let's think about this for a second,\u201dI began when he got back in. \"If you take me to the ER like this, Charlie is sure to hear about it.\u201dI glanced down at the sand and dirt caked into my jeans. \"Bella, I think you need stitches. I'm not going to let you bleed to death.\" \"I won't,\u201dI promised. \"Let's just take the bikes back first, and then we'll make a stop at my house so I can dispose of the evidence before we go to the hospital.\" \"What about Charlie?\" \"He said he had to work today.\" \"Are you really sure?\" \"Trust me. I'm an easy bleeder. It's not nearly as dire as it looks.\" Jacob wasn't happy\u2014his full mouth turned down in an uncharacteristic frown\u2014but he didn't want to get me in trouble. I stared out the window, holding his ruined shirt to my head, while he drove me to Forks. The motorcycle was better than I'd dreamed. It had served its original purpose. I'd cheated\u2014broken my promise. I'd been needlessly reckless. I felt a little less pathetic now that the promises had been broken on both sides. And then to discover the key to the hallucinations! At least, I hoped I had. I was going to test the theory as soon as possible. Maybe they'd get through with me quickly in the ER, and I could try again tonight. Racing down the road like that had been amazing. The feel of the wind in my face, the speed and the freedom\u2026 it reminded me of a past life, flying through the thick forest without a road, piggyback while he ran\u2014I stopped thinking right there, letting the memory break off in the sudden agony. I flinched. \"You still okay?\u201dJacob checked. \"Yeah.\u201dI tried to sound as convincing as before. \"By the way,\u201dhe added. \"I'm going to disconnect your foot brake tonight.\" At home, I went to look at myself in the mirror first thing; it was pretty gruesome. Blood was drying in thick streaks across my cheek and neck, matting in my muddy hair. I examined myself clinically, pretending the blood was paint so it wouldn't upset my stomach. I breathed through my mouth, and was fine. I washed up as well as I could. Then I hid my dirty, bloody clothes in the bottom of my laundry basket, putting on new jeans and a button-up shirt (that I didn't have to pull over my head) as carefully as I could. I managed to do this one-handed and keep both garments blood-free. \"Hurry up,\u201dJacob called. \"Okay, okay,\u201dI shouted back. After making sure I left nothing incriminating behind me, I headed downstairs. \"How do I look?\u201dI asked him. \"Better,\u201dhe admitted. \"But do I look like I tripped in your garage and hit my head on a hammer?\" \"Sure, I guess so.\" \"Let's go then.\" Jacob hurried me out the door, and insisted on driving again. We were halfway to the hospital when I realized he was still shirtless. I frowned guiltily. \"We should have grabbed you a jacket.\" \"That would have given us away,\u201dhe teased. \"Besides, it's not cold.\" \"Are you kidding?\u201dI shivered and reached out to turn the heat on. I watched Jacob to see if he was just playing tough so I wouldn't worry, but he looked comfortable enough. He had one arm over the back of my seat, though I was huddled up to keep warm. Jacob really did look older than sixteen\u2014not quite forty, but maybe older than me. Quil didn't have too much on him in the muscle department, for all that Jacob claimed to be a skeleton. The muscles were the long wiry kind, but they were definitely there under the smooth skin. His skin was such a pretty color, it made me jealous. Jacob noticed my scrutiny. \"What?\u201dhe asked, suddenly self-conscious. \"Nothing. I just hadn't realized before. Did you know, you're sort of beautiful?\" Once the words slipped out, I worried that he might take my impulsive observation the wrong way. But Jacob just rolled his eyes. \"You hit your head pretty hard, didn't you?\" \"I'm serious.\" \"Well, then, thanks. Sort of.\" I grinned. \"You're sort of welcome.\" I had to have seven stitches to close the cut on my forehead. After the sting of the local anesthetic, there was no pain in the procedure. Jacob held my hand while Dr. Snow was sewing, and I tried not to think about why that was ironic. We were at the hospital forever. By the time I was done, I had to drop Jacob off at his home and hurry back to cook dinner for Charlie. Charlie seemed to buy my story about falling in Jacob's garage. After all, it wasn't like I hadn't been able to land myself in the ER before with no more help than my own feet. This night was not as bad as that first night, after I'd heard the perfect voice in Port Angeles. The hole came back, the way it always did when I was away from Jacob, but it didn't throb so badly around the edges. I was already planning ahead, looking forward to more delusions, and that was a distraction. Also, I knew I would feel better tomorrow when I was with Jacob again. That made the empty hole and the familiar pain easier to bear; relief was in sight. The nightmare, too, had lost a little of its potency. I was horrified by the nothingness, as always, but I was also strangely impatient as I waited for the moment that would send me screaming into consciousness. I knew the nightmare had to end.  The next Wednesday, before I could get home from the ER, Dr. Gerandy called to warn my father that I might possibly have a concussion and advised him to wake me up every two hours through the night to make sure it wasn't serious. Charlie's eyes narrowed suspiciously at my weak explanation about tripping again. \"Maybe you should just stay out of the garage altogether, Bella,\u201dhe suggested that night during dinner. I panicked, worried that Charlie was about to lay down some kind of edict that would prohibit La Push, and consequently my motorcycle. And I wasn't giving it up\u2014I'd had the most amazing hallucination today. My velvet-voiced delusion had yelled at me for almost five minutes before I'd hit the brake too abruptly and launched myself into the tree. I'd take whatever pain that would cause me tonight without complaint. \"This didn't happen in the garage,\u201dI protested quickly. \"We were hiking, and I tripped over a rock.\u201d \"Since when do you hike?\u201dCharlie asked skeptically. \"Working at Newton's was bound to rub off sometime,\u201dI pointed out. \"Spend every day selling all the virtues of the outdoors, eventually you get curious.\" Charlie glared at me, unconvinced. \"I'll be more careful,\u201dI promised, surreptitiously crossing my fingers under the table. \"I don't mind you hiking right there around La Push, but keep close to town, okay?\" \"Why?\" \"Well, we've been getting a lot of wildlife complaints lately. The forestry department is going to check into it, but for the time being\u2026\" \"Oh, the big bear,\u201dI said with sudden comprehension. \"Yeah, some of the hikers coming through Newton's have seen it. Do you think there's really some giant mutated grizzly out there?\" His forehead creased. \"There's something. Keep it close to town, okay?\" \"Sure, sure,\u201dI said quickly. He didn't look completely appeased. \"Charlie's getting nosy,\u201dI complained to Jacob when I picked him up after school Friday. \"Maybe we should cool it with the bikes.\u201dHe saw my objecting expression and added, \"At least for a week or so. You could stay out of the hospital for a week, right?\" \"What are we going to do?\u201dI griped. He smiled cheerfully. \"What ever you want.\" I thought about that for a minute\u2014about what I wanted. I hated the idea of losing even my brief seconds of closeness with the memories that didn't hurt\u2014the ones that came on their own, without me thinking of them consciously. If I couldn't have the bikes, I was going to have to find some other avenue to the danger and the adrenaline, and that was going to take serious thought and creativity. Doing nothing in the meantime was not appealing. Suppose I got depressed again, even with Jake? I had to keep occupied. Maybe there was some other way, some other recipe\u2026 some other place. The house had been a mistake, certainly. But his presence must be stamped somewhere, somewhere other than inside me. There had to be a place where he seemed more real than among all the familiar landmarks that were crowded with other human memories. I could think of one place where that might hold true. One place that would always belong to him and no one else. A magic place, full of light. The beautiful meadow I'd seen only once in my life, lit by sunshine and the sparkle of his skin. This idea had a huge potential for backfiring\u2014it might be dangerously painful. My chest ached with emptiness even to think of it. It was hard to hold myself upright, to not give myself away. But surely, there of all places, I could hear his voice.  And I'd already told Charlie I was hiking\u2026 \"What are you thinking about so hard?\u201dJacob asked. \"Well\u2026\u201dI began slowly. \"I found this place in the forest once\u2014I came across it when I was, um, hiking.\u00a0 A little meadow, the most beautiful place. I don't know if I could track it down again on my own. It would definitely take a few tries\u2026\" \"We could use a compass and a grid pattern,\u201dJacob said with confident helpfulness. \"Do you know where you started from?\" \"Yes, just below the <em>trailhead</em> where the one-ten ends. I was going mostly south, I think.\" \"Cool. We'll find it.\u201dAs always, Jacob was game for anything I wanted. No matter how strange it was. So, Saturday afternoon, I tied on my new hiking boots\u2014purchased that morning using my twenty-per-cent-off employee discount for the first time\u2014grabbed my new topographical map of the Olympic Peninsula, and drove to La Push. We didn't get started immediately; first, Jacob sprawled across the living room floor\u2014taking up the whole room\u2014and, for a full twenty minutes, drew a complicated web across the key section of the map while I perched on a kitchen chair and talked to Billy. Billy didn't seem at all concerned about our proposed hiking trip. I was surprised that Jacob had told him where we were going, given the fuss people were making about the bear sightings. I wanted to ask Billy not to say anything about this to Charlie, but I was afraid that making the request would cause the opposite result. \"Maybe we'll see the super bear,\u201dJacob joked, eyes on his design. I glanced at Billy swiftly, fearing a Charlie-style reaction. But Billy just laughed at his son. \"Maybe you should take a jar of honey, just in case.\" Jake chuckled. \"Hope your new boots are fast, Bella. One little jar isn't going to keep a hungry bear occupied for long.\" \"I only have to be faster than you.\" \"Good luck with that!\u201dJacob said, rolling his eyes as he refolded the map. \"Let's go.\" \"Have fun,\u201dBilly rumbled, wheeling himself toward the refrigerator. Charlie was not a hard person to live with, but it looked to me like Jacob had it even easier than I did. I drove to the very end of the dirt road, stopping near the sign that marked the beginning of the <em>trailhead</em>. It had been a long time since I'd been here, and my stomach reacted nervously. This might be a very bad thing. But it would be worth it, if I got to hear him. I got out and looked at the dense wall of green. \"I went this way,\u201dI murmured, pointing straight ahead. \"Hmm,\u201dJake muttered. \"What?\" He looked at the direction I'd pointed, then at the clearly marked trail, and back. \"I would have figured you for a trail kind of girl.\" \"Not me.\u201dI smiled bleakly. \"I'm a rebel.\" He laughed, and then pulled out our map. \"Give me a second.\u201dHe held the compass in a skilled way, twisting the map around till it angled the way he wanted. \"Okay\u2014first line on the grid. Let's do it.\" I could tell that I was slowing Jacob up, but he didn't complain. I tried not to dwell on my last trip through this part of the forest, with a very different companion. Normal memories were still dangerous. If I let myself slip up, I'd end up with my arms clutching my chest to hold it together, gasping for air, and how would I explain that to Jacob? It wasn't as hard as I would have thought to keep focused on the present. The forest looked a lot like any other part of the peninsula, and Jacob set a vastly different mood. He whistled cheerfully, an unfamiliar tune, swinging his arms and moving easily through the rough undergrowth. The shadows didn't seem as dark as usual. Not with my personal sun along. Jacob checked the compass every few minutes, keeping us in a straight line with one of the radiating spokes of his grid. He really looked like he knew what he was doing. I was going to compliment him, but I caught myself. No doubt he'd add another few years to his inflated age. My mind wandered as I walked, and I grew curious. I hadn't forgotten the conversation we'd had by the sea cliffs\u2014I'd been waiting for him to bring it up again, but it didn't look like that was going to happen. \"Hey\u2026 Jake?\u201dI asked hesitantly. \"Yeah?\" \"How are things\u2026 with Embry? Is he back to normal yet?\" Jacob was silent for a minute, still moving forward with long paces. When he was about ten feet ahead, he stopped to wait for me. \"No. He's not back to normal,\u201dJacob said when I reached him, his mouth pulling down at the corners. He didn't start walking again. I immediately regretted bringing it up. \"Still with Sam.\" \"Yup.\" He put his arm around my shoulder, and he looked so troubled that I didn't playfully shake it off, as I might have otherwise. \"Are they still looking at you funny?\u201dI half-whispered. Jacob stared through the trees. \"Sometimes.\" \"And Billy?\" \"As helpful as ever,\u201dhe said in a sour, angry voice that disturbed me. \"Our couch is always open,\u201dI offered. He laughed, breaking out of the unnatural gloom. \"But think of the position that would put Charlie in\u2014when Billy calls the police to report my kidnapping.\" I laughed too, glad to have Jacob back to normal. We stopped when Jacob said we'd gone six miles, cut west for a short time, and headed back along another line of his grid. Everything looked exactly the same as the way in, and I had a feeling that my silly quest was pretty much doomed. I admitted as much when it started to get darker, the sunless day fading toward a starless night, but Jacob was more confident. \"As long as you're sure we're starting from the right place\u2026\u201dHe glanced down at me. \"Yes, I'm sure.\" \"Then we'll find it,\u201dhe promised, grabbing my hand and pulling me through a mass of ferns. On the other side was the truck. He gestured toward it proudly. \"Trust me.\" \"You're good,\u201dI admitted. \"Next time we bring flashlights, though.\" \"We'll save hiking for Sundays from now on. I didn't know you were that slow.\" I yanked my hand back and stomped around to the driver's side while he chuckled at my reaction.  \"So you up for another try tomorrow.'\u201che asked, sliding into the passenger seat. \"Sure. Unless you want to go without me so I don't tie you down to my gimpy pace.\" \"I'll survive,\u201dhe assured me. \"If we're hiking again, though, you might want to pick up some moleskin. I bet you can feel those new boots right now.\" \"A little,\u201dI confessed. It felt like I had more blisters than I had space to fit them. \"I hope we see the bear tomorrow. I'm sort of disappointed about that.\" \"Yes, me, too,\u201dI agreed sarcastically. \"Maybe we'll get lucky tomorrow and something will eat us!\" \"Bears don't want to eat people. We don't taste that good.\u201dHe grinned at me in the dark cab. \"Of course, you might be an exception. I bet you'd taste good.\" \"Thanks so much,\u201dI said, looking away. He wasn't the first person to tell me that.",

            "en": "5         6. FRIENDS THE MOTORCYCLES DIDN'T NEED TO BE HIDDEN ANY further than simply placing them in Jacob's shed. Billy's wheelchair couldn't maneuver the uneven ground separating it from the house. Jacob started pulling the first bike\u2014the red one, which was destined for me\u2014to pieces immediately. He opened up the passenger door of the Rabbit so I could sit on the seat instead of the ground. While he worked, Jacob chattered happily, needing only the lightest of nudges from me to keep the conversation rolling. He updated me on the progress of his sophomore year of school, running on about his classes and his two best friends. \"Quil and Embry?\u201dI interrupted. \"Those are unusual names.\" Jacob chuckled. \"Quil's is a hand-me-down, and I think Embry got named after a soap opera star. I can't say anything, though. They fight dirty if you start on their names\u2014they'll tag team you.\" \"Good friends.\u201dI raised one eyebrow. \"No, they are. Just don't mess with their names.\" Just then a call echoed in the distance. \"Jacob?\u201dsomeone shouted. \"Is that Billy?\u201dI asked. \"No.\u201dJacob ducked his head, and it looked like he was blushing under his brown skin. \"Speak of the devil,\u201dhe mumbled, \"and the devil shall appear.\" \"Jake? Are you out here?\u201dThe shouting voice was closer now. \"Yeah!\u201dJacob shouted back, and sighed. We waited through the short silence until two tall, dark-skinned boys strolled around the corner into the shed. One was slender, and almost as tall as Jacob. His black hair was chin-length and parted down the middle, one side tucked behind his left ear while the right side swung free. The shorter boy was more burly. His white T-shirt strained over his well-developed chest, and he seemed gleefully conscious of that fact. His hair was so short it was almost a buzz. Both boys stopped short when they saw me. The thin boy glanced swiftly back and forth between Jacob and me, while the brawny boy kept his eyes on me, a slow smile spreading across his face. \"Hey, guys,\u201dJacob greeted them halfheartedly. \"Hey, Jake,\u201dthe short one said without looking away from me. I had to smile in response, his grin was so impish. When I did, he winked at me. \"Hi, there.\" \"Quil, Embry\u2014this is my friend, Bella.\" Quil and Embry, I still didn't know which was which, exchanged a loaded look. \"Charlie's kid, right?\u201dthe brawny boy asked me, holding out his hand. \"That's right,\u201dI confirmed, shaking hands with him. His grasp was firm; it looked like he was flexing his bicep. \"I'm Quil Ateara,\u201dhe announced grandly before releasing my hand. \"Nice to meet you, Quil.\" \"Hey, Bella. I'm Embry, Embry Call\u2014you probably already figured that out, though.\u201dEmbry smiled a shy smile and waved with one hand, which he then shoved in the pocket of his jeans. I nodded. \"Nice to meet you, too.\" \"So what are you guys doing?\u201dQuil asked, still looking at me. \"Bella and I are going to fix up these bikes,\u201dJacob explained inaccurately. But bikes seemed to be the magic word. Both boys went to examine Jacob's project, drilling him with educated questions. Many of the words they used were unfamiliar to me, and I figured I'd have to have a Y chromosome to really understand the excitement. They were still immersed in talk of parts and pieces when I decided that I needed to head back home before Charlie showed up here. With a sigh, I slid out of the Rabbit. Jacob looked up, apologetic. \"We're boring you, aren't we?\" \"Naw.\u201dAnd it wasn't a lie. I was enjoying myself\u2014how strange. \"I just have to go cook dinner for Charlie.\" \"Oh\u2026 well, I'll finish taking these apart tonight and figure out what more we'll need to get started rebuilding them. When do you want to work on them again?\" \"Could I come back tomorrow?\u201d\u00a0 Sundays were the bane of my existence. There was never enough homework to keep me busy. Quil nudged Embry's arm and they exchanged grins. Jacob smiled in delight. \"That would be great!\" \"If you make a list, we can go shop for parts,\u201dI suggested. Jacob's face fell a little. \"I'm still not sure I should let you pay for everything.\" I shook my head. \"No way. I'm bankrolling this party. You just have to supply the labor and expertise.\" Embry rolled his eyes at Quil. \"That doesn't seem right,\u201dJacob shook his head. \"Jake, if I took these to a mechanic, how much would he charge me?\u201dI pointed out. He smiled. \"Okay, you're getting a deal.\" \"Not to mention the riding lessons,\u201dI added. Quil grinned widely at Embry and whispered something I didn't catch. Jacob's hand flashed out to smack the back of Quil's head. \"That's it, get out,\u201dhe muttered. \"No, really, I have to go,\u201dI protested, heading for the door. \"I'll see you tomorrow, Jacob.\" As soon as I was out of sight, I heard Quil and Embry chorus, \"Wooooo!\" The sound of a brief scuffle followed, interspersed with an \"ouch\u201dand a \"hey!\" \"If either of you set so much as one toe on my land tomorrow\u2026\u201dI heard Jacob threaten. His voice was lost as I walked through the trees. I giggled quietly. The sound made my eyes widen in wonder. I was laughing, actually laughing, and there wasn't even anyone watching. I felt so weightless that I laughed again, just make the feeling last longer. I beat Charlie home. When he walked in I was just taking the fried chicken out of the pan and laying it on a pile of paper towels. \"Hey, Dad.\u201dI flashed him a grin. Shock flitted across his face before he pulled his expression together. \"Hey, honey,\u201dhe said, his voice uncertain. \"Did you have fun with Jacob?\" I started moving the food to the table. \"Yeah, I did.\" \"Well, that's good.\u201dHe was still cautious. \"What did you two do?\" Now it was my turn to be cautious. \"I hung out in his garage and watched him work. Did you know he's rebuilding a Volkswagen?\" \"Yeah, I think Billy mentioned that.\" The interrogation had to stop when Charlie began chewing, but he continued to study my face as he ate.  After dinner, I dithered around, cleaning the kitchen twice, and then did my homework slowly in the front room while Charlie watched a hockey game. I waited as long as I could, but finally Charlie mentioned the late hour. When I didn't respond, he got up, stretched, and then left, turning out the light behind him. Reluctantly, I followed. As I climbed the stairs, I felt the last of the afternoon's abnormal sense of well-being drain from my system, replaced by a dull fear at the thought of what I was going to have to live through now. I wasn't numb anymore. Tonight would, no doubt, be as horrific as last night. I lay down on my bed and curled into a ball in preparation for the onslaught. I squeezed my eyes shut and\u2026 the next thing I knew, it was morning. I stared at the pale silver light coming through my window, stunned. For the first time in more than four months, I'd slept without dreaming. Dreaming or screaming. I couldn't tell which emotion was stronger\u2014the relief or the shock. I lay still in my bed for a few minutes, waiting for it to come back. Because something must be coming. If not the pain, then the numbness. I waited, but nothing happened. I felt more rested than I had in a long time. I didn't trust this to last. It was a slippery, precarious edge that I balanced on, and it wouldn't take much to knock me back down. Just glancing around my room with these suddenly clear eyes\u2014noticing how strange it looked, too tidy, like I didn't live here at all\u2014was dangerous. I pushed that thought from my mind, and concentrated, as I got dressed, on the fact that I was going to see Jacob again today. The thought made me feel almost\u2026 hopeful. Maybe it would be the same as yesterday. Maybe I wouldn't have to remind myself to look interested and to nod or smile at appropriate intervals, the way I had to with everyone else. Maybe\u2026 but I wouldn't trust this to last, either. Wouldn't trust it to be the same\u2014so easy\u2014as yesterday. I wasn't going to set myself up for disappointment like that. At breakfast, Charlie was being careful, too. He tried to hide his scrutiny, keeping his eyes on his eggs until he thought I wasn't looking. \"What are you up to today?\u201dhe asked, eyeing a loose thread on the edge of his cuff like he wasn't paying much attention to my answer. \"I'm going to hang out with Jacob again.\" He nodded without looking up. \"Oh,\u201dhe said. \"Do you mind?\u201dI pretended to worry. \"I could stay\u2026\" He glanced up quickly, a hint of panic in his eyes. \"No, no! You go ahead. Harry was going to come up to watch the game with me anyway.\" \"Maybe Harry could give Billy a ride up,\u201dI suggested. The fewer witnesses the better. \"That's a great idea.\" I wasn't sure if the game was just an excuse for kicking me out, but he looked excited enough now. He headed to the phone while I donned my rain jacket. I felt self-conscious with the checkbook shoved in my jacket pocket. It was something I never used. Outside, the rain came down like water slopped from a bucket. I had to drive more slowly than I wanted to; I could hardly see a car length in front of the truck. But I finally made it through the muddy lanes to Jacob's house. Before I'd killed the engine, the front door opened and Jacob came running out with a huge black umbrella. He held it over my door while I opened it. \"Charlie called\u2014said you were on your way,\u201dJacob explained with a grin. Effortlessly, without a conscious command to the muscles around my lips, my answering smile spread across my face. A strange feeling of warmth bubbled up in my throat, despite the icy rain splattering on my cheeks. \"Hi, Jacob.\" \"Good call on inviting Billy up.\u201dHe held up his hand for a high five. \u00a0I had to reach so high to slap his hand that he laughed. Harry showed up to get Billy just a few minutes later. Jacob took me on a brief tour of his tiny room while we waited to be unsupervised. \"So where to, Mr. Goodwrench?\u201dI asked as soon as the door closed behind Billy. Jacob pulled a folded paper out of his pocket and smoothed it out. \"We'll start at the dump first, see if we can get lucky. This could get a little expensive,\u201dhe warned me. \"Those bikes are going to need a lot of help before they'll run again.\u201dMy face didn't look worried enough, so he continued. \"I'm talking about maybe more than a hundred dollars here.\" I pulled my checkbook out, fanned myself with it, and rolled my eyes at his worries. \"We're covered.\" It was a very strange kind of day. I enjoyed myself. Even at the dump, in the slopping rain and ankle-deep mud. I wondered at first if it was just the aftershock of losing the numbness, but I didn't think that was enough of an explanation. I was beginning to think it was mostly Jacob. It wasn't just that he was always so happy to see me, or that he didn't watch me out of the corner of his eye, waiting for me to do something that would mark me as crazy or depressed. It was nothing that related to me at all. It was Jacob himself. Jacob was simply a perpetually happy person, and he carried that happiness with him like an aura, sharing it with whoever was near him. Like an earthbound sun, whenever someone was within his gravitational pull, Jacob warmed them. It was natural, a part of who he was. No wonder I was so eager to see him. Even when he commented on the gaping hole in my dashboard, it didn't send me into a panic like it should have. \"Did the stereo break?\u201dhe wondered. \"Yeah,\u201dI lied. He poked around in the cavity. \"Who took it out? There's a lot of damage\u2026\" \"I did,\u201dI admitted. He laughed. \"Maybe you shouldn't touch the motorcycles too much.\" \"No problem.\" According to Jacob, we did get lucky at the dump. He was very excited about several grease-blackened pieces of twisted metal that he found; I was just impressed that he could tell what they were supposed to be. From there we went to the Checker Auto Parts down in Hoquiam. In my truck, it was more than a two hour drive south on the winding freeway, but the time passed easily with Jacob. He chattered about his friends and his school, and I found myself asking questions, not even pretending, truly curious to hear what he had to say. \"I'm doing all the talking,\u201dhe complained after a long story about Quil and the trouble he'd stirred up by asking out a senior's steady girlfriend. \"Why don't you take a turn? What's going on in Forks? It has to be more exciting than La Push.\" \"Wrong,\u201dI sighed. \"There's really nothing. Your friends are a lot more interesting than mine. I like your friends. Quil's funny.\" He frowned. \"I think Quil likes you, too.\" I laughed. \"He's a little young for me.\" Jacob's frown deepened. \"He's not that much younger than you. It's just a year and a few months.\" I had a feeling we weren't talking about Quil anymore. I kept my voice light, teasing. \"Sure, but, considering the difference in maturity between guys and girls, don't you have to count that in dog years? What does that make me, about twelve years older?\" He laughed, rolling his eyes. \"Okay, but if you're going to get picky like that, you have to average in size, too. You're so small, I'll have to knock ten years off your total.\" \"Five foot four is perfectly average.\u201dI sniffed. \"It's not my fault you're a freak.\" We bantered like that till Hoquiam, still arguing over the correct formula to determine age\u2014I lost two more years because I didn't know how to change a tire, but gained one back for being in charge of the bookkeeping at my house\u2014until we were in Checker, and Jacob had to concentrate again. We found everything left on his list, and Jacob felt confident that he could make a lot of progress with our haul. By the time we got back to La Push, I was twenty-three and he was thirty\u2014he was definitely weighting skills in his favor. I hadn't forgotten the reason for what I was doing. And, even though I was enjoying myself more than I'd thought possible, there was no lessening of my original desire. I still wanted to cheat. It was senseless, and I really didn't care. I was going to be as reckless as I could possibly manage in Forks. I would not be the only keeper of an empty contract. Getting to spend time with Jacob was just a much bigger perk than I'd expected. Billy wasn't back yet, so we didn't have to be sneaky about unloading our day's spoils. As soon as we had everything laid out on the plastic floor next to Jacob's toolbox, he went right to work, still talking and laughing while his fingers combed expertly through the metal pieces in front of him. Jacob's skill with his hands was fascinating. They looked too big for the delicate tasks they performed with ease and precision. While he worked, he seemed almost graceful. Unlike when he was on his feet; there, his height and big feet made him nearly as dangerous as I was. Quil and Embry did not show up, so maybe his threat yesterday had been taken seriously. The day passed too quickly. It got dark outside the mouth of the garage before I was expecting it, and then we heard Billy calling for us. I jumped up to help Jacob put things away, hesitating because I wasn't sure what I should touch. \"Just leave it,\u201dhe said. \"I'll work on it later tonight.\" \"Don't forget your schoolwork or anything,\u201dI said, feeling a little guilty. I didn't want him to get in trouble. That plan was just for me. \"Bella?\" Both our heads snapped up as Charlie's familiar voice wafted through the trees, sounding closer than the house. \"Shoot,\u201dI muttered. \"Coming!\u201dI yelled toward the house. \"Let's go.\u201dJacob smiled, enjoying the cloak-and-dagger. He snapped the light off, and for a moment I was blind. Jacob grabbed my hand and towed me out of the garage and through the trees, his feet finding the familiar path easily. His hand was rough, and very warm. Despite the path, we were both tripping over our feet in the darkness. So we were also both laughing when the house came into view. The laughter did not go deep; it was light and superficial, but still nice. I was sure he wouldn't notice the faint hint of hysteria. I wasn't used to laughing, and it felt right and also very wrong at the same time. Charlie was standing under the little back porch, and Billy was sitting in the doorway behind them. \"Hey, Dad,\u201dwe both said at the same time, and that started us laughing again. Charlie stared at me with wide eyes that flashed down to note Jacob's hand around mine. \"Billy invited us for dinner,\u201dCharlie said to us in an absentminded tone. \"My super secret recipe for spaghetti. Handed down for generations,\u201dBilly said gravely. Jacob snorted. \"I don't think Ragu's actually been around that long.\" The house was crowded. Harry Clearwater was there, too, with his family\u2014his wife, Sue, whom I knew vaguely from my childhood summers in Forks, and his two children. Leah was a senior like me, but a year older. She was beautiful in an exotic way\u2014perfect copper skin, glistening black hair, eyelashes like feather dusters\u2014and preoccupied. She was on Billy's phone when we got in, and she never let it go. Seth was fourteen; he hung on Jacob's every word with idolizing eyes. There were too many of us for the kitchen table, so Charlie and Harry brought chairs out to the yard, and we ate spaghetti off plates on our laps in the dim light from Billy's open door. The men talked about the game, and Harry and Charlie made fishing plans. Sue teased her husband about his cholesterol and tried, unsuccessfully, to shame him into eating something green and leafy. Jacob talked mostly to me and Seth, who interrupted eagerly whenever Jacob seemed in danger of forgetting him. Charlie watched me, trying to be inconspicuous about it, with pleased but cautious eyes.  It was loud and sometimes confusing as everyone talked over everyone else, and the laughter from one joke interrupted the telling of another. I didn't have to speak often, but I smiled a lot, and only because I felt like it. I didn't want to leave. This was Washington, though, and the inevitable rain eventually broke up the party; Billy's living room was much too small to provide an option for continuing the get-together. Harry had driven Charlie down, so we rode together in my truck on the way back home. He asked about my day, and I told mostly the truth\u2014that I'd gone with Jacob to look at parts and then watched him work in his garage. \"You think you'll visit again anytime soon?\u201dhe wondered, trying to be casual about it. \"Tomorrow after school,\u201dI admitted. \"I'll take homework, don't worry.\" \"You be sure to do that,\u201dhe ordered, trying to disguise his satisfaction. I was nervous when we got to the house. I didn't want to go upstairs. The warmth of Jacob's presence was fading and, in its absence, the anxiety grew stronger. I was sure I wouldn't get away with two peaceful nights of sleep in a row. To put bedtime off, I checked my e-mail; there was a new message from Renee. She wrote about her day, a new book club that rilled the time slot of the meditation classes she'd just quit, her week subbing in the second grade, missing her kindergarteners. She wrote that Phil was enjoying his new coaching job, and that they were planning a second honeymoon trip to Disney World. And I noticed that the whole thing read like a journal entry, rather than a letter to someone else. Remorse flooded through me, leaving an uncomfortable sting behind. Some daughter I was. I wrote back to her quickly, commenting on each part of her letter, volunteering information of my own\u2014describing the spaghetti party at Billy's and how I felt watching Jacob build useful things out of small pieces of metal\u2014awed and slightly envious. I made no reference to the change this letter would be from the ones she'd received in the last several months. I could barely remember what I'd written to her even as recently as last week, but I was sure it wasn't very responsive. The more I thought about it, the guiltier I felt; I really must have worried her. I stayed up extra late after that, finishing more homework than strictly necessary. But neither sleep deprivation nor the time spent with Jacob\u2014being almost happy in a shallow kind of way\u2014could keep the dream away for two nights in a row. I woke shuddering, my scream muffled by the pillow. As the dim morning light filtered through the fog outside my window, I lay still in bed and tried to shake off the dream. There had been a small difference last night, and I concentrated on that. Last night I had not been alone in the woods. Sam Uley\u2014the man who had pulled me from the forest floor that night I couldn't bear to think of consciously\u2014was there. It was an odd, unexpected alteration. The man's dark eyes had been surprisingly unfriendly, filled with some secret he didn't seem inclined to share. I'd stared at him as often as my frantic searching had allowed; it made me uncomfortable, under all the usual panic, to have him there. Maybe that was because, when I didn't look directly at him, his shape seemed to shiver and change in my peripheral vision. Yet he did nothing but stand and watch. Unlike the time when we had met in reality, he did not offer me his help. Charlie stared at me during breakfast, and I tried to ignore him. I supposed I deserved it. I couldn't expect him not to worry. It would probably be weeks before he stopped watching for the return of the zombie, and I would just have to try to not let it bother me. After all, I would be watching for the return of the zombie, too. Two days was hardly long enough to call me cured. School was the opposite. Now that I was paying attention, it was clear that no one was watching here. I remembered the first day I'd come to Forks High School\u2014how desperately I'd wished that I could turn gray, fade into the wet concrete of the sidewalk like an oversized chameleon. It seemed I was getting that wish answered, a year late. It was like I wasn't there. Even my teachers' eyes slid past my seat as if it were empty. I listened all through the morning, hearing once again the voices of the people around me. I tried to catch up on what was going on, but the conversations were so disjointed that I gave up. Jessica didn't look up when I sat down next to her in Calculus. \"Hey, Jess,\u201dI said with put-on nonchalance. \"How was the rest of your weekend?\" She looked at me with suspicious eyes. Could she still be angry? Or was she just too impatient to deal with a crazy person? \"Super,\u201dshe said, turning back to her book. \"That's good,\u201dI mumbled. The figure of speech cold shoulder seemed to have some literal truth to it. I could feel the warm air blowing from the floor vents, but I was still too cold. I took the jacket off the back of my chair and put it on again. My fourth hour class got out late, and the lunch table I always sat at was full by the time I arrived. Mike was there, Jessica and Angela, Conner, Tyler, Eric and Lauren. Katie Marshall, the redheaded junior who lived around the corner from me, was sitting with Eric, and Austin Marks\u2014older brother to the boy with the motorcycles\u2014was next to her. I wondered how long they'd been sitting here, unable to remember if this was the first day or something that was a regular habit. I was beginning to get annoyed with myself. I might as well have been packed in Styrofoam peanuts through the last semester. No one looked up when I sat down next to Mike, even though the chair squealed stridently against the linoleum as I dragged it back. I tried to catch up with the conversation. Mike and Conner were talking sports, so I gave up on that one at once. \"Where's Ben today?\u201dLauren was asking Angela. I perked up, interested. I wondered if that meant Angela and Ben were still together. I barely recognized Lauren. She'd cut off all her blond, corn-silk hair\u2014now she had a pixie cut so short that the back was shaved like a boy. What an odd thing for her to do. I wished I knew the reason behind it. Did she get gum stuck in it? Did she sell it? Had all the people she was habitually nasty to caught her behind the gym and scalped her? I decided it wasn't fair for me to judge her now by my former opinion. For all I knew, she'd turned into a nice person. \"Ben's got the stomach flu,\u201dAngela said in her quiet, calm voice. \"Hopefully it's just some twenty-four hour thing. He was really sick last night.\" Angela had changed her hair, too. She'd grown out her layers. \"What did you two do this weekend?\u201dJessica asked, not sounding as if she cared about the answer. I'd bet that this was just an opener so she could tell her own stories. I wondered if she would talk about Port Angeles with me sitting two seats away? Was I that invisible, that no one would feel uncomfortable discussing me while I was here? \"We were going to have a picnic Saturday, actually, but\u2026 we changed our minds,\u201dAngela said. There was an edge to her voice that caught my interest. Jess, not so much. \"That's too bad,\u201dshe said, about to launch into her story. But I wasn't the only one who was paying attention. \"What happened?\u201dLauren asked curiously. \"Well,\u201dAngela said, seeming more hesitant than usual, though she was always reserved, \"we drove up north, almost to the hot springs\u2014there's a good spot just about a mile up the trail. But, when we were halfway there\u2026 we saw something.\" \"Saw something? What?\u201dLauren's pale eyebrows pulled together. Even Jess seemed to be listening now. \"I don't know,\u201dAngela said. \"We think it was a bear. It was black, anyway, but it seemed\u2026 too big.\" Lauren snorted. \"Oh, not you, too!\u201dHer eyes turned mocking, and I decided I didn't need to give her the benefit of the doubt. Obviously her personality had not changed as much as her hair. \"Tyler tried to sell me that one last week.\" \"You're not going to see any bears that close to the resort,\u201dJessica said, siding with Lauren.  \"Really,\u201dAngela protested in a low voice, looking down at the table. \"We did see it.\" Lauren snickered. Mike was still talking to Conner, not paying attention to the girls. \"No, she's right,\u201dI threw in impatiently. \"We had a hiker in just Saturday who saw the bear, too, Angela.\u00a0 He said it was huge and black and just outside of town, didn't he, Mike?\" There was a moment of silence. Every pair of eyes at the table turned to stare at me in shock. The new girl, Katie, had her mouth hanging open like she'd just witnessed an explosion. Nobody moved. \"Mike?\u201dI muttered, mortified. \"Remember the guy with the bear story?\" \"S-sure,\u201dMike stuttered after a second. I didn't know why he was looking at me so strangely. I talked to him at work, didn't I? Did I? I thought so\u2026 Mike recovered. \"Yeah, there was a guy who said he saw a huge black bear right at the <em>trailhead</em>\u2014bigger than a grizzly,\u201dhe confirmed. \"Hmph.\u201dLauren turned to Jessica, her shoulders stiff, and changed the subject. \"Did you hear back from USC?\u201dshe asked. Everyone else looked away, too, except for Mike and Angela. Angela smiled at me tentatively, and I hurried to return the smile. \"So, what did you do this weekend, Bella?\u201dMike asked, curious, but oddly wary. Everyone but Lauren looked back, waiting for my response. \"Friday night, Jessica and I went to a movie in Port Angeles. And then I spent Saturday afternoon and most of Sunday down at La Push.\" The eyes flickered to Jessica and back to me. Jess looked irritated. I wondered if she didn't want anyone to know she'd gone out with me, or whether she just wanted to be the one to tell the story. \"What movie did you see?\u201dMike asked, starting to smile. \"Dead End\u2014the one with the zombies.\u201dI grinned in encouragement. Maybe some of the damage I'd done in these past zombie months was reparable. \"I heard that was scary. Did you think so?\u201dMike was eager to continue the conversation. \"Bella had to leave at the end, she was so freaked,\u201dJessica inserted with a sly smile. I nodded, trying to look embarrassed. \"It was pretty scary.\" Mike didn't stop asking me questions till lunch was over. Gradually, the others were able to start up their own conversations again, though they still looked at me a lot. Angela talked mostly to Mike and me, and, when I got up to dump my tray, she followed. \"Thanks,\u201dshe said in a low voice when we were away from the table. \"For what?\" \"Speaking up, sticking up for me.\" \"No problem.\" She looked at me with concern, but not the offensive, maybe-she's-lost-it kind. \"Are you okay?\" This is why I'd picked Jessica over Angela\u2014though I'd always liked Angela more\u2014for the girls' night movie. Angela was too perceptive. \"Not completely,\u201dI admitted. \"But I'm a little bit better.\" \"I'm glad,\u201dshe said. \"I've missed you.\" Lauren and Jessica strolled by us then, and I heard Lauren whisper loudly, \"Oh, joy Bella's back.\" Angela rolled her eyes at them, and smiled at me in encouragement. I sighed It was like I was starting all over again. \"What's today's date?\u201dI wondered suddenly. \"It's January nineteenth.\" \"Hmm.\" \"What is it?\u201dAngela asked. \"It was a year ago yesterday that I had my first day here,\u201dI mused. \"Nothing's changed much,\u201dAngela muttered, looking after Lauren and Jessica. \"I know,\u201d I agreed.\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI was just thinking the same thing.\"",

            "en": "5          5. CHEATER \"BELLA, WHY DON'T YOU TAKE OFF,\" MIKE SUGGESTED, his eyes focused off to the side, not really looking at me. I wondered how long that had been going on without me noticing. It was a slow afternoon at Newton's. At the moment there were only two patrons in the store, dedicated backpackers from the sound of their conversation. Mike had spent the last hour going through the pros and cons of two brands of lightweight packs with them. But they'd taken a break from serious pricing to indulge in trying to one - up each other with their latest tales from the trail. Their distraction had given Mike a chance to escape. \"I don't mind staying,\" I said. I still hadn't been able to sink back into my protective shell of numbness, and everything seemed oddly close and loud today, like I'd taken cotton out of my ears. I tried to tune out the laughing hikers without success. \"I'm telling you,\" said the thickset man with the orange beard that didn't match his dark brown hair. \"I've seen grizzlies pretty close up in Yellowstone, but they had nothing on this brute.\" His hair was matted, and his clothes looked like they'd been on his back for more than a few days. Fresh from the mountains. \"Not a chance. Black bears don't get that big. The grizzlies you saw were probably cubs.\" The second man was tall and lean, his face tanned and wind-whipped into an impressive leathery crust. \"Seriously, Bella, as soon as these two give up, I'm closing the place down,\" Mike murmured. \"If you want me to go\u2026\" I shrugged. \u00a0\"On all fours it was taller than you,\" the bearded man insisted while I gathered my things together. \"Big as a house and pitch-black. I'm going to report it to the ranger here. People ought to be warned\u2014this wasn't up on the mountain, mind you\u2014this was only a few miles from the <em>trailhead</em>.\" Leather-face laughed and rolled his eyes. \"Let me guess\u2014you were on your way in? Hadn't eaten real food or slept off the ground in a week, right?\" \"Hey, uh, Mike, right?\" the bearded man called, looking toward us. \"See you Monday,\" I mumbled. \"Yes, sir,\" Mike replied, turning away. \"Say, have there been any warnings around here recently\u2014about black bears?\" \"No, sir. But it's always good to keep your distance and store your food correctly. Have you seen the new bear-safe canisters? They only weigh two pounds\u2026\" The doors slid open to let me out into the rain. I hunched over inside my jacket as I\u00a0 dashed for my truck. The rain hammering against my hood sounded unusually loud, too, but soon the roar of the engine drowned out everything else. I didn't want to go back to Charlie's empty house. Last night had been particularly brutal, and I had no desire to revisit the scene of the suffering. Even after the pain had subsided enough for me to sleep, it wasn't over. Like I'd told Jessica after the movie, there was never any doubt that I would have nightmares. I always had nightmares now, every night. Not nightmares really, not in the plural,\u00a0 because it was always the same nightmare. You'd think I'd get bored after so many months, grow immune to it. But the dream never failed to horrify me, and only ended when I woke myself with screaming. Charlie didn't come in to see what was wrong anymore, to make sure there was no intruder strangling me or something like that\u2014he was used to it now. My nightmare probably wouldn't even frighten someone else. Nothing jumped out and screamed, \"Boo!\" There were no zombies, no ghosts, no psychopaths. There was nothing, really. Only nothing. Just the endless maze of moss-covered trees, so quiet that the silence was an uncomfortable pressure against my eardrums. It was dark, like dusk on a cloudy day, with only enough light to see that there was nothing to see. I hurried through the gloom without a path, always searching, searching, searching, getting more frantic as the time stretched on, trying to move faster, though the speed made me clumsy\u2026 Then there would come the point in my dream\u2014and I could feel it coming now, but could never seem to wake myself up before it hit\u2014when I couldn't remember what it was that I was searching for. When I realized that there was nothing to search for, and nothing to find.  That there never had been anything more than just this empty, dreary wood, and there never would be anything more for me\u2026 nothing but nothing\u2026 That was usually about when the screaming started. I wasn't paying attention to where I was driving\u2014just wandering through empty, wet side roads as I avoided the ways that would take me home\u2014because I didn't have anywhere to go.  I wished I could feel numb again, but I couldn't remember how I'd managed it before. The nightmare was nagging at my mind and making me think about things that would cause me pain. I didn't want to remember the forest. Even as I shuddered away from the images, I felt my eyes fill with tears and the aching begin around the edges of the hole in my chest. I took one hand from the steering wheel and wrapped it around my torso to hold it in one piece. It will be as if I'd never existed. The words ran through my head, lacking the perfect clarity of my hallucination last night. They were just words, soundless, like print on a page. Just words, but they ripped the hole wide open, and I stomped on the brake, knowing I should not drive while this incapacitated. I curled over, pressing my face against the steering wheel and trying to breathe without lungs. S\u1ebd nh\u01b0 th\u1ec3 t\u00f4i ch\u01b0a h\u1ec1 t\u1ed3n t\u1ea1i tr\u00ean \u0111\u1eddi n\u00e0y I wondered how long this could last. Maybe someday, years from now\u2014if the pain would just decrease to the point where I could bear it\u2014I would be able to look back on those few short months that would always be the best of my life. And, if it were possible that the pain would ever soften enough to allow me to do that, I was sure that I would feel grateful for as much time as he'd given me. More than I'd asked for, more than I'd deserved. Maybe someday I'd be able to see it that way. But what if this hole never got any better? If the raw edges never healed? If the damage was permanent and irreversible? I held myself tightly together. As if he'd never existed, I thought in despair. What a stupid and impossible promise to make! He could steal my pictures and reclaim his gifts, but that didn't put things back the way they'd been before I'd met him. The physical evidence was the most insignificant part of the equation. I was changed, my insides altered almost past the point of recognition. Even my outsides looked different\u2014my face sallow, white except for the purple circles the nightmares had left under my eyes. My eyes were dark enough against my pallid skin that\u2014if I were beautiful, and seen from a distance\u2014I might even pass for a vampire now. But I was not beautiful, and I probably looked closer to a zombie. Nh\u01b0 th\u1ec3 anh ch\u01b0a t\u1eebng t\u1ed3n t\u1ea1i tr\u00ean \u0111\u1eddi n\u00e0y As if he'd never existed? That was insanity. It was a promise that he could never keep, a promise that was broken as soon as he'd made it. I thumped my head against the steering wheel, trying to distract myself from the sharper pain. It made me feel silly for ever worrying about keeping my promise. Where was the logic in sticking to an agreement that had already been violated by the other party? Who cared if I was reckless and stupid? There was no reason to avoid recklessness, no reason why I shouldn't get to be stupid. I laughed humorlessly to myself, still gasping for air. Reckless in Forks\u2014now there was a hopeless proposition. The dark humor distracted me, and the distraction eased the pain. My breath came easier, and I was able to lean back against the seat. Though it was cold today, my forehead was damp with sweat. I concentrated on my hopeless proposition to keep from sliding back into the excruciating memories. To be reckless in Forks would take a lot of creativity\u2014maybe more than I had. But I wished I could find some way\u2026 I might feel better if I weren't holding fast, all alone, to a broken pact. If I were an oath-breaker, too. But how could I cheat on my side of the deal, here in this harmless little town? Of course, Forks hadn't always been so harmless, but now it was exactly what it had always appeared to be. It was dull, it was safe. I stared out the windshield for a long moment, my thoughts moving sluggishly\u2014I couldn't seem to make those thoughts go anywhere. I cut the engine, which was groaning in a pitiful way after idling for so long, and stepped out into the drizzle. The cold rain dripped through my hair and then trickled across my cheeks like freshwater tears. It helped to clear my head. I blinked the water from my eyes, staring blankly across the road. After a minute of staring, I recognized where I was. I'd parked in the middle of the north lane of Russell Avenue. I was standing in front of the Cheneys' house\u2014my truck was blocking their driveway\u2014and across the road lived the Markses. I knew I needed to move my truck, and that I ought to go home. It was wrong to wander the way I had, distracted and impaired, a menace on the roads of Forks. Besides, someone would notice me soon enough, and report me to Charlie. As I took a deep breath in preparation to move, a sign in the Markses' yard caught my eye\u2014it was just a big piece of cardboard leaning against their mailbox post, with black letters scrawled in caps across it. Sometimes, kismet happens. Coincidence? Or was it meant to be? I didn't know, but it seemed kind of silly to think that it was somehow fated, that the dilapidated motorcycles rusting in the Markses' front yard beside the hand-printed FOR SALE, AS IS sign were serving some higher purpose by existing there, right where I needed them to be. So maybe it wasn't kismet. Maybe there were just all kinds of ways to be reckless, and I only now had my eyes open to them. Reckless and stupid. Those were Charlie's two very favorite words to apply to motorcycles. Charlie's job didn't get a lot of action compared to cops in bigger towns, but he did get called in on traffic accidents. With the long, wet stretches of freeway twisting and turning through the forest, blind corner after blind corner, there was no shortage of that kind of action. But even with all the huge log-haulers barreling around the turns, mostly people walked away. The exceptions to that rule were often on motorcycles, and Charlie had seen one too many victims, almost always kids, smeared on the highway. He'd made me promise before I was ten that I would never accept a ride on a motorcycle. Even at that age, I didn't have to think twice before promising. Who would want to ride a motorcycle here? It would be like taking a sixty-mile-per-hour bath. So many promises I kept\u2026 It clicked together for me then. I wanted to be stupid and reckless, and I wanted to break promises. Why stop at one? That's as far as I thought it through. I sloshed through the rain to the Markses' front door and rang the bell. One of the Marks boys opened the door, the younger one, the freshman. I couldn't remember his name. His sandy hair only came up to my shoulder. He had no trouble remembering my name. \"Bella Swan?\" he asked in surprise. \"How much do you want for the bike?\" I panted, jerking my thumb over my shoulder toward the sales display. \"Are you serious?\" he demanded. \"Of course I am.\" \"They don't work.\" I sighed impatiently\u2014this was something I'd already inferred from the sign. \"How much?\" \"If you really want one, just take it. My mom made my dad move them down to the road so they'd get picked up with the garbage.\" I glanced at the bikes again and saw that they were resting on a pile of yard clippings and dead branches. \"Are you positive about that?\" \"Sure, you want to ask her?\" It was probably better not to involve adults who might mention this to Charlie. \"No, I believe you.\" \"You want me to help you?\" he offered. \"They're not light.\" \"Okay, thanks. I only need one, though.\" \"Might as well take both,\" the boy said. \"Maybe you could scavenge some parts.\" He followed me out into the downpour and helped me load both of the heavy bikes into the back of my truck. He seemed eager to be rid of them, so I didn't argue. \"What are you going to do with them, anyway?\" he asked. \"They haven't worked in years.\" \"I kind of guessed that,\" I said, shrugging. My spur-of-the-moment whim hadn't come with a plan intact. \"Maybe I'll take them to Dowling's.\" He snorted. \"Dowling would charge more to fix them than they'd be worth running.\" I couldn't argue with that. John Dowling had earned a reputation for his pricing; no one went to him except in an emergency. Most people preferred to make the drive up to Port Angeles, if their car was able. I'd been very lucky on that front\u2014I'd been worried, when Charlie first gifted me my ancient truck, that I wouldn't be able to afford to keep it running. But I'd never had a single problem with it, other than the screaming-loud engine and the fifty-five-mile-per-hour maximum speed limit. Jacob Black had kept it in great shape when it had belonged to his father, Billy\u2026 Inspiration hit like a bolt of lightning\u2014not unreasonable, considering the storm. \"You know what? That's okay. I know someone who builds cars.\" \"Oh. That's good.\" He smiled in relief. He waved as I pulled away, still smiling. Friendly kid. I drove quickly and purposefully now, in a hurry to get home before there was the slightest chance of Charlie appearing, even in the highly unlikely event that he might knock off early. I dashed through the house to the phone, keys still in hand. \"Chief Swan, please,\" I said when the deputy answered. \"It's Bella.\" \"Oh, hey, Bella,\" Deputy Steve said affably. \"I'll go get him.\" I waited. \"What's wrong, Bella?\" Charlie demanded as soon as he picked up the phone. \"Can't I call you at work without there being an emergency?\" He was quiet for a minute. \"You never have before. Is there an emergency?\" \"No. I just wanted directions to the Blacks' place\u2014I'm not sure I can remember the way. I want to visit Jacob. I haven't seen him in months.\" When Charlie spoke again, his voice was much happier. \"That's a great idea, Bells. Do you have a pen?\" The directions he gave me were very simple. I assured him that I would be back for dinner, though he tried to tell me not to hurry. He wanted to join me in La Push, and I wasn't having that. So it was with a deadline that I drove too quickly through the storm-darkened streets out of town. I hoped I could get Jacob alone. Billy would probably tell on me if he knew what I was up to. While I drove, I worried a little bit about Billy's reaction to seeing me. He would be too pleased. In Billy's mind, no doubt, this had all worked out better than he had dared to hope. His pleasure and relief would only remind me of the one I couldn't bear to be reminded of. Not again today, I pleaded silently. I was spent. The Blacks' house was vaguely familiar, a small wooden place with narrow windows, the dull red paint making it resemble a tiny barn. Jacob's head peered out of the window before I could even get out of the truck. No doubt the familiar roar of the engine had tipped him off to my approach. Jacob had been very grateful when Charlie bought Billy's truck for me, saving Jacob from having to drive it when he came of age. I liked my truck very much, but Jacob seemed to consider the speed restrictions a shortcoming. He met me halfway to the house. \"Bella!\" His excited grin stretched wide across his face, the bright teeth standing in vivid contrast to the deep russet color of his skin. I'd never seen his hair out of its usual ponytail before. It fell like black satin curtains on either side of his broad face. Jacob had grown into some of his potential in the last eight months. He'd passed that point where the soft muscles of childhood hardened into the solid, lanky build of a teenager; the tendons and veins had become prominent under the red-brown skin of his arms, his hands. His face was still sweet like I remembered it, though it had hardened, too\u2014the planes of his cheekbones sharper, his jaw squared off, all childish roundness gone. \"Hey, Jacob!\" I felt an unfamiliar surge of enthusiasm at his smile. I realized that I was pleased to see him. This knowledge surprised me. I smiled back, and something clicked silently into place, like two corresponding puzzle pieces. I'd forgotten how much I really liked Jacob Black. He stopped a few feet away from me, and I stared up at him in surprise, leaning my head back though the rain pelted my face. \"You grew again!\" I accused in amazement. He laughed, his smile widening impossibly. \"Six five,\" he announced with self-satisfaction. His voice was deeper, but it had the husky tone I remembered. \"Is it ever going to stop?\" I shook my head in disbelief. \"You're huge.\" \"Still a beanpole, though.\" He grimaced. \"Come inside! You're getting all wet.\" He led the way, twisting his hair in his big hands as he walked. He pulled a rubber band from his hip pocket and wound it around the bundle. \"Hey, Dad,\" he called as he ducked to get through the front door. \"Look who stopped by.\" Billy was in the tiny square living room, a book in his hands. He set the book in his lap and wheeled himself forward when he saw me. \"Well, what do you know! It's good to see you, Bella.\" We shook hands. Mine was lost in his wide grasp. \"What brings you out here? Everything okay with Charlie?\" \"Yes, absolutely. I just wanted to see Jacob\u2014I haven't seen him in forever.\" Jacob's eyes brightened at my words. He was smiling so big it looked like it would hurt his cheeks.  \"Can you stay for dinner?\" Billy was eager, too. \"No, I've got to feed Charlie, you know.\" \"I'll call him now,\" Billy suggested. \"He's always invited.\" I laughed to hide my discomfort. \"It's not like you'll never see me again. I promise I'll be back again soon\u2014so much you'll get sick of me.\" After all, if Jacob could fix the bike, someone had to teach me how to ride it. Billy chuckled in response. \"Okay, maybe next time.\" \"So, Bella, what do you want to do?\" Jacob asked. \"Whatever. What were you doing before I interrupted?\" I was strangely comfortable here. It was familiar, but only distantly. There were no painful reminders of the recent past. Jacob hesitated. \"I was just heading out to work on my car, but we can do something else\u2026\" \"No, that's perfect!\" I interrupted. \"I'd love to see your car.\" \"Okay,\" he said, not convinced. \"It's out back, in the garage.\" Even better, I thought to myself. I waved at Billy. \"See you later.\" A thick stand of trees and shrubbery concealed his garage from the house. The garage\u00a0\u00a0 was no more than a couple of big preformed sheds that had been bolted together with their interior walls knocked out.  Under this shelter, raised on cinder blocks, was what looked to me like a completed automobile. I recognized the symbol on the grille, at least. \"What kind of Volkswagen is that?\" I asked. \"It's an old Rabbit\u20141986, a classic.\" \"How's it going?\" \"Almost finished,\" he said cheerfully. And then his voice dropped into a lower key. \"My dad made good on his promise last spring.\" \"Ah,\" I said. He seemed to understand my reluctance to open the subject. I tried not to remember last May at the prom. Jacob had been bribed by his father with money and car parts to deliver a message there. Billy wanted me to stay a safe distance from the most important person in my life. It turned out that his concern was, in the end, unnecessary. I was all too safe now. But I was going to see what I could do to change that. \"Jacob, what do you know about motorcycles?\" I asked. He shrugged. \"Some. My friend Embry has a dirt bike. We work on it together sometimes. Why?\" \"Well\u2026\" I pursed my lips as I considered. I wasn't sure if he could keep his mouth shut, but I didn't have many other options. \"I recently acquired a couple of bikes, and they're not in the greatest condition. I wonder if you could get them running?\" \"Cool.\" He seemed truly pleased by the challenge. His face glowed. \"I'll give it a try.\" I held up one finger in warning. \"The thing is,\" I explained, \"Charlie doesn't approve of motorcycles. \u00a0Honestly, he'd probably bust a vein in his forehead if he knew about this. So you can't tell Billy.\" \"Sure, sure.\" Jacob smiled. \"I understand.\" \"I'll pay you,\" I continued. This offended him. \"No. I want to help. You can't pay me.\" \"Well\u2026 how about a trade, then?\" I was making this up as I went, but it seemed reasonable enough. \"I only need one bike\u2014and I'll need lessons, too. So how about this? I'll give you the other bike, and then you can teach me.\" \"Swee-eet.\" He made the word into two syllables. \"Wait a sec\u2014are you legal yet? When's your birthday?\" \"You missed it,\" he teased, narrowing his eyes in mock resentment. \"I'm sixteen.\" \"Not that your age ever stopped you before,\" I muttered. \"Sorry about your birthday.\" \"Don't worry about it. I missed yours. What are you, forty?\" I sniffed. \"Close.\" \"We'll have a joint party to make up for it.\" \"Sounds like a date.\" His eyes sparkled at the word. I needed to reign in the enthusiasm before I gave him the wrong idea\u2014it was just that it had been a long time since I'd felt so light and buoyant. The rarity of the feeling made it more difficult to manage. \"Maybe when the bikes are finished\u2014our present to ourselves,\" I added. \"Deal. When will you bring them down?\" I bit my lip, embarrassed. \"They're in my truck now,\" I admitted. \"Great.\" He seemed to mean it. \"Will Billy see if we bring them around?\" He winked at me. \"We'll be sneaky.\" We eased around from the east, sticking to the trees when we were in view of the windows, affecting a casual-looking stroll, just in case. Jacob unloaded the bikes swiftly from the truck bed, wheeling them one by one into the shrubbery where I hid. It looked too easy for him\u2014I'd remembered the bikes being much, much heavier than that. \"These aren't half bad,\" Jacob appraised as we pushed them through the cover of the trees. \"This one here will actually be worth something when I'm done\u2014it's an old Harley Sprint.\" \"That one's yours, then.\" \"Are you sure?\" \"Absolutely.\" \"These are going to take some cash, though,\" he said, frowning down at the blackened metal. \"We'll have to save up for parts first.\" \"We nothing,\" I disagreed. \"If you're doing this for free, I'll pay for the parts.\" \"I don't know\u2026\" he muttered. \"I've got some money saved. College fund, you know.\" College, schmollege, I thought to myself. It wasn't like I'd saved up enough to go anywhere special\u2014and besides, I had no desire to leave Forks anyway. What difference would it make if I skimmed a little bit off the top? Jacob just nodded. This all made perfect sense to him. As we skulked back to the makeshift garage, I contemplated my luck. Only a teenage boy would agree to this: deceiving both our parents while repairing dangerous vehicles using money meant for my college education. He didn't see anything wrong with that picture. Jacob was a gift from the gods.",
