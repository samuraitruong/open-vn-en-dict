            "en": "9      9. THEORY \"Can I ask just one more?\" I pleaded as Edward accelerated much too quickly down the quiet street. He didn't seem to be paying any attention to the road. He sighed. \"One,\" he agreed. His lips pressed together into a cautious line. \"Well\u2026 you said you knew I hadn't gone into the bookstore, and that I had gone south. I was just wondering how you knew that.\" He looked away, deliberating. \"I thought we were past all the evasiveness,\" I grumbled. He almost smiled. \"Fine, then. I followed your scent.\" He looked at the road, giving me time to compose my face. I couldn't think of an acceptable response to that, but I filed it carefully away for future study. I tried to refocus. I wasn't ready to let him be finished, now that he was finally explaining things. \"And then you didn't answer one of my first questions\u2026\" I stalled. He looked at me with disapproval. \"Which one?\" \"How does it work \u2014 the mind-reading thing? Can you read anybody's mind, anywhere? How do you do it? Can the rest of your family\u2026 ?\" I felt silly, asking for clarification on make-believe. \"That's more than one,\" he pointed out. I simply intertwined my fingers and gazed at him, waiting. \"No, it's just me. And I can't hear anyone, anywhere. I have to be fairly close. The more familiar someone's\u2026 'voice' is, the farther away I can hear them. But still, no more than a few miles.\" He paused thoughtfully. \"It's a little like being in a huge hall filled with people, everyone talking at once. It's just a hum \u2014 a buzzing of voices in the background. Until I focus on one voice, and then what they're thinking is clear. \u00a0\"Most of the time I tune it all out \u2014 it can be very distracting. And then it's easier to seem normal\" \u2014 he frowned as he said the word \u2014 \"when I'm not accidentally answering someone's thoughts rather than their words.\" \"Why do you think you can't hear me?\" I asked curiously. He looked at me, his eyes enigmatic. \"I don't know,\" he murmured. \"The only guess I have is that maybe your mind doesn't work the same way the rest of theirs do. Like your thoughts are on the AM frequency and I'm only getting FM.\" He grinned at me, suddenly amused. \"My mind doesn't work right? I'm a freak?\" The words bothered me more than they should \u2014 probably because his speculation hit home. I'd always suspected as much, and it embarrassed me to have it confirmed. \"I hear voices in my mind and you're worried that you're the freak,\" he laughed. \"Don't worry, it's just a theory\u2026\" His face tightened. \"Which brings us back to you.\" I sighed. How to begin? \"Aren't we past all the evasions now?\" he reminded me softly. I looked away from his face for the first time, trying to find words. I happened to notice the speedometer. \"Holy crow!\" I shouted. \"Slow down!\" \"What's wrong?\" He was startled. But the car didn't decelerate. \"You're going a hundred miles an hour!\" I was still shouting. I shot a panicky glance out the window, but it was too dark to see much. The road was only visible in the long patch of bluish brightness from the headlights. The forest along both sides of the road was like a black wall \u2014 as hard as a wall of steel if we veered off the road at this speed. \"Relax, Bella.\" He rolled his eyes, still not slowing. \"Are you trying to kill us?\" I demanded. \"We're not going to crash.\" I tried to modulate my voice. \"Why are you in such a hurry?\" \"I always drive like this.\" He turned to smile crookedly at me. \"Keep your eyes on the road!\" \"I've never been in an accident, Bella \u2014 I've never even gotten a ticket.\" He grinned and tapped his forehead. \"Built-in radar detector.\" \"Very funny.\" I fumed. \"Charlie's a cop, remember? I was raised to abide by traffic laws. Besides, if you turn us into a Volvo pretzel around a tree trunk, you can probably just walk away.\" \"Probably,\" he agreed with a short, hard laugh. \"But you can't.\" He sighed, and I watched with relief as the needle gradually drifted toward eighty. \"Happy?\" \"Almost.\" \"I hate driving slow,\" he muttered. \"This is slow?\" \"Enough commentary on my driving,\" he snapped. \"I'm still waiting for your latest theory.\" I bit my lip. He looked down at me, his honey eyes unexpectedly gentle. \"I won't laugh,\" he promised. \"I'm more afraid that you'll be angry with me.\" \"Is it that bad?\" \"Pretty much, yeah.\" He waited. I was looking down at my hands, so I couldn't see his expression. \"Go ahead.\" His voice was calm. \"I don't know how to start,\" I admitted. \"Why don't you start at the beginning\u2026 you said you didn't come up with this on your own.\" \"No.\" \"What got you started \u2014 a book? A movie?\" he probed. \"No \u2014 it was Saturday, at the beach.\" I risked a glance up at his face. He looked puzzled. \"I ran into an old family friend \u2014Jacob Black,\" I continued. \"His dad and Charlie have been friends since I was a baby.\" He still looked confused. \"His dad is one of the Quileute elders.\" I watched him carefully. His confused expression froze in place. \"We went for a walk \u2014\" I edited all my scheming out of the story \"\u2014 and he was telling me some old legends \u2014 trying to scare me, I think. He told me one\u2026\" I hesitated. \"Go on,\" he said. \"About vampires.\" I realized I was whispering. I couldn't look at his face now. But I saw his knuckles tighten convulsively on the wheel. \"And you immediately thought of me?\" Still calm. \"No. He\u2026 mentioned your family.\" He was silent, staring at the road. I was worried suddenly, worried about protecting Jacob. \"He just thought it was a silly superstition,\" I said quickly. \"He didn't expect me to think anything of it.\" It didn't seem like enough; I had to confess. \"It was my fault, I forced him to tell me.\" \"Why?\" \"Lauren said something about you \u2014 she was trying to provoke me. And an older boy from the tribe said your family didn't come to the reservation, only it sounded like he meant something different. So I got Jacob alone and I tricked it out of him,\" I admitted, hanging my head.  He startled me by laughing. I glared up at him. He was laughing, but his eyes were fierce, staring ahead. \"Tricked him how?\" he asked. \"I tried to flirt \u2014 it worked better than I thought it would.\" Disbelief colored my tone as I remembered. \"I'd like to have seen that.\" He chuckled darkly. \"And you accused me of dazzling people \u2014 poor Jacob Black.\" I blushed and looked out my window into the night. \"What did you do then?\" he asked after a minute. \"I did some research on the Internet.\" \"And did that convince you?\" His voice sounded barely interested. But his hands were clamped hard onto the steering wheel. \"No. Nothing fit. Most of it was kind of silly. And then\u2026\" I stopped. \"What?\" \"I decided it didn't matter,\" I whispered. \"It didn't matter?\" His tone made me look up \u2014 I had finally broken through his carefully composed mask. His face was incredulous, with just a hint of the anger I'd feared. \"No,\" I said softly. \"It doesn't matter to me what you are.\" A hard, mocking edge entered his voice. \"You don't care if I'm a monster? If I'm not human!\" \"No.\" He was silent, staring straight ahead again. His face was bleak and cold. \"You're angry,\" I sighed. \"I shouldn't have said anything.\" \"No,\" he said, but his tone was as hard as his face. \"I'd rather know what you're thinking \u2014 even if what you're thinking is insane.\" \"So I'm wrong again?\" I challenged. \"That's not what I was referring to. 'It doesn't matter'!\" he quoted, gritting his teeth together.  \"I'm right?\" I gasped. \"Does it matter?\" I took a deep breath. \"Not really.\" I paused. \"But I am curious.\" My voice, at least, was composed. He was suddenly resigned. \"What are you curious about?\" \"How old are you?\" \"Seventeen,\" he answered promptly. \"And how long have you been seventeen?\" His lips twitched as he stared at the road. \"A while,\" he admitted at last. \"Okay.\" I smiled, pleased that he was still being honest with me. He stared down at me with watchful eyes, much as he had before, when he was worried I would go into shock. I smiled wider in encouragement, and he frowned. \"Don't laugh \u2014 but how can you come out during the daytime?\" He laughed anyway. \"Myth.\" \"Burned by the sun?\" \"Myth.\" \"Sleeping in coffins?\" \"Myth.\" He hesitated for a moment, and a peculiar tone entered his voice. \"I can't sleep.\" It took me a minute to absorb that. \"At all?\" \"Never,\" he said, his voice nearly inaudible. He turned to look at me with a <em>wistful</em> expression. The golden eyes held mine, and I lost my train of thought. I stared at him until he looked away. \"You haven't asked me the most important question yet.\" His voice was hard now, and when he looked at me again his eyes were cold. I blinked, still dazed. \"Which one is that?\" \"You aren't concerned about my diet?\" he asked sarcastically. \"Oh,\" I murmured, \"that.\" \"Yes, that.\" His voice was bleak. \"Don't you want to know if I drink blood?\" I flinched. \"Well, Jacob said something about that.\" \"What did Jacob say?\" he asked flatly. \"He said you didn't\u2026 hunt people. He said your family wasn't supposed to be dangerous because you only hunted animals.\" \"He said we weren't dangerous?\" His voice was deeply skeptical. \"Not exactly. He said you weren't supposed to be dangerous. But the Quileutes still didn't want you on their land, just in case.\" He looked forward, but I couldn't tell if he was watching the road or not. \"So was he right? About not hunting people?\" I tried to keep my voice as even as possible. \"The Quileutes have a long memory,\" he whispered. I took it as a confirmation. \"Don't let that make you complacent, though,\" he warned me. \"They're right to keep their distance from us. We are still dangerous.\" \"I don't understand.\" \"We try,\" he explained slowly. \"We're usually very good at what we do. Sometimes we make mistakes. Me, for example, allowing myself to be alone with you.\" \"This is a mistake?\" I heard the sadness in my voice, but I didn't know if he could as well. \"A very dangerous one,\" he murmured. We were both silent then. I watched the headlights twist with the curves of the road. They moved too fast; it didn't look real, it looked like a video game. I was aware of the time slipping away so quickly, like the black road beneath us, and I was hideously afraid that I would never have another chance to be with him like this again \u2014 openly, the walls between us gone for once. His words hinted at an end, and I recoiled from the idea. I couldn't waste one minute I had with him. \"Tell me more,\" I asked desperately, not caring what he said, just so I could hear his voice again. He looked at me quickly, startled by the change in my tone. \"What more do you want to know?\" \"Tell me why you hunt animals instead of people,\" I suggested, my voice still tinged with desperation. I realized my eyes were wet, and I fought against the grief that was trying to overpower me. \"I don't want to be a monster.\" His voice was very low. \"But animals aren't enough?\" He paused. \"I can't be sure, of course, but I'd compare it to living on tofu and soy milk; we call ourselves vegetarians, our little inside joke. It doesn't completely satiate the hunger \u2014 or rather thirst. But it keens us strong enough to resist. Most of the time.\" His tone turned ominous. \"Sometimes it's more difficult than others.\" \"Is it very difficult for you now?\" I asked. He sighed. \"Yes.\" \"But you're not hungry now,\" I said confidently \u2014 stating, not asking. \"Why do you think that?\" \"Your eyes. I told you I had a theory. I've noticed that people \u2014 men in particular \u2014 are crabbier when they're hungry.\" He chuckled. \"You are observant, aren't you?\" I didn't answer; I just listened to the sound of his laugh, committing it to memory. \"Were you hunting this weekend, with Emmett?\" I asked when it was quiet again. \"Yes.\" He paused for a second, as if deciding whether or not to say something. \"I didn't want to leave, but it was necessary. It's a bit easier to be around you when I'm not thirsty.\" \"Why didn't you want to leave?\" \"It makes me\u2026 anxious\u2026 to be away from you.\" His eyes were gentle but intense, and they seemed to be making my bones turn soft. \"I wasn't joking when I asked you to try not to fall in the ocean or get run over last Thursday. I was distracted all weekend, worrying about you. And after what happened tonight, I'm surprised that you did make it through a whole weekend unscathed.\" He shook his head, and then seemed to remember something. \"Well, not totally unscathed.\" \"What?\" \"Your hands,\" he reminded me. I looked down at my palms, at the almost-healed scrapes across the heels of my hands. His eyes missed nothing. \"I fell,\" I sighed. \"That's what I thought.\" His lips curved up at the corners. \"I suppose, being you, it could have been much worse \u2014 and that possibility tormented me the entire time I was away. It was a very long three days. I really got on Emmett's nerves.\" He smiled ruefully at me. \"Three days? Didn't you just get back today?\" \"No, we got back Sunday.\" \"Then why weren't any of you in school?\" I was frustrated, almost angry as I thought of how much disappointment I had suffered because of his absence. \"Well, you asked if the sun hurt me, and it doesn't. But I can't go out in the sunlight \u2014 at least, not where anyone can see.\" \"Why?\" \"I'll show you sometime,\" he promised.  I thought about it for a moment. \"You might have called me,\" I decided. He was puzzled. \"But I knew you were safe.\" \"But I didn't know where you were. I \u2014\" I hesitated, dropping my eyes. \"What?\" His velvety voice was compelling. \"I didn't like it. Not seeing you. It makes me anxious, too.\" I blushed to be saying this out loud. He was quiet. I glanced up, apprehensive, and saw that his expression was pained. \"Ah,\" he groaned quietly. \"This is wrong.\" I couldn't understand his response. \"What did I say?\" \"Don't you see, Bella? It's one thing for me to make myself miserable, but a wholly other thing for you to be so involved.\" He turned his anguished eyes to the road, his words flowing almost too fast for me to understand. \"I don't want to hear that you feel that way.\" His voice was low but urgent. His words cut me. \"It's wrong. It's not safe. I'm dangerous, Bella \u2014 please, grasp that.\" \" No.\" I tried very hard not to look like a sulky child. \"I'm serious,\" he growled. \"So am I. I told you, it doesn't matter what you are. It's too late.\" His voice whipped out, low and harsh. \"Never say that.\" I bit my lip and was glad he couldn't know how much that hurt. I stared out at the road. We must be close now. He was driving much too fast.  \"What are you thinking?\" he asked, his voice still raw. I just shook my head, not sure if I could speak. I could feel his gaze on my face, but I kept my eyes forward. \"Are you crying?\" He sounded appalled. I hadn't realized the moisture in my eyes had brimmed over. I quickly rubbed my hand across my cheek, and sure enough, traitor tears were there, betraying me.  \"No,\" I said, but my voice cracked. I saw him reach toward me hesitantly with his right hand, but then he stopped and placed it slowly back on the steering wheel. \"I'm sorry.\" His voice burned with regret. I knew he wasn't just apologizing for the words that had upset me. The darkness slipped by us in silence. \"Tell me something,\" he asked after another minute, and I could hear him struggle to use a lighter tone. \"Yes?\" \"What were you thinking tonight, just before I came around the corner? I couldn't understand your expression \u2014 you didn't look that scared, you looked like you were concentrating very hard on something.\" \"I was trying to remember how to incapacitate an attacker \u2014 you know, self-defense. I was going to smash his nose into his brain.\" I thought of the dark-haired man with a surge of hate. \"You were going to fight them?\" This upset him. \"Didn't you think about running?\" \"I fall down a lot when I run,\" I admitted. \"What about screaming for help?\" \"I was getting to that part.\" He shook his head. \"You were right \u2014 I'm definitely fighting fate trying to keep you alive.\" I sighed. We were slowing, passing into the boundaries of Forks. It had taken less than twenty minutes. \"Will I see you tomorrow?\" I demanded. \"Yes \u2014 I have a paper due, too.\" He smiled. \"I'll save you a seat at lunch.\" It was silly, after everything we'd been through tonight, how that little promise sent flutters through my stomach, and made me unable to speak. We were in front of Charlie's house. The lights were on, my truck in its place, everything utterly normal. It was like waking from a dream. He stopped the car, but I didn't move. \"Do you promise to be there tomorrow?\" \"I promise.\" I considered that for a moment, then nodded. I pulled his jacket off, taking one last whiff. \"You can keep it \u2014 you don't have a jacket for tomorrow,\" he reminded me. I handed it back to him. \"I don't want to have to explain to Charlie.\" \"Oh, right.\" He grinned. I hesitated, my hand on the door handle, trying to prolong the moment. \"Bella?\" he asked in a different tone \u2014 serious, but hesitant. \"Yes?\" I turned back to him too eagerly. \"Will you promise me something?\" \"Yes,\" I said, and instantly regretted my unconditional agreement. What if he asked me to stay away from him? I couldn't keep that promise. \"Don't go into the woods alone.\" I stared at him in blank confusion. \"Why?\" He frowned, and his eyes were tight as he stared past me out the window. \"I'm not always the most dangerous thing out there. Let's leave it at that.\" I shuddered slightly at the sudden bleakness in his voice, but I was relieved. This, at least, was an easy promise to honor. \"Whatever you say.\" \"I'll see you tomorrow,\" he sighed, and I knew he wanted me to leave now. \"Tomorrow, then.\" I opened the door unwillingly. \"Bella?\" I turned and he was leaning toward me, his pale, glorious face just inches from mine. My heart stopped beating. \"Sleep well,\" he said. His breath blew in my face, stunning me. It was the same exquisite scent that clung to his jacket, but in a more concentrated form. I blinked, thoroughly dazed. He leaned away. I was unable to move until my brain had somewhat unscrambled itself. Then I stepped out of the car awkwardly, having to use the frame for support. I thought I heard him chuckle, but the sound was too quiet for me to be certain. He waited till I had stumbled to the front door, and then I heard his engine quietly rev. I turned to watch the silver car disappear around the corner. I realized it was very cold. I reached for the key mechanically, unlocked the door, and stepped inside. Charlie called from the living room. \"Bella?\" \"Yeah, Dad, it's me.\" I walked in to see him. He was watching a baseball game. \"You're home early.\" \"Am I?\" I was surprised. \"It's not even eight yet,\" he told me. \"Did you girls have fun?\" \"Yeah \u2014 it was lots of fun.\" My head was spinning as I tried to remember all the way back to the girls' night out I had planned. \"They both found dresses.\" \"Are you all right?\" \"I'm just tired. I did a lot of walking.\" \"Well, maybe you should go lie down.\" He sounded concerned. I wondered what my face looked like. \"I'm just going to call Jessica first.\" \"Weren't you just with her?\" he asked, surprised. \"Yes \u2014 but I left my jacket in her car. I want to make sure she brings it tomorrow.\" \"Well, give her a chance to get home first.\" \"Right,\" I agreed. I went to the kitchen and fell, exhausted, into a chair. I was really feeling dizzy now. I wondered if I was going to go into shock after all. Get a grip, I told myself. The phone rang suddenly, startling me. I yanked it off the hook. \"Hello?\" I asked breathlessly. \"Bella?\" \"Hey, Jess, I was just going to call you.\" \"You made it home?\" Her voice was relieved\u2026 and surprised. \"Yes. I left my jacket in your car \u2014 could you bring it to me tomorrow?\" \"Sure. But tell me what happened!\" she demanded. \"Um, tomorrow \u2014 in Trig, okay?\" She caught on quickly. \"Oh, is your dad there?\" \"Yes, that's right.\" \"Okay, I'll talk to you tomorrow, then. Bye!\" I could hear the impatience in her voice. \"Bye, Jess.\" I walked up the stairs slowly, a heavy stupor clouding my mind. I went through the motions of getting ready for bed without paying any attention to what I was doing. It wasn't until I was in the shower \u2014 the water too hot, burning my skin \u2014 that I realized I was freezing. I shuddered violently for several minutes before the steaming spray could finally relax my rigid muscles. Then I stood in the shower, too tired to move, until the hot water began to run out. I stumbled out, wrapping myself securely in a towel, trying to hold the heat from the water in so the aching shivers wouldn't return. I dressed for bed swiftly and climbed under my quilt, curling into a ball, hugging myself to keep warm. A few small shudders trembled through me. My mind still swirled dizzily, full of images I couldn't understand, and some I fought to repress. Nothing seemed clear at first, but as I fell gradually closer to unconsciousness, a few certainties became evident. About three things I was absolutely positive. First, Edward was a vampire. Second, there was part of him \u2014 and I didn't know how potent that part might be \u2014 that thirsted for my blood. And third, I was unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him.",

            "en": "20             20. IMPATIENCE When I woke up I was confused. My thoughts were hazy, still twisted up in dreams and nightmares; it took me longer than it should have to realize where I was. This room was too bland to belong anywhere but in a hotel. The bedside lamps, bolted to the tables, were a dead giveaway, as were the long drapes made from the same fabric as the bedspread, and the generic watercolor prints on the walls. I tried to remember how I got here, but nothing came at first. I did remember the sleek black car, the glass in the windows darker than that on a limousine. The engine was almost silent, though we'd raced across the black freeways at more than twice the legal speed. And I remembered Alice sitting with me on the dark leather backseat. Somehow, during the long night, my head had ended up against her granite neck. My closeness didn't seem to bother her at all, and her cool, hard skin was oddly comforting to me. The front of her thin cotton shirt was cold, damp with the tears that streamed from my eyes until, red and sore, they ran dry. Sleep had evaded me; my aching eyes strained open even though the night finally ended and dawn broke over a low peak somewhere in California. The gray light, streaking across the cloudless sky, stung my eyes. But I couldn't close them; when I did, the images that flashed all too vividly, like still slides behind my lids, were unbearable. Charlie's broken expression \u2014 Edward's brutal snarl, teeth bared \u2014 Rosalie's resentful glare \u2014 the keen-eyed scrutiny of the tracker \u2014 the dead look in Edward's eyes after he kissed me the last time\u2026 I couldn't stand to see them. So I fought against my weariness and the sun rose higher. I was still awake when we came through a shallow mountain pass and the sun, behind us now, reflected off the tiled rooftops of the Valley of the Sun. I didn't have enough emotion left to be surprised that we'd made a three-day journey in one. I stared blankly at the wide, flat expanse laid out in front of me. Phoenix \u2014 the palm trees, the scrubby creosote, the haphazard lines of the intersecting freeways, the green swaths of golf courses and turquoise splotches of swimming pools, all submerged in a thin smog and embraced by the short, rocky ridges that weren't really big enough to be called mountains. The shadows of the palm trees slanted across the freeway \u2014 defined, sharper than I remembered, paler than they should be. Nothing could hide in these shadows. The bright, open freeway seemed benign enough. But I felt no relief, no sense of homecoming. \"Which way to the airport, Bella?\" Jasper had asked, and I flinched, though his voice was quite soft and un-alarming. It was the first sound, besides the purr of the car, to break the long night's silence. \"Stay on the I-ten,\" I'd answered automatically. \"We'll pass right by it.\" My brain had worked slowly through the fog of sleep deprivation. \"Are we flying somewhere?\" I'd asked Alice. \"No, but it's better to be close, just in case.\" I remembered beginning the loop around Sky Harbor International\u2026 but not ending it. I suppose that must have been when I'd fallen asleep. Though, now that I'd chased the memories down, I did have a vague impression of leaving the car \u2014 the sun was just falling behind the horizon \u2014 my arm draped over Alice's shoulder and her arm firm around my waist, dragging me along as I stumbled through the warm, dry shadows. I had no memory of this room. I looked at the digital clock on the nightstand. The red numbers claimed it was three o'clock, but they gave no indication if it was night or day. No edge of light escaped the thick curtains, but the room was bright with the light from the lamps. I rose stiffly and staggered to the window, pulling back the drapes. It was dark outside. Three in the morning, then. My room looked out on a deserted section of the freeway and the new long-term parking garage for the airport. It was slightly comforting to be able to pinpoint time and place. I looked down at myself. I was still wearing Esme's clothes, and they didn't fit very well at all. I looked around the room, glad when I discovered my duffel bag on top of the low dresser. I was on my way to find new clothes when a light tap on the door made me jump. \"Can I come in?\" Alice asked. I took a deep breath. \"Sure.\" She walked in, and looked me over cautiously. \"You look like you could sleep longer,\" she said. I just shook my head. She drifted silently to the curtains and closed them securely before turning back to me. \"We'll need to stay inside,\" she told me. \"Okay.\" My voice was hoarse; it cracked. \"Thirsty?\" she asked. I shrugged. \"I'm okay. How about you?\" \"Nothing unmanageable.\" She smiled. \"I ordered some food for you, it's in the front room. Edward reminded me that you have to eat a lot more frequently than we do.\" I was instantly more alert. \"He called?\" \"No,\" she said, and watched as my face fell. \"It was before we left.\" She took my hand carefully and led me through the door into the living room of the hotel suite. I could hear a low buzz of voices coming from the TV. Jasper sat motionlessly at the desk in the corner, his eyes watching the news with no glimmer of interest. I sat on the floor next to the coffee table, where a tray of food waited, and began picking at it without noticing what I was eating. Alice perched on the arm of the sofa and stared blankly at the TV like Jasper. I ate slowly, watching her, turning now and then to glance quickly at Jasper. It began to dawn on me that they were too still. They never looked away from the screen, though commercials were playing now. I pushed the tray away, my stomach abruptly uneasy. Alice looked down at me. \"What's wrong, Alice?\" I asked. \"Nothing's wrong.\" Her eyes were wide, honest\u2026 and I didn't trust them. \"What do we do now?\" \"We wait for Carlisle to call.\" \"And should he have called by now?\" I could see that I was near the mark. Alice's eyes flitted from mine to the phone on top of her leather bag and back. \"What does that mean?\" My voice quavered, and I fought to control it. \"That he hasn't called yet?\" \"It just means that they don't have anything to tell us.\" But her voice was too even, and the air was harder to breathe. Jasper was suddenly beside Alice, closer to me than usual. \"Bella,\" he said in a suspiciously soothing voice. \"You have nothing to worry about. You are completely safe here.\" \"I know that.\" \"Then why are you frightened?\" he asked, confused. He might feel the tenor of my emotions, but he couldn't read the reasons behind them. \"You heard what Laurent said.\" My voice was just a whisper, but I was sure they could hear me. \"He said James was lethal. What if something goes wrong, and they get separated? If something happens to any of them, Carlisle, Emmett\u2026 Edward\u2026\" I gulped. \"If that wild female hurts Esme\u2026\" My voice had grown higher, a note of hysteria beginning to rise in it. \"How could I live with myself when it's my fault? None of you should be risking yourselves for me \u2014\" \"Bella, Bella, stop,\" he interrupted me, his words pouring out so quickly they were hard to understand. \"You're worrying about all the wrong things, Bella. Trust me on this \u2014 none of us are in jeopardy. You are under too much strain as it is; don't add to it with wholly unnecessary worries. Listen to me!\" he ordered, for I had looked away. \"Our family is strong. Our only fear is losing you.\" \"But why should you \u2014\" Alice interrupted this time, touching my cheek with her cold fingers. \"It's been almost a century that Edward's been alone. Now he's found you. You can't see the changes that we see, we who have been with him for so long. Do you think any of us want to look into his eyes for the next hundred years if he loses you?\" My guilt slowly subsided as I looked into her dark eyes. But, even as the calm spread over me, I knew I couldn't trust my feelings with Jasper there. It was a very long day. We stayed in the room. Alice called down to the front desk and asked them to ignore our maid service for now. The windows stayed shut, the TV on, though no one watched it. At regular intervals, food was delivered for me. The silver phone resting on Alice's bag seemed to grow bigger as the hours passed. My babysitters handled the suspense better than I did. As I fidgeted and paced, they simply grew more still, two statues whose eyes followed me imperceptibly as I moved. I occupied myself with memorizing the room; the striped pattern of the couches, tan, peach, cream, dull gold, and tan again. Sometimes I stared at the abstract prints, randomly finding\u00a0 pictures in the shapes, like I'd found pictures in the clouds as a child. I traced a blue hand, a woman combing her hair, a cat stretching. But when the pale red circle became a staring eye, I looked away.  As the afternoon wore on, I went back to bed, simply for something to do. I hoped that by myself in the dark, I could give in to the terrible fears that hovered on the edge of my consciousness, unable to break through under Jasper's careful supervision. But Alice followed me casually, as if by some coincidence she had grown tired of the front room at the same time. I was beginning to wonder exactly what sort of instructions Edward had given her. I lay across the bed, and she sat, legs folded, next to me. I ignored her at first, suddenly tired enough to sleep. But after a few minutes, the panic that had held off in Jasper's presence began to make itself known. I gave up on the idea of sleep quickly then, curling up into a small ball, wrapping my arms around my legs. \"Alice?\" I asked. \"Yes?\" I kept my voice very calm. \"What do you think they're doing?\" \"Carlisle wanted to lead the tracker as far north as possible, wait for him to get close, and then turn and ambush him. Esme and Rosalie were supposed to head west as long as they could keep the female behind them.\u00a0 If she turned around, they were to head back to Forks and keep an eye on your dad. So I imagine things are going well if they can't call. It means the tracker is close enough that they don't want him to overhear.\" \"And Esme?\" \"I think she must be back in Forks. She won't call if there's any chance the female will overhear. I expect they're all just being very careful.\" \"Do you think they're safe, really?\" \"Bella, how many times do we have to tell you that there's no danger to us?\" \"Would you tell me the truth, though?\" \"Yes. I will always tell you the truth.\" Her voice was earnest. I deliberated for a moment, and decided she meant it. \"Tell me then\u2026 how do you become a vampire?\" My question caught her off guard. She was quiet. I rolled over to look at her, and her expression seemed ambivalent. \"Edward doesn't want me to tell you that,\" she said firmly, but I sensed she didn't agree. \"That's not fair. I think I have a right to know.\" \"I know.\" I looked at her, waiting. She sighed. \"He'll be extremely angry.\" \"It's none of his business. This is between you and me. Alice, as a friend, I'm begging you.\" And we were friends now, somehow \u2014 as she must have known we would be all along. She looked at me with her splendid, wise eyes\u2026 choosing. \"I'll tell you the mechanics of it,\" she said finally, \"but I don't remember it myself, and I've never done it or seen it done, so keep in mind that I can only tell you the theory.\" I waited. \"As predators, we have a glut of weapons in our physical arsenal \u2014 much, much more than really necessary. The strength, the speed, the acute senses, not to mention those of us like Edward, Jasper, and I, who have extra senses as well. And then, like a carnivorous flower, we are physically attractive to our prey.\" I was very still, remembering how pointedly Edward had demonstrated the same concept for me in the meadow. She smiled a wide, ominous smile. \"We have another fairly superfluous weapon. We're also venomous,\" she said, her teeth glistening. \"The venom doesn't kill \u2014 it's merely incapacitating. It works slowly, spreading through the bloodstream, so that, once bitten, our prey is in too much physical pain to escape us. Mostly superfluous, as I said. If we're that close, the prey doesn't escape. Of course, there are always exceptions.\u00a0 Carlisle, for example.\" \"So\u2026 if the venom is left to spread\u2026\" I murmured. \"It takes a few days for the transformation to be complete, depending on how much venom is in the bloodstream, how close the venom enters to the heart. As long as the heart keeps beating, the poison spreads, healing, changing the body as it moves through it. Eventually the heart stops, and the conversion is finished. But all that time, every minute of it, a victim would be wishing for death.\" I shivered. \"It's not pleasant, you see.\" \"Edward said that it was very hard to do\u2026 I don't quite understand,\" I said. \"We're also like sharks in a way. Once we taste the blood, or even smell it for that matter, it becomes very hard to keep from feeding. Sometimes impossible. So you see, to actually bite someone, to taste the blood, it would begin the frenzy. It's difficult on both sides \u2014 the blood-lust on the one hand, the awful pain on the other.\" \"Why do you think you don't remember?\" \"I don't know. For everyone else, the pain of transformation is the sharpest memory they have of their human life. I remember nothing of being human.\" Her voice was <em>wistful</em>. We lay silently, wrapped in our individual meditations. The seconds ticked by, and I had almost forgotten her presence, I was so enveloped in my thoughts. Then, without any warning, Alice leaped from the bed, landing lightly on her feet. My head jerked up as I stared at her, startled. \"Something's changed.\" Her voice was urgent, and she wasn't talking to me anymore. She reached the door at the same time Jasper did. He had obviously heard our conversation and her sudden exclamation. He put his hands on her shoulders and guided her back to the bed, sitting her on the edge. \"What do you see?\" he asked intently, staring into her eyes. Her eyes were focused on something very far away. I sat close to her, leaning in to catch her low, quick voice. \"I see a room. It's long, and there are mirrors everywhere. The floor is wooden. He's in the room, and he's waiting. There's gold\u2026 a gold stripe across the mirrors.\" \"Where is the room?\" \"I don't know. Something is missing \u2014 another decision hasn't been made yet.\" \"How much time?\" \"It's soon. He'll be in the mirror room today, or maybe tomorrow. It all depends. He's waiting for something. And he's in the dark now.\" Jasper's voice was calm, methodical, as he questioned her in a practiced way. \"What is he doing?\" \"He's watching TV\u2026 no, he's running a VCR, in the dark, in another place.\" \"Can you see where he is?\" \"No, it's too dark.\" \"And the mirror room, what else is there?\" \"Just the mirrors, and the gold. It's a band, around the room. And there's a black table with a big stereo, and a TV. He's touching the VCR there, but he doesn't watch the way he does in the dark room. This is the room where he waits.\" Her eyes drifted, then focused on Jasper's face. \"There's nothing else?\" She shook her head. They looked at each other, motionless. \"What does it mean?\" I asked. Neither of them answered for a moment, then Jasper looked at me. \"It means the tracker's plans have changed. He's made a decision that will lead him to the mirror room, and the dark room.\" \"But we don't know where those rooms are?\" \"No.\" \"But we do know that he won't be in the mountains north of Washington, being hunted. He'll elude them.\" Alice's voice was bleak.  \"Should we call?\" I asked. They traded a serious look, undecided. And the phone rang. Alice was across the room before I could lift my head to look at it. She pushed a button and held the phone to her ear, but she didn't speak first. \"Carlisle,\" she breathed. She didn't seem surprised or relieved, the way I felt. \"Yes,\" she said, glancing at me. She listened for a long moment. \"I just saw him.\" She described again the vision she'd seen. \"Whatever made him get on that plane\u2026 it was leading him to those rooms.\" She paused. \"Yes,\" Alice said into the phone, and then she spoke to me. \"Bella?\" She held the phone out toward me. I ran to it. \"Hello?\" I breathed. \"Bella,\" Edward said. \"Oh, Edward! I was so worried.\" \"Bella,\" he sighed in frustration, \"I told you not to worry about anything but yourself.\" It was so unbelievably good to hear his voice. I felt the hovering cloud of despair lighten and drift back as he spoke. \"Where are you?\" \"We're outside of Vancouver. Bella, I'm sorry \u2014 we lost him. He seems suspicious of us \u2014 he's careful to stay just far enough away that I can't hear what he's thinking. But he's gone now \u2014 it looks like he got on a plane. We think he's heading back to Forks to start over.\" I could hear Alice filling in Jasper behind me, her quick words blurring together into a humming noise. \"I know. Alice saw that he got away.\" \"You don't have to worry, though. He won't find anything to lead him to you. You just have to stay there and wait till we find him again.\" \"I'll be fine. Is Esme with Charlie?\" \"Yes \u2014 the female has been in town. She went to the house, but while Charlie was at work. She hasn't gone near him, so don't be afraid. He's safe with Esme and Rosalie watching.\" \"What is she doing?\" \"Probably trying to pick up the trail. She's been all through the town during the night. Rosalie traced her through the airport, all the roads around town, the school\u2026 she's digging, Bella, but there's nothing to find.\" \"And you're sure Charlie's safe?\" \"Yes, Esme won't let him out of her sight. And we'll be there soon. If the tracker gets anywhere near Forks, we'll have him.\" \"I miss you,\" I whispered. \"I know, Bella. Believe me, I know. It's like you've taken half my self away with you.\" \"Come and get it, then,\" I challenged. \"Soon, as soon as I possibly can. I will make you safe first.\" His voice was hard. \"I love you,\" I reminded him. \"Could you believe that, despite everything I've put you through, I love you, too?\" \"Yes, I can, actually.\" \"I'll come for you soon.\" \"I'll be waiting.\" As soon as the phone went dead, the cloud of depression began to creep over me again. I turned to give the phone back to Alice and found her and Jasper bent over the table, where Alice was sketching on a piece of hotel stationery. I leaned on the back of the couch, looking over her shoulder. She drew a room: long, rectangular, with a thinner, square section at the back. The wooden planks that made up the floor stretched lengthwise across the room. Down the walls were lines denoting the breaks in the mirrors. And then, wrapping around the walls, waist high, a long band. The band Alice said was gold. \"It's a ballet studio,\" I said, suddenly recognizing the familiar shapes. They looked at me, surprised \"Do you know this room?\" Jasper's voice sounded calm, but there was an undercurrent of something I couldn't identify. Alice bent her head to her work, her hand flying across the page now, the shape of an emergency exit taking shape against the back wall, the stereo and TV on a low table by the front right corner. \"It looks like a place I used to go for dance lessons \u2014 when I was eight or nine. It was shaped just the same.\" I touched the page where the square section jutted out, narrowing the back part of the room. \"That's where the bathrooms were \u2014 the doors were through the other dance floor. But the stereo was here\" I pointed to the left corner \u2014 \"it was older, and there wasn't a TV. There was a window in the waiting room \u2014 you would see the room from this perspective if you looked through it.\" Alice and Jasper were staring at me. \"Are you sure it's the same room?\" Jasper asked, still calm. \"No, not at all \u2014 I suppose most dance studios would look the same \u2014 the mirrors, the bar.\" I traced my finger along the ballet bar set against the mirrors. \"It's just the shape that looked familiar.\" I touched the door, set in exactly the same place as the one I remembered. \"Would you have any reason to go there now?\" Alice asked, breaking my reverie. \"No, I haven't been there in almost ten years. I was a terrible dancer \u2014 they always put me in the back for recitals,\" I admitted. \"So there's no way it could be connected with you?\" Alice asked intently. \"No, I don't even think the same person owns it. I'm sure it's just another dance studio, somewhere.\" \"Where was the studio you went to?\" Jasper asked in a casual voice. \"It was just around the corner from my mom's house. I used to walk there after school\u2026\" I said, my voice trailing off. I didn't miss the look they exchanged. \"Here in Phoenix, then?\" His voice was still casual. \"Yes,\" I whispered. \"\nFifty-eighth Street and Cactus.\" We all sat in silence, staring at the drawing. \"Alice, is that phone safe?\" \"Yes,\" she reassured me. \"The number would just trace back to Washington.\" \"Then I can use it to call my mom.\" \"I thought she was in Florida.\" \"She is \u2014 but she's coming home soon, and she can't come back to that house while\u2026\"  My voice trembled. I was thinking about something Edward had said, about the red-haired female at Charlie's house, at the school, where my records would be. \"How will you reach her?\" \"They don't have a permanent number except at the house \u2014 she's supposed to check her messages regularly.\" \"Jasper?\" Alice asked. He thought about it. \"I don't think there's any way it could hurt \u2014 be sure you don't say where you are, of course.\" I reached eagerly for the phone and dialed the familiar number. It rang four times, and then I heard my mom's breezy voice telling me to leave a message. \"Mom,\" I said after the beep, \"it's me. Listen, I need you to do something. It's important. As soon as you get this message, call me at this number.\" Alice was already at my side, writing the number for me on the bottom of her picture. I read it carefully, twice. \"Please don't go anywhere until you talk to me. Don't worry, I'm okay, but I have to talk to you right away, no matter how late you get this call, all right? I love you, Mom. Bye.\" I closed my eyes and prayed with all my might that no unforeseen change of plans would bring her home before she got my message. I settled into the sofa, nibbling on a plate of leftover fruit, anticipating a long evening. I thought about calling Charlie, but I wasn't sure if he should be home by now or not. I concentrated on the news, watching out for stories about Florida, or about spring training \u2014 strikes or hurricanes or terrorist attacks \u2014 anything that might send them home early. Immortality must grant endless patience. Neither Jasper nor Alice seemed to feel the need to do anything at all. For a while, Alice sketched the vague outline of the dark room from her vision, as much as she could see in the light from the TV. But when she was done, she simply sat, looking at the blank walls with her timeless eyes. Jasper, too, seemed to have no urge to pace, or peek through the curtains, or run screaming out the door, the way I did. I must have fallen asleep on the couch, waiting for the phone to ring again. The touch of Alice's cold hands woke me briefly as she carried me to the bed, but I was unconscious again before my head hit the pillow.",

            "en": "7 REPETITION          18. THE FUNERAL I SPRINTED DOWN THE STAIRS AND THREW THE DOOR open. It was Jacob, of course. Even blind, Alice wasn't slow. He was standing about six feet back from the door, his nose wrinkled in distaste, but his face otherwise smooth\u2014masklike. He didn't fool me; I could see the faint trembling of his hands. Hostility rolled off of him in waves. It brought back that awful afternoon when he'd chosen Sam over me, and I felt my chin jerk up defensively in response. Jacob's Rabbit idled by the curb with Jared behind the wheel and Embry in the passenger seat. I understood what this meant: they were afraid to let him come here alone. It made me sad, and a little annoyed. The Cullens weren't like that. \"Hey,\" I finally said when he didn't speak. Jake pursed his lips, still hanging back from the door. His eyes flickered across the front of the house. I ground my teeth. \"She's not here. Do you need something?\" He hesitated. \"You're alone?\" \"Yes.\" I sighed. \"Can I talk to you a minute?\" \"Of course you can, Jacob. Come on in.\" Jacob glanced over his shoulder at his friends in the car. I saw Embry shake his head just a tiny bit. For some reason, this bugged me to no end. My teeth clenched together again. \"Chicken\" I mumbled under my breath. Jake's eyes flashed back to me, his thick, black brows pushing into a furious angle over \u00a0his deep-set eyes. His jaw set, and he marched\u2014there was no other way to describe the way he moved\u2014up the sidewalk and shrugged past me into the house. I locked gazes with first Jared and then Embry\u2014I didn't like the hard way they eyed me; did they really think I would let anything hurt Jacob?\u2014before I shut the door on them. Jacob was in the hall behind me, staring at the mess of blankets in the living room. \"Slumber party?\" he asked, his tone sarcastic. \"Yeah,\" I answered with the same level of acid. I didn't like Jacob when he acted this way. \"What's it to you? He wrinkled his nose again like he smelled something unpleasant. \"Where's your friend'?\" I could hear the quotation marks in his tone. \"She had some errands to run. Look, Jacob, what do you want?\" Something about the room seemed to make him edgier\u2014his long arms were quivering. He didn't answer my question. Instead he moved on to the kitchen, his restless eyes darting everywhere. I followed him. He paced back and forth along the short counter. \"Hey,\" I said, putting myself in his way. He stopped pacing and stared down at me. \"What's your problem?\" \"I don't like having to be here.\" That stung. I winced, and his eyes tightened. \"Then I'm sorry you had to come,\" I muttered. \"Why don't you tell me what you need so you can leave?\" \"I just have to ask you a couple of questions. It shouldn't take long. We have to get back for the funeral.\" \"Okay. Get it over with then.\" I was probably overdoing it with the antagonism, but I didn't want him to see how much this hurt. I knew I wasn't being fair. After all, I'd picked the bloodsucker over him last night. I'd hurt him first. He took a deep breath, and his trembling fingers were suddenly still. His face smoothed into a serene mask. \"One of the Cullens is staying here with you,\" he stated. \"Yes. Alice Cullen.\" He nodded thoughtfully. \"How long is she here for?\" \"As long as she wants to be.\" The belligerence was still there in my tone. \"It's an open invitation.\" \"Do you think you could\u2026 please\u2026 explain to her about the other one\u2014Victoria?\" I paled. \"I told her about that.\" He nodded. \"You should know that we can only watch our own lands with a Cullen here. You'll only be safe in La Push. I can't protect you here anymore.\" \"Okay,\" I said in a small voice. He looked away then, out the back windows. He didn't continue. \"Is that all?\" He kept his eyes on the glass as he answered. \"Just one more thing.\" I waited, but he didn't continue. \"Yes?\" I finally prompted. \"Are the rest of them coming back now?\" he asked in a cool, quiet voice. It reminded me of Sam's always calm manner. Jacob was becoming more like Sam\u2026 I wondered why that bothered me so much. Now I didn't speak. He looked back at my face with probing eyes. \"Well?\" he asked. He struggled to conceal the tension behind his serene expression. \"No.\" I said finally. Grudgingly. \"They aren't coming back.\" His expression didn't change. \"Okay. That's all.\" I glared at him, annoyance rekindled. \"Well, run along now. Go tell Sam that the scary monsters aren't coming to get you.\" \"Okay,\" he repeated, still calm. That seemed to be it. Jacob walked swiftly from the kitchen. I waited to hear the front door open, but I heard nothing. I could hear the clock over the stove ticking, and I marveled again at how quiet he'd become. What a disaster. How could I have alienated him so completely in such a short amount of time?  Would he forgive me when Alice was gone? What if he didn't? I slumped against the counter and buried my face in my hands. How had I made such a mess of everything? But what could I have done differently? Even in hindsight, I couldn't think of any better way, any perfect course of action. \"Bella\u2026 ?\" Jacob asked in a troubled voice. I pulled my face out of my hands to see Jacob hesitating in the kitchen doorway; he hadn't left when I'd thought. It was only when I saw the clear drops sparkling in my hands that I realized I was crying. Jacob's calm expression was gone; his face was anxious and unsure. He walked quickly back to stand in front of me, ducking his head so that his eyes were closer to being on the same level with mine. \"Did it again, didn't I?\" \"Did what?\" I asked, my voice cracking. \"Broke my promise. Sorry.\" \"'It\u2019s okay,\" I mumbled. \"I started it this time.\" His face twisted. \"I knew how you felt about them. It shouldn't have taken me by surprise like that.\" I could see the revulsion in his eyes. I wanted to explain to him what Alice was really like, to defend her against the judgments he'd made, but something warned me that now was not the time. So I just said, \"Sorry,\" again. \"Let's not worry about it, okay? She's just visiting, right? She'll leave, and things will go back to normal.\" \"Can't I be friends with you both at the same time?\" I asked, my voice not hiding an ounce of the hurt I felt. He shook his head slowly. \"No, I don't think you can.\" I sniffed and stared at his big feet. \"But you'll wait, right? You'll still be my friend, even though I love Alice, too?\" I didn't look up, afraid to see what he'd think of that last part. It took him a minute to answer, so I was probably right not to look. \"Yeah, I'll always be your friend,\" he said gruffly. \"No matter what you love.\" \"Promise?\" \"Promise.\" I felt his arms wind around me, and I leaned against his chest, still sniffling. \"This sucks.\" \"Yeah.\" Then he sniffed my hair and said, \"Ew.\" \"What?\" I demanded. I looked up to see that his nose was wrinkled again. \"Why does everyone keep doing that to me? I don't smell!\" He smiled a little. \"Yes, you do\u2014you smell like them. Blech. Too sweet\u2014sickly sweet. And\u2026 icy. It burns my nose.\" \"Really?\" That was strange. Alice smelled unbelievably wonderful. To a human, anyway. \"But why would Alice think I smelled, too, then?\" That wiped his smile away. \"Huh. Maybe I don't smell so good to her, either. Huh.\" \"Well, you both smell fine to me.\" I rested my head against him again. I was going to miss him terribly when he walked out my door. It was a nasty catch-22\u2014on the one hand, I wanted Alice to stay forever. I was going to die\u2014metaphorically\u2014when she left me. But how was I supposed to go without seeing Jake for any length of time? What a mess, I thought again. \"I'll miss you,\" Jacob whispered, echoing my thoughts. \"Every minute. I hope she leaves soon.\" \"It really doesn't have to be that way, Jake.\" He sighed. \"Yes, it really does. Bella. You\u2026 love her. So I'd better not get anywhere near her. I'm not sure that I'm even-tempered enough to handle that. Sam would be mad if I broke the treaty, and\"\u2014his voice turned sarcastic\u2014\"you probably wouldn't like it too much if I killed your friend.\" I recoiled from him when he said that, but he only tightened his arms, refusing to let me escape. \"There's no point in avoiding the truth. That's the way things are, Bells.\" \"I do not like the way things are.\" Jacob freed one arm so that he could cup his big brown hand under my chin and make me look at him. \"Yeah. It was easier when we were both human, wasn't it?\" I sighed. We stared at each other for a long moment. His hand smoldered against my skin. In my face, I knew there was nothing but <em>wistful</em> sadness\u2014I didn't want to have to say goodbye now, no matter for how short a time. At first his face reflected mine, but then, as neither of us looked away, his expression changed. He released me, lifting his other hand to brush his fingertips along my cheek, trailing them down to my jaw. I could feel his fingers tremble\u2014not with anger this time. He pressed his palm against my cheek, so that my face was trapped between his burning hands. \"Bella,\" he whispered. I was frozen. No! I hadn't made this decision yet. I didn't know if I could do this, and now I was out of time to think. But I would have been a fool if I thought rejecting him now would have no consequences. I stared back at him. He was not my Jacob, but he could be. His face was familiar and beloved. In so many real ways, I did love him. He was my comfort, my safe harbor. Right now, I could choose to have him belong to me. Alice was back for the moment, but that changed nothing. True love was forever lost. The prince was never coming back to kiss me awake from my enchanted sleep. I was not a princess, after all. So what was the fairy-tale protocol for other kisses? The mundane kind that didn't break any spells? Maybe it would be easy\u2014like holding his hand or having his arms around me. Maybe it would feel nice. Maybe it wouldn't feel like a betrayal. Besides, who was I betraying, anyway? Just \u00a0myself. Keeping his eyes on mine, Jacob began to bend his face toward me. And I was still absolutely undecided. .  The shrill ring of the phone made us both jump, but it did not break his focus. He took his hand from under my chin and reached over me to grab the receiver, but still held my face securely with the hand against my cheek. His dark eyes did not free mine. I was too muddled to react, even to take advantage of the distraction. \"Swan residence,\" Jacob said, his husky voice low and intense. Someone answered, and Jacob altered in an instant. He straightened up, and his hand dropped from my face. His eyes went flat, his face blank, and I would have bet the measly remainder of my college and that it was Alice. I recovered myself and held out my hand for the phone. Jacob ignored me. \"He's not here,\" Jacob said, and the words were menacing. There was some very short reply, a request for more information it seemed, because he added unwillingly, \"He's at the funeral.\" Then Jacob hung up the phone. \"Filthy bloodsucker,\" he muttered under his breath. The face he turned back to me was the bitter mask again. \"Who did you just hang up on?\" I gasped, infuriated. \"In my house, and on my phone?\" \"Easy! He hung up on me!\" \"He? Who was it?!\" He sneered the title. \"Dr. Carlisle Cullen.\" \"Why didn't you let me talk to him?!\" \"He didn't ask for you,\" Jacob said coldly. His face was smooth, expressionless, but his hands shook. \"He asked where Charlie was and I told him. I don't think I broke any rules of etiquette.\" \"You listen to me, Jacob Black\u2014\" But he obviously wasn't listening. He looked quickly over his shoulder, as if someone had called his name from the other room. His eyes went wide and his body stiff, then he started trembling. I listened too, automatically, but heard nothing. \"Bye, Bells,\" he spit out, and wheeled toward the front door. I ran after him. \"What is it?\" And then I ran into him, as he rocked back on his heels, cussing under his breath. He spun around again, knocking me sideways. I bobbled and fell to the floor, my legs tangled with his. \"Shoot, ow!\" I protested as he hurriedly jerked his legs free one at a time. I struggled to pull myself up as he darted for the back door; he suddenly froze again. Alice stood motionless at the foot of the stairs. \"Bella,\" she choked. I scrambled to my feet and lurched to her side. Her eyes were dazed and far away, her face drawn and whiter than bone. Her slim body trembled to an inner turmoil. \"Alice, what's wrong?\" I cried. I put my hands on her face, trying to calm her. Her eyes focused on mine abruptly, wide with pain. \"Edward,\" was all she whispered. My body reacted faster than my mind was able to catch up with the implications of her reply. I didn't at first understand why the room was spinning or where the hollow roar in my ears was coming from. My mind labored, unable to make sense of Alice's bleak face and how it could possibly relate to Edward, while my body was already swaying, seeking the relief of unconsciousness before the reality could hit me. The stairway tilted at the oddest angle. Jacob's furious voice was suddenly in my ear, hissing out a stream of profanities. I felt a vague disapproval. His new friends were clearly a bad influence. I was on the couch without understanding how I got there, and Jacob was still swearing. It felt like there was an earthquake\u2014the couch was shaking under me. \"What did you do to her?\" he demanded. Alice ignored him. \"Bella? Bella, snap out of it. We have to hurry.\" \"Stay back,\" Jacob warned. \"Calm down, Jacob Black,\" Alice ordered. \"You don't want to do that so close to her.\" \"I don't think I'll have any problem keeping my focus,\" he retorted, but his voice sounded a little cooler. \"Alice?\" My voice was weak. \"What happened?\" I asked, even though I didn't want to hear. \"I don't know,\" she suddenly wailed. \"What is he thinking?!\" I labored to pull myself up despite the dizziness. I realized it was Jacob's arm I was gripping for balance. He was the one shaking, not the couch. Alice was pulling a small silver phone from her bag when my eyes relocated her. Her fingers dialed the numbers so fast they were a blur. \"Rose, I need to talk to Carlisle now.\" Her voice whipped through the words. \"Fine, as soon as he's back. No, I'll be on a plane. Look, have you heard anything from Edward?\" Alice paused now, listening with an expression that grew more appalled every second. Her mouth opened into a little O of horror, and the phone shook in her hand. \"Why?\" she gasped. \"Why would you do that, Rosalie?\" Whatever the answer was, it made her jaw tighten in anger. Her eyes flashed and narrowed. \"Well, you're wrong on both counts, though, Rosalie, so that would be a problem, don't you think?\" she asked acidly. \"Yes, that's right. She's absolutely fine\u2014I was wrong\u2026 It's a long story\u2026 But you're wrong about that part, too, that's why I'm calling\u2026 Yes, that's exactly what I saw.\" Alice's voice was very hard and her lips were pulled back from her teeth.  \"It's a bit late for that, Rose.\u00a0 Save your remorse for someone who believes it.\" Alice snapped the phone shut with a sharp twist of her fingers. Her eyes were tortured as she turned to face me. \"Alice,\" I blurted out quickly. I couldn't let her speak yet. I needed a few more seconds before she spoke and her words destroyed what was left of my life. \"Alice, Carlisle is back, though. He called just before\u2026\" She stared at me blankly. \"How long ago?\" she asked in a hollow voice. \"Half a minute before you showed up.\" \"What did he say?\" She really focused now, waiting for my answer. \"I didn't talk to him.\" My eyes flickered to Jacob. Alice turned her penetrating gaze on him. He flinched, but held his place next to me. He sit awkwardly, almost as if he were trying to shield me with his body. \"He asked for Charlie, and I told him Charlie wasn't here,\" Jacob muttered resentfully. \"Is that everything?\" Alice demanded, her voice like ice. \"Then he hung up on me,\" Jacob spit back. A tremor rolled down his spine, shaking me with it.  \"You told him Charlie was at the funeral,\" I reminded him. Alice jerked her head back toward me \"What were his exact words?\" \"He said, 'He's not here,' and when Carlisle asked where Charlie was, Jacob said, 'At the funeral.'\" Alice moaned and sank to her knees. \"Tell me Alice,\" I whispered. \"That wasn't Carlisle on the phone,\" she said hopelessly. \"Are you calling me a liar?\" Jacob snarled from beside me. Alice ignored him, focusing on my bewildered face. \"It was Edward.\" The words were just a choked whisper. \"He thinks you're dead.\" My mind started to work again. These words weren't the ones I'd been afraid of, and the relief cleared my head. \"Rosalie told him I killed myself, didn't she?\" I said, sighing as I relaxed. \"Yes,\" Alice admitted, her eyes flashing hard again. \"In her defense, she did believe it. They rely on my sight far too much for something that works so imperfectly. But for her to track him down to tell him this! Didn't she realize\u2026 or care\u2026 ?\" Her voice faded away in horror. \"And when Edward called here, he thought Jacob meant my funeral,\" I realized. It stung to know how close I'd been, just inches away from his voice. My nails dug into Jacob's arm, but he didn't flinch. Alice looked at me strangely. \"You're not upset,\" she whispered. \"Well, it's really rotten timing, but it will all get straightened out. The next time he calls, someone will tell him\u2026 what\u2026 really\u2026\" I trailed off. Her gaze strangled the words in my throat. Why was she so panicked? Why was her face twisting now with pity and horror? What was it she had said to Rosalie on the phone just now? Something about what she'd seen\u2026 and Rosalie's remorse; Rosalie would never feel remorse for anything that happened to me. But if she'd hurt her family, hurt her brother\u2026 \"Bella,\" Alice whispered. \"Edward won't call again. He believed her.\" \"I. Don't. Understand.\" My mouth framed each word in silence. I couldn't push the air out to actually say the words that would make her explain what that meant. \"He's going to Italy.\" It took the length of one heartbeat for me to comprehend. When Edward's voice came back to me now, it was not the perfect imitation of my \u00a0delusions. It was just the weak, flat tone of my memories. But the words alone were enough to shred through my chest and leave it gaping open. Words from a time when I would have bet everything that I owned or could borrow on that fact that he loved me. Well, I wasn't going to live without you, he'd said as we watched Romeo and Juliet die, here in this very room. But I wasn't sure how to do it\u2026 I knew Emmett and Jasper would never help\u2026 so I was thinking maybe I would go to Italy and do something to provoke the Volturi\u2026 You don't irritate them. Not unless you want to die. Not unless you want to die. \"NO!\" The half-shrieked denial was so loud after the whispered words, it made us all jump. I felt the blood rushing to my face as I realized what she'd seen. \"No! No, no, no! He can't! He can't do that!\" \"He made up his mind as soon as your friend confirmed that it was too late to save you.\" \"But he\u2026 he left! He didn't want me anymore! What difference does it make now? He knew I would die sometime!\" \"I don't think he ever planned to outlive you by long,\" Alice said quietly. \"How dare he!\" I screamed. I was on my feet now, and Jacob rose uncertainly to put himself between Alice and me again. \"Oh, get out of the way, Jacob!\" I elbowed my way around his trembling body with desperate impatience. \"What do we do?\" I begged Alice. There had to be something. \"Can't we call him? Can Carlisle?\" She was shaking her head. \"That was the first thing I tried. He left his phone in a trash can in Rio\u2014someone answered it\u2026\" she whispered. \"You said before we had to hurry. Hurry how? Let's do it, whatever it is!\" \"Bella, I\u2014I don't think I can ask you to\u2026\" She trailed off in indecision. \"Ask me!\" I commanded. She put her hands on my shoulders, holding me in place, her fingers flexing sporadically to emphasize her words. \"We may already be too late. I saw him going to the Volturi\u2026 and asking to die.\" We both cringed, and my eyes were suddenly blind. I blinked feverishly at the tears. \"It all depends on what they choose. I can't see that till they make a decision. \"But if they say no, and they might\u2014Aro is fond of Carlisle, and wouldn't want to offend him\u2014Edward has a backup plan. They're very protective of their city. If Edward does something to upset the peace, he thinks they'll act to stop him. And he's right. They will.\" I stared at her with my jaw clenched in frustration. I'd heard nothing yet that would explain why we were still standing here. \"So if they agree to grant his favor, we're too late. If they say no, and he comes up with a plan to offend them quickly enough, we're too late. If he gives into his more theatrical tendencies\u2026 we might have time.\" \"Let's go!\" \"Listen, Bella! Whether we are in time or not, we will be in the heart of the Volturi city. I will be considered his accomplice if he is successful. You will be a human who not only knows too much, but also smells too good. There's a very good chance that they will eliminate us all\u2014though in your case it won't be punishment so much as dinnertime.\" \"This is what's keeping us here?\" I asked in disbelief. \"I'll go alone if you're afraid.\" I mentally tabulated what money was left in my account, and wondered if Alice would lend me the rest. \"I'm only afraid of getting you killed.\" I snorted in disgust. \"I almost get myself killed on a daily basis! Tell me what I need to do!\" \"You write a note to Charlie. I'll call the airlines.\" \"Charlie,\" I gasped. Not that my presence was protecting him, but could I leave him here alone to face\u2026 \"I'm not going to let anything happen to Charlie.\" Jacob's low voice was gruff and angry. \"Screw the treaty.\" I glanced up at him, and he scowled at my panicked expression. \"Hurry, Bella,\" Alice interrupted urgently. I ran to the kitchen, yanking the drawers open and throwing the contents all over the floor as I searched for a pen. A smooth, brown hand held one out to me. \"Thanks,\" I mumbled, pulling the cap off with my teeth. He silently handed me the pad of paper we wrote phone messages on. I tore off the top sheet and threw it over my shoulder. Dad, I wrote. I'm with Alice. Edward's in trouble. You can ground me when I get back. I know it's a bad time. So sorry. Love you so much. Bella. \"Don't go,\" Jacob whispered. The anger was all gone now that Alice was out of sight. I wasn't about to waste time arguing with him. \"Please, please, please take care of \u00a0Charlie,\" I said as I dashed back out to the front room. Alice was waiting in the doorway with a bag over her shoulder. \"Get your wallet\u2014you'll need ID. Please tell me you have a passport. I don't have time to forge one.\" I nodded and then raced up the stairs, my knees weak with gratitude that my mother had wanted to marry Phil on a beach in Mexico. Of course, like all her plans, it had fallen through. But not before I'd made all the practical arrangements I could for her. I tore through my room. I stuffed my old wallet, a clean T-shirt, and sweatpants into my backpack, and then threw my toothbrush on top. I hurled myself back down the stairs. The sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu was nearly stifling by this point. At least, unlike the last time\u2014when I'd run away from Forks to escape thirsty vampires rather than to find them\u2014I wouldn't have to say goodbye to Charlie in person. Jacob and Alice were locked in some kind of confrontation in front of the open door, standing so far apart you wouldn't assume at first that they were having a conversation. Neither one seemed to notice my noisy reappearance. \"You might control yourself on occasion, but these leeches you're taking her to\u2014\" Jacob was furiously accusing her. \"Yes. You're right, dog.\" Alice was snarling, too. \"The Volturi are the very essence of our kind\u2014they're the reason your hair stands on end when you smell me. They are the substance of your nightmares, the dread behind your instincts. I'm not unaware of that.\" \"And you take her to them like a bottle of wine for a party!\" he shouted. \"You think she'd be better off if I left her here alone, with Victoria stalking her?\" \"We can handle the redhead.\" \"Then why is she still hunting?\" Jacob growled, and a shudder rippled through his torso. \"Stop that!\" I shouted at them both, wild with impatience. \"Argue when we get back, let's \u00a0go!\" Alice turned for the car, disappearing in her haste. I hurried after her, pausing automatically to turn and lock the door. Jacob caught my arm with a shivering hand. \"Please, Bella. I'm begging.\" His dark eyes were glistening with tears. A lump filled my throat. \"Jake, I have to\u2014\" \"You don't, though. You really don't. You could stay here with me. You could stay alive. For Charlie. For me.\" The engine of Carlisle's Mercedes purred; the rhythm of the thrumming spiked when Alice revved it impatiently. I shook my head, tears spattering from my eyes with the sharp motion. I pulled my arm free, and he didn't fight me. \"Don't die, Bella,\" he choked out. \"Don't go. Don't.\" What if I never saw him again? The thought pushed me past the silent tears; a sob broke out from my chest. I threw my arms around his waist and hugged for one too-short moment, burying my tear-wet face against his chest. He put his big hand on the back of my hair, as if to hold me there. \"Bye, Jake.\" I pulled his hand from my hair, and kissed his palm. I couldn't bear to look at his face. \"Sorry,\" I whispered.

            "en": "13        13. CONFESSIONS Edward in the sunlight was shocking. I couldn't get used to it, though I'd been staring at him all afternoon. His skin, white despite the faint flush from yesterday's hunting trip, literally sparkled, like thousands of tiny diamonds were embedded in the surface. He lay perfectly still in the grass, his shirt open over his sculpted, incandescent chest, his scintillating arms bare. His glistening, pale lavender lids were shut, though of course he didn't sleep. A perfect statue, carved in some unknown stone, smooth like marble, glittering like crystal. Now and then, his lips would move, so fast it looked like they were trembling. But, when I asked, he told me he was singing to himself; it was too low for me to hear. I enjoyed the sun, too, though the air wasn't quite dry enough for my taste. I would have liked to lie back, as he did, and let the sun warm my face. But I stayed curled up, my chin resting on my knees, unwilling to take my eyes off him. The wind was gentle; it tangled my hair and ruffled the grass that swayed around his motionless form. The meadow, so spectacular to me at first, paled next to his magnificence. Hesitantly, always afraid, even now, that he would disappear like a mirage, too beautiful to be real\u2026 hesitantly, I reached out one finger and stroked the back of his shimmering hand, where it lay within my reach. I marveled again at the perfect texture, satin smooth, cool as stone. When I looked up again, his eyes were open, watching me. Butterscotch today, lighter, warmer after hunting. His quick smile turned up the corners of his flawless lips. \"I don't scare you?\" he asked playfully, but I could hear the real curiosity in his soft voice. \"No more than usual.\" He smiled wider; his teeth flashed in the sun. I inched closer, stretched out my whole hand now to trace the contours of his forearm with my fingertips. I saw that my fingers trembled, and knew it wouldn't escape his notice. \"Do you mind?\" I asked, for he had closed his eyes again. \"No,\" he said without opening his eyes. \"You can't imagine how that feels.\" He sighed. I lightly trailed my hand over the perfect muscles of his arm, followed\u00a0 the faint pattern of bluish veins inside the crease at his elbow. With my other hand, I reached to turn his hand over. Realizing what I wished, he flipped his palm up in one of those blindingly fast, disconcerting movements of his. It startled me; my fingers froze on his arm for a brief second. \"Sorry,\" he murmured. I looked up in time to see his golden eyes close again. \"It's too easy to be myself with you.\" I lifted his hand, turning it this way and that as I watched the sun glitter on his palm. I held it closer to my face, trying to see the hidden facets in his skin. \"Tell me what you're thinking,\" he whispered. I looked to see his eyes watching me, suddenly intent. \"It's still so strange for me, not knowing.\" \"You know, the rest of us feel that way all the time.\" \"It's a hard life.\" Did I imagine the hint of regret in his tone? \"But you didn't tell me.\" \"I was wishing I could know what you were thinking\u2026\" I hesitated. \"And?\" \"I was wishing that I could believe that you were real. And I was wishing that I wasn't afraid.\" \"I don't want you to be afraid.\" His voice was just a soft murmur. I heard what he couldn't truthfully say, that I didn't need to be afraid, that there was nothing to fear. \"Well, that's not exactly the fear I meant, though that's certainly something to think about.\" So quickly that I missed his movement, he was half sitting, propped up on his right arm, his left palm still in my hands. His angel's face was only a few inches from mine. I might have \u2014 should have \u2014 flinched away from his unexpected closeness, but I was unable to move.  His golden eyes mesmerized me. \"What are you afraid of, then?\" he whispered intently. But I couldn't answer. As I had just that once before, I smelled his cool breath in my face. Sweet, delicious, the scent made my mouth water. It was unlike anything else. Instinctively, unthinkingly, I leaned closer, inhaling. And he was gone, his hand ripped from mine. In the time it took my eyes to focus, he was twenty feet away, standing at the edge of the small meadow, in the deep shade of a huge fir tree. He stared at me, his eyes dark in the shadows, his expression unreadable. I could feel the hurt and shock on my face. My empty hands stung. \"I'm\u2026 sorry\u2026 Edward,\" I whispered. I knew he could hear. \"Give me a moment,\" he called, just loud enough for my less sensitive ears. I sat very still. After ten incredibly long seconds, he walked back, slowly for him. He stopped, still several feet away, and sank gracefully to the ground, crossing his legs. His eyes never left mine.  He took two deep breaths, and then smiled in apology. \"I am so very sorry.\" He hesitated. \"Would you understand what I meant if I said I was only human?\" I nodded once, not quite able to smile at his joke. Adrenaline pulsed through my veins as the realization of danger slowly sank in. He could smell that from where he sat. His smile turned mocking. \"I'm the world's best predator, aren't I? Everything about me invites you in \u2014 my voice, my face, even my smell. As if I need any of that!\" Unexpectedly, he was on his feet, bounding away, instantly out of sight, only to appear beneath the same tree as before, having circled the meadow in half a second. \"As if you could outrun me,\" he laughed bitterly. He reached up with one hand and, with a deafening crack, effortlessly ripped a two-foot-thick branch from the trunk of the spruce. He balanced it in that hand for a moment, and then threw it with blinding speed, shattering it against another huge tree, which shook and trembled at the blow. And he was in front of me again, standing two feet away, still as a stone. \"As if you could fight me off,\" he said gently. I sat without moving, more frightened of him than I had ever been. I'd never seen him so completely freed of that carefully cultivated facade. He'd never been less human\u2026 or more beautiful. Face ashen, eyes wide, I sat like a bird locked in the eyes of a snake. His lovely eyes seem to glow with rash excitement. Then, as the seconds passed, they dimmed. His expression slowly folded into a mask of ancient sadness. \"Don't be afraid,\" he murmured, his velvet voice unintentionally seductive. \"I promise\u2026\" He hesitated. \"I swear not to hurt you.\" He seemed more concerned with convincing himself than me. \"Don't be afraid,\" he whispered again as he stepped closer, with exaggerated slowness. He sat sinuously, with deliberately unhurried movements, till our faces were on the same level, just a foot apart. \"Please forgive me,\" he said formally. \"I can control myself. You caught me off guard. But I'm on my best behavior now.\" He waited, but I still couldn't speak. \"I'm not thirsty today, honestly.\" He winked. At that I had to laugh, though the sound was shaky and breathless. \"Are you all right?\" he asked tenderly, reaching out slowly, carefully, to place his marble hand back in mine. I looked at his smooth, cold hand, and then at his eyes. They were soft, repentant. I looked back at his hand, and then deliberately returned to tracing the lines in his hand with my fingertip. I looked up and smiled timidly. His answering smile was dazzling. \"So where were we, before I behaved so rudely?\" he asked in the gentle cadences of an earlier century. \"I honestly can't remember.\" He smiled, but his face was ashamed. \"I think we were talking about why you were afraid, besides the obvious reason.\" \"Oh, right.\" \"Well?\" I looked down at his hand and doodled aimlessly across his smooth, iridescent palm. The seconds ticked by. \"How easily frustrated I am,\" he sighed. I looked into his eyes, abruptly grasping that this was every bit as new to him as it was to me. As many years of unfathomable experience as he had, this was hard for him, too. I took courage from that thought. \"I was afraid\u2026 because, for, well, obvious reasons, I can't stay with you. And I'm afraid that I'd like to stay with you, much more than I should.\" I looked down at his hands as I spoke. It was difficult for me to say this aloud. \"Yes,\" he agreed slowly. \"That is something to be afraid of, indeed. Wanting to be with me. That's really not in your best interest.\" I frowned. \"I should have left long ago,\" he sighed. \"I should leave now. But I don't know if I can.\" \"I don't want you to leave,\" I mumbled pathetically, staring down again. \"Which is exactly why I should. But don't worry. I'm essentially a selfish creature. I crave your company too much to do what I should.\" \"I'm glad.\" \"Don't be!\" He withdrew his hand, more gently this time; his voice was harsher than usual. Harsh for him, still more beautiful than any human voice. It was hard to keep up \u2014 his sudden mood changes left me always a step behind, dazed. \"It's not only your company I crave! Never forget that. Never forget I am more dangerous to you than I am to anyone else.\" He stopped, and I looked to see him gazing unseeingly into the forest. I thought for a moment. \"I don't think I understand exactly what you mean \u2014 by that last part anyway,\" I said. He looked back at me and smiled, his mood shifting yet again. \"How do I explain?\" he mused. \"And without frightening you again\u2026 hmmmm.\" Without seeming to think about it, he placed his hand back in mine; I held it tightly in both of mine. He looked at our hands. \"That's amazingly pleasant, the warmth.\" He sighed. A moment passed as he assembled his thoughts. \"You know how everyone enjoys different flavors?\" he began. \"Some people love chocolate ice cream, others prefer strawberry?\" I nodded. \"Sorry about the food analogy \u2014 I couldn't think of another way to explain.\" I smiled. He smiled ruefully back. \"You see, every person smells different, has a different essence. If you locked an alcoholic in a room full of stale beer, he'd gladly drink it. But he could resist, if he wished to, if he were a recovering alcoholic. Now let's say you placed in that room a glass of hundred-year-old brandy, the rarest, finest cognac \u2014 and filled the room with its warm aroma \u2014 how do you think he would fare then?\" We sat silently, looking into each other's eyes \u2014 trying to read each other's thoughts. He broke the silence first. \"Maybe that's not the right comparison. Maybe it would be too easy to turn down the brandy. Perhaps I should have made our alcoholic a heroin addict instead.\" \"So what you're saying is, I'm your brand of heroin?\" I teased, trying to lighten the mood. He smiled swiftly, seeming to appreciate my effort. \"Yes, you are exactly my brand of heroin.\" \"Does that happen often?\" I asked. He looked across the treetops, thinking through his response. \"I spoke to my brothers about it.\" He still stared into the distance. \"To Jasper, every one of you is much the same. He's the most recent to join our family. It's a struggle for him to abstain at all. He hasn't had time to grow sensitive to the differences in smell, in flavor.\" He glanced swiftly at me, his expression apologetic. \"Sorry,\" he said. \"I don't mind. Please don't worry about offending me, or frightening me, or whichever. That's the way you think. I can understand, or I can try to at least. Just explain however you can.\" He took a deep breath and gazed at the sky again. \"So Jasper wasn't sure if he'd ever come across someone who was as\" \u2014 he hesitated, looking for the right word \u2014 \"appealing as you are to me.\u00a0 Which makes me think not. Emmett has been on the wagon longer, so to speak, and he understood what I meant. He says twice, for him, once stronger than the other.\" \"And for you?\" \"Never.\" The word hung there for a moment in the warm breeze. \"What did Emmett do?\" I asked to break the silence. It was the wrong question to ask. His face grew dark, his hand clenched into a fist inside mine. He looked away. I waited, but he wasn't going to answer. \"I guess I know,\" I finally said. He lifted his eyes; his expression was <em>wistful</em>, pleading. \"Even the strongest of us fall off the wagon, don't we?\" \"What are you asking? My permission?\" My voice was sharper than I'd intended. I tried to make my tone kinder \u2014 I could guess what his honesty must cost him. \"I mean, is there no hope, then?\" How calmly I could discuss my own death! \"No, no!\" He was instantly contrite. \"Of course there's hope! I mean, of course I won't\u2026\" He left the sentence hanging. His eyes burned into mine. \"It's different for us. Emmett\u2026 these were strangers he happened across. It was a long time ago, and he wasn't as\u2026 practiced, as careful, as he is now.\" He fell silent and watched me intently as I thought it through. \"So if we'd met\u2026 oh, in a dark alley or something\u2026\" I trailed off. \"It took everything I had not to jump up in the middle of that class full of children and \u2014\" He stopped abruptly, looking away. \"When you walked past me, I could have ruined everything Carlisle has built for us, right then and there. If I hadn't been denying my thirst for the last, well, too many years, I wouldn't have been able to stop myself.\" He paused, scowling at the trees. He glanced at me grimly, both of us remembering. \"You must have thought I was possessed.\" \"I couldn't understand why. How you could hate me so quickly\u2026\" \"To me, it was like you were some kind of demon, summoned straight from my own personal hell to ruin me. The fragrance coming off your skin\u2026 I thought it would make me deranged that first day. In that one hour, I thought of a hundred different ways to lure you from the room with me, to get you alone. And I fought them each back, thinking of my family, what I could do to them. I had to run out, to get away before I could speak the words that would make you follow\u2026\" He looked up then at my staggered expression as I tried to absorb his bitter memories. His golden eyes scorched from under his lashes, hypnotic and deadly. \"You would have come,\" he promised. I tried to speak calmly. \"Without a doubt.\" He frowned down at my hands, releasing me from the force of his stare. \"And then, as I tried to rearrange my schedule in a pointless attempt to avoid you, you were there \u2014 in that close, warm little room, the scent was maddening. I so very nearly took you then. There was only one other frail human there \u2014 so easily dealt with.\" I shivered in the warm sun, seeing my memories anew through his eyes, only now grasping the danger. Poor Ms. Cope; I shivered again at how close I'd come to being inadvertently responsible for her death. \"But I resisted. I don't know how. I forced myself not to wait for you, not to follow you from the school. It was easier outside, when I couldn't smell you anymore, to think clearly, to make the right decision. I left the others near home \u2014 I was too ashamed to tell them how weak I was, they only knew something was very wrong \u2014 and then I went straight to Carlisle, at the hospital, to tell him I was leaving.\" I stared in surprise.  \"I traded cars with him \u2014 he had a full tank of gas and I didn't want to stop. I didn't dare to go home, to face Esme. She wouldn't have let me go without a scene. She would have tried to convince me that it wasn't necessary\u2026 \"By the next morning I was in Alaska.\" He sounded ashamed, as if admitting a great cowardice. \"I spent two days there, with some old acquaintances\u2026 but I was homesick. I hated knowing I'd upset Esme, and the rest of them, my adopted family. In the pure air of the mountains it was hard to believe you were so irresistible. I convinced myself it was weak to run away. I'd dealt with temptation before, not of this magnitude, not even close, but I was strong. Who were you, an insignificant little girl\" \u2014 he grinned suddenly \u2014 \"to chase me from the place I wanted to be? So I came back\u2026\" He stared off into space. I couldn't speak. \"I took precautions, hunting, feeding more than usual before seeing you again. I was sure that I was strong enough to treat you like any other human. I was arrogant about it. \"It was unquestionably a complication that I couldn't simply read your thoughts to know what your reaction was to me. I wasn't used to having to go to such circuitous measures, listening to your words in Jessica's mind\u2026 her mind isn't very original, and it was annoying to have to stoop to that. And then I couldn't know if you really meant what you said. It was all extremely irritating.\" He frowned at the memory. \"I wanted you to forget my behavior that first day, if possible, so I tried to talk with you like I would with any person. I was eager actually, hoping to decipher some of your thoughts. But you were too interesting, I found myself caught up in your expressions\u2026 and every now and then you would stir the air with your hand or your hair, and the scent would stun me again\u2026 \"Of course, then you were nearly crushed to death in front of my eyes. Later I thought of a perfectly good excuse for why I acted at that moment \u2014 because if I hadn't saved you, if your blood had been spilled there in front of me, I don't think I could have stopped myself from exposing us for what we are. But I only thought of that excuse later. At the time, all I could think was, 'Not her.'\" He closed his eyes, lost in his agonized confession. I listened, more eager than rational. Common sense told me I should be terrified. Instead, I was relieved to finally understand. And I was filled with compassion for his suffering, even now, as he confessed his craving to take my life. I finally was able to speak, though my voice was faint. \"In the hospital?\" His eyes flashed up to mine. \"I was appalled. I couldn't believe I had put us in danger after all, put myself in your power \u2014 you of all people. As if I needed another motive to kill you.\"  We both flinched as that word slipped out. \"But it had the opposite effect,\" he continued quickly. \"I fought with Rosalie, Emmett, and Jasper when they suggested that now was the time\u2026 the worst fight we've ever had. Carlisle sided with me, and Alice.\" He grimaced when he said her name. I couldn't imagine why. \"Esme told me to do whatever I had to in order to stay.\" He shook his head indulgently. \"All that next day I eavesdropped on the minds of everyone you spoke to, shocked that you kept your word. I didn't understand you at all. But I knew that I couldn't become more involved with you. I did my very best to stay as far from you as possible. And every day the perfume of your skin, your breath, your hair\u2026 it hit me as hard as the very first day.\" He met my eyes again, and they were surprisingly tender. \"And for all that,\" he continued, \"I'd have fared better if I had exposed us all at that first moment, than if now, here \u2014 with no witnesses and nothing to stop me \u2014 I were to hurt you.\" I was human enough to have to ask. \"Why?\" \"Isabella.\" He pronounced my full name carefully, then playfully ruffled my hair with his free hand. A shock ran through my body at his casual touch. \"Bella, I couldn't live with myself if I ever hurt you. You don't know how it's tortured me.\" He looked down, ashamed again. \"The thought of you, still, white, cold\u2026 to never see you blush scarlet again, to never see that flash of intuition in your eyes when you see through my pretenses\u2026 it would be unendurable.\" He lifted his glorious, agonized eyes to mine. \"You are the most important thing to me now. The most important thing to me ever.\" My head was spinning at the rapid change in direction our conversation had taken. From the cheerful topic of my impending demise, we were suddenly declaring ourselves. He waited, and even though I looked down to study our hands between us, I knew his golden eyes were on me.  \"You already know how I feel, of course,\" I finally said. \"I'm here\u2026 which, roughly translated, means I would rather die than stay away from you.\" I frowned. \"I'm an idiot.\" \"You are an idiot,\" he agreed with a laugh. Our eyes met, and I laughed, too. We laughed together at the idiocy and sheer impossibility of such a moment. \"And so the lion fell in love with the lamb\u2026\" he murmured. I looked away, hiding my eyes as I thrilled to the word. \"What a stupid lamb,\" I sighed. \"What a sick, masochistic lion.\" He stared into the shadowy forest for a long moment, and I wondered where his thoughts had taken him. \"Why\u2026 ?\" I began, and then paused, not sure how to continue. He looked at me and smiled; sunlight glinted off his face, his teeth.  \"Yes?\" \"Tell me why you ran from me before.\" His smile faded. \"You know why.\" \"No, I mean, exactly what did I do wrong? I'll have to be on my guard, you see, so I better start learning what I shouldn't do. This, for example\" \u2014 I stroked the back of his hand \u2014 \"seems to be all right.\" He smiled again. \"You didn't do anything wrong, Bella. It was my fault.\" \"But I want to help, if I can, to not make this harder for you.\" \"Well\u2026\" He contemplated for a moment. \"It was just how close you were. Most humans instinctively shy away from us, are repelled by our alienness\u2026 I wasn't expecting you to come so close. And the smell of your throat.\" He stopped short, looking to see if he'd upset me. \"Okay, then,\" I said flippantly, trying to alleviate the suddenly tense atmosphere. I tucked my chin. \"No throat exposure.\" It worked; he laughed. \"No, really, it was more the surprise than anything else.\" He raised his free hand and placed it gently on the side of my neck. I sat very still, the chill of his touch a natural warning \u2014 a warning telling me to be terrified. But there was no feeling of fear in me. There were, however, other feelings\u2026 \"You see,\" he said. \"Perfectly fine.\" My blood was racing, and I wished I could slow it, sensing that this must make everything so much more difficult \u2014 the thudding of my pulse in my veins. Surely he could hear it. \"The blush on your cheeks is lovely,\" he murmured. He gently freed his other hand. My hands fell limply into my lap. Softly he brushed my cheek, then held my face between his marble hands. \"Be very still,\" he whispered, as if I wasn't already frozen. Slowly, never moving his eyes from mine, he leaned toward me. Then abruptly, but very gently, he rested his cold cheek against the hollow at the base of my throat. I was quite unable to move, even if I'd wanted to. I listened to the sound of his even breathing, watching the sun and wind play in his bronze hair, more human than any other part of him. With deliberate slowness, his hands slid down the sides of my neck. I shivered, and I heard him catch his breath. But his hands didn't pause as they softly moved to my shoulders, and then stopped. His face drifted to the side, his nose skimming across my collarbone. He came to rest with the side of his face pressed tenderly against my chest. Listening to my heart. \"Ah,\" he sighed. I don't know how long we sat without moving. It could have been hours.  Eventually the throb of my pulse quieted, but he didn't move or speak again as he held me. I knew at any moment it could be too much, and my life could end \u2014 so quickly that I might not even notice. And I couldn't make myself be afraid. I couldn't think of anything, except that he was touching me. And then, too soon, he released me.  His eyes were peaceful. \"It won't be so hard again,\" he said with satisfaction. \"Was that very hard for you?\" \"Not nearly as bad as I imagined it would be. And you?\" \"No, it wasn't bad\u2026 for me.\" He smiled at my inflection. \"You know what I mean.\" I smiled. \"Here.\" He took my hand and placed it against his cheek. \"Do you feel how warm it is?\" And it was almost warm, his usually icy skin. But I barely noticed, for I was touching his face, something I'd dreamed of constantly since the first day I'd seen him. \"Don't move,\" I whispered. No one could be still like Edward. He closed his eyes and became as immobile as stone, a carving under my hand. I moved even more slowly than he had, careful not to make one unexpected move. I caressed his cheek, delicately stroked his eyelid, the purple shadow in the hollow under his eye. I traced the shape of his perfect nose, and then, so carefully, his flawless lips. His lips parted under my hand, and I could feel his cool breath on my fingertips. I wanted to lean in, to inhale the scent of him. So I dropped my hand and leaned away, not wanting to push him too far. He opened his eyes, and they were hungry. Not in a way to make me fear, but rather to tighten the muscles in the pit of my stomach and send my pulse hammering through my veins again. \"I wish,\" he whispered, \"I wish you could feel the\u2026 complexity\u2026 the confusion\u2026 I feel. That you could understand.\" He raised his hand to my hair, then carefully brushed it across my face. \"Tell me,\" I breathed. \"I don't think I can. I've told you, on the one hand, the hunger \u2014 the thirst \u2014 that, deplorable creature that I am, I feel for you. And I think you can understand that, to an extent. Though\" \u2014 he half-smiled \u2014 \"as you are not addicted to any illegal substances, you probably can't empathize completely. \"But\u2026\" His fingers touched my lips lightly, making me shiver again. \"There are other hungers. Hungers I don't even understand, that are foreign to me.\" \"I may understand that better than you think.\" \"I'm not used to feeling so human. Is it always like this?\" \"For me?\" I paused. \"No, never. Never before this.\" He held my hands between his. They felt so feeble in his iron strength. \"I don't know how to be close to you,\" he admitted. \"I don't know if I can.\" I leaned forward very slowly, cautioning him with my eyes. I placed my cheek against his stone chest. I could hear his breath, and nothing else. \"This is enough,\" I sighed, closing my eyes. In a very human gesture, he put his arms around me and pressed his face against my hair. \"You're better at this than you give yourself credit for,\" I noted. \"I have human instincts \u2014 they may be buried deep, but they're there.\" We sat like that for another immeasurable moment; I wondered if he could be as unwilling to move as I was. But I could see the light was fading, the shadows of the forest beginning to touch us, and I sighed. \"You have to go.\" \"I thought you couldn't read my mind.\" \"It's getting clearer.\" I could hear a smile in his voice. He took my shoulders and I looked into his face. \"Can I show you something?\" he asked, sudden excitement flaring in his eyes. \"Show me what?\" \"I'll show you how I travel in the forest.\" He saw my expression. \"Don't worry, you'll be very safe, and we'll get to your truck much faster.\" His mouth twitched up into that crooked smile so beautiful my heart nearly stopped. \"Will you turn into a bat?\" I asked warily. He laughed, louder than I'd ever heard. \"Like I haven't heard that one before!\" \"Right, I'm sure you get that all the time.\" \"Come on, little coward, climb on my back.\" I waited to see if he was kidding, but, apparently, he meant it. He smiled as he read my hesitation, and reached for me. My heart reacted; even though he couldn't hear my thoughts, my pulse always gave me away. He then proceeded to sling me onto his back, with very little effort on my part, besides, when in place, clamping my legs and arms so tightly around him that it would choke a normal person. It was like clinging to a stone. \"I'm a bit heavier than your average backpack,\" I warned.  \"Hah!\" he snorted. I could almost hear his eyes rolling. I'd never seen him in such high spirits before. He startled me, suddenly grabbing my hand, pressing my palm to his face, and inhaling deeply. \"Easier all the time,\" he muttered. And then he was running. If I'd ever feared death before in his presence, it was nothing compared to how I felt now. He streaked through the dark, thick underbrush of the forest like a bullet, like a ghost. There was no sound, no evidence that his feet touched the earth. His breathing never changed, never indicated any effort. But the trees flew by at deadly speeds, always missing us by inches. I was too terrified to close my eyes, though the cool forest air whipped against my face and burned them. I felt as if I were stupidly sticking my head out the window of an airplane in flight. And, for the first time in my life, I felt the dizzy faintness of motion sickness. Then it was over. We'd hiked hours this morning to reach Edward's meadow, and now, in a matter of minutes, we were back to the truck. \"Exhilarating, isn't it?\" His voice was high, excited. He stood motionless, waiting for me to climb down. I tried, but my muscles wouldn't respond. My arms and legs stayed locked around him while my head spun uncomfortably. \"Bella?\" he asked, anxious now. \"I think I need to lie down,\" I gasped. \"Oh, sorry.\" He waited for me, but I still couldn't move. \"I think I need help,\" I admitted. He laughed quietly, and gently unloosened my stranglehold on his neck. There was no resisting the iron strength of his hands. Then he pulled me around to face him, cradling me in his arms like a small child. He held me for a moment, then carefully placed me on the springy ferns. \"How do you feel?\" he asked. I couldn't be sure how I felt when my head was spinning so crazily. \"Dizzy, I think.\" \"Put your head between your knees.\" I tried that, and it helped a little. I breathed in and out slowly, keeping my head very still. I felt him sitting beside me. The moments passed, and eventually I found that I could raise my head. There was a hollow ringing sound in my ears. \"I guess that wasn't the best idea,\" he mused. I tried to be positive, but my voice was weak. \"No, it was very interesting.\" \"Hah! You're as white as a ghost \u2014 no, you're as white as me!\" \"I think I should have closed my eyes.\" \"Remember that next time.\" \"Next time!\" I groaned. He laughed, his mood still radiant. \"Show-off,\" I muttered. \"Open your eyes, Bella,\" he said quietly. And he was right there, his face so close to mine. His beauty stunned my mind \u2014 it was too much, an excess I couldn't grow accustomed to. \"I was thinking, while I was running\u2026\" He paused. \"About not hitting the trees, I hope.\" \"Silly Bella,\" he chuckled. \"Running is second nature to me, it's not something I have to think about.\" \"Show-off,\" I muttered again. He smiled. \"No,\" he continued, \"I was thinking there was something I wanted to try.\" And he took my face in his hands again. I couldn't breathe. He hesitated \u2014 not in the normal way, the human way. Not the way a man might hesitate before he kissed a woman, to gauge her reaction, to see how he would be received. Perhaps he would hesitate to prolong the moment, that ideal moment of anticipation, sometimes better than the kiss itself. Edward hesitated to test himself, to see if this was safe, to make sure he was still in control of his need. And then his cold, marble lips pressed very softly against mine. What neither of us was prepared for was my response. Blood boiled under my skin, burned in my lips. My breath came in a wild gasp. My fingers knotted in his hair, clutching him to me. My lips parted as I breathed in his heady scent. Immediately I felt him turn to unresponsive stone beneath my lips. His hands gently, but with irresistible force, pushed my face back. I opened my eyes and saw his guarded expression. \"Oops,\" I breathed. \"That's an understatement.\" His eyes were wild, his jaw clenched in acute restraint, yet he didn't lapse from his perfect articulation. He held my face just inches from his. He dazzled my eyes. \"Should I\u2026 ?\" I tried to disengage myself, to give him some room. His hands refused to let me move so much as an inch. \"No, it's tolerable. Wait for a moment, please.\" His voice was polite, controlled. I kept my eyes on his, watched as the excitement in them faded and gentled. Then he smiled a surprisingly impish grin. \"There,\" he said, obviously pleased with himself. \"Tolerable?\" I asked. He laughed aloud. \"I'm stronger than I thought. It's nice to know.\" \"I wish I could say the same. I'm sorry.\" \"You are only human, after all.\" \"Thanks so much,\" I said, my voice acerbic. He was on his feet in one of his lithe, almost invisibly quick movements. He held out his hand to me, an unexpected gesture. I was so used to our standard of careful non-contact. I took his icy hand, needing the support more than I thought. My balance had not yet returned. \"Are you still faint from the run? Or was it my kissing expertise?\" How lighthearted, how human he seemed as he laughed now, his seraphic face untroubled. He was a different Edward than the one I had known. And I felt all the more besotted by him. It would cause me physical pain to be separated from him now. \"I can't be sure, I'm still woozy,\" I managed to respond. \"I think it's some of both, though.\" \"Maybe you should let me drive.\" \"Are you insane?\" I protested. \"I can drive better than you on your best day,\" he teased. \"You have much slower reflexes.\" \"I'm sure that's true, but I don't think my nerves, or my truck, could take it.\" \"Some trust, please, Bella.\" My hand was in my pocket, curled tightly around the key. I pursed my lips, deliberated, then shook my head with a tight grin. \"Nope. Not a chance.\" He raised his eyebrows in disbelief. I started to step around him, heading for the driver's side. He might have let me pass if I hadn't wobbled slightly. Then again, he might not have. His arm created an inescapable snare around my waist. \"Bella, I've already expended a great deal of personal effort at this point to keep you alive. I'm not about to let you behind the wheel of a vehicle when you can't even walk straight. Besides, friends don't let friends drive drunk,\" he quoted with a chuckle. I could smell the unbearably sweet fragrance coming off his chest. \"Drunk?\" I objected. \"You're intoxicated by my very presence.\" He was grinning that playful smirk again. \"I can't argue with that,\" I sighed.; I couldn't resist him in anything. I held the key high and dropped it, watching his hand flash like lightning to catch it soundlessly. \"Take it easy \u2014 my truck is a senior citizen.\" \"Very sensible,\" he approved. \"And are you not affected at all?\" I asked, irked. \"By my presence?\" Again his mobile features transformed, his expression became soft, warm. He didn't answer at first; he simply bent his face to mine, and brushed his lips slowly along my jaw, from my ear to my chin, back and forth. I trembled. \"Regardless,\" he finally murmured, \"I have better reflexes.\"",
