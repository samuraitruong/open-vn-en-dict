Well, most fish would be lousy dancers, and not just because they don't have feet. The majority of them have an anatomical design that allows them to flex their bodies and move their tail, or caudal, fin to thrust themselves through the water. An area of muscle near to the tail generates most of the force. That's a great way to swim forward in a hurry, but not so great for rear motion.",
