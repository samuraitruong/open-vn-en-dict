            "en": "There are various theories about the existence of such graphic erotic motifs. One of the more exotic ones propounds that since Chandela kings were followers of Tantric principles, which dictate the balance between the male and female forces, they promoted their faith in the temples they created.  Some believe the depiction of sexual activities was considered a good omen.  Other theories have to do with the role of temples themselves in those times: they were considered places of learning as well as worship \u2013 especially of the finer arts, including the art of <em>lovemaking</em>. In addition, some believe that the depiction of sexual activities in temples was considered a good omen because it represented new beginnings and new life.",
