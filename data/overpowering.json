            "en": "2010 FIFA World Cup\u2122 - Key players          Claudia Wong spots three key players from each group at the 2010 FIFA World Cup\u2122. Group A South Africa Steven Pienaar Described as their \u2018best player by an absolute mile' by Everton Manager David Moyes, Steven Pienaar is the star player of the South African national team.  He brings not only his outstanding skills to the fore, but also his European experience at Everton.  Backed by the home crowd, the \u2018Mighty Peanut' is sure to deliver with his adept left foot and fast pace.  The pride of Johannesburg, he looks set to fly his country's colours at this year's World Cup on home soil. Uruguay Diego Forlan Born into a family of football stars, Diego Forlan's father and grandfather played for Uruguay and Independiente in Argentina.  As top scorer in 2005 with Villarreal and Atletico Madrid in 2009, Forlan scored a hat-trick against Peru in the South American qualifiers.  Uruguay's hopes will rely solely on this forward to showcase his two-footedness in South Africa. France William Gallas During his days as a Chelsea player, William Gallas formed an impregnable partnership with John Terry, before moving on to become a key player for Arsene Wenger's Arsenal side.  At the center of defense, any player seeking to sneak past France will have to face the experienced might of the Frenchman.  Group B Argentina Lionel Messi Debuting in the 2004-05 season, Lionel Messi broke the La Liga record for the youngest footballer to appear in a league game, and the youngest to score a league goal.  His power, balance, strength and versatility makes Messi an integral part of Barcelona's dominance in Spain and Europe over the last few seasons.  Living up to the Argentine number ten shirt, Messi wore this jersey for the first time in the FIFA World Cup\u2122 qualifier against Venezuela. Goals from Messi are sure to come in South Africa. Nigeria John Michael Ncekwube Obinna Carlo Ancelotti, Chelsea's current manager and a former Italian midfielder, claims that with regard to playing characteristics, John Michael Ncekwube Obinna, more commonly known as Mikel, plays like himself.  He impressed Jose Mourinho in the first week at Chelsea, and has exceeded expectations.  Able to disrupt attacks and spread play, Mikel's presence in the 2010 FIFA World Cup\u2122 will stir up and unite hopes in the hearts of Nigerians.   South Korea Park Ji-Sung Asia's pride, Park Ji-Sung was the star in the 2002 World Cup\u2122 where South Korea advanced to the semi-finals, scoring the match winner against Portugal.  Kick-starting his career as a defensive midfielder, Park is the only Korean to win the UEFA Champions League and the first Asian to ever play in a final of such a tournament.  His speed, skill and never-say-die attitude make him an indispensible and a legendary team captain of the gutsy South Korean side. Group C England John Terry John Terry led Chelsea to two Premier League titles in 2004-05 with an excellent defensive record ever in football League history. His experience in the centre-back role, ability to read the game well from the back and his flawless defensive skills made him the only English player to make the all-star squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup\u2122.  Although he will not be captaining the English side this World Cup\u2122, his sterling performance will be fundamental to the Three Lions hopes. United States of America Clinton Drew Dempsey Scored the only goal by a US player in the 2006 World Cup\u2122, Clinton Drew Dempsey portrays versatility and style in the midfield.  He brings his Fulham experience, tenacity in approaching goal, and excellent dribbling skills to the table.  His spirit of perseverance in playing games through injuries will only bring his team further in the World Cup\u2122. Slovenia Milivoje Novakovic Scoring five goals in qualifiers, Milivoje Novakovic is Slovenia's forward to mark.  He was remembered for his brilliant hat-trick against Trinidad and Tobago.  Slovenia will need Novakovic to be at his sharpest if they are to progress from Group C. Group D Germany Miroslav Klose All of Miroslav Klose's five goals in the 2002 World Cup\u2122 were headers, and he holds the only record for scoring five goals each in consecutive World Cups\u2122. Having won the golden boot in the 2006 World Cup\u2122, he was also one of the two players from the All-Star Team of 2002 to make it again to the All-Star Team of the 2006 World Cup\u2122.  Bayern Munich's heading machine, he also provides good assists and has an innate instinct to make the most of his chances. Serbia Nemanja Vidic Part of the \u2018Famous Four' of Serbia's defence, Nemanja Vidic's aggressiveness on the pitch and perfectly timed tackles caused his side to let in only one goal in the ten-game qualification of the 2006 World Cup\u2122.  In his 2008-09 season with Manchester United, he had a Premiership-record of 14 consecutive clean sheets.  His ability to turn defense into effective counter-attacks makes him an exceptional player. Ghana Michael Kojo Essien A formidable midfield presence, Michael Kojo Essien is Ghana's national hero.  Not afraid to unleash his shooting prowess from the distance, Essien is an all-rounder who excels in defensive play too.  His versatility has deployed him to several roles both defensively and offensively, and his opponents are often wary of him.  The energy, spirit and attitude he puts into every play is more than commendable. Group E Netherlands Dirk Kuyt Having boundless energy and a high work rate, Dirk Kuyt makes excellent assists with his crossing and angled runs in attack.  A selfless player, he tracks back to aid in defense and is always on his feet for any chance at goal.  Scoring three in the 2010 World Cup\u2122 qualifiers, he is a danger in the box to opposing defenders.  Denmark Christian Bager Poulsen Christian Bager Poulsen's two-footed passing ability and charismatic presence makes him a national team favourite.  His playmaking skills and determination on the pitch to destroy even the best attacks all reek of his talent.  He has his aggressive bouts of temper, including the infamous Rosenbeg punch, which have led to disciplinary records, but as a player, he has grown and matured.  He was also the first player to win Danish Player of the Year awards consecutively in 2005-06. Japan Shunsuke Nakamura The hopes of Japan in this World Cup\u2122 lie on the shoulders of Shunsuke Nakamura, famous for his trusty left-foot and accurate free-kick taking abilities.  Named the Most Valuable Player in the 2004 Asian Cup, he was the first Japanese player and second Asian to score in the UEFA Champions League.  Japan is by far the most successful Asian team having won the Asian Cup thrice, and is looking forward to doing Asian football proud in the World Cup\u2122. Group F Italy Gianluigi Buffon Awarded his first Italy cap at the age of 19, Gianluigi Buffon has kept five clean sheets and denied goals to any attacker in the 2006 World Cup\u2122 finals.  He is the epitome of all goalkeeping ability, skill and positional sense.  Guarding the goalmouth with his accuracy in stopping and blocking shots, knowing when to come off the line and when to stay back has led to him attaining Serie A Goalkeeper of the Year a record of nine times. Paraguay Roque Santa Cruz A tall and powerfully built physique gives Roque Santa Cruz the pace to whiz around and have an edge over any defender.  Ambitious with a winning attitude, Cruz's touch often converts into goals and victories.  This Manchester City striker's determination to score made him one of Paraguay's top scorers in the 2010 FIFA World Cup\u2122 qualifiers. New Zealand Ryan Nelsen Captaining the All Whites and as centre-back of Blackburn Rovers, Ryan Nelsen exudes outstanding defensive capabilities.  Five clean sheets in the qualification rounds all speak of his defensive resilience.  They have a relatively easy route than the other Asian World Cup\u2122 participants, and might possibly be this year's underdog team to root for. Group G Brazil Ricardo Izecson dos Santos Leite Kaka's speed, intelligence with the ball and mastery on both feet enables him to weave through midfield, slip past defenders, and find the back of the net repeatedly. Flashy footwork, composure, and an eye for goal are all part of his goal-scoring prowess. Successes at AC Milan and Real Madrid have caused many to rate him as the best player on the planet. Cote D'Ivoire Didier Yves Drogba Tebily Having a slightly later start in his football career, Didier Drogba has muscled his way into prominence with goalscoring determination.  Drogba's pace, strength, aerial accuracy contributes to his assists from both the left and right side of the pitch. An inspiring captain, he helped his team qualify for their first ever World Cup\u2122 in 2006 in Germany.  Named 2009 African Footballer of the Year, this was his second win of this award. Portugal Cristiano Ronaldo Cristiano Ronaldo's trademark stepovers, quick turning, and tricky bypasses leave his opponents tripping over their own feet.  In addition, Ronaldo is the most expensive player in the history of football. An asset to Real Madrid, the goals he contributed are certainly worth the price.  He has many awards to his name, including Manchester United's first Ballon d'Or in 40 years and FIFA World Player of the Year in 2008. Group H Spain Fernando Jose Torres Sanz El Nino, the hero that scored the winner for Spain in the Euro 2008 Final, is in the cream of the crop among today's football stars.  Whenever he plays he is bound to score, fully utilizing his lightning pace, sharp twists and turns, and <em>overpowering</em> skill.  Moving from Atletico Madrid to Liverpool, he is a star wherever he goes. This FIFA World Cup\u2122, Spain's number nine is one to look out for. Switzerland Alexander Frei Switzerland's captain and all-time top scorer, Alexander Frei currently plays for FC Basel.  A steady player who never fails to assist and contribute last-minute goals, Frei is an inspiring leader and an able team player at the same time.  Swiss Footballer of the Year in 2004 and 2007, his country will be depending on him to put in some goals. Chile Mark Gonzalez Burning down the left flanks, Mark Gonzalez is nicknamed \"Speedy Gonzalez\". Having stints at Real Betis, Liverpool and Club Deportivo Universidad Catolica, he has a wealth of experience, including being the highest-capped player in the squad. Born in South Africa but moving on to Chile later on, Gonzalez looks set to score in the country he was born in.",

            "en": "7 REPETITION        22 FLIGHT DEMETRI LEFT US IN THE CHEERFULLY OPULENT RECEPTION area, where the woman Gianna was still at her post behind the polished counter. Bright, harmless music tinkled from hidden speakers. \"Do not leave until dark,\" he warned us. Edward nodded, and Demetri hurried away. Gianna did not seem at all surprised by the exchange, though she did eye Edward's borrowed cloak with shrewd speculation. \"Are you all right?\" Edward asked under his breath, too low for the human woman to hear. His voice was rough\u2014if velvet can be rough\u2014with anxiety. Still stressed by our situation, I imagined. \"You'd better make her sit before she falls,\" Alice said. \"She's going to pieces.\" It was only then that I realize I was shaking, shaking hard, my entire frame vibrating until my teeth chattered and the room around me seemed to wobble and blur in my eyes. For one wild second, I wondered if this was how Jacob felt just before exploding into a werewolf.  I heard a sound that didn't make sense, a strange, ripping counterpart to the otherwise cheery background music. Distracted by the shaking, I couldn't tell where it was coming from. \"Shh, Bella, shh,\" Edward said as he pulled me to the sofa farthest away from the curious human at the desk. \"I think she's having hysterics. Maybe you should slap her,\" Alice suggested. Edward threw a frantic glance at her. Then I understood. Oh. The noise was me. The ripping sound was the sobs coming from my chest. That's what was shaking me. \"It's all right, you're safe, it's all right,\" he chanted again and again. He pulled me onto his lap and tucked the thick wool cloak around me, protecting me from his cold skin. I knew it was stupid to react like this. Who knew how much time I had to look at his face? He was saved, and I was saved, and he could leave me as soon as we were free. To have my eyes so filled with tears that I could not see his features clearly was wasteful\u2014\u00a0 insanity. But, behind my eyes where the tears could not wash the image away, I could still see the panicked face of the tiny woman with the rosary. \"All those people,\" I sobbed. \"I know,\" he whispered. \"It's so horrible.\" \"Yes, it is. I wish you hadn't had to see that.\" I rested my head against his cold chest, using the thick cloak to wipe my eyes. I took a few deep breaths, trying to calm myself. \"Is there anything I can get you?\" a voice asked politely. It was Gianna, leaning over Edward's shoulder with a look that was both concerned and yet still professional and detached at the same time. It didn't seem to bother her that her face was inches from a hostile vampire. She was either totally oblivious, or very good at her job. \"No,\" Edward answered coldly. She nodded, smiled at me, and then disappeared. I waited until she was out of hearing range. \"Does she know what's going on here?\" I demanded, my voice low and hoarse. I was getting control of myself, my breathing evening out. \"Yes. She knows everything,\" Edward told me. \"Does she know they're going to kill her someday?\" \"She's knows it's a possibility,\" he said. That surprised me. Edward's face was hard to read. \"She's hoping they'll decide to keep her.\" I felt the blood leave my face. \"She wants to be one of them?\" He nodded once, his eyes sharp on my face, watching my reaction. I shuddered. \"How can she want that?\" I whispered, more to myself than really looking for an answer. \"How can she watch those people file through to that hideous room and want to be a part of that?\" Edward didn't answer. His expression twisted in response to something I'd said. As I stared at his too beautiful face, trying to understand the change, it suddenly struck me that I was really here, in Edward's arms, however fleetingly, and that we were not\u2014at this exact moment\u2014about to be killed. \"Oh, Edward,\" I cried, and I was sobbing again. It was such a stupid reaction. The tears were too thick for me to see his face again, and that was inexcusable. I only had until sunset for sure. Like a fairy tale again, with deadlines that ended the magic. \"What's wrong?\" he asked, still anxious, rubbing my back with gentle pats. I wrapped my arms around his neck\u2014what was the worst he could do? Just push me away\u2014and hugged myself closer to him. \"Is it really sick for me to be happy right now?\" I asked. My voice broke twice. He didn't push me away. He pulled me tight against his ice-hard chest, so tight it was hard to breathe, even with my lungs securely intact. \"I know exactly what you mean,\" he whispered. \"But we have lots of reasons to be happy. For one, we're alive.\" \"Yes,\" I agreed. \"That's a good one.\" \"And together,\" he breathed. His breath was so sweet it made my head swim. I just nodded, sure that he did not place the same weight on that consideration as I did. \"And, with any luck, we'll still be alive tomorrow.\" \"Hopefully,\" I said uneasily. \"The outlook is quite good,\" Alice assured me. She'd been so quiet, I'd almost forgotten her presence. \"I'll see Jasper in less than twenty-four hours,\" she added in a satisfied tone. Lucky Alice. She could trust her future. I couldn't keep my eyes off of Edward's face for long. I stared at him, wishing more than anything that the future would never happen. That this moment would last forever, or, if it couldn't, that I would stop existing when it did. Edward stared right back at me, his dark eyes soft, and it was easy to pretend that he felt the same way. So that's what I did. I pretended, to make the moment sweeter. His fingertips traced the circles under my eyes. \"You look so tired.\" \"And you look thirsty,\" I whispered back, studying the purple bruises under his black irises. He shrugged. \"It's nothing.\" \"Are you sure? I could sit with Alice,\" I offered, unwilling; I'd rather he killed me now than move one inch from where I was.  \"Don't be ridiculous.\" He sighed; his sweet breath caressed my face. \"I've never been in better control of that side of my nature than right now.\" I had a million questions for him. One of them bubbled to my lips now, but I held my tongue. I didn't want to ruin the moment, as imperfect as it was, here in this room that made me sick, under the eyes of the would-be monster. Here in his arms, it was so easy to fantasize that he wanted me. I didn't want to think about his motivations now\u2014about whether he acted this way to keep me calm while we were still in danger, or if he just felt guilty for where we were and relieved that he wasn't responsible for my death. Maybe the time apart had been enough that I didn't bore him for the moment. But it didn't matter. I was so much happier pretending. I lay quiet in his arms, re-memorizing his face, pretending\u2026 He stared at my face like he was doing the same, while he and Alice discussed how to get home. Their voices were so quick and low that I knew Gianna couldn't understand. I missed half of it myself. It sounded like more theft would be involved, though. I wondered idly if the yellow Porsche had made it back to its owner yet. \"What was all that talk about singers?\" Alice asked at one point. \"La tua cantante,\" Edward said. His voice made the words into music. \"Yes, that,\" Alice said, and I concentrated for a moment. I'd wondered about that, too, at the time. I felt Edward shrug around me. \"They have a name for someone who smells the way Bella does to me.\u00a0 They call her my singer\u2014because her blood sings for me.\" Alice laughed. I was tired enough to sleep, but I fought against the weariness. I wasn't going to miss a second of the time I had with him. Now and then, as he talked with Alice, he would lean down suddenly and kiss me\u2014his glass-smooth lips brushing against my hair, my forehead, the tip of my nose. Each time it was like an electric shock to my long dormant heart. The sound of its beating seemed to fill the entire room. It was heaven\u2014right smack in the middle of hell. I lost track of the time completely. So when Edward's arms tightened around me, and both he and Alice looked to the back of the room with wary eyes, I panicked. I cringed into Edward's chest as Alec\u2014his eyes now a vivid ruby, but still spotless in his light gray suit despite the afternoon meal\u2014walked through the double doors. It was good news. \"You're free to leave now,\" Alec told us, his tone so warm you'd think we were all lifelong friends. \"We ask that you don't linger in the city.\" Edward made no answering pretence; his voice was ice cold. \"That won't be a problem.\" Alec smiled, nodded, and disappeared again.  \"Follow the right hallway around the corner to the first set of elevators,\" Gianna told us as Edward helped me to my feet. \"The lobby is two floors down, and exits to the street. Goodbye, now,\" she added pleasantly. I wondered if her competence would be enough to save her.  Alice shot her a dark look. I was relieved there was another way out; I wasn't sure if I could handle another tour through the underground. We left through a tastefully luxurious lobby. I was the only one who glanced back at the medieval castle that housed the elaborate business facade. \u00a0I couldn't see the turret from here, for which I was grateful. The party was still in full swing in the streets. The street lamps were just coming on as we walked swiftly through the narrow, cobbled lanes. The sky was a dull, fading gray overhead, but the buildings crowded the streets so closely that it felt darker. The party was darker, too. Edward's long, trailing cloak did not stand out in the way it might have on a normal evening in Volterra. There were others in black satin cloaks now, and the plastic fangs I'd seen on the child in the square today seemed to be very popular with the adults. \"Ridiculous,\" Edward muttered once. I didn't notice when Alice disappeared from beside me. I looked over to ask her a question, and she was gone. \"Where's Alice?\" I whispered in a panic. \"She went to retrieve your bags from where she stashed them this morning.\" I'd forgotten that I had access to a toothbrush. It brightened my outlook considerably. \"She's stealing a car, too, isn't she?\" I guessed. He grinned. \"Not till we're outside.\" It seemed like a very long way to the entryway. Edward could see that I was spent; he wound his arm around my waist and supported most of my weight as we walked. I shuddered as he pulled me through the dark stone archway. The huge, ancient portcullis above was like a cage door, threatening to drop on us, to lock us in. He led me toward a dark car, waiting in a pool of shadow to the right of the gate with the engine running. To my surprise, he slid into the backseat with me, instead of insisting on driving. Alice was apologetic. \"I'm sorry.\" She gestured vaguely toward the dashboard. \"There wasn't much to choose from.\" \"It's fine, Alice.\" He grinned. \"They can't all be 911 Turbos.\" She sighed. \"I may have to acquire one of those legally. It was fabulous.\" \"I'll get you one for Christmas,\" Edward promised. Alice turned to beam at him, which worried me, as she was already speeding down the dark and curvy hillside at the same time. \"Yellow,\" she told him. Edward kept me tight in his arms. Inside the gray cloak, I was warm and comfortable. More than comfortable. \"You can sleep now, Bella,\" he murmured. \"It's over.\" I knew he meant the danger, the nightmare in the ancient city, but I still had to swallow hard before I could answer. \"I don't want to sleep. I'm not tired.\" Just the second part was a lie. I wasn't about to close my eyes. The car was only dimly lit by the dashboard controls, but it was enough that I could see his face. He pressed his lips to the hollow under my ear. \"Try,\" he encouraged. I shook my head. He sighed. \"You're still just as stubborn.\" I was stubborn; I fought with my heavy lids, and I won. The dark road was the hardest part; the bright lights at the airport in Florence made it easier, as did the chance to brush my teeth and change into clean clothes; Alice bought Edward new clothes, too, and he left the dark cloak on a pile of trash in an alley. The plane trip to Rome was so short that there wasn't really a chance for the fatigue to drag me under. I knew the flight from Rome to Atlanta would be another matter entirely, so I asked the flight attendant if she could bring me a Coke. \"Bella,\" Edward said disapprovingly. He knew my low tolerance for caffeine. Alice was behind us. I could hear her murmuring to Jasper on the phone. \"I don't want to sleep,\" I reminded him. I gave him an excuse that was believable because it was true. \"If I close my eyes now, I'll see things I don't want to see. I'll have nightmares.\" He didn't argue with me after that. It would have been a very good time to talk, to get the answers I needed\u2014needed but not really wanted; I was already despairing at the thought of what I might hear. We had an uninterrupted block of time ahead of us, and he couldn't escape me on an airplane\u2014well, not easily, at least. No one would hear us except Alice; it was late, and most of the passengers were turning off lights and asking for pillows in muted voices. Talk would help me fight off the exhaustion. But, perversely, I bit my tongue against the flood of questions. My reasoning was probably flawed by exhaustion, but I hoped that by postponing the discussion, I could buy a few more hours with him at some later time\u2014spin this out for another night, Scheherazade-style. So I kept drinking soda, and resisting even the urge to blink. Edward seemed perfectly content to hold me in his arms, his fingers tracing my face again and again. I touched his face, too. I couldn't stop myself, though I was afraid it would hurt me later, when I was alone again. He continued to kiss my hair, my forehead, my wrists\u2026 but never my lips, and that was good. After all, how many ways can one heart be mangled and still be expected to keep beating? I'd lived through a lot that should have finished me in the last few days, but it didn't make me feel strong. Instead, I felt horribly fragile, like one word could shatter me. Edward didn't speak. Maybe he was hoping I would sleep. Maybe he had nothing to say. I won the fight against my heavy lids. I was awake when we reached the airport in Atlanta, and I even watched the sun beginning to rise over Seattle's cloud cover before Edward slid the window shut. I was proud of myself. I hadn't missed one minute. Neither Alice nor Edward was surprised by the reception that waited for us at Sea-Tac airport, but it caught me off guard. Jasper was the first one I saw\u2014he didn't seem to see me at all. His eyes were only for Alice. She went quickly to his side; they didn't embrace like other couples meeting there. They only stared into each other's faces, yet, somehow, the moment was so private that I still felt the need to look away. Carlisle and Esme waited in a quiet corner far from the line for the metal detectors, in the shadow of a wide pillar. Esme reached for me, hugging me fiercely, yet awkwardly, because Edward kept his arms around me, too. \"Thank you so much,\" she said in my ear. Then she threw her arms around Edward, and she looked like she would be crying if that were possible. \"You will never put me through that again,\" she nearly growled. Edward grinned, repentant. \"Sorry, Mom.\" \"Thank you, Bella,\" Carlisle said. \"We owe you.\" \"Hardly,\" I mumbled. The sleepless night was suddenly <em>overpowering</em>. My head felt disconnected from my body. \"She's dead on her feet,\" Esme scolded Edward. \"Let's get her home.\" Not sure if home was what I wanted at this point, I stumbled, half-blind, through the airport, Edward dragging me on one side and Esme on the other. I didn't know if Alice and Jasper were behind us or not, and I was too exhausted to look. I think I was mostly asleep, though I was still walking, when we reached their car. The surprise of seeing Emmett and Rosalie leaning against the black sedan under the dim lights of the parking garage revived me some. Edward stiffened. \"Don't,\" Esme whispered. \"She feels awful.\" \"She should,\" Edward said, making no attempt to keep his voice down. \"It's not her fault,\" I said, my words garbled with exhaustion. \"Let her make amends,\" Esme pleaded.  \"We'll ride with Alice and Jasper.\"\u00a0 Edward glowered at the absurdly lovely blond vampire waiting for us. \"Please, Edward,\" I said. I didn't want to ride with Rosalie any more than he seemed to, but I'd caused more than enough discord in his family. He sighed, and towed me toward the car. Emmett and Rosalie got in the front seat without speaking, while Edward pulled me in the back again. I knew I wasn't going to be able to fight my eyelids anymore, and I laid my head against his chest in defeat, letting them close. I felt the car purr to life. \"Edward,\" Rosalie began. \"I know.\" Edward's brusque tone was not generous. \"Bella?\" Rosalie asked softly. My eyelids fluttered open in shock. It was the first time she'd ever spoken directly to me. \"Yes, Rosalie?\" I asked, hesitant. \"I'm so very sorry, Bella. I feel wretched about every part of this, and so grateful that you were brave enough to go save my brother after what I did. Please say you'll forgive me.\" The words were awkward, stilted because of her embarrassment, but they seemed sincere. \"Of course, Rosalie,\" I mumbled, grasping at any chance to make her hate me a little less. \"It's not your fault at all. I'm the one who jumped off the damn cliff. Of course I forgive you.\" The words came out like mush. \"It doesn't count until she's conscious, Rose,\" Emmett chuckled. \"I'm conscious,\" I said; it just sounded like a garbled sigh. \"Let her sleep,\" Edward insisted, but his voice was a little warmer. It was quiet then, except for the gentle thrum of the engine. I must have fallen asleep, because it seemed like seconds later when the door opened and Edward was carrying me from the car. My eyes wouldn't open. At first I thought we were still at the airport. And then I heard Charlie. \"Bella!\" he shouted from some distance. \"Charlie,\" I mumbled, trying to shake off the stupor. \"Shh,\" Edward whispered. \"It's okay; you're home and safe. Just sleep.\" \"I can't believe you have the nerve to show your face here.\" Charlie bellowed at Edward, his voice much closer now. \"Stop it, Dad,\" I groaned. He didn't hear me. \"What's wrong with her?\" Charlie demanded. \"She's just very tired, Charlie,\" Edward assured him quietly. \"Please let her rest.\" \"Don't tell me what to do!\" Charlie yelled. \"Give her to me. Get your hands off her!\" Edward tried to pass me to Charlie, but I clung to him with locked, tenacious fingers. I could feel my dad yanking on my arm. \"Cut it out, Dad,\" I said with more volume. I managed to drag my lids back to stare at Charlie with bleary eyes. \"Be mad at me.\" We were in front of my house. The front door was standing open. The cloud cover overhead was too thick to guess at a time of day. \"You bet I will be,\" Charlie promised. \"Get inside.\" \u201cO\u2019Kay. Let me down,\" I sighed. Edward set me on my feet. I could see that I was upright, but I couldn't feel my legs. I trudged forward anyway, until the sidewalk swirled up toward my face. Edward's arms caught me before I hit the concrete. \"Just let me get her upstairs,\" Edward said. \"Then I'll leave.\" \"No,\" I cried, panicking. I hadn't got my answers yet. He had to stay for at least that much, didn't he? \"I won't be far,\" Edward promised, whispering so low in my ear that Charlie didn't have a hope of hearing. I didn't hear Charlie answer, but Edward headed into the house. My open eyes only made it till the stairs. The last thing I felt was Edward's cool hands prying my fingers loose from his shirt.",

            "en": "1 3            13. KILLER If it was anyone but Jacob, i thought to myself, shaking my head as I drove down  the forest-lined highway to La Push. I still wasn't sure if I was doing the right thing, but I'd made a compromise with myself. I couldn't condone what Jacob and his friends, his pack, were doing. I understood now what he'd said last night\u2014that I might not want to see him again\u2014and I could have called him as he'd suggested, but that felt cowardly. I owed him a face-to-face conversation, at least. I would tell him to his face that I couldn't just overlook what was going on. I couldn't be friends with a killer and say nothing, let the killing continue\u2026 That would make me a monster, too. But I couldn't not warn him, either. I had to do what I could to protect him. I pulled up to the Blacks' house with my lips pressed together into a hard line. It was bad enough that my best friend was a werewolf. Did he have to be a monster, too? The house was dark, no lights in the windows, but I didn't care if I woke them. My fist thudded against the front door with angry energy; the sound reverberated through the walls. \"Come in,\" I heard Billy call after a minute, and a light flicked on. I twisted the knob; it was unlocked. Billy was leaning around an open doorway just off the little kitchen, a bathrobe around his shoulders, not in his chair yet. When he saw who it was, his eyes widened briefly, and then his face turned stoic. \"Well, good morning, Bella. What are you doing up so early?\" \"Hey, Billy. I need to talk to Jake\u2014where is he?\" \"Um\u2026 I don't really know,\" he lied, straight-faced. \"Do you know what Charlie is doing this morning?\" I demanded, sick of the stalling. \"Should I?\" \"He and half the other men in town are all out in the woods with guns, hunting giant wolves.\" Billy's expression flickered, and then went blank. \"So I'd like to talk to Jake about that, if you don't mind,\" I continued. Billy pursed his thick lips for a long moment. \"I'd bet he's still asleep,\" he finally said, nodding toward the tiny hallway off the front room. \"He's out late a lot these days. Kid needs his rest\u2014probably you shouldn't wake him.\" \"It's my turn,\" I muttered under my breath as I stalked to the hallway. Billy sighed. Jacob's tiny closet of a room was the only door in the yard-long hallway. I didn't bother to knock. I threw the door open; it slammed against the wall with a bang. Jacob\u2014still wearing just the same black cut-off sweats he'd worn last night\u2014was stretched diagonally across the double bed that took up all of his room but a few inches around the edges. Even on a slant, it wasn't long enough; his feet hung off the one end and his head off the other. He was fast asleep, snoring lightly with his mouth hanging open. The sound of the door hadn't even made him twitch. His face was peaceful with deep sleep, all the angry lines smoothed out. There were circles under his eyes that I hadn't noticed before. Despite his ridiculous size, he looked very young now, and very weary. Pity shook me. I stepped back out, and shut the door quietly behind me. Billy stared with curious, guarded eyes as I walked slowly back into the front room. \"I think I'll let him get some rest.\" Billy nodded, and then we gazed at each other for a minute. I was dying to ask him about his part in this. What did he think of what his son had become? But I knew how he'd supported Sam from the very beginning, and so I supposed the murders must not bother him. How he justified that to himself I couldn't imagine. I could see many questions for me in his dark eyes, but he didn't voice them either. \"Look,\" I said, breaking the loud silence. \"I'll be down at the beach for a while. When he wakes up, tell him I'm waiting for him, okay?\" \"Sure, sure,\" Billy agreed. I wondered if he really would. Well, if he didn't, I'd tried, right? I drove down to First Beach and parked in the empty dirt lot. It was still dark\u2014the gloomy predawn of a cloudy day\u2014and when I cut the headlights it was hard to see. I had to let my eyes adjust before I could find the path that led through the tall hedge of weeds. It was colder here, with the wind whipping off the black water, and I shoved my hands deep into the pockets of my winter jacket. At least the rain had stopped. I paced down the beach toward the north seawall. I couldn't see St. James or the other islands, just the vague shape of the water's edge. I picked my way carefully across the rocks, watching out for driftwood that might trip me. I found what I was looking for before I realized I was looking for it. It materialized out of the gloom when it was just a few feet away: a long bone-white driftwood tree stranded deep on the rocks. The roots twisted up at the seaward end, like a hundred brittle tentacles. I couldn't be sure that it was the same tree where Jacob and I had had our first conversation\u2014a conversation that had begun so many different, tangled threads of my life\u2014but it seemed to be in about the same place I sat down where I'd sat before, and stared out across the invisible sea. Seeing Jacob like that\u2014innocent and vulnerable in sleep\u2014had stolen all my revulsion, dissolved all my anger. I still couldn't turn a blind eye to what was happening, like Billy seemed to, but I couldn't condemn Jacob for it either. Love didn't work that way, I decided. Once you cared about a person, it was impossible to be logical about them anymore. Jacob was my friend whether he killed people or not. And I didn't know what I was going to do about that. When I pictured him sleeping so peacefully, I felt an <em>overpowering</em> urge to protect him. Completely illogical. Illogical or not, I brooded over the memory his peaceful face, trying to come up with some answer, some way to shelter him, while the sky slowly turned gray. \"Hi, Bella.\" Jacob's voice came from the darkness and made me jump. It was soft, almost shy, but I'd been expecting some forewarning from the noisy rocks, and so it still startled me. I could see his silhouette against the coming sunrise\u2014it looked enormous. \"Jake?\" He stood several paces away, shifting his weight from foot to foot anxiously. \"Billy told me you came by\u2014didn't take you very long, did it? I knew you could figure it out.\" \"Yeah, I remember the right story now,\" I whispered. It was quiet for a long moment and, though it was still too dark to see well, my skin prickled as if his eyes were searching my face. There must have been enough light for him to read my expression, because when he spoke again, his voice was suddenly acidic. \"You could have just called,\" he said harshly. I nodded. \"I know.\" Jacob started pacing along the rocks. If I listened very hard, I could just hear the gentle brush of his feet on the rocks behind the sound of the waves. The rocks had clattered like castanets for me. \"Why did you come?\" he demanded, not halting his angry stride. \"I thought it would be better face-to-face.\" He snorted. \"Oh, much better.\" \"Jacob, I have to warn you\u2014\" \"About the rangers and the hunters? Don't worry about it. We already know.\" \"Don't worry about it?\" I demanded in disbelief. \"Jake, they've got guns! They're setting traps and offering rewards and\u2014\" \"We can take care of ourselves,\" he growled, still pacing. \"They're not going to catch anything. They're only making it more difficult\u2014they'll start disappearing soon enough, too.\" \"Jake!\" I hissed. \"What? It's just a fact.\" My voice was pale with revulsion. \"How can you\u2026 feel that way? You know these people. Charlie's out there!\" The thought made my stomach twist. He came to an abrupt stop. \"What more can we do?\" he retorted. The sun turned the clouds a slivery pink above us. I could see his expression now; it was angry, frustrated, betrayed. \"Could you\u2026 well, try to not be a\u2026 werewolf?\" I suggested in a whisper. He threw his hands up in the air. \"Like I have a choice about it!\" he shouted. \"And how would that help anything, if you're worried about people disappearing?\" \"I don't understand you.\" He glared at me, his eyes narrowing and his mouth twisting into a snarl. \"You know what makes me so mad I could just spit?\" I flinched away from his hostile expression. He seemed to be waiting for an answer, so I shook my head. \"You're such a hypocrite, Bella\u2014there you sit, terrified of me! How is that fair?\" His hands shook with anger. \"Hypocrite? How does being afraid of a monster make me a hypocrite?\" \"Ugh!\" he groaned, pressing his trembling fists to his temples and squeezing his eyes shut. \"Would you listen to yourself?\" \"What?\" He took two steps toward me, leaning over me and glaring with fury. \"Well, I'm so sorry that I can't be the right kind of monster for you, Bella. I guess I'm just not as great as a bloodsucker, am I?\" I jumped to my feet and glared back. \"No, you're not!\" I shouted. \"It's not what you are, stupid, it's what you do!\" \"What's that supposed to mean?\" He roared, his entire frame quivering with rage. I was taken entirely by surprise when Edward's voice cautioned me. \"Be very careful, Bella,\" his velvet voice warned. \"Don't push him too far. You need to calm him down.\" Even the voice in my head was making no sense today. I listened to him, though. I would do anything for that voice. \"Jacob,\" I pleaded, making my tone soft and even. \"Is it really necessary to kill people, Jacob? Isn't there some other way? I mean, if vampires can find a way to survive without murdering people, couldn't you give it a try, too?\" He straightened up with a jerk, like my words had sent an electric shock through him. His eyebrows shot up and his eyes stared wide. \"Killing people?\" he demanded. \"What did you think we were talking about?\" He wasn't trembling anymore. He looked at me with half-hopeful disbelief. \"I thought we were talking about your disgust for werewolves.\" \"No, Jake, no. It's not that you're a\u2026 wolf. That's fine,\" I promised him, and I knew as I said the words that I meant them. I really didn't care if he turned into a big wolf\u2014he was still Jacob. \"If you could just find a way not to hurt people\u2026 that's all that upsets me. These ate innocent people, Jake, people like Charlie, and I can't just look the other way while you\u2014\" \"Is that all? Really?\" he interrupted me, a smile breaking across his face. \"You're just scared because I'm a murderer? That's the only reason?\" \"Isn't that reason enough?\" He started to laugh. \"Jacob Black, this is so not funny!\" \"Sure, sure,\" he agreed, still chortling. He took one long stride and caught me in another vice-tight bear hug. \"You really, honestly don't mind that I morph into a giant dog?\" he asked, his voice joyful in my ear. \"No,\" I gasped. \"Can't\u2014breathe\u2014Jake!\" He let me go, but took both my hands. \"I'm not a killer, Bella.\" I studied his face, and it was clear that this was the truth. Relief pulsed through me. \"Really?\" I asked. \"Really,\" he promised solemnly. I threw my arms around him. It reminded me of that first day with the motorcycles\u2014he was bigger, though, and I felt even more like a child now. Like that other time, he stroked my hair. \"Sorry I called you a hypocrite,\" he apologized. \"Sorry I called you a murderer.\" He laughed. I thought of something then, and pulled away from him so that I could see his face. My eyebrows furrowed in anxiety. \"What about Sam? And the others?\" He shook his head, smiling like a huge burden had been removed from his shoulders.  \"Of course not. Don't you remember what we call ourselves?\" The memory was clear\u2014I'd just been thinking of that very day. \"Protectors?\" \"Exactly.\" \"But I don't understand. What's happening in the woods? The missing hikers, the blood?\" His face was serious, worried at once. \"We're trying to do our job, Bella. We're trying to protect them, but we're always just a little too late.\" \"Protect them from what? Is there really a bear out there, too?\" \"Bella, honey, we only protect people from one thing\u2014our one enemy. It's the reason we exist\u2014because they do.\" I stared at him blankly for one second before I understood. Then the blood drained from my face and a thin, wordless cry of horror broke through my lips. He nodded. \"I thought you, of all people, would realize what was really going on.\" \"Laurent,\" I whispered. \"He's still here.\" Jacob blinked twice, and cocked his head to one side. \"Who's Laurent?\" I tried to sort out the chaos in my head so that I could answer. \"You know\u2014you saw him in the meadow. You were there\u2026\" The words came out in a wondering tone as it all sunk in. \"You were there, and you kept him from killing me\u2026\" \"Oh, the black-haired leech?\" He grinned, a tight, fierce grin. \"Was that his name?\" I shuddered. \"What were you thinking?\" I whispered. \"He could have killed you! Jake, you don't realize how dangerous\u2014\" Another laugh interrupted me \"Bella, one lone vampire isn't much of a problem for a pack as big as ours. It was so easy, it was hardly even fun!\" \"What was so easy?\" \"Killing the bloodsucker who was going to kill you. Now, I don't count that towards the whole murder thing,\" he added quickly. \"Vampires don't count as people.\" I could only mouth the words. \"You\u2026 killed\u2026 Laurent?\" He nodded. \"Well, it was a group effort,\" he qualified. \"Laurent is dead?\" I whispered. His expression changed. \"You're not upset about that, are you? He was going to kill you\u2014he was going for the kill, Bella, we were sure of that before we attacked. You know that, right?\" \"I know that. No, I'm not upset\u2014I'm\u2026\" I had to sit down. I stumbled back a step until I felt the driftwood against my calves, and then sank down onto it. \"Laurent is dead. He's not coming back for me.\" \"You're not mad? He wasn't one of your friends or anything, was he?\" \"My friend?\" I stared up at him, confused and dizzy with relief. I started babbling, my eyes getting moist. \"No, Jake. I'm so\u2026 so relieved. I thought he was going to find me\u2014I've been waiting for him every night, just hoping that he'd stop with me and leave Charlie alone. I've been so frightened, Jacob\u2026 But how? He was a vampire! How did you kill him? He was so strong, so hard, like marble\u2026\" He sat down next to me and put one big arm around me comfortingly. \"It's what we're made for, Bells. \u00a0We're strong, too. I wish you would have told me that you were so afraid. You didn't need to be.\" \"You weren't around,\" I mumbled, lost in thought. \"Oh, right.\" \"Wait, Jake\u2014I thought you knew, though. Last night, you said it wasn't safe for you to be in my room. I thought you knew that a vampire might be coming. Isn't that what you were talking about?\" He looked confused for a minute, and then he ducked his head. \"No, that's not what I meant.\" \"Then why didn't you think it was safe for you there?\" He looked at me with guilt-ridden eyes. \"I didn't say it wasn't safe for me. I was thinking of you.\" \"What do you mean?\" He looked down and kicked a rock. \"There's more than one reason I'm not supposed to be around you, Bella. I wasn't supposed to tell you our secret, for one thing, but the other part is that it's not safe for you.\u00a0 If I get too mad\u2026 too upset\u2026 you might get hurt.\" I thought about that carefully. \"When you were mad before\u2026 when I was yelling at you\u2026 and you were shaking\u2026 ?\" \"Yeah.\" His face dropped even lower. \"That was pretty stupid of me. I have to keep a better hold on myself. I swore I wasn't going to get mad, no matter what you said to me. But\u2026 I just got so upset that I was going to lose you\u2026 that you couldn't deal with what I am\u2026\" \"What would happen\u2026 if you got too mad?\" I whispered. \"I'd turn into a wolf,\" he whispered back. \"You don't need a full moon.\" He rolled his eyes. \"Hollywood's version doesn't get much right.\" Then he sighed, and was serious again. \"You don't need to be so stressed out, Bells. We're going to take care of this. And we're keeping a special eye on Charlie and the others\u2014we won't let anything happen to him. Trust me on that.\" Something very, very obvious, something I should have grasped at once\u2014but I'd been so distracted by the idea of Jacob and his friends fighting with Laurent, that I'd completely missed it at the time\u2014occurred to me only then, when Jacob used the present tense again. We're going to take care of this. It wasn't over. \"Laurent is dead,\" I gasped, and my entire body went ice cold. \"Bella?\" Jacob asked anxiously, touching my ashen cheek. \"If Laurent died\u2026 a week ago\u2026 then someone else is killing people now.\" Jacob nodded; his teeth clenched together, and he spoke through them. \"There were two of them. We thought his mate would want to fight us\u2014in our stories, they usually get pretty pissed off if you kill their mate\u2014but she just keeps running away, and then coming back again. If we could figure out what she was after, it would be easier to take her down. But she makes no sense. She keeps dancing around the edges, like she's testing our defenses, looking for a way in\u2014but in where? Where does she want to go?\u00a0 Sam thinks she's trying to separate us, so she'll have a better chance\u2026\" His voice faded until it sounded like it was coming through a long tunnel; I couldn't make out the individual words anymore. My forehead dewed with sweat and my stomach rolled like I had the stomach flu again. Exactly like I had the flu. I turned away from him quickly, and leaned over the tree trunk. My body convulsed with useless heaves, my empty stomach contracting with horrified nausea, though there was nothing in it to expel. Victoria was here. Looking for me. Killing strangers in the woods. The woods where Charlie was searching\u2026 My head spun sickeningly. Jacob's hands caught my shoulders\u2014kept me from sliding forward onto the rocks. I could feel his hot breath on my cheek. \"Bella! What's wrong?\" \"Victoria,\" I gasped as soon as I could catch my breath around the nauseous spasms. In my head, Edward snarled in fury at the name. I felt Jacob pull me up from my slump. He draped me awkwardly across his lap, laying my limp head against his shoulder. He struggled to balance me, to keep me from sagging over, one way or the other he brushed the sweaty hair back from my face. \"Who?\" Jacob asked. \"Can you hear me, Bella? Bella?\" \"She wasn't Laurent's mate,\" I moaned into his shoulder. \"They were just old friends\u2026\" \"Do you need some water? A doctor? Tell me what to do,\" he demanded, frantic. \"I'm not sick\u2014I'm scared,\" I explained in a whisper. The word scared didn't really seem to cover it. Jacob patted my back. \"Scared of this Victoria?\" I nodded, shuddering. \"Victoria is the red-haired female?\" I trembled again, and whimpered, \"Yes.\" \"How do you know she wasn't his mate?\" \"Laurent told me James was her mate,\" I explained, automatically flexing the hand with the scar. He pulled my face around, holding it steady in his big hand. He stared intently into my eyes. \"Did he tell you anything else, Bella? This is important. Do you know what she wants?\" \"Of course,\" I whispered. \"She wants me.\" His eyes flipped wide, then narrowed into slits. \"Why?\" he demanded. \"Edward killed James,\" I whispered. Jacob held me so tightly that there was no need for me to clutch at the hole\u2014he kept me in one piece. \"She did get\u2026 pissed off. But Laurent said she thought it was fairer to kill me than Edward. Mate for mate. She didn't know\u2014still doesn't know, I guess\u2014that\u2026 that\u2026\" I swallowed hard. \"That things aren't like that with us anymore. Not for Edward, anyway.\" Jacob was distracted by that, his face torn between several different expressions. \"Is that what happened? Why the Cullens left?\" \"I'm nothing but a human, after all. Nothing special,\" I explained, shrugging weakly. Something like a growl\u2014not a real growl, just a human approximation\u2014rumbled in Jacob's chest under my ear. \"If that idiot bloodsucker is honestly stupid enough\u2014\" \"Please,\" I moaned. \"Please. Don't.\" Jacob hesitated, then nodded once. \"This is important,\" he said again, his face all business now. \"This is exactly what we needed to know.We've got to tell the others right away.\" He stood, pulling me to my feet. He kept two hands on my waist until he was sure I wasn't going to fall. \"I'm okay,\" I lied. He traded his hold on my waist for one of my hands. \"Let's go.\" He pulled me back toward the truck. \"Where are we going?\" I asked. \"I'm not sure yet,\" he admitted. \"I'll call a meeting. Hey, wait here for just a minute, okay?\" He leaned me against the side of the truck and released my hand. \"Where are you going?\" \"I'll be right back,\" he promised. Then he turned and sprinted through the parking lot, across the road, and into the bordering forest. He flitted into the trees, swift and sleek as a deer. \"Jacob!\" I yelled after him hoarsely, but he was already gone. It was not a good time to be left alone. Seconds after Jacob was out of sight, I was hyperventilating. I dragged myself into the cab of the truck, and mashed the locks down at once. It didn't make me feel any better. Victoria was already hunting me. It was just luck that she hadn't found me yet\u2014just luck and five teenage werewolves. I exhaled sharply. No matter what Jacob said, the thought of him coming anywhere close to Victoria was horrifying. I didn't care what he could turn into when he got mad. I could see her in my head, her face wild, her hair like flames, deadly, indestructible\u2026 But, according to Jacob, Laurent was gone. Was that really possible? Edward\u2014I clutched automatically at my chest\u2014had told me how difficult it was to kill a vampire. Only another vampire could do the job. Yet Jake said this was what werewolves were made for\u2026 He said they were keeping a special eye on Charlie\u2014that I should trust the werewolves to keep my father safe. How could I trust that? None of us were safe! Jacob the very least of all, if he was trying to put himself between Victoria and Charlie\u2026 between Victoria and me. I felt like I might be about to throw up again. A sharp rap on the truck's window made me yelp in terror\u2014but it was just Jacob, back already. I unlocked the door with trembling, grateful fingers. \"You're really scared, aren't you?\" he asked as he climbed in. I nodded. \"Don't be. We'll take care of you\u2014and Charlie, too. I promise.\" \"The idea of you finding Victoria is scarier than the idea of her finding me,\" I whispered. He laughed. \"You've got to have a little more confidence in us than that. It's insulting.\" I just shook my head. I'd seen too many vampires in action. \"Where did you go just now?\" I asked. He pursed his lips, and said nothing. \"What? Is it a secret?\" He frowned. \"Not really. It's kind of weird, though. I don't want to freak you out.\" \"I'm sort of used to weird by this point, you know.\" I tried to smile without much success. Jacob grinned back easily. \"Guess you'd have to be. Okay. See, when we're wolves, we can\u2026 hear each other.\" My eyebrows pulled down in confusion. \"Not hear sounds,\" he went on, \"but we can hear\u2026 thoughts\u2014each other's anyway\u2014no matter how far away from each other we are. It really helps when we hunt, but it's a big pain otherwise. It's embarrassing\u2014having no secrets like that. Freaky, eh?\" \"Is that what you meant last night, when you said you would tell them you'd seen me, even though you didn't want to?\" \"You're quick.\" \"Thanks.\" \"You're also very good with weird. I thought that would bother you.\" \"It's not\u2026 well, you're not the first person I've known who could do that. So it doesn't seem so weird to me.\" \"Really?\u2026 Wait\u2014are you talking about your bloodsuckers?\" \"I wish you wouldn't call them that.\" He laughed. \"Whatever. The Cullens, then?\" \"Just\u2026 just Edward.\" I pulled one arm surreptitiously around my torso. Jacob looked surprised\u2014unpleasantly so. \"I thought those were just stories. I've heard legends about vampires who could do\u2026 extra stuff, but I thought that was just a myth.\" \"Is anything just a myth anymore?\" I asked him wryly. He scowled. \"Guess not. Okay, we're going to meet Sam and the others at the place we go to ride our bikes.\" I started the truck and headed back up the road. \"So did you just turn into a wolf now, to talk to Sam?\" I asked, curious. Jacob nodded, seeming embarrassed. \"I kept it real short\u2014I tried not to think about you so they wouldn't know what was going on. I was afraid Sam would tell me I couldn't bring you.\" \"That wouldn't have stopped me.\" I couldn't get rid of my perception of Sam as the bad guy. My teeth clenched together whenever I heard his name. \"Well, it would have stopped me,\" Jacob said, morose now. \"Remember how I couldn't finish my sentences last night? How I couldn't just tell you the whole story?\" \"Yeah. You looked like you were choking on something.\" He chuckled darkly. \"Close enough. Sam told me I couldn't tell you. He's\u2026 the head of the pack, you know. He's the Alpha. When he tells us to do something, or not to do something\u2014when he really means it, well, we can't just ignore him.\" \"Weird,\" I muttered. \"Very,\" he agreed. \"It's kind of a wolf thing.\" \"Huh\" was the best response I could think of. \"Yeah, there's a load of stuff like that\u2014wolf things. I'm still learning. I can't imagine what it was like for Sam, trying to deal with this alone.\u00a0 It sucks bad enough to go through it with a whole pack for support.\" \"Sam was alone?\" \"Yeah.\" Jacob's voice lowered. \"When I\u2026 changed, it was the most\u2026 horrible, the most terrifying thing I've ever been through\u2014worse than anything I could have imagined. But I wasn't alone\u2014there were the voices there, in my head, telling me what had happened and what I had to do. That kept me from losing my mind, I think. But Sam\u2026\" He shook his head. \"Sam had no help.\" This was going to take some adjusting. When Jacob explained it like that, it was hard not to feel compassion for Sam. I had to keep reminding myself that there was no reason to hate him anymore. \"Will they be angry that I'm with you?\" I asked. He made a face. \"Probably.\" \"Maybe I shouldn't\u2014\" \"No, it's okay,\" he assured me. \"You know a ton of things that can help us. It's not like you're just some ignorant human. You're like a\u2026 I don't know, spy or something. You've been behind enemy lines.\" I frowned to myself. Was that what Jacob would want from me? Insider information to help them destroy their enemies? I wasn't a spy, though. I hadn't been collecting that kind of information. Already, his words made me feel like a traitor. But I wanted him to stop Victoria, didn't I? No. I did want Victoria to be stopped, preferably before she tortured me to death or ran into Charlie or killed another stranger. I just didn't want Jacob to be the one to stop her, or rather to try. I didn't want Jacob within a hundred miles of her. \"Like the stuff about the mind-reading bloodsucker,\" he continued, oblivious to my reverie. \"That's the kind of thing we need to know about. That really sucks that those stories are true. It makes everything more complicated. Hey, do you think this Victoria can do anything special?\" \"I don't think so,\" I hesitated, and then sighed. \"He would have mentioned it.\" \"He? Oh, you mean Edward\u2014oops, sorry. I forgot. You don't like to say his name. Or hear it.\" I squeezed my midsection, trying to ignore the throbbing around the edges of my chest. \"Not really, no.\" \"Sorry.\" \"How do you know me so well, Jacob? Sometimes it's like you can read my mind.\" \"Naw. I just pay attention.\" We were on the little dirt road where Jacob had first taught me to ride the motorcycle. \"This good?\" I asked. \"Sure, sure.\" I pulled over and cut the engine. \"You're still pretty unhappy, aren't you?\" he murmured. I nodded, staring unseeingly into the gloomy forest. \"Did you ever think\u2026 that maybe\u2026 you're better off?\" I inhaled slowly, and then let my breath out. \"No.\" \"'Cause he wasn't the best\u2014\" \"Please, Jacob,\" I interrupted, begging in a whisper. \"Could we please not talk about this? I can't stand it.\" \"Okay.\" He took a deep breath. \"I'm sorry I said anything.\" \"Don't feel bad. If things were different, it would be nice to finally be able to talk to someone about it.\" He nodded. \"Yeah, I had a hard time keeping a secret from you for two weeks. It must be hell to not be able to talk to anyone.\" \"Hell,\" I agreed. Jacob sucked in a sharp breath. \"They're here. Let's go.\" \"Are you sure?\" I asked while he popped his door open. \"Maybe I shouldn't be here.\" \"They'll deal with it,\" he said, and then he grinned. \"Who's afraid of the big, bad wolf?\" \"Ha ha,\" I said. But I got out of the truck, hurrying around the front end to stand close beside Jacob. I remembered only too clearly the giant monsters in the meadow. My hands were trembling like Jacob's had been before, but with fear rather than rage. Jake took my hand and squeezed it. \"Here we go.\"",

            "en": "11        11. COMPLICATIONS Everyone watched us as we walked together to our lab table. I noticed that he no longer angled the chair to sit as far from me as the desk would allow. Instead, he sat quite close beside me, our arms almost touching. Mr. Banner backed into the room then \u2014 what superb timing the man had \u2014 pulling a tall metal frame on wheels that held a heavy-looking, outdated TV and VCR. A movie day \u2014 the lift in the class atmosphere was almost tangible. Mr. Banner shoved the tape into the reluctant VCR and walked to the wall to turn off the lights. And then, as the room went black, I was suddenly hyperaware that Edward was sitting less than an inch from me. I was stunned by the unexpected electricity that flowed through me, amazed that it was possible to be more aware of him than I already was. A crazy impulse to reach over and touch him, to stroke his perfect face just once in the darkness, nearly overwhelmed me. I crossed my arms tightly across my chest, my hands balling into fists. I was losing my mind. The opening credits began, lighting the room by a token amount. My eyes, of their own accord, flickered to him. I smiled sheepishly as I realized his posture was identical to mine, fists clenched under his arms, right down to the eyes, peering sideways at me. He grinned back, his eyes somehow managing to smolder, even in the dark. I looked away before I could start hyperventilating. It was absolutely ridiculous that I should feel dizzy. The hour seemed very long. I couldn't concentrate on the movie \u2014 I didn't even know what subject it was on. I tried unsuccessfully to relax, but the electric current that seemed to be originating from somewhere in his body never slackened. Occasionally I would permit myself a quick glance in his direction, but he never seemed to relax, either. The <em>overpowering</em> craving to touch him also refused to fade, and I crushed my fists safely against my ribs until my fingers were aching with the effort. I breathed a sigh of relief when Mr. Banner flicked the lights back on at the end of class, and stretched my arms out in front of me, flexing my stiff fingers. Edward \u00a0chuckled beside me. \"Well, that was interesting,\" he murmured. His voice was dark and his eyes were cautious. \"Umm,\" was all I was able to respond. \"Shall we?\" he asked, rising fluidly. I almost groaned. Time for Gym. I stood with care, worried my balance might have been affected by the strange new intensity between us. He walked me to my next class in silence and paused at the door; I turned to say goodbye. His face startled me \u2014 his expression was torn, almost pained, and so fiercely beautiful that the ache to touch him flared as strong as before. My goodbye stuck in my throat. He raised his hand, hesitant, conflict raging in his eyes, and then swiftly brushed the length of my cheekbone with his fingertips. His skin was as icy as ever, but the trail his fingers left on my skin was alarmingly warm \u2014 like I'd been burned, but didn't feel the pain of it yet. He turned without a word and strode quickly away from me. I walked into the gym, lightheaded and wobbly. I drifted to the locker room, changing in a trance like state, only vaguely aware that there were other people surrounding me. Reality didn't fully set in until I was handed a racket. It wasn't heavy, yet it felt very unsafe in my hand. I could see a few of the other kids in class eyeing me furtively. Coach Clapp ordered us to pair up into teams. Mercifully, some vestiges of Mike's chivalry still survived; he came to stand beside me. \"Do you want to be a team?\" \"Thanks, Mike \u2014 you don't have to do this, you know.\" I grimaced apologetically. \"Don't worry, I'll keep out of your way.\" He grinned. Sometimes it was so easy to like Mike. It didn't go smoothly. I somehow managed to hit myself in the head with my racket and clip Mike's shoulder on the same swing. I spent the rest of the hour in the back corner of the court, the racket held safely behind my back. Despite being handicapped by me, Mike was pretty good; he won three games out of four single handedly. He gave me an unearned high five when the coach finally blew the whistle ending class. \"So,\" he said as we walked off the court. \"So what?\" \"You and Cullen, huh?\" he asked, his tone rebellious. My previous feeling of affection disappeared. \"That's none of your business, Mike,\" I warned, internally cursing Jessica straight to the fiery pits of Hades. \"I don't like it,\" he muttered anyway. \"You don't have to,\" I snapped. \"He looks at you like\u2026 like you're something to eat,\" he continued, ignoring me. I choked back the hysteria that threatened to explode, but a small giggle managed to get out despite my efforts. He glowered at me. I waved and fled to the locker room. I dressed quickly, something stronger than butterflies battering recklessly against the walls of my stomach, my argument with Mike already a distant memory. I was wondering if Edward would be waiting, or if I should meet him at his car. What if his family was there? I felt a wave of real terror. Did they know that I knew? Was I supposed to know that they knew that I knew, or not? By the time I walked out of the gym, I had just about decided to walk straight home without even looking toward the parking lot. But my worries were unnecessary. Edward was waiting, leaning casually against the side of the gym, his breathtaking face untroubled now. As I walked to his side, I felt a peculiar sense of release. \"Hi,\" I breathed, smiling hugely. \"Hello.\" His answering smile was brilliant. \"How was Gym?\" My face fell a tiny bit. \"Fine,\" I lied. \"Really?\" He was unconvinced. His eyes shifted their focus slightly, looking over my shoulder and narrowing. I glanced behind me to see Mike's back as he walked away. \"What?\" I demanded. His eyes slid back to mine, still tight. \"Newton's getting on my nerves.\" \"You weren't listening again?\" I was horror-struck. All traces of my sudden good humor vanished. \"How's your head?\" he asked innocently. \"You're unbelievable!\" I turned, stomping away in the general direction of the parking lot, though I hadn't ruled out walking at this point. He kept up with me easily. \"You were the one who mentioned how I'd never seen you in Gym \u2014 it made me curious.\" He didn't sound repentant, so I ignored him. We walked in silence \u2014 a furious, embarrassed silence on my part \u2014 to his car. But I had to stop a few steps away \u2014 a crowd of people, all boys, were surrounding it. Then I realized they weren't surrounding the Volvo, they were actually circled around Rosalie's red convertible, unmistakable lust in their eyes. None of them even looked up as Edward slid between them to open his door. I climbed quickly in the passenger side, also unnoticed. \"Ostentatious,\" he muttered. \"What kind of car is that?\" I asked. \"An M3.\" \"I don't speak Car and Driver.\" \"It's a BMW.\" He rolled his eyes, not looking at me, trying to back out without running over the car enthusiasts. I nodded \u2014 I'd heard of that one. \"Are you still angry?\" he asked as he carefully maneuvered his way out. \"Definitely.\" He sighed. \"Will you forgive me if I apologize?\" \"Maybe\u2026 if you mean it. And if you promise not to do it again,\" I insisted. His eyes were suddenly shrewd. \"How about if I mean it, and I agree to let you drive Saturday?\" he countered my conditions. I considered, and decided it was probably the best offer I would get. \"Deal,\" I agreed. \"Then I'm very sorry I upset you.\" His eyes burned with sincerity for a protracted moment \u2014 playing havoc with the rhythm of my heart \u2014 and then turned playful. \"And I'll be on your doorstep bright and early Saturday morning.\" \"Um, it doesn't help with the Charlie situation if an unexplained Volvo is left in the driveway.\" His smile was condescending now. \"I wasn't intending to bring a car.\" \"How \u2014\" He cut me off. \"Don't worry about it. I'll be there, no car.\" I let it go. I had a more pressing question. \"Is it later yet?\" I asked significantly. He frowned. \"I supposed it is later.\" I kept my expression polite as I waited. He stopped the car. I looked up, surprised \u2014 of course we were already at Charlie's house, parked behind the truck. It was easier to ride with him if I only looked when it was over. When I looked back at him, he was staring at me, measuring with his eyes.  \"And you still want to know why you can't see me hunt?\" He seemed solemn, but I thought I saw a trace of humor deep in his eyes. \"Well,\" I clarified, \"I was mostly wondering about your reaction.\" \"Did I frighten you?\" Yes, there was definitely humor there. \"No,\" I lied. He didn't buy it. \"I apologize for scaring you,\" he persisted with a slight smile, but then all evidence of teasing disappeared. \"It was just the very thought of you being there\u2026 while we hunted.\" His jaw tightened. \"That would be bad?\" He spoke from between clenched teeth. \"Extremely.\" \"Because\u2026 ?\" He took a deep breath and stared through the windshield at the thick, rolling clouds that seemed to press down, almost within reach. \"When we hunt,\" he spoke slowly, unwillingly, \"we give ourselves over to our senses\u2026 govern less with our minds. Especially our sense of smell. If you were anywhere near me when I lost control that way\u2026\" He shook his head, still gazing morosely at the heavy clouds. I kept my expression firmly under control, expecting the swift flash of his eyes to judge my reaction that soon followed. My face gave nothing away. But our eyes held, and the silence deepened \u2014 and changed. Flickers of the electricity I'd felt this afternoon began to charge the atmosphere as he gazed unrelentingly into my eyes. It wasn't until my head started to swim that I realized I wasn't breathing. When I drew in a jagged breath, breaking the stillness, he closed his eyes. \"Bella, I think you should go inside now.\" His low voice was rough, his eyes on the clouds again. I opened the door, and the arctic draft that burst into the car helped clear my head. Afraid I might stumble in my woozy state, I stepped carefully out of the car and shut the door behind me without looking back. The whir of the automatic window unrolling made me turn. \"Oh, Bella?\" he called after me, his voice more even. He leaned toward the open window with a faint smile on his lips. \"Yes?\" \"Tomorrow it's my turn.\" \"Your turn to what?\" He smiled wider, flashing his gleaming teeth. \"Ask the questions.\" And then he was gone, the car speeding down the street and disappearing around the corner before I could even collect my thoughts. I smiled as I walked to the house. It was clear he was planning to see me tomorrow, if nothing else. That night Edward starred in my dreams, as usual. However, the climate of my unconsciousness had changed. It thrilled with the same electricity that had charged the afternoon, and I tossed and turned restlessly, waking often. It was only in the early hours of the morning that I finally sank into an exhausted, dreamless sleep. When I woke I was still tired, but edgy as well. I pulled on my brown turtleneck and the inescapable jeans, sighing as I daydreamed of spaghetti straps and shorts. Breakfast was the usual, quiet event I expected. Charlie fried eggs for himself; I had my bowl of cereal. I wondered if he had forgotten about this Saturday. He answered my unspoken question as he stood up to take his plate to the sink. \"About this Saturday\u2026\" he began, walking across the kitchen and turning on the faucet. I cringed. \"Yes, Dad?\" \"Are you still set on going to Seattle?\" he asked. \"That was the plan.\" I grimaced, wishing he hadn't brought it up so I wouldn't have to compose careful half-truths. He squeezed some dish soap onto his plate and swirled it around with the brush. \"And you're sure you can't make it back in time for the dance?\" \"I'm not going to the dance, Dad.\" I glared. \"Didn't anyone ask you?\" he asked, trying to hide his concern by focusing on rinsing the plate. I sidestepped the minefield. \"It's a girl's choice.\" \"Oh.\" He frowned as he dried his plate. I sympathized with him. It must be a hard thing, to be a father; living in fear that your daughter would meet a boy she liked, but also having to worry if she didn't. How ghastly it would be, I thought, shuddering, if Charlie had even the slightest inkling of exactly what I did like. Charlie left then, with a goodbye wave, and I went upstairs to brush my teeth and gather my books. When I heard the cruiser pull away, I could only wait a few seconds before I had to peek out of my window. The silver car was already there, waiting in Charlie's spot on the driveway. I bounded down the stairs and out the front door, wondering how long this bizarre routine would continue. I never wanted it to end.  He waited in the car, not appearing to watch as I shut the door behind me without bothering to lock the dead-bolt. I walked to the car, pausing shyly before opening the door and stepping in. He was smiling, relaxed \u2014 and, as usual, perfect and beautiful to an excruciating degree. \"Good morning.\" His voice was silky. \"How are you today?\" His eyes roamed over my face, as if his question was something more than simple courtesy. \"Good, thank you.\" I was always good \u2014 much more than good \u2014 when I was near him. His gaze lingered on the circles under my eyes. \"You look tired.\" \"I couldn't sleep,\" I confessed, automatically swinging my hair around my shoulder to provide some measure of cover. \"Neither could I,\" he teased as he started the engine. I was becoming used to the quiet purr. I was sure the roar of my truck would scare me, whenever I got to drive it again. I laughed. \"I guess that's right. I suppose I slept just a little bit more than you did.\" \"I'd wager you did.\" \"So what did you do last night?\" I asked. He chuckled. \"Not a chance. It's my day to ask questions.\" \"Oh, that's right. What do you want to know?\" My forehead creased. I couldn't imagine anything about me that could be in any way interesting to him. \"What's your favorite color?\" he asked, his face grave. I rolled my eyes. \"It changes from day to day.\" \"What's your favorite color today?\" He was still solemn. \"Probably brown.\" I tended to dress according to my mood. He snorted, dropping his serious expression. \"Brown?\" he asked skeptically. \"Sure. Brown is warm. I miss brown. Everything that's supposed to be brown \u2014 tree trunks, rocks, dirt \u2014 is all covered up with squashy green stuff here,\" I complained. He seemed fascinated by my little rant. He considered for a moment, staring into my eyes. \"You're right,\" he decided, serious again. \"Brown is warm.\" He reached over, swiftly, but somehow still hesitantly, to sweep my hair back behind my shoulder. We were at the school by now. He turned back to me as he pulled into a parking space. \"What music is in your CD player right now?\" he asked, his face as somber as if he'd asked for a murder confession. I realized I'd never removed the CD Phil had given me. When I said the name of the band, he smiled crookedly, a peculiar expression in his eyes. He flipped open a compartment under his car's CD player, pulled out one of thirty or so CDs that were jammed into the small space, and handed it to me, \"Debussy to this?\" He raised an eyebrow. It was the same CD. I examined the familiar cover art, keeping my eyes down. It continued like that for the rest of the day. While he walked me to English, when he met me after Spanish, all through the lunch hour, he questioned me relentlessly about every insignificant detail of my existence. Movies I'd liked and hated, the few places I'd been and the many places I wanted to go, and books \u2014 endlessly books. I couldn't remember the last time I'd talked so much. More often than not, I felt self-conscious, certain I must be boring him. But the absolute absorption of his face, and his never-ending stream of questions, compelled me to continue. Mostly his questions were easy, only a very few triggering my easy blushes. But when I did flush, it brought on a whole new round of questions. Such as the time he asked my favorite gemstone, and I blurted out topaz before thinking. He'd been flinging questions at me with such speed that I felt like I was taking one of those psychiatric tests where you answer with the first word that comes to mind. I was sure he would have continued down whatever mental list he was following, except for the blush. My face reddened because, until very recently, my favorite gemstone was garnet. It was impossible, while staring back into his topaz eyes, not to remember the reason for the switch. And, naturally, he wouldn't rest until I'd admitted why I was embarrassed. \"Tell me,\" he finally commanded after persuasion failed \u2014 failed only because I kept my eyes safely away from his face. \"It's the color of your eyes today,\" I sighed, surrendering, staring down at my hands as I fiddled with a piece of my hair. \"I suppose if you asked me in two weeks I'd say onyx.\" I'd given more information than necessary in my unwilling honesty, and I worried it would provoke the strange anger that flared whenever I slipped and revealed too clearly how obsessed I was. But his pause was very short. \"What kinds of flowers do you prefer?\" he fired off. I sighed in relief, and continued with the psychoanalysis. Biology was a complication again. Edward had continued with his quizzing up until Mr. Banner entered the room, dragging the audiovisual frame again. As the teacher approached the light switch, I noticed Edward slide his chair slightly farther away from mine. It didn't help. As soon as the room was dark, there was the same electric spark, the same restless craving to stretch my hand across the short space and touch his cold skin, as yesterday. I leaned forward on the table, resting my chin on my folded arms, my hidden fingers gripping the table's edge as I fought to ignore the irrational longing that unsettled me. I didn't look at him, afraid that if he was looking at me, it would only make self-control that much harder. I sincerely tried to watch the movie, but at the end of the hour I had no idea what I'd just seen. I sighed in relief again when Mr. Banner turned the lights on, finally glancing at Edward; he was looking at me, his eyes ambivalent. He rose in silence and then stood still, waiting for me. We walked toward the gym in silence, like yesterday. And, also like yesterday, he touched my face wordlessly \u2014 this time with the back of his cool hand, stroking once from my temple to my jaw \u2014 before he turned and walked away. Gym passed quickly as I watched Mike's one-man badminton show. He didn't speak to me today, either in response to my vacant expression or because he was still angry about our squabble yesterday. Somewhere, in a corner of my mind, I felt bad about that. But I couldn't concentrate on him. I hurried to change afterward, ill at ease, knowing the faster I moved, the sooner I would be with Edward. The pressure made me more clumsy than usual, but eventually I made it out the door, feeling the same release when I saw him standing there, a wide smile automatically spreading across my face. He smiled in reaction before launching into more cross-examination. His questions were different now, though, not as easily answered. He wanted to know what I missed about home, insisting on descriptions of anything he wasn't familiar with. We sat in front of Charlie's house for hours, as the sky darkened and rain plummeted around us in a sudden deluge. I tried to describe impossible things like the scent of creosote \u2014 bitter, slightly resinous, but still pleasant \u2014 the high, keening sound of the cicadas in July, the feathery barrenness of the trees, the very size of the sky, extending white-blue from horizon to horizon, barely interrupted by the low mountains covered with purple volcanic rock. The hardest thing to explain was why it was so beautiful to me \u2014 to justify a beauty that didn't depend on the sparse, spiny vegetation that often looked half dead, a beauty that had more to do with the exposed shape of the land, with the shallow bowls of valleys between the craggy hills, and the way they held on to the sun. I found myself using my hands as I tried to describe it to him. His quiet, probing questions kept me talking freely, forgetting, in the dim light of the storm, to be embarrassed for monopolizing the conversation. Finally, when I had finished detailing my cluttered room at home, he paused instead of responding with another question.  \"Are you finished?\" I asked in relief. \"Not even close \u2014 but your father will be home soon.\" \"Charlie!\" I suddenly recalled his existence, and sighed. I looked out at the rain-darkened sky, but it gave nothing away. \"How late is it?\" I wondered out loud as I glanced at the clock. I was surprised by the time \u2014 Charlie would be driving home now. \"It's twilight,\" Edward murmured, looking at the western horizon, obscured as it was with clouds. His voice was thoughtful, as if his mind were somewhere far away. I stared at him as he gazed unseeingly out the windshield. I was still staring when his eyes suddenly shifted back to mine. \"It's the safest time of day for us,\" he said, answering the unspoken question in my eyes. \"The easiest time. But also the saddest, in a way\u2026 the end of another day, the return of the night. Darkness is so predictable, don't you think?\" He smiled wistfully. \"I like the night. Without the dark, we'd never see the stars.\" I frowned. \"Not that you see them here much.\" He laughed, and the mood abruptly lightened. \"Charlie will be here in a few minutes. So, unless you want to tell him that you'll be with me Saturday\u2026\" He raised one eyebrow. \"Thanks, but no thanks.\" I gathered my books, realizing I was stiff from sitting still so long. \"So is it my turn tomorrow, then?\" \"Certainly not!\" His face was teasingly outraged. \"I told you I wasn't done, didn't I?\" \"What more is there?\" \"You'll find out tomorrow.\" He reached across to open my door for me, and his sudden proximity sent my heart into frenzied palpitations. But his hand froze on the handle. \"Not good,\" he muttered. \"What is it?\" I was surprised to see that his jaw was clenched, his eyes disturbed. He glanced at me for a brief second. \"Another complication,\" he said glumly. He flung the door open in one swift movement, and then moved, almost cringed, swiftly away from me. The flash of headlights through the rain caught my attention as a dark car pulled up to the curb just a few feet away, facing us. \"Charlie's around the corner,\" he warned, staring through the downpour at the other vehicle. I hopped out at once, despite my confusion and curiosity. The rain was louder as it glanced off my jacket. I tried to make out the shapes in the front seat of the other car, but it was too dark. I could see Edward illuminated in the glare of the new car's headlights; he was still staring ahead, his gaze locked on something or someone I couldn't see. His expression was a strange mix of frustration and defiance. Then he revved the engine, and the tires squealed against the wet pavement. The Volvo was out of sight in seconds. \"Hey, Bella,\" called a familiar, husky voice from the driver's side of the little black car. \"Jacob?\" I asked, squinting through the rain. Just then, Charlie's cruiser swung around the corner, his lights shining on the occupants of the car in front of me. Jacob was already climbing out, his wide grin visible even through the darkness. In the passenger seat was a much older man, a heavyset man with a memorable face \u2014 a face that overflowed, the cheeks resting against his shoulders, with creases running through the russet skin like an old leather jacket. And the surprisingly familiar eyes, black eyes that seemed at the same time both too young and too ancient for the broad face they were set in. Jacob's father, Billy Black. I knew him immediately, though in the more than five years since I'd seen him last I'd managed to forget his name when Charlie had spoken of him my first day here. He was staring at me, scrutinizing my face, so I smiled tentatively at him. His eyes were wide, as if in shock or fear, his nostrils flared. My smile faded. Another complication, Edward had said. Billy still stared at me with intense, anxious eyes. I groaned internally. Had Billy recognized Edward so easily? Could he really believe the impossible legends his son had scoffed at? The answer was clear in Billy's eyes. Yes. Yes, he could.",
