            "en": "Five Reasons Why Inter Beat Bayern Munich    1) Diego Milito It\u2019s not hard to figure out that the 30-year-old was an important factor, simply by looking at the scoreboard.  You\u2019ll see the Argentine\u2019s name not once, but twice as he continued his penchant of scoring in big matches.  His goals clinched all three of Inter\u2019s titles this season \u2013 the Coppa Italia, Serie A and now the Champions League.  President Massimo Moratti\u2019s dream has been realised in no small part due to his efforts.  At Real Zaragoza and <em>Genoa</em> he proved to be a capable scorer, but at Inter he displayed a world-class pedigree at the top level and will hope to carry that into the World Cup.  2) Bayern\u2019s Weak Defense Milito clincially took both his chances with great aplomb, but also exposed FC Hollywood\u2019s centre-backs, a weakness that had been highlighted throughout the season in Europe\u2019s top competition, even against Manchester United and Fiorentina, and an Achilles heel that Goal.com\u2019s Ewan Macdonald pinpointed before the match. In the first instance, he beat Martin Demichelis in the air before playing a give-and-go with Wesley Sneijder and completed his brace when he left Daniel van Buyten for dead. 3) Motivation Of course both sides had their motivations, but in reality it may have propelled the Beneamata further than the Bavarians on the day. As Goal.com\u2019s Peter Staunton reports, Mourinho was motivated to defeat former mentor Louis van Gaal and win \u2018the war\u2019 with Italy.  The players were motivated by history \u2013 an Italian club\u2019s first-ever treble season and patron Massimo Moratti motivated to replicate his father\u2019s success.  Eto\u2019o determined to succeed somewhere other than Barcelona, Lucio resolute in overcoming the side that let him go, Sneijder unwavering in his goal to succeed at the Santiago Bernabeu, the list goes on...  4) Selfless Style Of Play It may not be the most pretty football to watch \u2013 Arsenal or Barcelona will offer you more of a spectacle \u2013 but the Nerazzurri proved they are the most effective in 2009-10 by working hard and diligently for one another.  Samuel Eto\u2019o is a true example, having given up his goalscoring instincts for a spot on the wing, Lucio and Walter Samuel threw their bodies on the line time and time again, Javier Zanetti dug deep to find the energy reserves to cover men and ground, and even Maicon curbed his attacking enthusiasm on Saturday evening.  5) Jose Mourinho Yes, you all knew this list would end with \u2018The Special One\u2019.  Tactically he was spot on once again \u2013 denying Bayern space in the attacking third, keeping their opportunities to a minimum, and of course ending their hopes \u2013 as he did to Chelsea, CSKA Moscow and former champions Barcelona.  Now on his way to Real Madrid, he leaves a legacy in Milan having won a historic treble that the fans will remember for years to come. His time in Serie A was anything but smooth, but in the end it was a boost for himself, the club and the country.",

            "en": "Top 20 Unsolved Mysteries (part 1)            This list comprises the most famous unsolved mysteries known to man that really defy rational explanation or are just outright strange. 1. Shroud of Turin The shroud of Turin is a linen cloth bearing the image of a man who had apparently died of crucifixion. Most Catholics consider it to be the burial shroud of Jesus Christ. It is currently held in the Cathedral of St John the Baptist in Turin, Italy. Despite many scientific investigations, no one has yet been able to explain how the image has been imprinted on the shroud and despite many attempts, no one has managed to replicate it. Radiocarbon tests date it to the middle ages, however apologists for the shroud believe it is incorrupt \u2013 and carbon dating can only date things which decay. Prior to the middle ages, reports of the shroud exist as the Image of Edessa \u2013 reliably reported since at least the 4th century. In addition, another cloth (the Sudarium) known even from biblical times (John 20:7) exists which is said to have covered Christ\u2019s head in the tomb. A 1999 study by Mark Guscin, a member of the multidisciplinary investigation team of the Spanish Center for Sindonology, investigated the relationship between the two cloths. Based on history, forensic pathology, blood chemistry (the Sudarium also is reported to have type AB blood stains), and stain patterns, he concluded that the two cloths covered the same head at two distinct, but close moments of time. Avinoam Danin (a researcher at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem) concurred with this analysis, adding that the pollen grains in the Sudarium match those of the shroud. 2. Mary Celeste Mary Celeste was launched in Nova Scotia in 1860. Her original name was \u201cAmazon\u201d. She was 103 ft overall displacing 280 tons and listed as a half-brig. Over the next 10 years she was involved in several accidents at sea and passed through a number of owners. Eventually she turned up at a New York salvage auction where she was purchased for $3,000. After extensive repairs she was put under American registry and renamed \u201cMary Celeste\u201d. The new captain of Mary Celeste was Benjamin Briggs, 37, a master with three previous commands. On November 7, 1872 the ship departed New York with Captain Briggs, his wife, young daughter and a crew of eight. The ship was loaded with 1700 barrels of raw American alcohol bound for <em>Genoa</em>, Italy. The captain, his family and crew were never seen again. The ship was found floating in the middle of the Strait of Gibraltar. There were no signs of struggle on board and all documents except the captain\u2019s log were missing. In early 1873, it was reported that two lifeboats grounded in Spain, one with a body and an American flag, the other containing five bodies. It has been alleged that these could have been the remains of the crew of the Mary Celeste. However, the bodies were apparently never identified. 3. The Taos Hum The \u2018Taos Hum\u2019 is a low-pitched sound heard in numerous places worldwide, especially in the USA, UK, and northern europe. It is usually heard only in quiet environments, and is often described as sounding like a distant diesel engine. Since it has proven indetectable by microphones or VLF antennae, its source and nature is still a mystery. In 1997 Congress directed scientists and observers from some of the most prestigious research institutes in the nation to look into a strange low frequency noise heard by residents in and around the small town of Taos, New Mexico. For years those who had heard the noise, often described by them as a \u201chum\u201d, had been looking for answers. To this day no one knows the cause of the hum. 4. Black Dahlia In 1947 the body of 22 year old Elizabeth Short was found in two pieces in a parking lot in Los Angeles. According to newspaper reports shortly after the murder, Short received the nickname \u201cBlack Dahlia\u201d at a Long Beach drugstore in the summer of 1946, as a play on the then-current movie The Blue Dahlia. However, Los Angeles County district attorney investigators\u2019 reports state the nickname was invented by newspaper reporters covering the murder. In either case, Short was not generally known as the \u201cBlack Dahlia\u201d during her lifetime. Many rumours and tales have spread about the Black Dahlia, and the investigation (one of the largest in LA history) never found the killer. 5. Comte de Saint Germain The Count of St. Germain (allegedly died February 27, 1784) was a courtier, adventurer, inventor, amateur scientist, violinist, amateur composer, and a mysterious gentleman; he also displayed some skills with the practice of alchemy. He was known as \u2018Der Wundermann\u2019 \u2014 \u2018The Wonderman\u2019. He was a man whose origin was unknown and who disappeared without leaving a trace. Since his death, various occult organizations have adopted him as a model figure or even as a powerful deity. In recent years several people have claimed to be the Count of St. Germain. (Note that St Germain was never regarded as a saint by the Roman Catholic Church \u2013 the \u201cst.\u201d before his name refers to his alleged home). 6. Voynich manuscript The Voynich Manuscript is a medieval document written in an unknown script and in an unknown language. For over one hundred years people have tried to break the code to not avail. The overall impression given by the surviving leaves of the manuscript suggests that it was meant to serve as a pharmacopoeia or to address topics in medieval or early modern medicine. However, the puzzling details of illustrations have fueled many theories about the book\u2019s origins, the contents of its text, and the purpose for which it was intended. The document contains illustrations that suggest the book is in six parts: Herbal, Astronomical, Biological, Cosmological, Pharmaceutical, and recipes. 7. Jack the Ripper In the later half of 1888, London was terrorised by a series of murders in the east end (largely in the Whitechapel area). The name Jack the Ripper was taken from a letter sent to a newspaper at the time by someone claiming to be the killer. The victims were typically prostitutes who had their throats cut and bodies mutilated. In some cases the bodies were discovered just minutes after the ripper had left the scene. The police at the time had many suspects but could never find sufficient evidence to convict anyone. In modern times there has even been some speculation that Prince Albert Victor was the murderer. Even with modern police methods, no further light has been shed on the murders in recent times. To this day no one knows who the ripper was. 8. Bermuda Triangle The Bermuda triangle is an area of water in the North Atlantic Ocean in which a large number of planes and boats have gone missing in mysterious circumstances. Over the years many explanations have been put forward for the disappearances, including bad weather, alien abductions, time warps, and suspension of the laws of physics. Although substantial documentation exists to show that many of the reports have been exaggerated, there is still no explanation for the unusually large number of disappearances in the area. 9. The Zodiac Killer The Zodiac killer was active in Northern California for ten months in the late 1960s. He killed at least five people, and injured two. He comitted the first two murders with a pistol, just inside the Benecia border. In his second shooting in Vallejo, he attempted to kill two people, but one survived despite gunshots to the head and neck. 40 minutes later the police received an anonymous phone call from a man claiming to be their killer and admitting to the murders of the previous two victims. One month three letters were sent to Newspapers in California containing a cypher that the killer claimed would give them his name. The cypher was decrypted to read: \u201cI LIKE KILLING PEOPLE BECAUSE IT IS SO MUCH FUN IT IS MORE FUN THAN KILLING WILD GAME IN THE FORREST BECAUSE MAN IS THE MOST DANGEROUE ANAMAL OF ALL TO KILL SOMETHING GIVES ME THE MOST THRILLING EXPERENCE IT IS EVEN BETTER THAN GETTING YOUR ROCKS OFF WITH A GIRL THE BEST PART OF IT IS THAE WHEN I DIE I WILL BE REBORN IN PARADICE AND THEI HAVE KILLED WILL BECOME MY SLAVES I WILL NOT GIVE YOU MY NAME BECAUSE YOU WILL TRY TO SLOI DOWN OR ATOP MY COLLECTIOG OF SLAVES FOR MY AFTERLIFE EBEORIETEMETHHPITI\u201d The last eighteen letters have not been decrypted. While Arthur Leigh Allen was the prime suspect, all of the evidence was against him being the killer. To this day the Zodiac murders have not been solved. 10. The Babushka Lady During the analysis of the film footage of the assasination of John F. Kennedy in 1963, a mysterious woman was spotted. She was wearing a brown overcoat and a scarf on her head (the scarf is the reason for her name as she wore it in a similar style to Russian grandmothers \u2013 also called babushkas). The woman appeared to be holding something in front of her face which is believed to be a camera. She appears in many photos of the scene. Even after the shooting when most people had fled the area, she remained in place and continued to film. Shortly after she is seen moving away to the East up Elm Street. The FBI publically requested that the woman come forward and give them the footage she shot but she never did. In 1970 a woman called Beverly Oliver came forward and claimed to be the Babushka Woman, though her story contains many inconsistencies. She is generally regarded as a fraud. To this day, no one knows who the Babushka Woman is or what she was doing there. More unusual is her refusal to come forward to offer her evidence.",
