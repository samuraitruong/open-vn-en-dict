            "en": "17         17. THE GAME It was just beginning to drizzle when Edward turned onto my street. Up until that moment, I'd had no doubt that he'd be staying with me while I spent a few interim hours in the real world. And then I saw the black car, a weathered Ford, parked in Charlie's driveway \u2014 and heard Edward mutter something unintelligible in a low, harsh voice. Leaning away from the rain under the shallow front porch, Jacob Black stood behind his father's wheelchair. Billy's face was <em>impassive</em> as stone as Edward parked my truck against the curb. Jacob stared down, his expression mortified. Edward's low voice was furious. \"This is crossing the line.\" \"He came to warn Charlie?\" I guessed, more horrified than angry. Edward just nodded, answering Billy's gaze through the rain with narrowed eyes. I felt weak with relief that Charlie wasn't home yet. \"Let me deal with this,\" I suggested. Edward's black glare made me anxious. To my surprise, he agreed. \"That's probably best. Be careful, though. The child has no idea.\" I bridled a little at the word child. \"Jacob is not that much younger than I am,\" I reminded him. He looked at me then, his anger abruptly fading. \"Oh, I know,\" he assured me with a grin. I sighed and put my hand on the door handle. \"Get them inside,\" he instructed, \"so I can leave. I'll be back around dusk.\" \"Do you want my truck?\" I offered, meanwhile wondering how I would explain its absence to Charlie. He rolled his eyes. \"I could walk home faster than this truck moves.\" \"You don't have to leave,\" I said wistfully. He smiled at my glum expression. \"Actually, I do. After you get rid of them\" \u2014 he threw a dark glance in the Blacks' direction \u2014 \"you still have to prepare Charlie to meet your new boyfriend.\" He grinned widely, showing all of his teeth. I groaned. \"Thanks a lot.\" He smiled the crooked smile that I loved. \"I'll be back soon,\" he promised. His eyes flickered back to the porch, and then he leaned in to swiftly kiss me just under the edge of my jaw. My heart lurched frantically, and I, too, glanced toward the porch. Billy's face was no longer <em>impassive</em>, and his hands clutched at the armrests of his chair. \"Soon,\" I stressed as I opened the door and stepped out into the rain. I could feel his eyes on my back as I half-ran through the light sprinkle toward the porch. \"Hey, Billy. Hi, Jacob.\" I greeted them as cheerfully as I could manage. \"Charlie's gone for the day \u2014 I hope you haven't been waiting long.\" \"Not long,\" Billy said in a subdued tone. His black eyes were piercing. \"I just wanted to bring this up.\" He indicated a brown paper sack resting in his lap. \"Thanks,\" I said, though I had no idea what it could be. \"Why don't you come in for a minute and dry off?\" I pretended to be oblivious to his intense scrutiny as I unlocked the door, and waved them in ahead of me. \"Here, let me take that,\" I offered, turning to shut the door. I allowed myself one last glance at Edward. He was waiting, perfectly still, his eyes solemn. \"You'll want to put it in the fridge,\" Billy noted as he handed me the package. \"It's some of Harry Clearwater's homemade fish fry \u2014 Charlie's favorite. The fridge keeps it drier.\" He shrugged. \"Thanks,\" I repeated, but with feeling this time. \"I was running out of new ways to fix fish, and he's bound to bring home more tonight.\" \"Fishing again?\" Billy asked with a subtle gleam in his eye. \"Down at the usual spot? Maybe I'll run by and see him.\" \"No,\" I quickly lied, my face going hard. \"He was headed someplace new\u2026 but I have no idea where.\" He took in my changed expression, and it made him thoughtful. \"Jake,\" he said, still appraising me. \"Why don't you go get that new picture of Rebecca out of the car? I'll leave that for Charlie, too.\" \"Where is it?\" Jacob asked, his voice morose. I glanced at him, but he was staring at the floor, his eyebrows pulling together. \"I think I saw it in the trunk,\" Billy said. \"You may have to dig for it.\" Jacob slouched back out into the rain. Billy and I faced each other in silence. After a few seconds, the quiet started to feel awkward, so I turned and headed to the kitchen. I could hear his wet wheels squeak against the linoleum as he followed. I shoved the bag onto the crowded top shelf of the fridge, and spun around to confront him. His deeply lined face was unreadable. \"Charlie won't be back for a long time.\" My voice was almost rude. He nodded in agreement, but said nothing. \"Thanks again for the fish fry,\" I hinted. He continued nodding. I sighed and folded my arms across my chest. He seemed to sense that I had given up on small talk. \"Bella,\" he said, and then he hesitated. I waited. \"Bella,\" he said again, \"Charlie is one of my best friends.\" \"Yes.\" He spoke each word carefully in his rumbling voice. \"I noticed you've been spending time with one of the Cullens.\" \"Yes,\" I repeated curtly. His eyes narrowed. \"Maybe it's none of my business, but I don't think that is such a good idea.\" \"You're right,\" I agreed. \"It is none of your business.\" He raised his graying eyebrows at my tone. \"You probably don't know this, but the Cullen family has an unpleasant reputation on the reservation.\" \"Actually, I did know that,\" I informed him in a hard voice. This surprised him. \"But that reputation couldn't be deserved, could it?\u00a0 Because the Cullens never set foot on the reservation, do they?\" I could see that my less than subtle reminder of the agreement that both bound and protected his tribe pulled him up short. \"That's true,\" he acceded, his eyes guarded. \"You seem\u2026 well informed about the Cullens. More informed than I expected.\" I stared him down. \"Maybe even better informed than you are.\" He pursed his thick lips as he considered that. \"Maybe.\" he allowed, but his eyes were shrewd. \"Is Charlie as well informed?\" He had found the weak chink in my armor. \"Charlie likes the Cullens a lot,\" I hedged. He clearly understood my evasion. His expression was unhappy, but unsurprised. \"It's not my business,\" he said. \"But it may be Charlie's.\" \"Though it would be my business, again, whether or not I think that it's Charlie's business, right?\" I wondered if he even understood my confused question as I struggled not to say anything compromising. But he seemed to. He thought about it while the rain picked up against the roof, the only sound breaking the silence. \"Yes,\" he finally surrendered. \"I guess that's your business, too.\" I sighed with relief. \"Thanks, Billy.\" \"Just think about what you're doing, Bella,\" he urged. \"Okay,\" I agreed quickly. He frowned. \"What I meant to say was, don't do what you're doing.\" I looked into his eyes, filled with nothing but concern for me, and there was nothing I could say. Just then the front door banged loudly, and I jumped at the sound. \"There's no picture anywhere in that car.\" Jacob's complaining voice reached us before he did. The shoulders of his shirt were stained with the rain, his hair dripping, when he rounded the corner. \"Hmm,\" Billy grunted, suddenly detached, spinning his chair around to face his son. \"I guess I left it at home.\" Jacob rolled his eyes dramatically. \"Great.\" \"Well, Bella, tell Charlie\" \u2014 Billy paused before continuing \u2014 \"that we stopped by, I mean.\" \"I will,\" I muttered. Jacob was surprised. \"Are we leaving already?\" \"Charlie's gonna be out late,\" Billy explained as he rolled himself past Jacob. \"Oh.\" Jacob looked disappointed. \"Well, I guess I'll see you later, then, Bella.\" \"Sure,\" I agreed. \"Take care,\" Billy warned me. I didn't answer. Jacob helped his father out the door. I waved briefly, glancing swiftly toward my now-empty truck, and then shut the door before they were gone. I stood in the hallway for a minute, listening to the sound of their car as it backed out and drove away. I stayed where I was, waiting for the irritation and anxiety to subside. When the tension eventually faded a bit, I headed upstairs to change out of my dressy clothes. I tried on a couple of different tops, not sure what to expect tonight. As I concentrated on what was coming, what had just passed became insignificant. Now that I was removed from Jasper's and Edward's influence, I began to make up for not being terrified before. I gave up quickly on choosing an outfit \u2014 throwing on an old flannel shirt and jeans \u2014 knowing I would be in my raincoat all night anyway. The phone rang and I sprinted downstairs to get it. There was only one voice I wanted to hear; anything else would be a disappointment. But I knew that if he wanted to talk to me, he'd probably just materialize in my room. \"Hello?\" I asked, breathless. \"Bella? It's me,\" Jessica said. \"Oh, hey, Jess.\" I scrambled for a moment to come back down to reality. It felt like months rather than days since I'd spoken to Jess. \"How was the dance?\" \"It was so much fun!\" Jessica gushed. Needing no more invitation than that, she launched into a minute-by-minute account of the previous night. I mmm'd and ahh'd at the right places, but it wasn't easy to concentrate. Jessica, Mike, the dance, the school \u2014 they all seemed strangely irrelevant at the moment. My eyes kept flashing to the window, trying to judge the degree of light behind the heavy clouds. \"Did you hear what I said, Bella?\" Jess asked, irritated. \"I'm sorry, what?\" \"I said, Mike kissed me! Can you believe it?\" \"That's wonderful, Jess,\" I said. \"So what did you do yesterday?\" Jessica challenged, still sounding bothered by my lack of attention. Or maybe she was upset because I hadn't asked for details. \"Nothing, really. I just hung around outside to enjoy the sun.\" I heard Charlie's car in the garage. \"Did you ever hear anything more from Edward Cullen?\" The front door slammed and I could hear Charlie banging around under the stairs, putting his tackle away. \"Um.\" I hesitated, not sure what my story was anymore. \"Hi there, kiddo!\" Charlie called as he walked into the kitchen. I waved at him. Jess heard his voice. \"Oh, your dad's there. Never mind \u2014 we'll talk tomorrow. See you in Trig.\" \"See ya, Jess.\" I hung up the phone. \"Hey, Dad,\" I said. He was scrubbing his hands in the sink. \"Where's the fish?\" \"I put it out in the freezer.\" \"I'll go grab a few pieces before they freeze \u2014 Billy dropped off some of Harry Clearwater's fish fry this afternoon.\" I worked to sound enthusiastic. \"He did?\" Charlie's eyes lit up. \"That's my favorite.\" Charlie cleaned up while I got dinner ready. It didn't take long till we were sitting at the table, eating in silence. Charlie was enjoying his food. I was wondering desperately how to fulfill my assignment, struggling to think of a way to broach the subject. \"What did you do with yourself today?\" he asked, snapping me out of my reverie. \"Well, this afternoon I just hung out around the house\u2026\" Only the very recent part of this afternoon, actually. I tried to keep my voice upbeat, but my stomach was hollow. \"And this morning I was over at the Cullens'.\" Charlie dropped his fork. \"Dr. Cullen's place?\" he asked in astonishment. I pretended not to notice his reaction. \"Yeah.\" \"What were you doing there?\" He hadn't picked his fork back up. \"Well, I sort of have a date with Edward Cullen tonight, and he wanted to introduce me to his parents\u2026 Dad?\" It appeared that Charlie was having an aneurysm. \"Dad, are you all right?\" \"You are going out with Edward Cullen?\" he thundered. Uh-oh. \"I thought you liked the Cullens.\" \"He's too old for you,\" he ranted. \"We're both juniors,\" I corrected, though he was more right than he dreamed. \"Wait\u2026\" He paused. \"Which one is Edwin?\" \"Edward is the youngest, the one with the reddish brown hair.\" The beautiful one, the godlike one\u2026 \"Oh, well, that's\" \u2014 he struggled \u2014 \"better, I guess. I don't like the look of that big one. I'm sure he's a nice boy and all, but he looks too\u2026 mature for you. Is this Edwin your boyfriend?\" \"It's Edward, Dad.\" \"Is he?\" \"Sort of, I guess.\" \"You said last night that you weren't interested in any of the boys in town.\" But he picked up his fork again, so I could see the worst was over. \"Well, Edward doesn't live in town, Dad.\" He gave me a disparaging look as he chewed. \"And, anyways,\" I continued, \"it's kind of at an early stage, you know.\u00a0 Don't embarrass me with all the boyfriend talk, okay?\" \"When is he coming over?\" \"He'll be here in a few minutes.\" \"Where is he taking you?\" I groaned loudly. \"I hope you're getting the Spanish Inquisition out of your system now. We're going to play baseball with his family.\" His face puckered, and then he finally chuckled. \"You're playing baseball?\" \"Well, I'll probably watch most of the time.\" \"You must really like this guy,\" he observed suspiciously. I sighed and rolled my eyes for his benefit. I heard the roar of an engine pull up in front of the house. I jumped up and started cleaning my dishes. \"Leave the dishes, I can do them tonight. You baby me too much.\" The doorbell rang, and Charlie stalked off to answer it. I was half a step behind him. I hadn't realized how hard it was pouring outside. Edward stood in the halo of the porch light, looking like a male model in an advertisement for raincoats. \"Come on in, Edward.\" I breathed a sigh of relief when Charlie got his name right. \"Thanks, Chief Swan,\" Edward said in a respectful voice. \"Go ahead and call me Charlie. Here, I'll take your jacket.\" \"Thanks, sir.\" \"Have a seat there, Edward.\" I grimaced. Edward sat down fluidly in the only chair, forcing me to sit next to Chief Swan on the sofa. I quickly shot him a dirty look. He winked behind Charlie's back. \"So I hear you're getting my girl to watch baseball.\" Only in Washington would the fact that it was raining buckets have no bearing at all on the playing of outdoor sports. \"Yes, sir, that's the plan.\" He didn't look surprised that I'd told my father the truth. He might have been listening, though. \"Well, more power to you, I guess.\" Charlie laughed, and Edward joined in. \"Okay.\" I stood up. \"Enough humor at my expense. Let's go.\" I walked back to the hall and pulled on my jacket. They followed. \"Not too late, Bell.\" \"Don't worry, Charlie, I'll have her home early,\" Edward promised. \"You take care of my girl, all right?\" I groaned, but they ignored me. \"She'll be safe with me, I promise, sir.\" Charlie couldn't doubt Edward's sincerity, it rang in every word. I stalked out. They both laughed, and Edward followed me. I stopped dead on the porch. There, behind my truck, was a monster Jeep. Its tires were higher than my waist. There were metal guards over the headlights and tail-lights, and four large spotlights attached to the crash bar. The hardtop was shiny red. Charlie let out a low whistle. \"Wear your seat belts,\" he choked out. Edward followed me around to my side and opened the door. I gauged the distance to the seat and prepared to jump for it. He sighed, and then lifted me in with one hand. I hoped Charlie didn't notice. As he went around to the driver's side, at a normal, human pace, I tried to put on my seat belt. But there were too many buckles. \"What's all this?\" I asked when he opened the door. \"It's an off-roading harness.\" \"Uh-oh.\" I tried to find the right places for all the buckles to fit, but it wasn't going too quickly. He sighed again and reached over to help me. I was glad that the rain was too heavy to see Charlie clearly on the porch. That meant he couldn't see how Edward's hands lingered at my neck, brushed along my collarbones. I gave up trying to help him and focused on not hyperventilating. Edward turned the key and the engine roared to life. We pulled away from the house. \"This is a\u2026 um\u2026 big Jeep you have.\" \"It's Emmett's. I didn't think you'd want to run the whole way.\" \"Where do you keep this thing?\" \"We remodeled one of the outbuildings into a garage.\" \"Aren't you going to put on your seat belt?\" He threw me a disbelieving look. Then something sunk in. \"Run the whole way? As in, we're still going to run part of the way?\" My voice edged up a few octaves. He grinned tightly. \"You're not going to run.\" \"I'm going to be sick.\" \"Keep your eyes closed, you'll be fine.\" I bit my lip, fighting the panic. He leaned over to kiss the top of my head, and then groaned. I looked at him, puzzled. \"You smell so good in the rain,\" he explained. \"In a good way, or in a bad way?\" I asked cautiously. He sighed. \"Both, always both.\" I don't know how he found his way in the gloom and downpour, but he somehow found a side road that was less of a road and more of a mountain path. For a long while conversation was impossible, because I was bouncing up and down on the seat like a jackhammer. He seemed to enjoy the ride, though, smiling hugely the whole way. And then we came to the end of the road; the trees formed green walls on three sides of the Jeep. The rain was a mere drizzle, slowing every second, the sky brighter through the clouds. \"Sorry, Bella, we have to go on foot from here.\" \"You know what? I'll just wait here.\" \"What happened to all your courage? You were extraordinary this morning.\" \"I haven't forgotten the last time yet.\" Could it have been only yesterday? He was around to my side of the car in a blur. He started unbuckling me. \"I'll get those, you go on ahead,\" I protested. \"Hmmm\u2026\" he mused as he quickly finished. \"It seems I'm going to have to tamper with your memory.\" Before I could react, he pulled me from the Jeep and set my feet on the ground. It was barely misting now; Alice was going to be right. \"Tamper with my memory?\" I asked nervously. \"Something like that.\" He was watching me intently, carefully, but there was humor deep in his eyes. He placed his hands against the Jeep on either side of my head and leaned forward, forcing me to press back against the door. He leaned in even closer, his face inches from mine. I had no room to escape. \"Now,\" he breathed, and just his smell disturbed my thought processes, \"what exactly are you worrying about?\" \"Well, um, hitting a tree \u2014\" I gulped \"\u2014 and dying. And then getting sick.\" He fought back a smile. Then he bent his head down and touched his cold lips softly to the hollow at the base of my throat. \"Are you still worried now?\" he murmured against my skin. \"Yes.\" I struggled to concentrate. \"About hitting trees and getting sick.\" His nose drew a line up the skin of my throat to the point of my chin. His cold breath tickled my skin. \"And now?\" His lips whispered against my jaw. \"Trees,\" I gasped. \"Motion sickness.\" He lifted his face to kiss my eyelids. \"Bella, you don't really think I would hit a tree, do you?\" \"No, but I might.\" There was no confidence in my voice. He smelled an easy victory. He kissed slowly down my cheek, stopping just at the corner of my mouth. \"Would I let a tree hurt you?\" His lips barely brushed against my trembling lower lip. \"No,\" I breathed. I knew there was a second part to my brilliant defense, but I couldn't quite call it back. \"You see,\" he said, his lips moving against mine. \"There's nothing to be afraid of, is there?\" \"No,\" I sighed, giving up. Then he took my face in his hands almost roughly, and kissed me in earnest, his unyielding lips moving against mine. There really was no excuse for my behavior. Obviously I knew better by now. And yet I couldn't seem to stop from reacting exactly as I had the first time. Instead of keeping safely motionless, my arms reached up to twine tightly around his neck, and I was suddenly welded to his stone figure. I sighed, and my lips parted. He staggered back, breaking my grip effortlessly. \"Damn it, Bella!\" he broke off, gasping. \"You'll be the death of me, I swear you will.\" I leaned over, bracing my hands against my knees for support. \"You're indestructible,\" I mumbled, trying to catch my breath. \"I might have believed that before I met you. Now let's get out of here before I do something really stupid,\" he growled. He threw me across his back as he had before, and I could see the extra effort it took for him to be as gentle as he was. I locked my legs around his waist and secured my arms in a choke hold around his neck. \"Don't forget to close your eyes,\" he warned severely. I quickly tucked my face into his shoulder blade, under my own arm, and squeezed my eyes shut. And I could hardly tell we were moving. I could feel him gliding along beneath me, but he could have been strolling down the sidewalk, the movement was so smooth. I was tempted to peek, just to see if he was really flying through the forest like before, but I resisted. It wasn't worth that awful dizziness. I contented myself with listening to his breath come and go evenly. I wasn't quite sure we had stopped until he reached back and touched my hair. \"It's over, Bella.\" I dared to open my eyes, and, sure enough, we were at a standstill. I stiffly unlocked my stranglehold on his body and slipped to the ground, landing on my backside. \"Oh!\" I huffed as I hit the wet ground. He stared at me incredulously, evidently not sure whether he was still too mad to find me funny. But my bewildered expression pushed him over the edge, and he broke into a roar of laughter. I picked myself up, ignoring him as I brushed the mud and bracken off the back of my jacket. That only made him laugh harder. Annoyed, I began to stride off into the forest. I felt his arm around my waist. \"Where are you going, Bella?\" \"To watch a baseball game. You don't seem to be interested in playing anymore, but I'm sure the others will have fun without you.\" \"You're going the wrong way.\" I turned around without looking at him, and stalked off in the opposite direction. He caught me again. \"Don't be mad, I couldn't help myself. You should have seen your face.\" He chuckled before he could stop himself. \"Oh, you're the only one who's allowed to get mad?\" I asked, raising my eyebrows. \"I wasn't mad at you.\" \"'Bella, you'll be the death of me'?\" I quoted sourly. \"That was simply a statement of fact.\" I tried to turn away from him again, but he held me fast. \"You were mad,\" I insisted. \"Yes.\" \"But you just said \u2014\" \"That I wasn't mad at you. Can't you see that, Bella?\" He was suddenly intense, all trace of teasing gone. \"Don't you understand?\" \"See what?\" I demanded, confused by his sudden mood swing as much as his words. \"I'm never angry with you \u2014 how could I be? Brave, trusting\u2026 warm as you are.\" \"Then why?\" I whispered, remembering the black moods that pulled him away from me, that I'd always interpreted as well-justified frustration \u2014 frustration at my weakness, my slowness, my unruly human reactions\u2026 He put his hands carefully on both sides of my face. \"I infuriate myself,\" he said gently. \"The way I can't seem to keep from putting you in danger. My very existence puts you at risk. Sometimes I truly hate myself. I should be stronger, I should be able to \u2014\"  I placed my hand over his mouth. \"Don't.\" He took my hand, moving it from his lips, but holding it to his face. \"I love you,\" he said. \"It's a poor excuse for what I'm doing, but it's still true.\" It was the first time he'd said he loved me \u2014 in so many words. He might not realize it, but I certainly did. \"Now, please try to behave yourself,\" he continued, and he bent to softly brush his lips against mine. I held properly still. Then I sighed. \"You promised Chief Swan that you would have me home early, remember? We'd better get going.\" \"Yes, ma'am.\" He smiled wistfully and released all of me but one hand. He led me a few feet through the tall, wet ferns and draping moss, around a massive hemlock tree, and we were there, on the edge of an enormous open field in the lap of the Olympic peaks. It was twice the size of any baseball stadium. I could see the others all there; Esme, Emmett, and Rosalie, sitting on a bare outcropping of rock, were the closest to us, maybe a hundred yards away. Much farther out I could see Jasper and Alice, at least a quarter of a mile apart, appearing to throw something back and forth, but I never saw any ball. It looked like Carlisle was marking bases, but could they really be that far apart? When we came into view, the three on the rocks rose. Esme started toward us. Emmett followed after a long look at Rosalie's back; Rosalie had risen gracefully and strode off toward the field without a glance in our direction. My stomach quivered uneasily in response. \"Was that you we heard, Edward?\" Esme asked as she approached. \"It sounded like a bear choking,\" Emmett clarified. I smiled hesitantly at Esme. \"That was him.\" \"Bella was being unintentionally funny,\" Edward explained, quickly settling the score. Alice had left her position and was running, or dancing, toward us. She hurtled to a fluid stop at our feet. \"It's time,\" she announced. As soon as she spoke, a deep rumble of thunder shook the forest beyond us, and then crashed westward toward town. \"Eerie, isn't it?\" Emmett said with easy familiarity, winking at me. \"Let's go.\" Alice reached for Emmett's hand and they darted toward the oversized field; she ran like a gazelle. He was nearly as graceful and just as fast \u2014 yet Emmett could never be compared to a gazelle. \"Are you ready for some ball?\" Edward asked, his eyes eager, bright. I tried to sound appropriately enthusiastic. \"Go team!\" He snickered and, after mussing my hair, bounded off after the other two. His run was more aggressive, a cheetah rather than a gazelle, and he quickly overtook them. The grace and power took my breath away. \"Shall we go down?\" Esme asked in her soft, melodic voice, and I realized I was staring openmouthed after him. I quickly reassembled my expression and nodded. Esme kept a few feet between us, and I wondered if she was still being careful not to frighten me. She matched her stride to mine without seeming impatient at the pace.  \"You don't play with them?\" I asked shyly. \"No, I prefer to referee \u2014 I like keeping them honest,\" she explained. \"Do they like to cheat, then?\" \"Oh yes \u2014 you should hear the arguments they get into! Actually, I hope you don't, you would think they were raised by a pack of wolves.\" \"You sound like my mom,\" I laughed, surprised. She laughed, too. \"Well, I do think of them as my children in most ways. I never could get over my mothering instincts \u2014 did Edward tell you I had lost a child?\" \"No,\" I murmured, stunned, scrambling to understand what lifetime she was remembering. \"Yes, my first and only baby. He died just a few days after he was born, the poor tiny thing,\" she sighed. \"It broke my heart \u2014 that's why I jumped off the cliff, you know,\" she added matter-of-factly. \"Edward just said you f-fell,\" I stammered. \"Always the gentleman.\" She smiled. \"Edward was the first of my new sons. I've always thought of him that way, even though he's older than I, in one way at least.\" She smiled at me warmly. \"That's why I'm so happy that he's found you, dear.\" The endearment sounded very natural on her lips. \"He's been the odd man out for far too long; it's hurt me to see him alone.\" \"You don't mind, then?\" I asked, hesitant again. \"That I'm\u2026 all wrong for him?\" \"No.\" She was thoughtful. \"You're what he wants. It will work out, somehow,\" she said, though her forehead creased with worry. Another peal of thunder began. Esme stopped then; apparently, we'd reached the edge of the field. It looked as if they had formed teams. Edward was far out in left field, Carlisle stood between the first and second bases, and Alice held the ball, positioned on the spot that must be the pitcher's mound. Emmett was swinging an aluminum bat; it whistled almost untraceably through the air. I waited for him to approach home plate, but then I realized, as he took his stance, that he was already there \u2014 farther from the pitcher's mound than I would have thought possible. Jasper stood several feet behind him, catching for the other team. Of course, none of them had gloves. \"All right,\" Esme called in a clear voice, which I knew even Edward would hear, as far out as he was. \"Batter up.\" Alice stood straight, deceptively motionless. Her style seemed to be stealth rather than an intimidating windup. She held the ball in both hands at her waist, and then, like the strike of a cobra, her right hand flicked out and the ball smacked into Jasper's hand. \"Was that a strike?\" I whispered to Esme. \"If they don't hit it, it's a strike,\" she told me. Jasper hurled the ball back to Alice's waiting hand. She permitted herself a brief grin. And then her hand spun out again. This time the bat somehow made it around in time to smash into the invisible ball. The crack of impact was shattering, thunderous; it echoed off the mountains \u2014 I immediately understood the necessity of the thunderstorm. The ball shot like a meteor above the field, flying deep into the surrounding forest. \"Home run,\" I murmured. \"Wait,\" Esme cautioned, listening intently, one hand raised. Emmett was a blur around the bases, Carlisle shadowing him. I realized Edward was missing. \"Out!\" Esme cried in a clear voice. I stared in disbelief as Edward sprang from the fringe of the trees, ball in his upraised hand, his wide grin visible even to me. \"Emmett hits the hardest,\" Esme explained, \"but Edward runs the fastest.\" The inning continued before my incredulous eyes. It was impossible to keep up with the speed at which the ball flew, the rate at which their bodies raced around the field. I learned the other reason they waited for a thunderstorm to play when Jasper, trying to avoid Edward's infallible fielding, hit a ground ball toward Carlisle. Carlisle ran into the ball, and then raced Jasper to first base. When they collided, the sound was like the crash of two massive falling boulders. I jumped up in concern, but they were somehow unscathed. \"Safe,\" Esme called in a calm voice. Emmett's team was up by one \u2014 Rosalie managed to flit around the bases after tagging up on one of Emmett's long flies \u2014 when Edward caught the third out. He sprinted to my side, sparkling with excitement. \"What do you think?\" he asked. \"One thing's for sure, I'll never be able to sit through dull old Major League Baseball again.\" \"And it sounds like you did so much of that before,\" he laughed. \"I am a little disappointed,\" I teased. \"Why?\" he asked, puzzled. \"Well, it would be nice if I could find just one thing you didn't do better than everyone else on the planet.\" He flashed his special crooked smile, leaving me breathless. \"I'm up,\" he said, heading for the plate. He played intelligently, keeping the ball low, out of the reach of Rosalie's always-ready hand in the outfield, gaining two bases like lightning before Emmett could get the ball back in play. Carlisle knocked one so far out of the field \u2014 with a boom that hurt my ears \u2014 that he and Edward both made it in. Alice slapped them dainty high fives. The score constantly changed as the game continued, and they razzed each other like any street ballplayers as they took turns with the lead. Occasionally Esme would call them to order. The thunder rumbled on, but we stayed dry, as Alice had predicted. Carlisle was up to bat, Edward catching, when Alice suddenly gasped. My eyes were on Edward, as usual, and I saw his head snap up to look at her. Their eyes met and something flowed between them in an instant. He was at my side before the others could ask Alice what was wrong. \"Alice?\" Esme's voice was tense. \"I didn't see \u2014 I couldn't tell,\" she whispered. All the others were gathered by this time. \"What is it, Alice?\" Carlisle asked with the calm voice of authority. \"They were traveling much quicker than I thought. I can see I had the perspective wrong before,\" she murmured. Jasper leaned over her, his posture protective. \"What changed?\" he asked. \"They heard us playing, and it changed their path,\" she said, contrite, as if she felt responsible for whatever had frightened her. Seven pairs of quick eyes flashed to my face and away. \"How soon?\" Carlisle said, turning toward Edward. A look of intense concentration crossed his face. \"Less than five minutes. They're running \u2014 they want to play.\" He scowled. \"Can you make it?\" Carlisle asked him, his eyes flicking toward me again. \"No, not carrying \u2014\" He cut short. \"Besides, the last thing we need is for them to catch the scent and start hunting.\" \"How many?\" Emmett asked Alice. \"Three,\" she answered tersely. \"Three!\" he scoffed. \"Let them come.\" The steel bands of muscle flexed along his massive arms. For a split second that seemed much longer than it really was, Carlisle deliberated. Only Emmett seemed unperturbed; the rest stared at Carlisle's face with anxious eyes. \"Let's just continue the game,\" Carlisle finally decided. His voice was cool and level. \"Alice said they were simply curious.\" All this was said in a flurry of words that lasted only a few seconds. I had listened carefully and caught most of it, though I couldn't hear what Esme now asked Edward with a silent vibration of her lips. I only saw the slight shake of his head and the look of relief on her face. \"You catch, Esme,\" he said. \"I'll call it now.\" And he planted himself in front of me. The others returned to the field, warily sweeping the dark forest with their sharp eyes. Alice and Esme seemed to orient themselves around where I stood. \"Take your hair down,\" Edward said in a low, even voice. I obediently slid the rubber band out of my hair and shook it out around me. I stated the obvious. \"The others are coming now.\" \"Yes, stay very still, keep quiet, and don't move from my side, please.\" He hid the stress in his voice well, but I could hear it. He pulled my long hair forward, around my face. \"That won't help,\" Alice said softly. \"I could smell her across the field.\" \"I know.\" A hint of frustration colored his tone. Carlisle stood at the plate, and the others joined the game halfheartedly. \"What did Esme ask you?\" I whispered. He hesitated for a second before he answered. \"Whether they were thirsty,\" he muttered unwillingly. The seconds ticked by; the game progressed with apathy now. No one dared to hit harder than a bunt, and Emmett, Rosalie, and Jasper hovered in the infield.  Now and again, despite the fear that numbed my brain, I was aware of Rosalie's eyes on me. They were expressionless, but something about the way she held her mouth made me think she was angry. Edward paid no attention to the game at all, eyes and mind ranging the forest. \"I'm sorry, Bella,\" he muttered fiercely. \"It was stupid, irresponsible, to expose you like this. I'm so sorry.\" I heard his breath stop, and his eyes zeroed in on right field. He took a half step, angling himself between me and what was coming. Carlisle, Emmett, and the others turned in the same direction, hearing sounds of passage much too faint for my ears.",

            "en": "16           16. CARLISLE He led me back to the room that he'd pointed out as Carlisle's office. He paused outside the door for an instant. \"Come in,\" Carlisle's voice invited. Edward opened the door to a high-ceilinged room with tall, west-facing windows. The walls were paneled again, in a darker wood \u2014 where they were visible. Most of the wall space was taken up by towering bookshelves that reached high above my head and held more books than I'd ever seen outside a library. Carlisle sat behind a huge mahogany desk in a leather chair. He was just placing a bookmark in the pages of the thick volume he held. The room was how I'd always imagined a college dean's would look \u2014 only Carlisle looked too young to fit the part. \"What can I do for you?\" he asked us pleasantly, rising from his seat.  \"I wanted to show Bella some of our history,\" Edward said. \"Well, your history, actually.\" \"We didn't mean to disturb you,\" I apologized. \"Not at all. Where are you going to start?\" \"The Waggoner,\" Edward replied, placing one hand lightly on my shoulder and spinning me around to look back toward the door we'd just come through. Every time he touched me, in even the most casual way, my heart had an audible reaction. It was more embarrassing with Carlisle there. The wall we faced now was different from the others. Instead of bookshelves, this wall was crowded with framed pictures of all sizes, some in vibrant colors, others dull monochromes. I searched for some logic, some binding motif the collection had in common, but I found nothing in my hasty examination. Edward pulled me toward the far left side, standing me in front of a small square oil painting in a plain wooden frame. This one did not stand out among the bigger and brighter pieces; painted in varying tones of sepia, it depicted a miniature city full of steeply slanted roofs, with thin spires atop a few scattered towers. A wide river filled the foreground, crossed by a bridge covered with structures that looked like tiny cathedrals. \"London in the sixteen-fifties,\" Edward said. \"The London of my youth,\" Carlisle added, from a few feet behind us. I flinched; I hadn't heard him approach. Edward squeezed my hand.  \"Will you tell the story?\" Edward asked. I twisted a little to see Carlisle's reaction. He met my glance and smiled. \"I would,\" he replied. \"But I'm actually running a bit late. The hospital called this morning \u2014 Dr. Snow is taking a sick day. Besides, you know the stories as well as I do,\" he added, grinning at Edward now. It was a strange combination to absorb \u2014 the everyday concerns of the town doctor stuck in the middle of a discussion of his early days in seventeenth-century London. It was also unsettling to know that he spoke aloud only for my benefit. After another warm smile for me, Carlisle left the room. I stared at the little picture of Carlisle's hometown for a long moment.  \"What happened then?\" I finally asked, staring up at Edward, who was watching me. \"When he realized what had happened to him?\" He glanced back to the paintings, and I looked to see which image caught his interest now. It was a larger landscape in dull fall colors \u2014 an empty, shadowed meadow in a forest, with a craggy peak in the distance. \"When he knew what he had become,\" Edward said quietly, \"he rebelled against it. He tried to destroy himself. But that's not easily done.\" \"How?\" I didn't mean to say it aloud, but the word broke through my shock. \"He jumped from great heights,\" Edward told me, his voice <em>impassive</em>. \"He tried to drown himself in the ocean\u2026 but he was young to the new life, and very strong. It is amazing that he was able to resist\u2026 feeding\u2026 while he was still so new. The instinct is more powerful then, it takes over everything. But he was so repelled by himself that he had the strength to try to kill himself with starvation.\" \"Is that possible?\u201dMy voice was faint. \"No, there are very few ways we can be killed.\" I opened my mouth to ask, but he spoke before I could. \"So he grew very hungry, and eventually weak. He strayed as far as he could from the human populace, recognizing that his willpower was weakening, too.  For months he wandered by night, seeking the loneliest places, loathing himself. \"One night, a herd of deer passed his hiding place. He was so wild with thirst that he attacked without a thought. His strength returned and he realized there was an alternative to being the vile monster he feared. Had he not eaten venison in his former life? Over the next months his new philosophy was born. He could exist without being a demon. He found himself again. \"He began to make better use of his time. He'd always been intelligent, eager to learn. Now he had unlimited time before him. He studied by night, planned by day. He swam to France and \u2014\" \"He swam to France?\" \"People swim the Channel all the time, Bella,\" he reminded me patiently. \"That's true, I guess. It just sounded funny in that context. Go on.\" \"Swimming is easy for us \u2014\" \"Everything is easy for you,\" I griped. He waited, his expression amused. \"I won't interrupt again, I promise.\" He chuckled darkly, and finished his sentence. \"Because, technically, we don't need to breathe.\" \"You \u2014\" \"No, no, you promised.\" He laughed, putting his cold finger lightly to my lips. \"Do you want to hear the story or not?\" \"You can't spring something like that on me, and then expect me not to say anything,\" I mumbled against his finger. He lifted his hand, moving it to rest against my neck. The speed of my heart reacted to that, but I persisted. \"You don't have to breathe?\" I demanded. \"No, it's not necessary. Just a habit.\" He shrugged. \"How long can you go\u2026 without breathing?\" \"Indefinitely, I suppose; I don't know. It gets a bit uncomfortable \u2014 being without a sense of smell.\" \"A bit uncomfortable,\" I echoed. I wasn't paying attention to my own expression, but something in it made him grow somber. His hand dropped to his side and he stood very still, his eyes intent on my face. The silence lengthened. His features were immobile as stone. \"What is it?\" I whispered, touching his frozen face. His face softened under my hand, and he sighed. \"I keep waiting for it to happen.\" \"For what to happen?\" \"I know that at some point, something I tell you or something you see is going to be too much. And then you'll run away from me, screaming as you go.\" He smiled half a smile, but his eyes were serious. \"I won't stop you. I want this to happen, because I want you to be safe. And yet, I want to be with you. The two desires are impossible to reconcile\u2026\" He trailed off, staring at my face. Waiting. \"I'm not running anywhere,\" I promised. \"We'll see,\" he said, smiling again. I frowned at him. \"So, go on \u2014 Carlisle was swimming to France.\" He paused, getting back into his story. Reflexively, his eyes flickered to another picture \u2014 the most colorful of them all, the most ornately framed, and the largest; it was twice as wide as the door it hung next to. The canvas overflowed with bright figures in swirling robes, writhing around long pillars and off marbled balconies. I couldn't tell if it represented Greek mythology, or if the characters floating in the clouds above were meant to be biblical. \"Carlisle swam to France, and continued on through Europe, to the universities there. By night he studied music, science, medicine \u2014 and found his calling, his penance, in that, in saving human lives.\" His expression became awed, almost reverent. \"I can't adequately describe the struggle; it took Carlisle two centuries of torturous effort to perfect his self-control. Now he is all but immune to the scent of human blood, and he is able to do the work he loves without agony. He finds a great deal of peace there, at the hospital\u2026\" Edward stared off into space for a long moment. Suddenly he seemed to recall his purpose. He tapped his finger against the huge painting in front of us. \"He was studying in Italy when he discovered the others there. They were much more civilized and educated than the wraiths of the London sewers.\" He touched a comparatively sedate quartet of figures painted on the highest balcony, looking down calmly on the mayhem below them. I examined the grouping carefully and realized, with a startled laugh, that I recognized the golden-haired man. \"Solimena was greatly inspired by Carlisle's friends. He often painted them as gods,\" Edward chuckled. \"Aro, Marcus, Caius,\" he said, indicating the other three, two black-haired, one snowy-white. \"Nighttime patrons of the arts.\" \"What happened to them?\" I wondered aloud, my fingertip hovering a centimeter from the figures on the canvas. \"They're still there.\" He shrugged. \"As they have been for who knows how many millennia. Carlisle stayed with them only for a short time, just a few decades. He greatly admired their civility, their refinement, but they persisted in trying to cure his aversion to 'his natural food source,' as they called it. They tried to persuade him, and he tried to persuade them, to no avail. At that point, Carlisle decided to try the New World. He dreamed of finding others like himself. He was very lonely, you see. \"He didn't find anyone for a long time. But, as monsters became the stuff of fairy tales, he found he could interact with unsuspecting humans as if he were one of them. He began practicing medicine. But the companionship he craved evaded him; he couldn't risk familiarity. \"When the influenza epidemic hit, he was working nights in a hospital in Chicago. He'd been turning over an idea in his mind for several years, and he had almost decided to act \u2014 since he couldn't find a companion, he would create one. He wasn't absolutely sure how his own transformation had occurred, so he was hesitant. And he was loath to steal anyone's life the way his had been stolen. It was in that frame of mind that he found me. There was no hope for me; I was left in a ward with the dying. He had nursed my parents, and knew I was alone. He decided to try\u2026\" His voice, nearly a whisper now, trailed off. He stared unseeingly through the west windows. I wondered which images filled his mind now, Carlisle's memories or his own. I waited quietly. When he turned back to me, a gentle angel's smile lit his expression. \"And so we've come full circle,\" he concluded. \"Have you always stayed with Carlisle, then?\" I wondered. \"Almost always.\" He put his hand lightly on my waist and pulled me with him as he walked through the door. I stared back at the wall of pictures, wondering if I would ever get to hear the other stories. Edward didn't say any more as we walked down the hall, so I asked, \"Almost?\" He sighed, seeming reluctant to answer. \"Well, I had a typical bout of rebellious adolescence \u2014 about ten years after I was\u2026 born\u2026 created, whatever you want to call it. I wasn't sold on his life of abstinence, and I resented him for curbing my appetite. So I went off on my own for a time.\" \"Really?\" I was intrigued, rather than frightened, as I perhaps should have been. He could tell. I vaguely realized that we were headed up the next flight of stairs, but I wasn't paying much attention to my surroundings. \"That doesn't repulse you?\" \"No.\" \"Why not?\" \"I guess\u2026 it sounds reasonable.\" He barked a laugh, more loudly than before. We were at the top of the stairs now, in another paneled hallway. \"From the time of my new birth,\" he murmured, \"I had the advantage of knowing what everyone around me was thinking, both human and non-human alike. That's why it took me ten years to defy Carlisle \u2014 I could read his perfect sincerity, understand exactly why he lived the way he did. \"It took me only a few years to return to Carlisle and recommit to his vision. I thought I would be exempt from the\u2026 depression\u2026 that accompanies a conscience. Because I knew the thoughts of my prey, I could pass over the innocent and pursue only the evil. If I followed a murderer down a dark alley where he stalked a young girl \u2014 if I saved her, then surely I wasn't so terrible.\" I shivered, imagining only too clearly what he described \u2014 the alley at night, the frightened girl, the dark man behind her. And Edward, Edward as he hunted, terrible and glorious as a young god, unstoppable. Would she have been grateful, that girl, or more frightened than before? \"But as time went on, I began to see the monster in my eyes. I couldn't escape the debt of so much human life taken, no matter how justified. And I went back to Carlisle and Esme. They welcomed me back like the prodigal. It was more than I deserved.\" We'd come to a stop in front of the last door in the hall. \"My room,\" he informed me, opening it and pulling me through. His room faced south, with a wall-sized window like the great room below. The whole back side of the house must be glass. His view looked down on the winding Sol Duc River, across the untouched forest to the Olympic Mountain range. The mountains were much closer than I would have believed. The western wall was completely covered with shelf after shelf of CDs. His room was better stocked than a music store. In the corner was a sophisticated-looking sound system, the kind I was afraid to touch because I'd be sure to break something. There was no bed, only a wide and inviting black leather sofa. The floor was covered with a thick golden carpet, and the walls were hung with heavy fabric in a slightly darker shade. \"Good acoustics?\" I guessed. He chuckled and nodded. He picked up a remote and turned the stereo on. It was quiet, but the soft jazz number sounded like the band was in the room with us. I went to look at his mind-boggling music collection. \"How do you have these organized?\" I asked, unable to find any rhyme or reason to the titles. He wasn't paying attention. \"Ummm, by year, and then by personal preference within that frame,\" he said absently. I turned, and he was looking at me with a peculiar expression in his eyes. \"What?\" \"I was prepared to feel\u2026 relieved. Having you know about everything, not needing to keep secrets from you. But I didn't expect to feel more than that. I like it. It makes me\u2026 happy.\" He shrugged, smiling slightly. \"I'm glad,\" I said, smiling back. I'd worried that he might regret telling me these things. It was good to know that wasn't the case. But then, as his eyes dissected my expression, his smile faded and his forehead creased. \"You're still waiting for the running and the screaming, aren't you?\" I guessed. A faint smile touched his lips, and he nodded. \"I hate to burst your bubble, but you're really not as scary as you think you are. I don't find you scary at all, actually,\" I lied casually. He stopped, raising his eyebrows in blatant disbelief. Then he flashed a wide, wicked smile. \"You really shouldn't have said that,\" he chuckled. He growled, a low sound in the back of his throat; his lips curled back over his perfect teeth. His body shifted suddenly, half-crouched, tensed like a lion about to pounce. I backed away from him, glaring. \"You wouldn't.\" \u00a0\" I didn't see him leap at me \u2014 it was much too fast. I only found myself suddenly airborne, and then we crashed onto the sofa, knocking it into the wall. All the while, his arms formed an iron cage of protection around me \u2014 I was barely jostled. But I still was gasping as I tried to right myself. He wasn't having that. He curled me into a ball against his chest, holding me more securely than iron chains. I glared at him in alarm, but he seemed well in control, his jaw relaxed as he grinned, his eyes bright only with humor. \"You were saying?\" he growled playfully. \"That you are a very, very terrifying monster,\" I said, my sarcasm marred a bit by my breathless voice. \"Much better,\" he approved. \"Um.\" I struggled. \"Can I get up now?\" He just laughed. \"Can we come in?\" a soft voice sounded from the hall. I struggled to free myself, but Edward merely readjusted me so that I was somewhat more conventionally seated on his lap. I could see it was Alice, then, and Jasper behind her in the doorway. My cheeks burned, but Edward seemed at ease. \"Go ahead.\" Edward was still chuckling quietly. Alice seemed to find nothing unusual in our embrace; she walked \u2014 almost danced, her movements were so graceful \u2014 to the center of the room, where she folded herself sinuously onto the floor. Jasper, however, paused at the door, his expression a trifle shocked. He stared at Edward's face, and I wondered if he was tasting the atmosphere with his unusual sensitivity. \"It sounded like you were having Bella for lunch, and we came to see if you would share,\" Alice announced. I stiffened for an instant, until I realized Edward was grinning \u2014 whether at her comment or my response, I couldn't tell. \"Sorry, I don't believe I have enough to spare,\" he replied, his arms holding me recklessly close. \"Actually,\" Jasper said, smiling despite himself as he walked into the room, \"Alice says there's going to be a real storm tonight, and Emmett wants to play ball. Are you game?\" The words were all common enough, but the context confused me. I gathered that Alice was a bit more reliable than the weatherman, though. Edward's eyes lit up, but he hesitated. \"Of course you should bring Bella,\" Alice chirped. I thought I saw Jasper throw a quick glance at her. \"Do you want to go?\" Edward asked me, excited, his expression vivid. \"Sure.\" I couldn't disappoint such a face. \"Um, where are we going?\" \"We have to wait for thunder to play ball \u2014 you'll see why,\" he promised. \"Will I need an umbrella?\" They all three laughed aloud. \"Will she?\" Jasper asked Alice. \"No.\" She was positive. \"The storm will hit over town. It should be dry enough in the clearing.\" \"Good, then.\" The enthusiasm in Jasper's voice was catching, naturally. I found myself eager, rather than scared stiff. \"Let's go see if Carlisle will come.\" Alice bounded up and to the door in a fashion that would break any ballerina's heart. \"Like you don't know,\" Jasper teased, and they were swiftly on their way. Jasper managed to inconspicuously close the door behind them. \"What will we be playing?\" I demanded. \"You will be watching,\" Edward clarified. \"We will be playing baseball.\" I rolled my eyes. \"Vampires like baseball?\" \"It's the American pastime,\" he said with mock solemnity.",

            "en": "7 REPETITION          20. VOLTERRA WE BEGAN THE STEEP CLIMB, AND THE ROAD GREW CONGESTED. As we wound higher, the cars became too close together for Alice to weave insanely between them anymore. We slowed to a crawl behind a little tan Peugeot. \"Alice,\" I moaned. The clock on the dash seemed to be speeding up. \"It's the only way in,\" she tried soothe me. But her voice was too strained to comfort. The cars continued to edge forward, one car length at a time. The sun beamed down brilliantly, seeming already overhead. The cars crept one by one toward the city. As we got closer, I could see cars parked by the side of the road with people getting out to walk the test of the way. At first I thought it was just impatience\u2014something I could easily understand. But then we came around a switchback, and I could see the filled parking lot outside the city wall, the crowds of people walking through the gates. No one was being allowed to drive through. \"Alice,\" I whispered urgently. \"I know,\" she said. Her face was chiseled from ice. Now that I was looking, and we were crawling slowly enough to see, I could tell that it was very windy. The people crowding toward the gate gripped their hats and tugged their hair out of their faces. Their clothes billowed around them. I also noticed that the color red was everywhere. Red shirts, red hats, red flags dripping like long ribbons beside the gate, whipping in the wind\u2014as I watched, the brilliant crimson scarf one woman had tied around her hair was caught in a sudden gust. It twisted up into the air above her, writhing like it was alive. She reached for it, jumping in the air, but it continued to flutter higher, a patch of bloody color against the dull, ancient walls. \"Bella.\" Alice spoke quickly in a fierce, low voice. \"I can't see what the guard here will decide now\u2014if this doesn't work, you're going to have to go in alone. You're going to have to run. Just keep asking for the Palazzo dei Priori, and running in the direction they tell you. Don't get lost.\" \"Palazzo dei Priori, Palazzo dei Priori,\" I repeated the name over and over again, trying to get it down. \"Or 'the clock tower,' if they speak English. I'll go around and try to find a secluded spot somewhere behind the city where I can go over the wall.\" I nodded. \"Palazzo dei Priori.\" \"Edward will be under the clock tower, to the north of the square. There's a narrow alleyway on the right, and he'll be in the shadow there. You have to get his attention before he can move into the sun.\" I nodded furiously. Alice was near the front of the line. A man in a navy blue uniform was directing the flow of traffic, turning the cars away from the full lot. They U-turned and headed back to find a place beside the road. Then it was Alice's turn. The uniformed man motioned lazily, not paying attention. Alice accelerated, edging around him and heading for the gate. He shouted something at us, but held his ground, waving frantically to keep the next car from following our bad example. The man at the gate wore a matching uniform. As we approached him, the throngs of tourists passed, crowding the sidewalks, staring curiously at the pushy, flashy Porsche. The guard stepped into the middle of the street. Alice angled the car carefully before she came to a full stop. The sun beat against my window, and she was in shadow. She swiftly reached behind the seat and grabbed something from her bag. The guard came around the car with an irritated expression, and tapped on her window angrily.  She rolled the window down halfway, and I watched him do a double take when he saw the face behind the dark glass. \"I'm sorry, only tour buses allowed in the city today, miss,\" he said in English, with a heavy accent. He was apologetic, now, as if he wished he had better news for the strikingly beautiful woman. \"It's a private tour,\" Alice said, flashing an alluring smile. She reached her hand out of the window, into the sunlight. I froze, until I realized she was wearing an elbow-length, tan glove. She took his hand, still raised from tapping her window, and pulled it into the car. She put something into his palm, and folded his fingers around it. His face was dazed as he retrieved his hand and stared at the thick roll of money he now held. The outside bill was a thousand dollar bill. \"Is this a joke?\" he mumbled. Alice's smile was blinding. \"Only if you think it's funny.\" He looked at her, his eyes staring wide. I glanced nervously at the clock on the dash. If Edward stuck to his plan, we had only five minutes left. \"I'm in a wee bit of a hurry,\" she hinted, still smiling. The guard blinked twice, and then shoved the money inside his vest. He took a step away from the window and waved us on. None of the passing people seemed to notice the quiet exchange. Alice drove into the city, and we both sighed in relief. The street was very narrow, cobbled with the same color stones as the faded cinnamon brown buildings that darkened the street with their shade. It had the feel of an alleyway. Red flags decorated the walls, spaced only a few yards apart, flapping in the wind that whistled through the narrow lane. It was crowded, and the foot traffic slowed our progress. \"Just a little farther,\" Alice encouraged me; I was gripping the door handle, ready to throw myself into the street as soon as she spoke the word. She drove in quick spurts and sudden stops, and the people in the crowd shook their fists at us and said angry words that I was glad I couldn't understand. She turned onto a little path that couldn't have been meant for cars; shocked people had to squeeze into doorways as we scraped by. We found another street at the end. The buildings were taller here; they leaned together overhead so that no sunlight touched the pavement\u2014the thrashing red flags on either side nearly met. The crowd was thicker here than anywhere else. Alice stopped the car. I had the door open before we were at a standstill. She pointed to where the street widened into a patch of bright openness. \"There\u2014we're at the southern end of the square. Run straight across, to the right of the clock tower. I'll find a way around\u2014\" Her breath caught suddenly, and when she spoke again, her voice was a hiss. \"They're everywhere?\" I froze in place, but she pushed me out of the car. \"Forget about them. You have two minutes. Go, Bella, go!\" she shouted, climbing out of the car as she spoke. I didn't pause to watch Alice melt into the shadows. I didn't stop to close my door behind me. I shoved a heavy woman out of my way and ran flat out, head down, paying little attention to anything but the uneven stones beneath my feet. Coming out of the dark lane, I was blinded by the brilliant sunlight beating down into the principal plaza.  The wind whooshed into me, flinging my hair into my eyes and blinding me further. It was no wonder that I didn't see the wall of flesh until I'd smacked into it. There was no pathway, no crevice between the close pressed bodies. I pushed against them furiously, fighting the hands that shoved back. I heard exclamations of irritation and even pain as I battled my way through, but none were in a language I understood. The faces were a blur of anger and surprise, surrounded by the ever-present red. A blond woman scowled at me, and the red scarf coiled around her neck looked like a gruesome wound. A child, lifted on a man's shoulders to see over the crowd, grinned down at me, his lips distended over a set of plastic vampire fangs. The throng jostled around me, spinning me the wrong direction. I was glad the clock was so visible, or I'd never keep my course straight. But both hands on the clock pointed up toward the pitiless sun, and, though I shoved viciously against the crowd, I knew I was too late. I wasn't halfway across. I wasn't going to make it. I was stupid and slow and human, and we were all going to die because of it. I hoped Alice would get out. I hoped that she would see me from some dark shadow and know that I had failed, so she could go home to Jasper. I listened, above the angry exclamations, trying to hear the sound of discovery: the gasp, maybe the scream, as Edward came into someone's view. But there was a break in the crowd\u2014I could see a bubble of space ahead. I pushed urgently toward it, not realizing till I bruised my shins against the bricks that there was a wide, square fountain set into the center of the plaza. I was nearly crying with relief as I flung my leg over the edge and ran through the knee-deep water. It sprayed all around me as I thrashed my way across the pool. Even in the sun, the wind was glacial, and the wet made the cold actually painful. But the fountain was very wide; it let me cross the center of the square and then some in mere seconds. I didn't pause when I hit the far edge\u2014I used the low wall as a springboard, throwing myself into the crowd. They moved more readily for me now, avoiding the icy water that splattered from my dripping clothes as I ran. I glanced up at the clock again. A deep, booming chime echoed through the square. It throbbed in the stones under my feet. Children cried, covering their ears. And I started screaming as I ran. \"Edward!\" I screamed, knowing it was useless. The crowd was too loud, and my voice was breathless with exertion. But I couldn't stop screaming. The clock tolled again. I ran past a child in his mother's arms\u2014his hair was almost white in the dazzling sunlight. A circle of tall men, all wearing red blazers, called out warnings as I barreled through them. The clock tolled again. On the other side of the men in blazers, there was a break in the throng, space between the sightseers who milled aimlessly around me. My eyes searched the dark narrow passage to the right of the wide square edifice under the tower. I couldn't see the street level\u2014there were still too many people in the way. The clock tolled again. It was hard to see now. Without the crowd to break the wind, it whipped at my face and burned my eyes. I couldn't be sure if that was the reason behind my tears, or if I was crying in defeat as the clock tolled again. A little family of four stood nearest to the alley's mouth. The two girls wore crimson dresses, with matching ribbons tying their dark hair back. The father wasn't tall. It seemed like I could see something bright in the shadows, just over his shoulder. I hurtled toward them, trying to see past the stinging tears. The clock tolled, and the littlest girl clamped her hands over her ears. The older girl, just waist high on her mother, hugged her mother's leg and stared into the shadows behind them. As I watched, she tugged on her mother's elbow and pointed toward the darkness. The clock tolled, and I was so close now. I was close enough to hear her high-pitched voice. Her father stared at me in surprise as I bore down on them, rasping out Edward's name over and over again. The older girl giggled and said something to her mother, gesturing toward the shadows again impatiently. I swerved around the father\u2014he clutched the baby out of my way\u2014and sprinted for the gloomy breach behind them as the clock tolled over my head. \"Edward, no!\" I screamed, but my voice was lost in the roar of the chime. I could see him now. And I could see that he could not see me. It was really him, no hallucination this time. And I realized that my delusions were more flawed than I'd realized; they'd never done him justice. Edward stood, motionless as a statue, just a few feet from the mouth of the alley. His eyes were closed, the rings underneath them deep purple, his arms relaxed at his sides, his palms turned forward. His expression was very peaceful, like he was dreaming pleasant things. The marble skin of his chest was bare\u2014there was a small pile of white fabric at his feet. The light reflecting from the pavement of the square gleamed dimly from his skin. I'd never seen anything more beautiful\u2014even as I ran, gasping and screaming, I could appreciate that. And the last seven months meant nothing. And his words in the forest meant nothing. And it did not matter if he did not want me. I would never want anything but him, no matter how long I lived. The clock tolled, and he took a large stride toward the light. \"No!\" I screamed. \"Edward, look at me!\" He wasn't listening. He smiled very slightly. He raised his foot to take the step that would put him directly in the path of the sun. I slammed into him so hard that the force would have hurled me to the ground if his arms hadn't caught me and held me up. It knocked my breath out of me and snapped my head back. His dark eyes opened slowly as the clock tolled again. He looked down at me with quiet surprise. \"Amazing,\" he said, his exquisite voice full of wonder, slightly amused. \"Carlisle was right.\" \"Edward,\" I tried to gasp, but my voice had no sound. \"You've got to get back into the shadows. You have to move!\" He seemed bemused. His hand brushed softly against my cheek. He didn't appear to notice that I was trying to force him back. I could have been pushing against the alley walls for all the progress I was making. The clock tolled, but he didn't react. It was very strange, for I knew we were both in mortal danger. Still, in that instant, I felt well. Whole. I could feel my heart racing in my chest, the blood pulsing hot and fast through my veins again. My lungs filled deep with the sweet scent that came off his skin. It was like there had never been any hole in my chest. I was perfect\u2014not healed, but as if there had been no wound in the first place. d\u1ec5 ch\u1ecbu \"I can't believe how quick it was. I didn't feel a thing\u2014they're very good,\" he mused, closing his eyes again and pressing his lips against my hair. His voice was like honey and velvet. \"Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath, hath had no power yet upon thy beauty,\" he murmured, and I recognized the line spoken by Romeo in the tomb. The clock boomed out its final chime \"You smell just exactly the same as always,\" he went on. \"So maybe this is hell. I don't care. I'll take it.\" \"I'm not dead,\" I interrupted. \"And neither are you! Please Edward, we have to move. They can't be far away!\" I struggled in his arms, and his brow furrowed in confusion. \"What was that?\" he asked politely. \"We're not dead, not yet! But we have to get out of here before the Volturi\u2014\" Comprehension flickered on his face as I spoke. Before I could finish, he suddenly yanked me away from the edge of the shadows, spinning me effortlessly so that my back was tight against the brick wall, and his back was to me as he faced away into the alley. His arms spread wide, protectively, in front of me. I peeked under his arm to see two dark shapes detach themselves from the gloom. \"Greetings, gentlemen,\" Edward's voice was calm and pleasant, on the surface. \"I don't think I'll be requiring your services today. I would appreciate it very much, however, if you would send my thanks to your masters.\" \"Shall we take this conversation to a more appropriate venue?\" a smooth voice whispered menacingly. \"I don't believe that will be necessary.\" Edward's voice was harder now. \"I know your instructions, Felix.\u00a0 I haven't broken any rules.\" \"Felix merely meant to point out the proximity of the sun,\" the other shadow said in a soothing tone. They were both concealed within smoky gray cloaks that reached to the ground and undulated in the wind. \"Let us seek better cover.\" \"I'll be right behind you,\" Edward said dryly. \"Bella, why don't you go back to the square and enjoy the festival?\" \"No, bring the girl,\" the first shadow said, somehow injecting a leer into his whisper. \"I don't think so.\" The pretense of civility disappeared. Edward's voice was flat and icy. His weight shifted infinitesimally, and I could see that he was preparing to fight. \"No.\" I mouthed the word. \"Shh,\" he murmured, only for me. \"Felix,\" the second, more reasonable shadow cautioned. \"Not here.\" He turned to Edward. \"Aro would simply like to speak with you again, if you have decided not to force our hand after all.\" \"Certainly,\" Edward agreed. '\"But the girl goes free.\" \"I'm afraid that's not possible,\" the polite shadow said regretfully. \"We do have rules to obey.\" \"Then I'm afraid that I'll be unable to accept Aro's invitation, Demetri.\" \"That's just fine,\" Felix purred. My eyes were adjusting to the deep shade, and I could see that Felix was very big, tall and thick through the shoulders. His size reminded me of Emmett. \"Aro will be disappointed,\" Demetri sighed. \"I'm sure he'll survive the letdown,\" Edward replied. Felix and Demetri stole closer toward the mouth of the alley, spreading out slightly so they could come at Edward from two sides. They meant to force him deeper into the alley, to avoid a scene. No reflected light found access to their skin; they were safe inside their cloaks. Edward didn't move an inch. He was dooming himself by protecting me. Abruptly, Edward's head whipped around, toward the darkness of the winding alley, and Demetri and Felix did the same, in response to some sound or movement too subtle for my senses. \"Let's behave ourselves, shall we?\" a lilting voice suggested. \"There are ladies present.\" Alice tripped lightly to Edward's side, her stance casual. There was no hint of any underlying tension. She looked so tiny, so fragile. Her little arms swung like a child's. Yet Demetri and Felix both straightened up, their cloaks swirling slightly as a gust of wind funneled through the alley. Felix's face soured. Apparently, they didn't like even numbers. \"We're not alone,\" she reminded them. Demetri glanced over his shoulder. A few yards into the square, the little family, with the girls in their red dresses, was watching us. The mother was speaking urgently to her husband, her eyes on the five of us. She looked away when Demetri met her gaze. The man walked a few steps farther into the plaza, and tapped one of the red-blazered men on the shoulder. Demetri shook his head. \"Please, Edward, let's be reasonable,\" he said. \"Let's,\" Edward agreed. \"And we'll leave quietly now, with no one the wiser.\" Demetri sighed in frustration. \"At least let us discuss this more privately.\" Six men in red now joined the family as they watched us with anxious expressions. I was very conscious of Edward's protective stance in front of me\u2014sure that this was what caused their alarm. I wanted to scream to them to run. Edward's teeth came together audibly. \"No.\" Felix smiled. \"Enough.\" The voice was high, reedy, and n came from behind us. I peeked under Edward's other arm to see a small, dark shape coming toward us. By the way the edges billowed, I knew it would be another one of them. Who else? At first I thought it was a young boy. The newcomer was as tiny as Alice, with lank, pale brown hair trimmed short. The body under the cloak\u2014which was darker, almost black\u2014was slim and androgynous. But the face was too pretty for a boy. The wide-eyed, full-lipped face would make a Botticelli angel look like a gargoyle. Even allowing for the dull crimson irises. Her size was so insignificant that the reaction to her appearance confused me. Felix and Demetri relaxed immediately, stepping back from their offensive positions to blend again with the shadows of the overhanging walls. Edward dropped his arms and relaxed his position as well\u2014but in defeat. \"Jane,\" he sighed in recognition and resignation. Alice folded her arms across her chest, her expression <em>impassive</em>. \"Follow me,\" Jane spoke again, her childish voice a monotone. She turned her back on us and drifted silently into the dark. Felix gestured for us to go first, smirking. Alice walked after the little Jane at once. Edward wrapped his arm around my waist and pulled me along beside her. The alley angled slightly downward as it narrowed. I looked up at him with frantic questions in my eyes, but he just shook his head. Though I couldn't hear the others behind us, I was sure they were there. \"Well, Alice,\" Edward said conversationally as we walked. \"I suppose I shouldn't be surprised to see you here.\" \"It was my mistake,\" Alice answered in the same tone. \"It was my job to set it right.\" \"What happened?\" His voice was polite, as if he were barely interested. I imagined this was due to the listening ears behind us. \"It's a long story.\" Alice's eyes flickered toward me and away. \"In summary, she did jump off a cliff, but she wasn't trying to kill herself. Bella's all about the extreme sports these days.\" I flushed and turned my eyes straight ahead, looking after the dark shadow that I could no longer see. I could imagine what he was hearing in Alice's thoughts now. Near-drownings, stalking vampires, werewolf friends\u2026 \"Hm,\" Edward said curtly, and the casual tone of his voice was gone. There was a loose curve to the alley, still slanting downward, so I didn't see the squared-off dead end coming until we reached the flat, windowless, brick face. The little one called Jane was nowhere to be seen. Alice didn't hesitate, didn't break pace as she strode toward the wall. Then, with easy grace, she slid down an open hole in the street. It looked like a drain, sunk into the lowest point of the paving. I hadn't noticed it until Alice disappeared, but the grate was halfway pushed aside. The hole was small, and black. I balked. \"It's all right, Bella,\" Edward said in a low voice. \"Alice will catch you.\" I eyed the hole doubtfully. I imagine he would have gone first, if Demetri and Felix hadn't been waiting, smug and silent, behind us. I crouched down, swinging my legs into the narrow gap. \"Alice?\" I whispered, voice trembling. \"I'm right here, Bella,\" she reassured me. Her voice came from too far below to make me feel better. Edward took my wrists\u2014his hands felt like stones in winter\u2014and lowered me into the blackness. \"Ready?\" he asked. \"Drop her,\" Alice called. I closed my eyes so I couldn't see the darkness, scrunching them together in terror, clamping my mouth shut so I wouldn't scream. Edward let me fall. It was silent and short. The air whipped past me for just half a second, and then, with a huff as I exhaled, Alice's waiting arms caught me. I was going to have bruises; her arms were very hard. She stood me upright. It was dim, but not black at the bottom. The light from the hole above provided a faint glow, reflecting wetly from the stones under my feet. The light vanished for a second, and then Edward was a faint, white radiance beside me. He put his arm around me, holding me close to his side, and began to tow me swiftly forward. I wrapped both arms around his cold waist, and tripped and stumbled my way across the uneven stone surface.  The sound of the heavy grate sliding over the drain hole behind us rang with metallic finality. The dim light from the street was quickly lost in the gloom. The sound of my staggering footsteps echoed through the black space; it sounded very wide, but I couldn't be sure. There were no sounds other than my frantic heartbeat and my feet on the wet stones\u2014except for once, when an impatient sigh whispered from behind me. Edward held me tightly. He reached his free hand across his body to hold my face, too, his smooth thumb tracing across my lips. Now and then, I felt his face press into my hair. I realized that this was the only reunion we would get, and I clutched myself closer to him.  For now, it felt like he wanted me, and that was enough to offset the horror of the subterranean tunnel and the prowling vampires behind us. It was probably no more than guilt\u2014the same guilt that compelled him to come here to die when he'd believed that it was his fault that I'd killed myself. But I felt his lips press silently against my forehead, and I didn't care what the motivation was. At least I could be with him again before I died. That was better than a long life. I wished I could ask him exactly what was going to happen now. I wanted desperately to know how we were going to die\u2014as if that would somehow make it better, knowing in advance. But I couldn't speak, even in a whisper, surrounded as we were. The others could hear everything\u2014my every breath, my every heartbeat. The path beneath our feet continued to slant downward, taking us deeper into the ground, and it made me claustrophobic. Only Edward's hand, soothing against my face, kept me from screaming out loud. I couldn't tell where the light was coming from, but it slowly turned dark gray instead of black. We were in a low, arched tunnel. Long trails of ebony moisture seeped down the gray stones, like they were bleeding ink. I was shaking, and I thought it was from fear. It wasn't until my teeth started to chatter together that I realized I was cold. My clothes were still wet, and the temperature underneath the city was wintry. As was Edward's skin. He realized this at the same time I did, and let go of me, keeping only my hand. \"N-n-no,\" I chattered, throwing my arms around him. I didn't care if I froze. Who knew how long we had left? His cold hand chafed against my arm, trying to warm me with the friction. We hurried through the tunnel, or it felt like hurrying to me. My slow progress irritated someone\u2014I guessed Felix\u2014and I heard him heave a sigh now and then. At the end of the tunnel was a grate\u2014the iron bars were rusting, but thick as my arm. A small door made of thinner, interlaced bars was standing open. Edward ducked through and hurried on to a larger, brighter stone room. The grille slammed shut with a clang, followed by the snap of a lock. I was too afraid to look behind me. On the other side of the long room was a low, heavy wooden door. It was very thick\u2014as I could tell because it, too, stood open. We stepped through the door, and I glanced around me in surprise, relaxing automatically. Beside me, Edward tensed, his jaw clenched tight.",

            "en": "2-2songngu        2. STITCHES CARLISLE WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO STAYED calm. Centuries of\u00a0 experience in the emergency room were evident in his quiet, authoritative voice. \"Emmett, Rose, get Jasper outside.\" Unsmiling for once, Emmett nodded. \"Come on, Jasper.\" Jasper struggled against Emmett's unbreakable grasp, twisting around, reaching toward his brother with his bared teeth, his eyes still past reason. Edward's face was whiter than bone as he wheeled to crouch over me, taking a clearly defensive position. A low warning growl slid from between his clenched teeth. I could tell that he wasn't breathing. Rosalie, her divine face strangely smug, stepped in front of Jasper\u2014keeping a careful distance from his teeth\u2014and helped Emmett wrestle him through the glass door that Esme held open, one hand pressed over her mouth and nose. Esme's heart-shaped face was ashamed. \"I'm so sorry, Bella,\" she cried as she followed the others into the yard. \"Let me by, Edward,\" Carlisle murmured. A second passed, and then Edward nodded slowly and relaxed his stance. Carlisle knelt beside me, leaning close to examine my arm. I could feel the shock frozen on my face, and I tried to compose it. \"Here, Carlisle,\" Alice said, handing him a towel. He shook his head. \"Too much glass in the wound.\" He reached over and ripped a long, thin scrap from the bottom of the white tablecloth. He twisted it around my arm above the elbow to form a tourniquet. The smell of the blood was making me dizzy. My ears rang. \"Bella,\" Carlisle said softly. \"Do you want me to drive you to the hospital, or would you like me to take care of it here?\" \"Here, please,\" I whispered. If he took me to the hospital, there would be no way to keep this from Charlie. \"I'll get your bag,\" Alice said. \"Let's take her to the kitchen table,\" Carlisle said to Edward. Edward lifted me effortlessly, while Carlisle kept the pressure steady on my arm. \"How are you doing, Bella?\" Carlisle asked. \"I'm fine.\" My voice was reasonably steady, which pleased me. Edward's face was like stone. Alice was there. Carlisle's black bag was already on the table, a small but brilliant desk light plugged into the wall. Edward sat me gently into a chair, and Carlisle pulled up another. He went to work at once. Edward stood over me, still protective, still not breathing. \"Just go, Edward,\" I sighed. \"I can handle it,\" he insisted. But his jaw was rigid; his eyes burned with the intensity of the thirst he fought, so much worse for him than it was for the others. \"You don't need to be a hero,\" I said. \"Carlisle can fix me up without your help. Get some fresh air.\" I winced as Carlisle did something to my arm that stung. \"I'll stay,\" he said. \"Why are you so masochistic?\" I mumbled. Carlisle decided to intercede. \"Edward, you may as well go find Jasper before he gets too far. I'm sure he's upset with himself, and I doubt he'll listen to anyone but you right now.\" \"Yes,\" I eagerly agreed. \"Go find Jasper.\" \"You might as well do something useful,\" Alice added. Edward's eyes narrowed as we ganged up on him, but, finally, he nodded once and sprinted smoothly through the kitchen's back door. I was sure he hadn't taken a breath since I'd sliced my finger. A numb, dead feeling was spreading through my arm. Though it erased the sting, it reminded me of the gash, and I watched Carlisle's face carefully to distract me from what his hands were doing. His hair gleamed gold in the bright light as he bent over my arm. I could feel the faint stirrings of unease in the pit of my stomach, but I was determined not to let my usual squeamishness get the best of me. There was no pain now, just a gentle tugging sensation that I tried to ignore. No reason to get sick like a baby. If she hadn't been in my line of sight, I wouldn't have noticed Alice give up and steal out of the room. With a tiny, apologetic smile on her lips, she disappeared through the kitchen doorway. \"Well, that's everyone,\" I sighed. \"I can clear a room, at least.\" \"It's not your fault,\" Carlisle comforted me with a chuckle. \"It could happen to anyone.\" \"Could\" I repeated. \"But it usually just happens to me.\" He laughed again. His relaxed calm was only more amazing set in direct contrast with everyone else's reaction. I couldn't find any trace of anxiety in his face. He worked with quick, sure movements. The only sound besides our quiet breathing was the soft plink, plink as the tiny fragments of glass dropped one by one to the table. \"How can you do this?\" I demanded. \"Even Alice and Esme\u2026\" I trailed off, shaking my head in wonder. Though the rest of them had given up the traditional diet of vampires just as absolutely as Carlisle had, he was the only one who could bear the smell of my blood without suffering from the intense temptation. Clearly, this was much more difficult than he made it seem. \"Years and years of practice,\" he told me. \"I barely notice the scent anymore.\" \"Do you think it would be harder if you took a vacation from the hospital for a long time. And weren't around any blood?\" \"Maybe.\" He shrugged his shoulders, but his hands remained steady. \"I've never felt the need for an extended holiday.\" He flashed a brilliant smile in my direction. \"I enjoy my work too much.\" Plink, plink, plink. I was surprised at how much glass there seemed to be in my arm. I was tempted to glance at the growing pile, just to check the size, but I knew that idea would not be helpful to my no-vomiting strategy. \"What is it that you enjoy?\" I wondered. It didn't make sense to me\u2014the years of struggle and self-denial he must have spent to get to the point where he could endure this so easily. Besides, I wanted to keep him talking; the conversation kept my mind off the queasy feeling in my stomach. His dark eyes were calm and thoughtful as he answered. \"Hmm. What I enjoy the very most is when my\u2026 enhanced abilities let me save someone who would otherwise have been lost. It's pleasant knowing that, thanks to what I can do, some people's lives are better because I exist. Even the sense of smell is a useful diagnostic tool at times.\" One side of his mouth pulled up in half a smile. I mulled that over while he poked around, making sure all the glass splinters were gone. Then he rummaged in his bag for new tools, and I tried not to picture a needle and thread. \"You try very hard to make up for something that was never your fault,\" I suggested while a new kind of tugging started at the edges of my skin. \"What I mean is, it's not like you asked for this. You didn't choose this kind of life, and yet you have to work so hard to be good.\" \"I don't know that I'm making up for anything,\" he disagreed lightly. \"Like everything in life, I just had to decide what to do with what I was given.\" \"That makes it sound too easy.\" He examined my arm again. \"There,\" he said, snipping a thread. \"All done.\" He wiped an oversized Q-tip, dripping with some syrup-colored liquid, thoroughly across the operation site. The smell was strange; it made my head spin. The syrup stained my skin. \"In the beginning, though,\" I pressed while he taped another long piece of gauze securely in place, sealing it to my skin. \"Why did you even think to try a different way than the obvious one?\" His lips turned up in a private smile. \"Hasn't Edward told you this story?\" \"Yes. But I'm trying to understand what you were thinking\u2026\" His face was suddenly serious again, and I wondered if his thoughts had gone to the same place that mine had. Wondering what I would be thinking when\u2014I refused to think if\u2014it was me. n\u1ebfu \"You know my father was a clergyman,\" he mused as he cleaned the table carefully, rubbing everything down with wet gauze, and then doing it again. The smell of alcohol burned in my nose. \"He had a rather harsh view of the world, which I was already beginning to question before the time that I changed.\" Carlisle put all the dirty gauze and the glass slivers into an empty crystal bowl. I didn't understand what he was doing, even when he lit the match. Then he threw it onto the alcohol-soaked fibers, and the sudden blaze made me jump. \"Sorry,\" he apologized. \"That ought to do it\u2026 So I didn't agree with my father's particular brand of faith. But never, in the nearly four hundred years now since I was born, have I ever seen anything to make me doubt whether God exists in some form or the other. Not even the reflection in the mirror.\" I pretended to examine the dressing on my arm to hide my surprise at the direction our conversation had taken. Religion was the last thing I expected, all things considered. My own life was fairly devoid of belief. Charlie considered himself a Lutheran, because that's what his parents had been, but Sundays he worshipped by the river with a fishing pole in his hand. Renee tried out a church now and then, but, much like her brief affairs with tennis, pottery, yoga, and French classes, she moved on by the time I was aware of her newest fad.  \"I'm sure all this sounds a little bizarre, coming from a vampire.\" He grinned, knowing how their casual use of that word never failed to shock me. \"But I'm hoping that there is still a point to this life, even for us.\u00a0 It's a long shot, I'll admit,\" he continued in an offhand voice. \"By all accounts, we're damned regardless. But I hope, maybe foolishly, that we'll get some measure of credit for trying.\" \"I don't think that's foolish,\" I mumbled. I couldn't imagine anyone, deity included, who wouldn't be impressed by Carlisle. Besides, the only kind of heaven I could appreciate would have to include Edward. \"And I don't think anyone else would, either.\" \"Actually, you're the very first one to agree with me.\" \"The rest of them don't feel the same?\" I asked, surprised, thinking of only one person in particular. Carlisle guessed the direction of my thoughts again. \"Edward's with me up to a point. God and heaven exist\u2026 and so does hell. But he doesn't believe there is an afterlife for our kind.\" Carlisle's voice was very soft; he stared out the big window over the sink, into the darkness. \"You see, he thinks we've lost our souls.\" I immediately thought of Edward's words this afternoon: unless you want to die\u2014or whatever it is that we do. The light bulb flicked on over my head. \"That's the real problem, isn't it?\" I guessed. \"That's why he's being so difficult about me.\" \u00a0Carlisle spoke slowly. \"I look at my\u2026 son. His strength, his goodness, the brightness that shines out of him\u2014and it only fuels that hope, that faith, more than ever. How could there not be more for one such as Edward?\" I nodded in fervent agreement. \"But if I believed as he does\u2026\" He looked down at me with unfathomable eyes. \"If you believed as he did. Could you take away his soul?\" The way he phrased the question thwarted my answer. If he'd asked me whether I would risk my soul for Edward, the reply would be obvious. But would I risk Edward's soul? I pursed my lips unhappily. That wasn't a fair exchange. \"You see the problem.\" I shook my head, aware of the stubborn set of my chin. Carlisle sighed. \"It's my choice,\" I insisted. \"It's his, too.\" He held up his hand when he could see that I was about to argue. \"Whether he is responsible for doing that to you.\" \"He's not the only one able to do it.\" I eyed Carlisle speculatively. He laughed, abruptly lightening the mood. \"Oh, no! You're going to have to work this out with him.\" But then he sighed. \"That's the one part I can never be sure of. I think, in most other ways, that I've done the best I could with what I had to work with. But was it right to doom the others to this life? I can't decide.\" I didn't answer. I imagined what my life would be like if Carlisle had resisted the temptation to change his lonely existence\u2026 and shuddered. \"It was Edward's mother who made up my mind.\" Carlisle's voice was almost a whisper. He stared unseeingly out the black windows. \"His mother?\" Whenever I'd asked Edward about his parents, he would merely say that they had died long ago, and his memories were vague. I realized Carlisle's memory of them, despite the brevity of their contact, would be perfectly clear. \"Yes. Her name was Elizabeth. Elizabeth Masen. His father, Edward Senior, never regained consciousness in the hospital. He died in the first wave of the influenza. But Elizabeth was alert until almost the very end. Edward looks a great deal like her\u2014she had that same strange bronze shade to her hair, and her eyes were exactly the same color green.\" \"His eyes were green?\" I murmured, trying to picture it. \"Yes\u2026\" Carlisle's ocher eyes were a hundred years away now. \"Elizabeth worried obsessively over her son. She hurt her own chances of survival trying to nurse him from her sickbed. I expected that he would go first, he was so much worse off than she was. When the end came for her, it was very quick. It was just after sunset, and I'd arrived to relieve the doctors who'd been working all day. That was a hard time to pretend\u2014there was so much work to be done, and I had no need of rest. How I hated to go back to my house, to hide in the dark and pretend to sleep while so many were dying. \"I went to check Elizabeth and her son first. I'd grown attached\u2014always a dangerous thing to do considering the fragile nature of humans. I could see at once that she'd taken a bad turn. The fever was raging out of control, and her body was too weak to fight anymore. She didn't look weak, though, when she glared up at me from her cot. \"Save him!' she commanded me in the hoarse voice that was all her throat could manage. \"I'll do everything in my power,' I promised her, taking her hand. The fever was so high, she probably couldn't even tell how unnaturally cold mine felt. Everything felt cold to her skin. \"You must,\" she insisted, clutching at my hand with enough strength that I wondered if she wouldn't pull through the crisis after all. Her eyes were hard, like stones, like emeralds. 'You must do everything in your power. What others cannot do, that is what you must do for my Edward.\" \"It frightened me. She looked it me with those piercing eyes, and, for one instant, I felt certain that she knew my secret. Then the fever overwhelmed her, and she never regained consciousness. She died within an hour of making her demand. \"I'd spent decades considering the idea of creating a companion for myself. Just one other creature who could really know me, rather than what I pretended to be. But I could never justify it to myself\u2014doing what had been done to me. \"There Edward lay, dying. It was clear that he had only hours left. Beside him, his mother, her face somehow not yet peaceful, not even in death.\" Carlisle saw it all again, his memory unburned by the intervening century. I could see it clearly, too, as he spoke\u2014the despair of the hospital, the overwhelming atmosphere of death. Edward burning with fever, his life slipping away with each tick of the clock\u2026 I shuddered again, and forced the picture from my mind. \"Elizabeth's words echoed in my head. How could she guess what I could do? Could anyone really want that for her son? \"I looked at Edward. Sick as he was, he was still beautiful. There was something pure and good about his face. The kind of face I would have wanted my son to have. \"After all those years of indecision, I simply acted on a whim. I wheeled his mother to the morgue first, and then I came back for him. No one noticed that he was still breathing. There weren't enough hands, enough eyes, to keep track of half of what the patients needed. The morgue was empty\u2014of the living, at least. I stole him out the back door, and carried him across the rooftops back to my home. \"I wasn't sure what had to be done. I settled for recreating the wounds I'd received myself, so many centuries earlier in London. I felt bad about that later. It was more painful and lingering than necessary. \"I wasn't sorry, though. I've never been sorry that I saved Edward.\" He shook his head, coming back to the present. He smiled at me. \"I suppose I should take you home now.\" \"I'll do that,\" Edward said. He came through the shadowy dining room, walking slowly for him. His face was smooth, unreadable, but there was something wrong with his eyes\u2014something he was trying very hard to hide. I felt a spasm of unease in my stomach. \"Carlisle can take me,\" I said. I looked down at my shirt; the light blue cotton was soaked and spotted with my blood. My right shoulder was covered in thick pink frosting. \"I'm fine.\" Edward's voice was unemotional. \"You'll need to change anyway. You'd give Charlie a heart attack the way you look. I'll have Alice get you something.\" He strode out the kitchen door again. I looked at Carlisle anxiously. \"He's very upset.\" \"Yes,\" Carlisle agreed. \"Tonight is exactly the kind of thing that he fears the most. You being put in danger, because of what we are.\" \"It's not his fault.\" \"It's not yours, either.\" I looked away from his wise, beautiful eyes. I couldn't agree with that. Carlisle offered me his hand and helped me up from the table. I followed him out into the main room. Esme had come back; she was mopping the floor where I'd fallen\u2014with straight bleach from the smell of it. \"Esme, let me do that.\" I could feel that my face was bright red again. \"I'm already done.\" She smiled up at me. \"How do you feel?\" \"I'm fine,\" I assured her. \"Carlisle sews faster than any other doctor I've had.\" They both chuckled. Alice and Edward came in the back doors. Alice hurried to my side, but Edward hung back, his face indecipherable. \"C'mon,\" Alice said. \"I'll get you something less macabre to wear.\" She found me a shirt of Esme's that was close to the same color mine had been. Charlie wouldn't notice, I was sure. The long white bandage on my arm didn't look nearly as serious when I was no longer spattered in gore. Charlie was never surprised to see me bandaged. \"Alice,\" I whispered as she headed back to the door. \"Yes?\" She kept her voice low, too, and looked at me curiously, her head cocked to the side. \"How bad is it?\" I couldn't be sure if my whispering was a wasted effort. Even though we were upstairs, with the door closed, perhaps he could hear me. Her face tensed. \"I'm not sure yet.\" \"How's Jasper?\" She sighed. \"He's very unhappy with himself. It's all so much more of challenge for him, and he hates feeling weak.\" \"It's not his fault. You'll tell him that I'm not mad at him, not at all, won't you?\" \"Of course.\" Edward was waiting for me by the front door. As I got to the bottom of the staircase, he held it open without a word. \"Take your things!\" Alice cried as I walked warily toward Edward. She scooped up the two packages, one half-opened, and my camera from under the piano, and pressed them into my good arm. \"You can thank me later, when you've opened them.\" Esme and Carlisle both said a quiet goodnight. I could see them stealing quick glances at their <em>impassive</em> son, much like I was. It was a relief to be outside; I hurried past the lanterns and the roses, now unwelcome reminders.  Edward kept pace with me silently. He opened the passenger side for me, and I climbed in without complaint. On the dashboard was a big red ribbon, stuck to the new stereo. I pulled it off, throwing it to the floor. As Edward slid into the other side, I kicked the ribbon under my seat. He didn't look at me or the stereo. Neither of us switched it on, and the silence was somehow intensified by the sudden thunder of the engine. He drove too fast down the dark, serpentine lane. The silence was making me insane. \"Say something,\" I finally begged as he turned onto the freeway. \"What do you want me to say?\" he asked in a detached voice. I cringed at his remoteness. 'Tell me you forgive me.\" That brought a flicker of life to his face\u2014a flicker of anger. \"Forgive you? For what?\" \"If I'd been more careful, nothing would have happened.\" \"Bella, you gave yourself a paper cut\u2014that hardly deserves the death penalty.\" \"It's still my fault.\" My words opened up the floodgate. \"Your fault? If you'd cut yourself at Mike Newton's house, with Jessica there and Angela and your other normal friends, the worst that could possibly have happened would be what? Maybe they couldn't find you a bandage? If you'd tripped and knocked over a pile of glass plates on your own\u2014without someone throwing you into them\u2014even then, what's the worst? You'd get blood on the seats when they drove you to the emergency room? Mike Newton could have held your hand while they stitched you up\u2014and he wouldn't be righting the urge to kill you the whole time he was there. Don't try to take any of this on yourself, Bella. It will only make me more disgusted with myself.\" \"How the hell did Mike Newton end up in this conversation?\" I demanded. \"Mike Newton ended up in this conversation because Mike Newton would be a hell of a lot healthier for you to be with,\" he growled. \"I'd rather die than be with Mike Newton,\" I protested. \"I'd rather die than be with anyone but you.\" \"Don't be melodramatic, please.\" \"Well then, don't you be ridiculous.\" He didn't answer. He glared through the windshield, his expression black. I racked my brain for some way to salvage the evening. When we pulled up in front of my house, I still hadn't come up with anything. He killed the engine, but his hands stayed clenched around the steering wheel. \"Will you stay tonight?\" I asked. \"I should go home.\" The last thing I wanted was for him to go wallow in remorse. \"For my birthday,\" I pressed. \"You can't have it both ways\u2014either you want people to ignore your birthday or you don't. One or the other.\" His voice was stern, but not as serious as before. I breathed a silent sigh of relief. \"Okay. I've decided that I don't want you to ignore my birthday. I'll see you upstairs.\" I hopped out, reaching back in for my packages. He frowned. \"You don't have to take those.\" \"I want them,\" I responded automatically, and then wondered if he was using reverse psychology. \"No, you don't. Carlisle and Esme spent money on you.\" \"I'll live.\" I tucked the presents awkwardly under my good arm and slammed the door behind me. He was out of the truck and by my side in less than a second. \"Let me carry them, at least.\" he said as he took them away. \"I'll be in your room.\" I smiled. \"Thanks.\" \"Happy birthday,\" he sighed, and leaned down to touch his lips to mine. I reached up on my toes to make the kiss last longer when he pulled away. He smiled my favorite crooked smile, and then he disappeared into the darkness. The game was still on; as soon as I walked through the front door I could hear the announcer rambling over the babble of the crowd. \"Bell?\" Charlie called. \"Hey, Dad,\" I said as I came around the corner. I held my arm close to my side. The slight pressure burned, and I wrinkled my nose. The anesthetic was apparently losing its effectiveness. \"How was it?\" Charlie lounged across the sofa with his bare feet propped up on the arm.  What was left of his curly brown hair was crushed flat on one side. \"Alice went overboard. Flowers, cake, candles, presents\u2014the whole bit.\" \"What did they get you?\" \"A stereo for my truck.\" And various unknowns. \"Wow.\" \"Yeah,\" I agreed. \"Well, I'm calling it a night.\" \"I'll see you in the morning.\" I waved. \"See ya.\" \"What happened to your arm?\" I flushed and cursed silently. \"I tripped. It's nothing.\" \"Bella,\" he sighed, shaking his head. \"Goodnight, Dad.\" I hurried up to the bathroom, where I kept my pajamas for just such nights as these. I shrugged into the matching tank top and cotton pants that I'd gotten to replace the holey sweats I used to wear to bed, wincing as the movement pulled at the stitches. I washed my face one-handed, brushed my teeth, and then skipped to my room. He was sitting in the center of my bed, toying idly with one of the silver boxes. \"Hi,\" he said. His voice was sad. He was wallowing. I went to the bed, pushed the presents out of his hands, and climbed into his lap. \"Hi.\" I snuggled into his stone chest. \"Can I open my presents now?\" \"Where did the enthusiasm come from?\" he wondered. \"You made me curious.\" I picked up the long flat rectangle that must have been from Carlisle and Esme. \"Allow me,\" he suggested. He took the gift from my hand and tore the silver paper off with one fluid movement. He handed the rectangular white box back to me. \"Are you sure I can handle lifting the lid?\" I muttered, but he ignored me. Inside the box was a long thick piece of paper with an overwhelming amount of fine print. It took me a minute to get the gist of the information. \"We're going to Jacksonville?\" And I was excited, in spite of myself. It was a voucher for plane tickets, for both me and Edward. \"That's the idea.\" \"I can't believe it. Renee is going to flip! You don't mind, though, do you? It's sunny, you'll have to stay inside all day.\" \"I think I can handle it,\" he said, and then frowned. \"If I'd had any idea that you could respond to a gift this appropriately, I would have made you open it in front of Carlisle and Esme. I thought you'd complain.\" \"Well, of course it's too much. But I get to take you with me!\" He chuckled. \"Now I wish I'd spent money on your present. I didn't realize that you were capable of being reasonable.\" I set the tickets aside and reached for his present, my curiosity rekindled. He took it from me and unwrapped it like the first one. He handed back a clear CD jewel case, with a blank silver CD inside. \"What is it?\" I asked, perplexed. He didn't say anything; he took the CD and reached around me to put it in the CD player on the bedside table. He hit play, and we waited in silence. Then the music began. I listened, speechless and wide-eyed. I knew he was waiting for my reaction, but I couldn't talk. Tears welled up, and I reached up to wipe them away before they could spill over. \"Does your arm hurt?\" he asked anxiously. \"No, it's not my arm. It's beautiful, Edward. You couldn't have given me anything I would love more. I can't believe it.\" I shut up, so I could listen. It was his music, his compositions. The first piece on the CD was my lullaby. \"I didn't think you would let me get a piano so I could play for you here,\" he explained. \"You're right.\" \"How does your arm feel?\" \"Just fine.\" Actually, it was starting to blaze under the bandage. I wanted ice. I would have settled for his hand, but that would have given me away. \"I'll get you some Tylenol.\" \"I don't need anything,\" I protested, but he slid me off his lap and headed for the door. \"Charlie,\" I hissed. Charlie wasn't exactly aware that Edward frequently stayed over. In fact, he would have a stroke if that fact were brought to his attention. But I didn't feel too guilty for deceiving him.\u00a0\u00a0  It wasn't as if we were up to anything he wouldn't want me to be up to. Edward and his rules\u2026 \"He won't catch me,\" Edward promised as he disappeared silently out the door . . and returned, catching the door before it had swung back to touch the frame. He had the glass from the bathroom and the bottle of pills in one hand. I took the pills he handed me without arguing\u2014I knew I would lose the argument And my arm really was starting to bother me. My lullaby continued, soft and lovely, in the background. \"It's late,\" Edward noted. He scooped me up off the bed with one arm, and pulled the cover back with the other. He put me down with my head on my pillow and tucked the quilt around me. He lay down next to me\u2014on top of the blanket so I wouldn't get chilled\u2014and put his arm over me. I leaned my head against his shoulder and sighed happily. \"Thanks again,\" I whispered. \"You're welcome.\" It was quiet for a long moment as I listened to my lullaby drift to a close. Another song began. I recognized Esme's favorite. \"What are you thinking about?'\" I wondered in a whisper. He hesitated for a second before he told me. \"I was thinking about right and wrong, actually.\" I felt a chill tingle along my spine. \"Remember how I decided that I wanted you to not ignore my birthday?\" I asked quickly, hoping it wasn't too clear that I was trying to distract him. \"Yes,\" he agreed, wary. \"Well, I was thinking, since it's still my birthday, that I'd like you to kiss me again.\" \"You're greedy tonight.\" \"Yes, I am\u2014but please, don't do anything you don't want to do,\" I added, piqued. He laughed, and then sighed. \"Heaven forbid that I should do anything I don't want to do,\" he said in a strangely desperate tone as he put his hand under my chin and pulled my face up to his. The kiss began much the same as usual\u2014Edward was as careful as ever, and my heart began to overreact like it always did. And then something seemed to change. Suddenly his lips became much more urgent, his free hand twisted into my hair and held my face securely to his. And, though my hands tangled in his hair, too, and though I was clearly beginning to cross his cautious lines, for once he didn't stop me. His body was cold through the thin quilt, but I crushed myself against him eagerly. When he stopped it was abrupt; he pushed me away with gentle, firm hands. I collapsed back onto my pillow, gasping, my head spinning. Something tugged at my memory, elusive, on the edges. \"Sorry,\" he said, and he was breathless, too. \"That was out of line.\" \"I don't mind,\" I panted. He frowned at me in the darkness. \"Try to sleep. Bella.\" \"No, I want you to kiss me again.\" \"You're overestimating my self-control.\" \"Which is tempting you more, my blood or my body?\" I challenged. \"It's a tie.\" He grinned briefly in spite of himself, and then was serious again. \"Now. why don't you stop pushing your luck and go to sleep?\" \"Fine,\" I agreed, snuggling closer to him. I really did feel exhausted. It had been a long day in so many ways, yet I felt no sense of relief at its end. Almost as if something worse was coming tomorrow. It was a silly premonition\u2014what could be worse than today?' Just the shock catching up with me, no doubt. Trying to be sneaky about it, I pressed my injured arm against his shoulder, so his cool skin would sooth the burning. It felt better at once. I was halfway asleep, maybe more, when I realized what his kiss had reminded me of: last spring, when he'd had to leave me to throw James off my trail, Edward had kissed me goodbye, not knowing when\u2014or if\u2014we would see each other again. This kiss had the same almost painful edge for some reason I couldn't imagine. I shuddered into unconsciousness, as if I were already having a nightmare.",
