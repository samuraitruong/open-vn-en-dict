Instead, he sat quite close beside me, our arms almost touching. Mr. Banner backed into the room then \u2014 what superb timing the man had \u2014 pulling a tall metal frame on wheels that held a heavy-looking, outdated TV and VCR. A movie day \u2014 the lift in the class atmosphere was almost tangible. Mr. Banner shoved the tape into the reluctant VCR and walked to the wall to turn off the lights. And then, as the room went black, I was suddenly hyperaware that Edward was sitting less than an inch from me. I was stunned by the unexpected electricity that flowed through me, amazed that it was possible to be more aware of him than I already was. A crazy impulse to reach over and touch him, to stroke his perfect face just once in the darkness, nearly overwhelmed me. I crossed my arms tightly across my chest, my hands <em>balling</em> into fists. I was losing my mind. The opening credits began, lighting the room by a token amount. My eyes, of their own accord, flickered to him. I smiled sheepishly as I realized his posture was identical to mine, fists clenched under his arms, right down to the eyes, peering sideways at me. He grinned back, his eyes somehow managing to smolder, even in the dark. I looked away before I could start hyperventilating. It was absolutely ridiculous that I should feel dizzy. The hour seemed very long. I couldn't concentrate on the movie \u2014 I didn't even know what subject it was on. I tried unsuccessfully to relax, but the electric current that seemed to be originating from somewhere in his body never slackened. Occasionally I would permit myself a quick glance in his direction, but he never seemed to relax, either. The overpowering craving to touch him also refused to fade, and I crushed my fists safely against my ribs until my fingers were aching with the effort. I breathed a sigh of relief when Mr. Banner flicked the lights back on at the end of class, and stretched my arms out in front of me, flexing my stiff fingers. Edward \u00a0chuckled beside me. \"Well, that was interesting,\" he murmured. His voice was dark and his eyes were cautious. \"Umm,\" was all I was able to respond. \"Shall we?\" he asked, rising fluidly. I almost groaned. Time for Gym. I stood with care, worried my balance might have been affected by the strange new intensity between us. He walked me to my next class in silence and paused at the door; I turned to say goodbye. His face startled me \u2014 his expression was torn, almost pained, and so fiercely beautiful that the ache to touch him flared as strong as before. My goodbye stuck in my throat. He raised his hand, hesitant, conflict raging in his eyes, and then swiftly brushed the length of my cheekbone with his fingertips. His skin was as icy as ever, but the trail his fingers left on my skin was alarmingly warm \u2014 like I'd been burned, but didn't feel the pain of it yet. He turned without a word and strode quickly away from me. I walked into the gym, lightheaded and wobbly. I drifted to the locker room, changing in a trance like state, only vaguely aware that there were other people surrounding me. Reality didn't fully set in until I was handed a racket. It wasn't heavy, yet it felt very unsafe in my hand. I could see a few of the other kids in class eyeing me furtively. Coach Clapp ordered us to pair up into teams. Mercifully, some vestiges of Mike's chivalry still survived; he came to stand beside me. \"Do you want to be a team?\" \"Thanks, Mike \u2014 you don't have to do this, you know.\" I grimaced apologetically. \"Don't worry, I'll keep out of your way.\" He grinned. Sometimes it was so easy to like Mike. It didn't go smoothly. I somehow managed to hit myself in the head with my racket and clip Mike's shoulder on the same swing. I spent the rest of the hour in the back corner of the court, the racket held safely behind my back. Despite being handicapped by me, Mike was pretty good; he won three games out of four single handedly. He gave me an unearned high five when the coach finally blew the whistle ending class. \"So,\" he said as we walked off the court. \"So what?\" \"You and Cullen, huh?\" he asked, his tone rebellious. My previous feeling of affection disappeared. \"That's none of your business, Mike,\" I warned, internally cursing Jessica straight to the fiery pits of Hades. \"I don't like it,\" he muttered anyway. \"You don't have to,\" I snapped. \"He looks at you like\u2026 like you're something to eat,\" he continued, ignoring me. I choked back the hysteria that threatened to explode, but a small giggle managed to get out despite my efforts. He glowered at me. I waved and fled to the locker room. I dressed quickly, something stronger than butterflies battering recklessly against the walls of my stomach, my argument with Mike already a distant memory. I was wondering if Edward would be waiting, or if I should meet him at his car. What if his family was there? I felt a wave of real terror. Did they know that I knew? Was I supposed to know that they knew that I knew, or not? By the time I walked out of the gym, I had just about decided to walk straight home without even looking toward the parking lot. But my worries were unnecessary. Edward was waiting, leaning casually against the side of the gym, his breathtaking face untroubled now. As I walked to his side, I felt a peculiar sense of release. \"Hi,\" I breathed, smiling hugely. \"Hello.\" His answering smile was brilliant. \"How was Gym?\" My face fell a tiny bit. \"Fine,\" I lied. \"Really?\" He was unconvinced. His eyes shifted their focus slightly, looking over my shoulder and narrowing. I glanced behind me to see Mike's back as he walked away. \"What?\" I demanded. His eyes slid back to mine, still tight. \"Newton's getting on my nerves.\" \"You weren't listening again?\" I was horror-struck. All traces of my sudden good humor vanished. \"How's your head?\" he asked innocently. \"You're unbelievable!\" I turned, stomping away in the general direction of the parking lot, though I hadn't ruled out walking at this point. He kept up with me easily. \"You were the one who mentioned how I'd never seen you in Gym \u2014 it made me curious.\" He didn't sound repentant, so I ignored him. We walked in silence \u2014 a furious, embarrassed silence on my part \u2014 to his car. But I had to stop a few steps away \u2014 a crowd of people, all boys, were surrounding it. Then I realized they weren't surrounding the Volvo, they were actually circled around Rosalie's red convertible, unmistakable lust in their eyes. None of them even looked up as Edward slid between them to open his door. I climbed quickly in the passenger side, also unnoticed. \"Ostentatious,\" he muttered. \"What kind of car is that?\" I asked. \"An M3.\" \"I don't speak Car and Driver.\" \"It's a BMW.\" He rolled his eyes, not looking at me, trying to back out without running over the car enthusiasts. I nodded \u2014 I'd heard of that one. \"Are you still angry?\" he asked as he carefully maneuvered his way out. \"Definitely.\" He sighed. \"Will you forgive me if I apologize?\" \"Maybe\u2026 if you mean it. And if you promise not to do it again,\" I insisted. His eyes were suddenly shrewd. \"How about if I mean it, and I agree to let you drive Saturday?\" he countered my conditions. I considered, and decided it was probably the best offer I would get. \"Deal,\" I agreed. \"Then I'm very sorry I upset you.\" His eyes burned with sincerity for a protracted moment \u2014 playing havoc with the rhythm of my heart \u2014 and then turned playful. \"And I'll be on your doorstep bright and early Saturday morning.\" \"Um, it doesn't help with the Charlie situation if an unexplained Volvo is left in the driveway.\" His smile was condescending now. \"I wasn't intending to bring a car.\" \"How \u2014\" He cut me off. \"Don't worry about it. I'll be there, no car.\" I let it go. I had a more pressing question. \"Is it later yet?\" I asked significantly. He frowned. \"I supposed it is later.\" I kept my expression polite as I waited. He stopped the car. I looked up, surprised \u2014 of course we were already at Charlie's house, parked behind the truck. It was easier to ride with him if I only looked when it was over. When I looked back at him, he was staring at me, measuring with his eyes.  \"And you still want to know why you can't see me hunt?\" He seemed solemn, but I thought I saw a trace of humor deep in his eyes. \"Well,\" I clarified, \"I was mostly wondering about your reaction.\" \"Did I frighten you?\" Yes, there was definitely humor there. \"No,\" I lied. He didn't buy it. \"I apologize for scaring you,\" he persisted with a slight smile, but then all evidence of teasing disappeared. \"It was just the very thought of you being there\u2026 while we hunted.\" His jaw tightened. \"That would be bad?\" He spoke from between clenched teeth. \"Extremely.\" \"Because\u2026 ?\" He took a deep breath and stared through the windshield at the thick, rolling clouds that seemed to press down, almost within reach. \"When we hunt,\" he spoke slowly, unwillingly, \"we give ourselves over to our senses\u2026 govern less with our minds. Especially our sense of smell. If you were anywhere near me when I lost control that way\u2026\" He shook his head, still gazing morosely at the heavy clouds. I kept my expression firmly under control, expecting the swift flash of his eyes to judge my reaction that soon followed. My face gave nothing away. But our eyes held, and the silence deepened \u2014 and changed. Flickers of the electricity I'd felt this afternoon began to charge the atmosphere as he gazed unrelentingly into my eyes. It wasn't until my head started to swim that I realized I wasn't breathing. When I drew in a jagged breath, breaking the stillness, he closed his eyes. \"Bella, I think you should go inside now.\" His low voice was rough, his eyes on the clouds again. I opened the door, and the arctic draft that burst into the car helped clear my head. Afraid I might stumble in my woozy state, I stepped carefully out of the car and shut the door behind me without looking back. The whir of the automatic window unrolling made me turn. \"Oh, Bella?\" he called after me, his voice more even. He leaned toward the open window with a faint smile on his lips. \"Yes?\" \"Tomorrow it's my turn.\" \"Your turn to what?\" He smiled wider, flashing his gleaming teeth. \"Ask the questions.\" And then he was gone, the car speeding down the street and disappearing around the corner before I could even collect my thoughts. I smiled as I walked to the house. It was clear he was planning to see me tomorrow, if nothing else. That night Edward starred in my dreams, as usual. However, the climate of my unconsciousness had changed. It thrilled with the same electricity that had charged the afternoon, and I tossed and turned restlessly, waking often. It was only in the early hours of the morning that I finally sank into an exhausted, dreamless sleep. When I woke I was still tired, but edgy as well. I pulled on my brown turtleneck and the inescapable jeans, sighing as I daydreamed of spaghetti straps and shorts. Breakfast was the usual, quiet event I expected. Charlie fried eggs for himself; I had my bowl of cereal. I wondered if he had forgotten about this Saturday. He answered my unspoken question as he stood up to take his plate to the sink. \"About this Saturday\u2026\" he began, walking across the kitchen and turning on the faucet. I cringed. \"Yes, Dad?\" \"Are you still set on going to Seattle?\" he asked. \"That was the plan.\" I grimaced, wishing he hadn't brought it up so I wouldn't have to compose careful half-truths. He squeezed some dish soap onto his plate and swirled it around with the brush. \"And you're sure you can't make it back in time for the dance?\" \"I'm not going to the dance, Dad.\" I glared. \"Didn't anyone ask you?\" he asked, trying to hide his concern by focusing on rinsing the plate. I sidestepped the minefield. \"It's a girl's choice.\" \"Oh.\" He frowned as he dried his plate. I sympathized with him. It must be a hard thing, to be a father; living in fear that your daughter would meet a boy she liked, but also having to worry if she didn't. How ghastly it would be, I thought, shuddering, if Charlie had even the slightest inkling of exactly what I did like. Charlie left then, with a goodbye wave, and I went upstairs to brush my teeth and gather my books. When I heard the cruiser pull away, I could only wait a few seconds before I had to peek out of my window. The silver car was already there, waiting in Charlie's spot on the driveway. I bounded down the stairs and out the front door, wondering how long this bizarre routine would continue. I never wanted it to end.  He waited in the car, not appearing to watch as I shut the door behind me without bothering to lock the dead-bolt. I walked to the car, pausing shyly before opening the door and stepping in. He was smiling, relaxed \u2014 and, as usual, perfect and beautiful to an excruciating degree. \"Good morning.\" His voice was silky. \"How are you today?\" His eyes roamed over my face, as if his question was something more than simple courtesy. \"Good, thank you.\" I was always good \u2014 much more than good \u2014 when I was near him. His gaze lingered on the circles under my eyes. \"You look tired.\" \"I couldn't sleep,\" I confessed, automatically swinging my hair around my shoulder to provide some measure of cover. \"Neither could I,\" he teased as he started the engine. I was becoming used to the quiet purr. I was sure the roar of my truck would scare me, whenever I got to drive it again. I laughed. \"I guess that's right. I suppose I slept just a little bit more than you did.\" \"I'd wager you did.\" \"So what did you do last night?\" I asked. He chuckled. \"Not a chance. It's my day to ask questions.\" \"Oh, that's right. What do you want to know?\" My forehead creased. I couldn't imagine anything about me that could be in any way interesting to him. \"What's your favorite color?\" he asked, his face grave. I rolled my eyes. \"It changes from day to day.\" \"What's your favorite color today?\" He was still solemn. \"Probably brown.\" I tended to dress according to my mood. He snorted, dropping his serious expression. \"Brown?\" he asked skeptically. \"Sure. Brown is warm. I miss brown. Everything that's supposed to be brown \u2014 tree trunks, rocks, dirt \u2014 is all covered up with squashy green stuff here,\" I complained. He seemed fascinated by my little rant. He considered for a moment, staring into my eyes. \"You're right,\" he decided, serious again. \"Brown is warm.\" He reached over, swiftly, but somehow still hesitantly, to sweep my hair back behind my shoulder. We were at the school by now. He turned back to me as he pulled into a parking space. \"What music is in your CD player right now?\" he asked, his face as somber as if he'd asked for a murder confession. I realized I'd never removed the CD Phil had given me. When I said the name of the band, he smiled crookedly, a peculiar expression in his eyes. He flipped open a compartment under his car's CD player, pulled out one of thirty or so CDs that were jammed into the small space, and handed it to me, \"Debussy to this?\" He raised an eyebrow. It was the same CD. I examined the familiar cover art, keeping my eyes down. It continued like that for the rest of the day. While he walked me to English, when he met me after Spanish, all through the lunch hour, he questioned me relentlessly about every insignificant detail of my existence. Movies I'd liked and hated, the few places I'd been and the many places I wanted to go, and books \u2014 endlessly books. I couldn't remember the last time I'd talked so much. More often than not, I felt self-conscious, certain I must be boring him. But the absolute absorption of his face, and his never-ending stream of questions, compelled me to continue. Mostly his questions were easy, only a very few triggering my easy blushes. But when I did flush, it brought on a whole new round of questions. Such as the time he asked my favorite gemstone, and I blurted out topaz before thinking. He'd been flinging questions at me with such speed that I felt like I was taking one of those psychiatric tests where you answer with the first word that comes to mind. I was sure he would have continued down whatever mental list he was following, except for the blush. My face reddened because, until very recently, my favorite gemstone was garnet. It was impossible, while staring back into his topaz eyes, not to remember the reason for the switch. And, naturally, he wouldn't rest until I'd admitted why I was embarrassed. \"Tell me,\" he finally commanded after persuasion failed \u2014 failed only because I kept my eyes safely away from his face. \"It's the color of your eyes today,\" I sighed, surrendering, staring down at my hands as I fiddled with a piece of my hair. \"I suppose if you asked me in two weeks I'd say onyx.\" I'd given more information than necessary in my unwilling honesty, and I worried it would provoke the strange anger that flared whenever I slipped and revealed too clearly how obsessed I was. But his pause was very short. \"What kinds of flowers do you prefer?\" he fired off. I sighed in relief, and continued with the psychoanalysis. Biology was a complication again. Edward had continued with his quizzing up until Mr. Banner entered the room, dragging the audiovisual frame again. As the teacher approached the light switch, I noticed Edward slide his chair slightly farther away from mine. It didn't help. As soon as the room was dark, there was the same electric spark, the same restless craving to stretch my hand across the short space and touch his cold skin, as yesterday. I leaned forward on the table, resting my chin on my folded arms, my hidden fingers gripping the table's edge as I fought to ignore the irrational longing that unsettled me. I didn't look at him, afraid that if he was looking at me, it would only make self-control that much harder. I sincerely tried to watch the movie, but at the end of the hour I had no idea what I'd just seen. I sighed in relief again when Mr. Banner turned the lights on, finally glancing at Edward; he was looking at me, his eyes ambivalent. He rose in silence and then stood still, waiting for me. We walked toward the gym in silence, like yesterday. And, also like yesterday, he touched my face wordlessly \u2014 this time with the back of his cool hand, stroking once from my temple to my jaw \u2014 before he turned and walked away. Gym passed quickly as I watched Mike's one-man badminton show. He didn't speak to me today, either in response to my vacant expression or because he was still angry about our squabble yesterday. Somewhere, in a corner of my mind, I felt bad about that. But I couldn't concentrate on him. I hurried to change afterward, ill at ease, knowing the faster I moved, the sooner I would be with Edward. The pressure made me more clumsy than usual, but eventually I made it out the door, feeling the same release when I saw him standing there, a wide smile automatically spreading across my face. He smiled in reaction before launching into more cross-examination. His questions were different now, though, not as easily answered. He wanted to know what I missed about home, insisting on descriptions of anything he wasn't familiar with. We sat in front of Charlie's house for hours, as the sky darkened and rain plummeted around us in a sudden deluge. I tried to describe impossible things like the scent of creosote \u2014 bitter, slightly resinous, but still pleasant \u2014 the high, keening sound of the cicadas in July, the feathery barrenness of the trees, the very size of the sky, extending white-blue from horizon to horizon, barely interrupted by the low mountains covered with purple volcanic rock. The hardest thing to explain was why it was so beautiful to me \u2014 to justify a beauty that didn't depend on the sparse, spiny vegetation that often looked half dead, a beauty that had more to do with the exposed shape of the land, with the shallow bowls of valleys between the craggy hills, and the way they held on to the sun. I found myself using my hands as I tried to describe it to him. His quiet, probing questions kept me talking freely, forgetting, in the dim light of the storm, to be embarrassed for monopolizing the conversation. Finally, when I had finished detailing my cluttered room at home, he paused instead of responding with another question.  \"Are you finished?\" I asked in relief. \"Not even close \u2014 but your father will be home soon.\" \"Charlie!\" I suddenly recalled his existence, and sighed. I looked out at the rain-darkened sky, but it gave nothing away. \"How late is it?\" I wondered out loud as I glanced at the clock. I was surprised by the time \u2014 Charlie would be driving home now. \"It's twilight,\" Edward murmured, looking at the western horizon, obscured as it was with clouds. His voice was thoughtful, as if his mind were somewhere far away. I stared at him as he gazed unseeingly out the windshield. I was still staring when his eyes suddenly shifted back to mine. \"It's the safest time of day for us,\" he said, answering the unspoken question in my eyes. \"The easiest time. But also the saddest, in a way\u2026 the end of another day, the return of the night. Darkness is so predictable, don't you think?\" He smiled wistfully. \"I like the night. Without the dark, we'd never see the stars.\" I frowned. \"Not that you see them here much.\" He laughed, and the mood abruptly lightened. \"Charlie will be here in a few minutes. So, unless you want to tell him that you'll be with me Saturday\u2026\" He raised one eyebrow. \"Thanks, but no thanks.\" I gathered my books, realizing I was stiff from sitting still so long. \"So is it my turn tomorrow, then?\" \"Certainly not!\" His face was teasingly outraged. \"I told you I wasn't done, didn't I?\" \"What more is there?\" \"You'll find out tomorrow.\" He reached across to open my door for me, and his sudden proximity sent my heart into frenzied palpitations. But his hand froze on the handle. \"Not good,\" he muttered. \"What is it?\" I was surprised to see that his jaw was clenched, his eyes disturbed. He glanced at me for a brief second. \"Another complication,\" he said glumly. He flung the door open in one swift movement, and then moved, almost cringed, swiftly away from me. The flash of headlights through the rain caught my attention as a dark car pulled up to the curb just a few feet away, facing us. \"Charlie's around the corner,\" he warned, staring through the downpour at the other vehicle. I hopped out at once, despite my confusion and curiosity. The rain was louder as it glanced off my jacket. I tried to make out the shapes in the front seat of the other car, but it was too dark. I could see Edward illuminated in the glare of the new car's headlights; he was still staring ahead, his gaze locked on something or someone I couldn't see. His expression was a strange mix of frustration and defiance. Then he revved the engine, and the tires squealed against the wet pavement. The Volvo was out of sight in seconds. \"Hey, Bella,\" called a familiar, husky voice from the driver's side of the little black car. \"Jacob?\" I asked, squinting through the rain. Just then, Charlie's cruiser swung around the corner, his lights shining on the occupants of the car in front of me. Jacob was already climbing out, his wide grin visible even through the darkness. In the passenger seat was a much older man, a heavyset man with a memorable face \u2014 a face that overflowed, the cheeks resting against his shoulders, with creases running through the russet skin like an old leather jacket. And the surprisingly familiar eyes, black eyes that seemed at the same time both too young and too ancient for the broad face they were set in. Jacob's father, Billy Black. I knew him immediately, though in the more than five years since I'd seen him last I'd managed to forget his name when Charlie had spoken of him my first day here. He was staring at me, scrutinizing my face, so I smiled tentatively at him. His eyes were wide, as if in shock or fear, his nostrils flared. My smile faded. Another complication, Edward had said. Billy still stared at me with intense, anxious eyes. I groaned internally. Had Billy recognized Edward so easily? Could he really believe the impossible legends his son had scoffed at? The answer was clear in Billy's eyes. Yes. Yes, he could.",

            "en": "14         714. MIND OVER MATTER He could drive well, when he kept the speed reasonable, I had to admit.  Like so many things, it seemed to be effortless to him. He barely looked at the road, yet the tires never deviated so much as a centimeter from the center of the lane. He drove one-handed, holding my hand on the seat. Sometimes he gazed into the setting sun, sometimes he glanced at me \u2014 my face, my hair blowing out the open window, our hands twined together. He had turned the radio to an oldies station, and he sang along with a song I'd never heard. He knew every line. \"You like fifties music?\" I asked.  \"Music in the fifties was good. Much better than the sixties, or the seventies, ugh!\" He shuddered. \"The eighties were bearable.\" \"Are you ever going to tell me how old you are?\" I asked, tentative, not wanting to upset his buoyant humor. \"Does it matter much?\" His smile, to my relief, remained unclouded. \"No, but I still wonder\u2026\" I grimaced. \"There's nothing like an unsolved mystery to keep you up at night.\" \"I wonder if it will upset you,\" he reflected to himself. He gazed into the sun; the minutes passed. \"Try me,\" I finally said. He sighed, and then looked into my eyes, seeming to forget the road completely for a time. Whatever he saw there must have encouraged him. He looked into the sun \u2014 the light of the setting orb glittered off his skin in ruby-tinged sparkles \u2014 and spoke.  \"I was born in Chicago in 1901.\" He paused and glanced at me from the corner of his eyes. My face was carefully unsurprised, patient for the rest. He smiled a tiny smile and continued. \"Carlisle found me in a hospital in the summer of 1918. I was seventeen, and dying of the Spanish influenza.\" He heard my intake of breath, though it was barely audible to my own ears. He looked down into my eyes again. \"I don't remember it well \u2014 it was a very long time ago, and human memories fade.\" He was lost in his thoughts for a short time before he went on. \"I do remember how it felt, when Carlisle saved me. It's not an easy thing, not something you could forget.\" \"Your parents?\" \"They had already died from the disease. I was alone. That was why he chose me. In all the chaos of the epidemic, no one would ever realize I was gone.\" \"How did he\u2026 save you?\" A few seconds passed before he answered. He seemed to choose his words carefully. \"It was difficult. Not many of us have the restraint necessary to accomplish it. But Carlisle has always been the most humane, the most compassionate of us\u2026 I don't think you could find his equal throughout all of history.\" He paused. \"For me, it was merely very, very painful.\" I could tell from the set of his lips, he would say no more on this subject. I suppressed my curiosity, though it was far from idle. There were many things I needed to think through on this particular issue, things that were only beginning to occur to me. No doubt his quick mind had already comprehended every aspect that eluded me.  His soft voice interrupted my thoughts. \"He acted from loneliness. That's usually the reason behind the choice. I was the first in Carlisle's family, though he found Esme soon after. She fell from a cliff. They brought her straight to the hospital morgue, though, somehow, her heart was still beating.\" \"So you must be dying, then, to become\u2026\" We never said the word, and I couldn't frame it now. \"No, that's just Carlisle. He would never do that to someone who had another choice.\" The respect in his voice was profound whenever he spoke of his father figure. \"It is easier he says, though,\" he continued, \"if the blood is weak.\" He looked at the now-dark road, and I could feel the subject closing again. \"And Emmett and Rosalie?\" \"Carlisle brought Rosalie to our family next. I didn't realize till much later that he was hoping she would be to me what Esme was to him \u2014 he was careful with his thoughts around me.\" He rolled his eyes. \"But she was never more than a sister. It was only two years later that she found Emmett. She was hunting \u2014 we were in Appalachia at the time \u2014 and found a bear about to finish him off. She carried him back to Carlisle, more than a hundred miles, afraid she wouldn't be able to do it herself. I'm only beginning to guess how difficult that journey was for her.\" He threw a pointed glance in my direction, and raised our hands, still folded together, to brush my cheek with the back of his hand. \"But she made it,\" I encouraged, looking away from the unbearable beauty of his eyes. \"Yes,\" he murmured. \"She saw something in his face that made her strong enough. And they've been together ever since. Sometimes they live separately from us, as a married couple. But the younger we pretend to be, the longer we can stay in any given place. Forks seemed perfect, so we all enrolled in high school.\" He laughed. \"I suppose we'll have to go to their wedding in a few years, again.\" \"Alice and Jasper?\" \"Alice and Jasper are two very rare creatures. They both developed a conscience, as we refer to it, with no outside guidance. Jasper belonged to another\u2026 family, a very different kind of family. He became depressed, and he wandered on his own. Alice found him. Like me, she has certain gifts above and beyond the norm for our kind.\" \"Really?\" I interrupted, fascinated. \"But you said you were the only one who could hear people's thoughts.\" \"That's true. She knows other things. She sees things \u2014 things that might happen, things that are coming. But it's very subjective. The future isn't set in stone. Things change.\" His jaw set when he said that, and his eyes darted to my face and away so quickly that I wasn't sure if I only imagined it. \"What kinds of things does she see?\" \"She saw Jasper and knew that he was looking for her before he knew it himself. She saw Carlisle and our family, and they came together to find us. She's most sensitive to non-humans. She always sees, for example, when another group of our kind is coming near. And any threat they may pose.\" \"Are there a lot of\u2026 your kind?\" I was surprised. How many of them could walk among us undetected? \"No, not many. But most won't settle in any one place. Only those like us, who've given up hunting you people\" \u2014 a sly glance in my direction \u2014 \"can live together with humans for any length of time. We've only found one other family like ours, in a small village in Alaska. We lived together for a time, but there were so many of us that we became too noticeable. Those of us who live\u2026 differently tend to band together.\"  \"And the others?\" \"Nomads, for the most part. We've all lived that way at times. It gets tedious, like anything else. But we run across the others now and then, because most of us prefer the North.\" \"Why is that?\" We were parked in front of my house now, and he'd turned off the truck.  It was very quiet and dark; there was no moon. The porch light was off so I knew my father wasn't home yet.  \"Did you have your eyes open this afternoon?\" he teased. \"Do you think I could walk down the street in the sunlight without causing traffic accidents? There's a reason why we chose the Olympic Peninsula, one of the most sunless places in the world. It's nice to be able to go outside in the day. You wouldn't believe how tired you can get of nighttime in eighty-odd years.\" \"So that's where the legends came from?\" \"Probably.\" \"And Alice came from another family, like Jasper?\" \"No, and that is a mystery. Alice doesn't remember her human life at all.  And she doesn't know who created her. She awoke alone. Whoever made her walked away, and none of us understand why, or how, he could. If she hadn't had that other sense, if she hadn't seen Jasper and Carlisle and known that she would someday become one of us, she probably would have turned into a total savage.\" There was so much to think through, so much I still wanted to ask. But, to my great embarrassment, my stomach growled. I'd been so intrigued, I hadn't even noticed I was hungry. I realized now that I was ravenous.  \"I'm sorry, I'm keeping you from dinner.\" \"I'm fine, really.\" \"I've never spent much time around anyone who eats food. I forget.\" \"I want to stay with you.\" It was easier to say in the darkness, knowing as I spoke how my voice would betray me, my hopeless addiction to him.  \"Can't I come in?\" he asked. \"Would you like to?\" I couldn't picture it, this godlike creature sitting in my father's shabby kitchen chair. \"Yes, if it's all right.\" I heard the door close quietly, and almost simultaneously he was outside my door, opening it for me. \"Very human,\" I complimented him. \"It's definitely resurfacing.\" He walked beside me in the night, so quietly I had to peek at him constantly to be sure he was still there. In the darkness he looked much more normal. Still pale, still dreamlike in his beauty, but no longer the fantastic sparkling creature of our sunlit afternoon. He reached the door ahead of me and opened it for me. I paused halfway through the frame. \"The door was unlocked?\" \"No, I used the key from under the eave.\" I stepped inside, flicked on the porch light, and turned to look at him with my eyebrows raised. I was sure I'd never used that key in front of him. \"I was curious about you.\" \"You spied on me?\" But somehow I couldn't infuse my voice with the proper outrage. I was flattered. He was unrepentant. \"What else is there to do at night?\" I let it go for the moment and went down the hall to the kitchen. He was there before me, needing no guide. He sat in the very chair I'd tried to picture him in. His beauty lit up the kitchen. It was a moment before I could look away. I concentrated on getting my dinner, taking last night's lasagna from the fridge, placing a square on a plate, heating it in the microwave. It revolved, filling the kitchen with the smell of tomatoes and oregano. I didn't take my eyes from the plate of food as I spoke. \"How often?\" I asked casually. \"Hmmm?\" He sounded as if I had pulled him from some other train of thought. I still didn't turn around. \"How often did you come here?\" \"I come here almost every night.\" I whirled, stunned. \"Why?\" \"You're interesting when you sleep.\" He spoke matter-of-factly. \"You talk.\" \"No!\" I gasped, heat flooding my face all the way to my hairline. I gripped the kitchen counter for support. I knew I talked in my sleep, of course; my mother teased me about it. I hadn't thought it was something I needed to worry about here, though. His expression shifted instantly to chagrin. \"Are you very angry with me?\" \"That depends!\" I felt and sounded like I'd had the breath knocked out of me. He waited. \"On?\" he urged. \"What you heard!\" I wailed. Instantly, silently, he was at my side, taking my hands carefully in his.  \"Don't be upset!\" he pleaded. He dropped his face to the level of my eyes, holding my gaze. I was embarrassed. I tried to look away.  \"You miss your mother,\" he whispered. \"You worry about her. And when it rains, the sound makes you restless. You used to talk about home a lot, but it's less often now. Once you said, 'It's too green.'\" He laughed softly, hoping, I could see, not to offend me further. \"Anything else?\" I demanded. He knew what I was getting at. \"You did say my name,\" he admitted. I sighed in defeat. \"A lot?\" \"How much do you mean by 'a lot,' exactly?\" \"Oh no!\" I hung my head. He pulled me against his chest, softly, naturally. \"Don't be self-conscious,\" he whispered in my ear. \"If I could dream at all, it would be about you. And I'm not ashamed of it.\" Then we both heard the sound of tires on the brick driveway, saw the headlights flash through the front windows, down the hall to us. I stiffened in his arms. \"Should your father know I'm here?\" he asked. \"I'm not sure\u2026\" I tried to think it through quickly. \"Another time then\u2026\" And I was alone. \"Edward!\" I hissed. I heard a ghostly chuckle, then nothing else. My father's key turned in the door. \"Bella?\" he called. It had bothered me before; who else would it be? Suddenly he didn't seem so far off base. \"In here.\" I hoped he couldn't hear the hysterical edge to my voice. I grabbed my dinner from the microwave and sat at the table as he walked in. His footsteps sounded so noisy after my day with Edward.  \"Can you get me some of that? I'm bushed.\" He stepped on the heels of his boots to take them off, holding the back of Edward's chair for support. I took my food with me, scarfing it down as I got his dinner. It burned my tongue. I filled two glasses with milk while his lasagna was heating, and gulped mine to put out the fire. As I set the glass down, I noticed the milk trembling and realized my hand was shaking. Charlie sat in the chair, and the contrast between him and its former occupant was comical. \"Thanks,\" he said as I placed his food on the table. \"How was your day?\" I asked. The words were rushed; I was dying to escape to my room. \"Good. The fish were biting\u2026 how about you? Did you get everything done that you wanted to?\" \"Not really \u2014 it was too nice out to stay indoors.\" I took another big bite. \"It was a nice day,\" he agreed. What an understatement, I thought to myself. Finished with the last bite of lasagna, I lifted my glass and chugged the remains of my milk. Charlie surprised me by being observant. \"In a hurry?\" \"Yeah, I'm tired. I'm going to bed early.\" \"You look kinda keyed up,\" he noted. Why, oh why, did this have to be his night to pay attention? \"Do I?\" was all I could manage in response. I quickly scrubbed my dishes clean in the sink, and placed them upside down on a dish towel to dry. \"It's Saturday,\" he mused. I didn't respond. \"No plans tonight?\" he asked suddenly. \"No, Dad, I just want to get some sleep.\" \"None of the boys in town your type, eh?\" He was suspicious, but trying to play it cool. \"No, none of the boys have caught my eye yet.\" I was careful not to over-emphasize the word boys in my quest to be truthful with Charlie. \"I thought maybe that Mike Newton\u2026 you said he was friendly.\" \"He's Just a friend, Dad.\" \"Well, you're too good for them all, anyway. Wait till you get to college to start looking.\" Every father's dream, that his daughter will be out of the house before the hormones kick in. \"Sounds like a good idea to me,\" I agreed as I headed up the stairs. \"'Night, honey,\" he called after me. No doubt he would be listening carefully all evening, waiting for me to try to sneak out. \"See you in the morning, Dad.\" See you creeping into my room tonight at midnight to check on me. I worked to make my tread sound slow and tired as I walked up the stairs to my room. I shut the door loud enough for him to hear, and then sprinted on my tiptoes to the window. I threw it open and leaned out into the night. My eyes scanned the darkness, the impenetrable shadows of the trees. \"Edward?\" I whispered, feeling completely idiotic. The quiet, laughing response came from behind me. \"Yes?\" I whirled, one hand flying to my throat in surprise. He lay, smiling hugely, across my bed, his hands behind his head, his feet dangling off the end, the picture of ease. \"Oh!\" I breathed, sinking unsteadily to the floor.  \"I'm sorry.\" He pressed his lips together, trying to hide his amusement. \"Just give me a minute to restart my heart.\" He sat up slowly, so as not to startle me again. Then he leaned forward and reached out with his long arms to pick me up, gripping the tops of my arms like I was a toddler. He sat me on the bed beside him. \"Why don't you sit with me,\" he suggested, putting a cold hand on mine. \"How's the heart?\" \"You tell me \u2014 I'm sure you hear it better than I do.\" I felt his quiet laughter shake the bed. We sat there for a moment in silence, both listening to my heartbeat slow. I thought about having Edward in my room, with my father in the house. \"Can I have a minute to be human?\" I asked. \"Certainly.\" He gestured with one hand that I should proceed. \"Stay,\" I said, trying to look severe. \"Yes, ma'am.\" And he made a show of becoming a statue on the edge of my bed. I hopped up, grabbing my pajamas from off the floor, my bag of toiletries off the desk. I left the light off and slipped out, closing the door. I could hear the sound from the TV rising up the stairs. I banged the bathroom door loudly, so Charlie wouldn't come up to bother me. I meant to hurry. I brushed my teeth fiercely, trying to be thorough and speedy, removing all traces of lasagna. But the hot water of the shower couldn't be rushed. It unknotted the muscles in my back, calmed my pulse. The familiar smell of my shampoo made me feel like I might be the same person I had been this morning. I tried not to think of Edward, sitting in my room, waiting, because then I had to start all over with the calming process. Finally, I couldn't delay anymore. I shut off the water, toweling hastily, rushing again. I pulled on my holey t-shirt and gray sweatpants. Too late to regret not packing the Victoria's Secret silk pajamas my mother got me two birthdays ago, which still had the tags on them in a drawer somewhere back home. I rubbed the towel through my hair again, and then yanked the brush through it quickly. I threw the towel in the hamper, flung my brush and toothpaste into my bag. Then I dashed down the stairs so Charlie could see that I was in my pajamas, with wet hair. \"'Night, Dad.\" \"'Night, Bella.\" He did look startled by my appearance. Maybe that would keep him from checking on me tonight. I took the stairs two at a time, trying to be quiet, and flew into my room, closing the door tightly behind me. Edward hadn't moved a fraction of an inch, a carving of Adonis perched on my faded quilt. I smiled, and his lips twitched, the statue coming to life. His eyes appraised me, taking in the damp hair, the tattered shirt. He raised one eyebrow. \"Nice.\" I grimaced. \"No, it looks good on you.\" \"Thanks,\" I whispered. I went back to his side, sitting cross-legged beside him. I looked at the lines in the wooden floor. \"What was all that for?\" \"Charlie thinks I'm sneaking out.\" \"Oh.\" He contemplated that. \"Why?\" As if he couldn't know Charlie's mind much more clearly than I could guess. \"Apparently, I look a little overexcited.\" He lifted my chin, examining my face. \"You look very warm, actually.\" He bent his face slowly to mine, laying his cool cheek against my skin. I held perfectly still. \"Mmmmmm\u2026\" he breathed. It was very difficult, while he was touching me, to frame a coherent question. It took me a minute of scattered concentration to begin. \"It seems to be\u2026 much easier for you, now, to be close to me.\" \"Does it seem that way to you?\" he murmured, his nose gliding to the corner of my jaw. I felt his hand, lighter than a moth's wing, brushing my damp hair back, so that his lips could touch the hollow beneath my ear. \"Much, much easier,\" I said, trying to exhale. \"Hmm.\" \"So I was wondering\u2026\" I began again, but his fingers were slowly tracing my collarbone, and I lost my train of thought. \"Yes?\" he breathed. \"Why is that,\" my voice shook, embarrassing me, \"do you think?\" I felt the tremor of his breath on my neck as he laughed. \"Mind over matter.\" I pulled back; as I moved, he froze \u2014 and I could no longer hear the sound of his breathing. We stared cautiously at each other for a moment, and then, as his clenched jaw gradually relaxed, his expression became puzzled. \"Did I do something wrong?\" \"No \u2014 the opposite. You're driving me crazy,\" I explained.  He considered that briefly, and when he spoke, he sounded pleased. \"Really?\" A triumphant smile slowly lit his face. \"Would you like a round of applause?\" I asked sarcastically. He grinned. \"I'm just pleasantly surprised,\" he clarified. \"In the last hundred years or so,\" his voice was teasing, \"I never imagined anything like this. I didn't believe I would ever find someone I wanted to be with\u2026 in another way than my brothers and sisters. And then to find, even though it's all new to me, that I'm good at it\u2026 at being with you\u2026\" \"You're good at everything,\" I pointed out. He shrugged, allowing that, and we both laughed in whispers. \"But how can it be so easy now?\" I pressed. \"This afternoon\u2026\" \"It's not easy,\" he sighed. \"But this afternoon, I was still\u2026 undecided. I am sorry about that, it was unforgivable for me to behave so.\" \"Not unforgivable,\" I disagreed. \"Thank you.\" He smiled. \"You see,\" he continued, looking down now, \"I wasn't sure if I was strong enough\u2026\" He picked up one of my hands and pressed it lightly to his face. \"And while there was still that possibility that I might be\u2026 overcome\" \u2014 he breathed in the scent at my wrist \u2014 \"I was\u2026 susceptible. Until I made up my mind that I was strong enough, that there was no possibility at all that I would\u2026 that I ever could\u2026\" I'd never seen him struggle so hard for words. It was so\u2026 human. \"So there's no possibility now?\" \"Mind over matter,\" he repeated, smiling, his teeth bright even in the darkness. \"Wow, that was easy,\" I said. He threw back his head and laughed, quietly as a whisper, but still exuberantly. \"Easy for you!\" he amended, touching my nose with his fingertip. And then his face was abruptly serious. \"I'm trying,\" he whispered, his voice pained. \"If it gets to be\u2026 too much, I'm fairly sure I'll be able to leave.\" I scowled. I didn't like the talk of leaving. \"And it will be harder tomorrow,\" he continued. \"I've had the scent of you in my head all day, and I've grown amazingly desensitized. If I'm away from you for any length of time, I'll have to start over again. Not quite from scratch, though, I think.\" \"Don't go away, then,\" I responded, unable to hide the longing in my voice. \"That suits me,\" he replied, his face relaxing into a gentle smile. \"Bring on the shackles \u2014 I'm your prisoner.\" But his long hands formed manacles around my wrists as he spoke. He laughed his quiet, musical laugh. He'd laughed more tonight than I'd ever heard in all the time I'd spent with him. \"You seem more\u2026 optimistic than usual,\" I observed. \"I haven't seen you like this before.\" \"Isn't it supposed to be like this?\" He smiled. \"The glory of first love, and all that. It's incredible, isn't it, the difference between reading about something, seeing it in the pictures, and experiencing it?\" \"Very different,\" I agreed. \"More forceful than I'd imagined.\" \"For example\" \u2014 his words flowed swiftly now, I had to concentrate to catch it all \u2014 \"the emotion of jealousy. I've read about it a hundred thousand times, seen actors portray it in a thousand different plays and movies. I believed I understood that one pretty clearly. But it shocked me\u2026\" He grimaced. \"Do you remember the day that Mike asked you to the dance?\" I nodded, though I remembered that day for a different reason. \"The day you started talking to me again.\" \"I was surprised by the flare of resentment, almost fury, that I felt \u2014 I didn't recognize what it was at first. I was even more aggravated than usual that I couldn't know what you were thinking, why you refused him. Was it simply for your friend's sake? Was there someone else? I knew I had no right to care either way. I tried not to care. \"And then the line started forming,\" he chuckled. I scowled in the darkness. \"I waited, unreasonably anxious to hear what you would say to them, to watch your expressions. I couldn't deny the relief I felt, watching the annoyance on your face. But I couldn't be sure. \"That was the first night I came here. I wrestled all night, while watching you sleep, with the chasm between what I knew was right, moral, ethical, and what I wanted. I knew that if I continued to ignore you as I should, or if I left for a few years, till you were gone, that someday you would say yes to Mike, or someone like him. It made me angry. \"And then,\" he whispered, \"as you were sleeping, you said my name. You spoke so clearly, at first I thought you'd woken. But you rolled over restlessly and mumbled my name once more, and sighed. The feeling that coursed through me then was unnerving, staggering. And I knew I couldn't ignore you any longer.\" He was silent for a moment, probably listening to the suddenly uneven pounding of my heart. \"But jealousy\u2026 it's a strange thing. So much more powerful than I would have thought. And irrational! Just now, when Charlie asked you about that vile Mike Newton\u2026\" He shook his head angrily. \"I should have known you'd be listening,\" I groaned. \"Of course.\" \"That made you feel jealous, though, really?\" \"I'm new at this; you're resurrecting the human in me, and everything feels stronger because it's fresh.\" \"But honestly,\" I teased, \"for that to bother you, after I have to hear that Rosalie \u2014 Rosalie, the incarnation of pure beauty, Rosalie \u2014 was meant for you. Emmett or no Emmett, how can I compete with that?\" \"There's no competition.\" His teeth gleamed. He drew my trapped hands around his back, holding me to his chest. I kept as still as I could, even breathing with caution. \"I know there's no competition,\" I mumbled into his cold skin. \"That's the problem.\" \"Of course Rosalie is beautiful in her way, but even if she wasn't like a sister to me, even if Emmett didn't belong with her, she could never have one tenth, no, one hundredth of the attraction you hold for me.\" He was serious now, thoughtful. \"For almost ninety years I've walked among my kind, and yours\u2026 all the time thinking I was complete in myself, not realizing what I was seeking. And not finding anything, because you weren't alive yet.\" \"It hardly seems fair,\" I whispered, my face still resting on his chest, listening to his breath come and go. \"I haven't had to wait at all. Why should I get off so easily?\" \"You're right,\" he agreed with amusement. \"I should make this harder for you, definitely.\" He freed one of his hands, released my wrist, only to gather it carefully into his other hand. He stroked my wet hair softly, from the top of my head to my waist. \"You only have to risk your life every second you spend with me, that's surely not much. You only have to turn your back on nature, on humanity\u2026 what's that worth?\" \"Very little \u2014 I don't feel deprived of anything.\" \"Not yet.\" And his voice was abruptly full of ancient grief. I tried to pull back, to look in his face, but his hand locked my wrists in an unbreakable hold. \"What \u2014\" I started to ask, when his body became alert. I froze, but he suddenly released my hands, and disappeared. I narrowly avoided falling on my face. \"Lie down!\" he hissed. I couldn't tell where he spoke from in the darkness. I rolled under my quilt, <em>balling</em> up on my side, the way I usually slept. I heard the door crack open, as Charlie peeked in to make sure I was where I was supposed to be. I breathed evenly, exaggerating the movement. A long minute passed. I listened, not sure if I'd heard the door close. Then Edward's cool arm was around me, under the covers, his lips at my ear. \"You are a terrible actress \u2014 I'd say that career path is out for you.\" \"Darn it,\" I muttered. My heart was crashing in my chest. He hummed a melody I didn't recognize; it sounded like a lullaby. He paused. \"Should I sing you to sleep?\" \"Right,\" I laughed. \"Like I could sleep with you here!\" \"You do it all the time,\" he reminded me. \"But I didn't know you were here,\" I replied icily. \"So if you don't want to sleep\u2026\" he suggested, ignoring my tone. My breath caught. \"If I don't want to sleep\u2026 ?\" He chuckled. \"What do you want to do then?\" I couldn't answer at first. \"I'm not sure,\" I finally said. \"Tell me when you decide.\" I could feel his cool breath on my neck, feel his nose sliding along my jaw, inhaling. \"I thought you were desensitized.\" \"Just because I'm resisting the wine doesn't mean I can't appreciate the bouquet,\" he whispered. \"You have a very floral smell, like lavender\u2026 or freesia,\" he noted. \"It's mouthwatering.\" \"Yeah, it's an off day when I don't get somebody telling me how edible I smell.\" He chuckled, and then sighed. \"I've decided what I want to do,\" I told him. \"I want to hear more about you.\" \"Ask me anything.\" I sifted through my questions for the most vital. \"Why do you do it?\" I said. \"I still don't understand how you can work so hard to resist what you\u2026 are. Please don't misunderstand, of course I'm glad that you do. I just don't see why you would bother in the first place.\" He hesitated before answering. \"That's a good question, and you are not the first one to ask it. The others \u2014 the majority of our kind who are quite content with our lot \u2014 they, too, wonder at how we live. But you see, just because we've been\u2026 dealt a certain hand\u2026 it doesn't mean that we can't choose to rise above \u2014 to conquer the boundaries of a destiny that none of us wanted. To try to retain whatever essential humanity we can.\" I lay unmoving, locked in awed silence. \"Did you fall asleep?\" he whispered after a few minutes. \"No.\" \"Is that all you were curious about?\" I rolled my eyes. \"Not quite.\" \"What else do you want to know?\" \"Why can you read minds \u2014 why only you? And Alice, seeing the future\u2026 why does that happen?\" I felt him shrug in the darkness. \"We don't really know. Carlisle has a theory\u2026 he believes that we all bring something of our strongest human traits with us into the next life, where they are intensified \u2014 like our minds, and our senses. He thinks that I must have already been very sensitive to the thoughts of those around me. And that Alice had some precognition, wherever she was.\" \"What did he bring into the next life, and the others?\" \"Carlisle brought his compassion. Esme brought her ability to love passionately. Emmett brought his strength, Rosalie her\u2026 tenacity. Or you could call it pigheadedness.\" he chuckled. \"Jasper is very interesting. He was quite charismatic in his first life, able to influence those around him to see things his way. Now he is able to manipulate the emotions of those around him \u2014 calm down a room of angry people, for example, or excite a lethargic crowd, conversely. It's a very subtle gift.\" I considered the impossibilities he described, trying to take it in. He waited patiently while I thought. \"So where did it all start? I mean, Carlisle changed you, and then someone must have changed him, and so on\u2026\" \"Well, where did you come from? Evolution? Creation? Couldn't we have evolved in the same way as other species, predator and prey? Or, if you don't believe that all this world could have just happened on its own, which is hard for me to accept myself, is it so hard to believe that the same force that created the delicate angelfish with the shark, the baby seal and the killer whale, could create both our kinds together?\" \"Let me get this straight \u2014 I'm the baby seal, right?\" \"Right.\" He laughed, and something touched my hair \u2014 his lips? I wanted to turn toward him, to see if it was really his lips against my hair. But I had to be good; I didn't want to make this any harder for him than it already was. \"Are you ready to sleep?\" he asked, interrupting the short silence. \"Or do you have any more questions?\" \"Only a million or two.\" \"We have tomorrow, and the next day, and the next\u2026\" he reminded me. I smiled, euphoric at the thought.  \"Are you sure you won't vanish in the morning?\" I wanted this to be certain. \"You are mythical, after all.\" \"I won't leave you.\" His voice had the seal of a promise in it. \"One more, then, tonight\u2026\" And I blushed. The darkness was no help \u2014 I'm sure he could feel the sudden warmth under my skin. \"What is it?\" \"No, forget it. I changed my mind.\" \"Bella, you can ask me anything.\" I didn't answer, and he groaned. \"I keep thinking it will get less frustrating, not hearing your thoughts. But it just gets worse and worse.\" \"I'm glad you can't read my thoughts. It's bad enough that you eavesdrop on my sleep-talking.\" \"Please?\" His voice was so persuasive, so impossible to resist. I shook my head. \"If you don't tell me, I'll just assume it's something much worse than it is,\" he threatened darkly. \"Please?\" Again, that pleading voice. \"Well,\" I began, glad that he couldn't see my face. \"Yes?\" \"You said that Rosalie and Emmett will get married soon\u2026 Is that\u2026 marriage\u2026 the same as it is for humans?\" He laughed in earnest now, understanding. \"Is that what you're getting at?\" I fidgeted, unable to answer. \"Yes, I suppose it is much the same,\" he said. \"I told you, most of those human desires are there, just hidden behind more powerful desires.\" \"Oh,\" was all I could say. \"Was there a purpose behind your curiosity?\" \"Well, I did wonder\u2026 about you and me\u2026 someday\u2026\" He was instantly serious, I could tell by the sudden stillness of his body. I froze, too, reacting automatically. \"I don't think that\u2026 that\u2026 would be possible for us.\" \"Because it would be too hard for you, if I were that\u2026 close?\" \"That's certainly a problem. But that's not what I was thinking of. It's just that you are so soft, so fragile. I have to mind my actions every moment that we're together so that I don't hurt you. I could kill you quite easily, Bella, simply by accident.\" His voice had become just a soft murmur. He moved his icy palm to rest it against my cheek. \"If I was too hasty\u2026 if for one second I wasn't paying enough attention, I could reach out, meaning to touch your face, and crush your skull by mistake. You don't realize how incredibly breakable you are. I can never, never afford to lose any kind of control when I'm with you.\" He waited for me to respond, growing anxious when I didn't. \"Are you scared?\" he asked. I waited for a minute to answer, so the words would be true. \"No. I'm fine.\" He seemed to deliberate for a moment. \"I'm curious now, though,\" he said, his voice light again. \"Have you ever\u2026 ?\" He trailed off suggestively. \"Of course not.\" I flushed. \"I told you I've never felt like this about anyone before, not even close.\" \"I know. It's just that I know other people's thoughts. I know love and lust don't always keep the same company.\" \"They do for me. Now, anyway, that they exist for me at all,\" I sighed. \"That's nice. We have that one thing in common, at least.\" He sounded satisfied. \"Your human instincts\u2026\" I began. He waited. \"Well, do you find me attractive, in that way, at all?\" He laughed and lightly rumpled my nearly dry hair.  \"I may not be a human, but I am a man,\" he assured me. I yawned involuntarily. \"I've answered your questions, now you should sleep,\" he insisted. \"I'm not sure if I can.\" \"Do you want me to leave?\" \"No!\" I said too loudly. He laughed, and then began to hum that same, unfamiliar lullaby; the voice of an archangel, soft in my ear. More tired than I realized, exhausted from the long day of mental and emotional stress like I'd never felt before, I drifted to sleep in his cold arms.",
