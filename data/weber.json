            "en": "Nosebleeds    Nosebleeds are more often annoying than a serious health threat, although they can indicate the presence of other underlying illnesses.  Most nosebleeds can be treated at home. They are messy and can be embarrassing, but most do not need professional medical attention.  What are they?  Most nosebleeds start in the lower part of the septum, the semi-rigid wall that separates the two channels of the nose.  It contains blood vessels that can be broken by a blow to the nose or the edge of a sharp fingernail.  With these nosebleeds - known as anterior nosebleeds - bleeding can occur from one side of the nose (epistaxis) or both (epistaxis bilateral).  They can usually be treated easily at home and do not require medical attention.  More rarely, posterior nosebleeds start when bleeding begins high and deep within the nose.  Blood flows down the back of the mouth and throat even when the patient is sitting up or standing.  This more severe type of nosebleed needs immediate medical attention.  What causes them?  Nosebleeds are caused by the rupture of a small blood vessel called a capiliary in the nose.  The most common cause of this is injury - a good bash to the nose will result in bleeding.  The other main cause is dryness of the inside of the nose. A dry climate or heated indoor air irritates and dries out nasal membranes, causing crusts that may itch and then bleed when picked.  Other causes of nosebleeds are colds, high altitude, allergies and medications.  Nosebleeds can also result from a calcium deficiency.  Occasionally, nosebleeds may indicate other disorders such as bleeding disorders, cancer, high blood pressure or disease of the arteries.  They can also indicate hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia, also known as Osler-<em>Weber</em>-Rendu syndrome.  This is a disorder involving a vascular growth similar to a birthmark in the back of the nose.  What is the treatment?  Doctors advise people with lower-septum nosebleeds to sit up straight and pinch the nostrils together firmly for 10 minutes.  An ice pack can also be applied to the nose and cheeks.  The pressure should then be relieved to see if the nose is still bleeding.  If it is, patients are advised to pinch the nostrils for another 10 minutes.  If the nosebleed was caused by atmospheric dryness, the patient should breathe steamy air. After bleeding stops, petroleum jelly can be applied just inside the nose to prevent further bleeding.  Once bleeding has stopped, the sufferer should avoid any strenuous activity for 12 hours. Nor should they blow their nose, as this may dislodge blood clots and cause bleeding to start again.  If bleeding does not stop after 30 minutes of direct pressure, patients should see a doctor.  If blood runs down the back of the throat when pressure is applied to the nose, it could be a higher-septum nosebleed and require a visit to the doctor.  Patients should also seek professional help if nosebleeds occur more than once a week.  What is the treatment for serious nosebleeds?  Cauterisation is the minor surgical procedure used to stop heavy nosebleeds.  It involves destroying tissue with an electric current, a hot iron, or caustic chemicals.  This seals the ruptured blood vessel and prevents further bleeding.",

            "en": "ECLIPSE            ECLIPSE    Fire and Ice  Some say the world will end in fire,  Some say in ice.  From what I\u2019ve tasted of desire  I hold with those who favor fire.  But if it had to perish twice,  I think I know enough of hate  To say that for destruction ice  Is also great  And would suffice.  Robert Frost    PREFACE  All our attempts at subterfuge had been in vain.  With ice in my heart, I watched him prepare to defend me. His intense concentration betrayed no hint of doubt, though he was outnumbered. I knew that we could expect no help \u2014 at this moment, his family was fighting for their lives just as surely as he was for ours.    Would I ever learn the outcome of that other fight? Find out who the winners and the losers were?  Would I live long enough for that?  The odds of that didn\u2019t look so great.  Black eyes, wild with their fierce craving for my death, watched for the moment when my protector\u2019s attention would be diverted. The moment when I would surely die.  Somewhere, far, far away in the cold forest, a wolf howled.    1. ULTIMATUM  Bella,  I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re making Charlie carry notes to Billy like we\u2019re in second grade \u2014 if I wanted to talk to you I would answer them  You made the choice here, okay? You can\u2019t have it both ways when  What part of \u201cmortal enemies\u201d is too complicated for you to  Look, I know I\u2019m being a jerk, but there\u2019s just no way around  We can\u2019t be friends when you\u2019re spending all your time with a bunch of  It just makes it worse when I think about you too much, so don\u2019t write anymore  Yeah, I miss you, too. A lot. Doesn\u2019t change anything. Sorry.  Jacob     I ran my fingers across the page, feeling the dents where he had pressed the pen to the paper so hard that it had nearly broken through. I could picture him writing this \u2014 scrawling the angry letters in his rough handwriting, slashing through line after line when the words came out wrong, maybe even snapping the pen in his too-big hand; that would explain the ink splatters. I could imagine the frustration pulling his black eyebrows together and crumpling his forehead. If I\u2019d been there, I might have laughed. Don\u2019t give yourself a brain hemorrhage, Jacob, I would have told him. Just spit it out.     Laughing was the last thing I felt like doing now as I reread the words I\u2019d already memorized. His answer to my pleading note \u2014 passed from Charlie to Billy to him, just like second grade, as he\u2019d pointed out \u2014 was no surprise. I\u2019d known the essence of what it would say before I\u2019d opened it. What was surprising was how much each crossed-out line wounded me \u2014 as if the points of the letters had cutting edges. More than that, behind each angry beginning lurked a vast pool of hurt; Jacob\u2019s pain cut me deeper than my own.     While I was pondering this, I caught the unmistakable scent of a smoking burner rising from the kitchen. In another house, the fact that someone besides myself was cooking might not be a cause for panicking. I shoved the wrinkled paper into my back pocket and ran, making it downstairs in the nick of time. The jar of spaghetti sauce Charlie\u2019d stuck in the microwave was only on its first revolution when I yanked the door open and pulled it out.     \u201cWhat did I do wrong?\u201d Charlie demanded.  \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to take the lid off first, Dad. Metal\u2019s bad for microwaves.\u201d I swiftly removed the lid as I spoke, poured half the sauce into a bowl, and then put the bowl inside the microwave and the jar back in the fridge; I fixed the time and pressed start.  Charlie watched my adjustments with pursed lips. \u201cDid I get the noodles right?\u201d  I looked in the pan on the stove \u2014 the source of the smell that had alerted me. \u201cStirring helps,\u201d I said mildly. I found a spoon and tried to de-clump the mushy hunk that was scalded to the bottom.  Charlie sighed.     \u201cSo what\u2019s all this about?\u201d I asked him.  He folded his arms across his chest and glared out the back windows into the sheeting rain. \u201cDon\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d he grumbled.  I was mystified. Charlie cooking? And what was with the surly attitude? Edward wasn\u2019t here yet; usually my dad reserved this kind of behavior for my boyfriend\u2019s benefit, doing his best to illustrate the theme of \u201cunwelcome\u201d with every word and posture. Charlie\u2019s efforts were unnecessary \u2014 Edward knew exactly what my dad was thinking without the show.      The word boyfriend had me chewing on the inside of my cheek with a familiar tension while I stirred. It wasn\u2019t the right word, not at all. I needed something more expressive of eternal commitment. . . . But words like destiny and fate sounded hokey when you used them in casual conversation.     Edward had another word in mind, and that word was the source of the tension I felt. It put my teeth on edge just to think it to myself. Fianc\u00e9e. Ugh. I shuddered away from the thought.  \u201cDid I miss something? Since when do you make dinner?\u201d I asked Charlie. The pasta lump bobbed in the boiling water as I poked it. \u201cOr try to make dinner, I should say.\u201d  Charlie shrugged. \u201cThere\u2019s no law that says I can\u2019t cook in my own house.\u201d     \u201cYou would know,\u201d I replied, grinning as I eyed the badge pinned to his leather jacket.  \u201cHa. Good one.\u201d He shrugged out of the jacket as if my glance had reminded him he still had it on, and hung it on the peg reserved for his gear. His gun belt was already slung in place \u2014 he hadn\u2019t felt the need to wear that to the station for a few weeks. There had been no more disturbing disappearances to trouble the small town of Forks, Washington, no more sightings of the giant, mysterious wolves in the ever-rainy woods. . . .      I prodded the noodles in silence, guessing that Charlie would get around to talking about whatever was bothering him in his own time. My dad was not a man of many words, and the effort he had put into trying to orchestrate a sit-down dinner with me made it clear there were an uncharacteristic number of words on his mind.  I glanced at the clock routinely - something I did every few minutes around this time. Less than a half hour to go now.    Afternoons were the hardest part of my day. Ever since my former best friend (and werewolf), Jacob Black, had informed on me about the motorcycle I\u2019d been riding on the sly \u2014 a betrayal he had devised in order to get me grounded so that I couldn\u2019t spend time with my boyfriend (and vampire), Edward Cullen \u2014 Edward had been allowed to see me only from seven till nine-thirty p.m., always inside the confines of my home and under the supervision of my dad\u2019s unfailingly crabby glare.     This was an escalation from the previous, slightly less stringent grounding that I\u2019d earned for an unexplained three-day disappearance and one episode of cliff diving.     Of course, I still saw Edward at school, because there wasn\u2019t anything Charlie could do about that. And then, Edward spent almost every night in my room, too, but Charlie wasn\u2019t precisely aware of that. Edward\u2019s ability to climb easily and silently through my second-story window was almost as useful as his ability to read Charlie\u2019s mind.     Though the afternoon was the only time I spent away from Edward, it was enough to make me restless, and the hours always dragged. Still, I endured my punishment without complaining because \u2014 for one thing \u2014 I knew I\u2019d earned it, and \u2014 for another \u2014 because I couldn\u2019t bear to hurt my dad by moving out now, when a much more permanent separation hovered, invisible to Charlie, so close on my horizon.    My dad sat down at the table with a grunt and unfolded the damp newspaper there; within seconds he was clucking his tongue in disapproval.  \u201cI don\u2019t know why you read the news, Dad. It only ticks you off.\u201d  He ignored me, grumbling at the paper in his hands. \u201cThis is why everyone wants to live in a small town! Ridiculous.\u201d  \u201cWhat have big cities done wrong now?\u201d  \u201cSeattle\u2019s making a run for murder capital of the country. Five unsolved homicides in the last two weeks. Can you imagine living like that?\u201d      \u201cI think Phoenix is actually higher up the homicide list, Dad. I have lived like that.\u201d And I\u2019d never come close to being a murder victim until after I moved to his safe little town. In fact, I was still on several hit lists. . . . The spoon shook in my hands, making the water tremble. \u201cWell, you couldn\u2019t pay me enough,\u201d Charlie said.     I gave up on saving dinner and settled for serving it; I had to use a steak knife to cut a portion of spaghetti for Charlie and then myself, while he watched with a sheepish expression. Charlie coated his helping with sauce and dug in. I disguised my own clump as well as I could and followed his example without much enthusiasm. We ate in silence for a moment. Charlie was still scanning the news, so I picked up my much-abused copy of Wuthering Heights from where I\u2019d left it this morning at breakfast, and tried to lose myself in turn-of-the-century England while I waited for him to start talking.     I was just to the part where Heathcliff returns when Charlie cleared his throat and threw the paper to the floor.  \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Charlie said. \u201cI did have a reason for doing this.\u201d He waved his fork at the gluey spread.  \u201cI wanted to talk to you.\u201d  I laid the book aside; the binding was so destroyed that it slumped flat to the table. \u201cYou could have just asked.\u201d  He nodded, his eyebrows pulling together. \u201cYeah. I\u2019ll remember that next time. I thought taking dinner off your hands would soften you up.\u201d     I laughed. \u201cIt worked \u2014 your cooking skills have me soft as a marshmallow. What do you need, Dad?\u201d  \u201cWell, it\u2019s about Jacob.\u201d  I felt my face harden. \u201cWhat about him?\u201d I asked through stiff lips.  \u201cEasy, Bells. I know you\u2019re still upset that he told on you, but it was the right thing. He was being responsible.\u201d  \u201cResponsible,\u201d I repeated scathingly, rolling my eyes. \u201cRight. So, what about Jacob?\u201d  The careless question repeated inside my head, anything but trivial.What about Jacob? What was I going to do about him? My former best friend who was now . . . what? My enemy? I cringed.    Charlie\u2019s face was suddenly wary. \u201cDon\u2019t get mad at me, okay?\u201d  \u201cMad?\u201d  \u201cWell, it\u2019s about Edward, too.\u201d  My eyes narrowed.  Charlie\u2019s voice got gruffer. \u201cI let him in the house, don\u2019t I?\u201d  \u201cYou do,\u201d I admitted. \u201cFor brief periods of time. Of course, you might let me out of the house for brief periods now and then, too,\u201d I continued \u2014 only jokingly; I knew I was on lockdown for the duration of the school year. \u201cI\u2019ve been pretty good lately.\u201d  \u201cWell, that\u2019s kind of where I was heading with this. . . .\u201d And then Charlie\u2019s face stretched into an unexpected eye-crinkling grin; for a second he looked twenty years younger.     I saw a dim glimmer of possibility in that smile, but I proceeded slowly. \u201cI\u2019m confused, Dad. Are we talking about Jacob, or Edward, or me being grounded?\u201d  The grin flashed again. \u201cSort of all three.\u201d  \u201cAnd how do they relate?\u201d I asked, cautious.  \u201cOkay.\u201d He sighed, raising his hands as if in surrender. \u201cSo I\u2019m thinking maybe you deserve a parole for good behavior. For a teenager, you\u2019re amazingly non-whiney.\u201d  My voice and eyebrows shot up. \u201cSeriously? I\u2019m free?\u201d  Where was this coming from? I\u2019d been positive I would be under house arrest until I actually moved out, and Edward hadn\u2019t picked up any wavering in Charlie\u2019s thoughts. . . .     Charlie held up one finger. \u201cConditionally.\u201d  The enthusiasm vanished. \u201cFantastic,\u201d I groaned.  \u201cBella, this is more of a request than a demand, okay? You\u2019re free. But I\u2019m hoping you\u2019ll use that freedom . . . judiciously.\u201d  \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d  He sighed again. \u201cI know you\u2019re satisfied to spend all of your time with Edward \u2014\u201d  \u201cI spend time with Alice, too,\u201d I interjected. Edward\u2019s sister had no hours of visitation; she came and went as she pleased. Charlie was putty in her capable hands.  \u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you have other friends besides the Cullens, Bella. Or you used to.\u201d     We stared at each other for a long moment.  \u201cWhen was the last time you spoke to Angela <em>Weber</em>?\u201d he threw at me.  \u201cFriday at lunch,\u201d I answered immediately.  Before Edward\u2019s return, my school friends had polarized into two groups. I liked to think of those groups as good vs.evil. Us and them worked, too. The good guys were Angela, her steady boyfriend Ben Cheney, and Mike Newton; these three had all very generously forgiven me for going crazy when Edward left. Lauren Mallory was the evil core of the them side, and almost everyone else, including my first friend in Forks, Jessica Stanley, seemed content to go along with her anti-Bella agenda.     With Edward back at school, the dividing line had become even more distinct.  Edward\u2019s return had taken its toll on Mike\u2019s friendship, but Angela was unswervingly loyal, and Ben followed her lead. Despite the natural aversion most humans felt toward the Cullens, Angela sat dutifully beside Alice every day at lunch. After a few weeks, Angela even looked comfortable there. It was difficult not to be charmed by the Cullens \u2014 once one gave them the chance to be charming.  \u201cOutside of school?\u201d Charlie asked, calling my attention back.     \u201cI haven\u2019t seen anyone outside of school, Dad. Grounded, remember? And Angela has a boyfriend, too. She\u2019s always with Ben.If I\u2019m really free,\u201d I added, heavy on the skepticism, \u201cmaybe we could double.\u201d  \u201cOkay. But then . . .\u201d He hesitated. \u201cYou and Jake used to be joined at the hip, and now \u2014\u201d  I cut him off. \u201cCan you get to the point, Dad? What\u2019s your condition \u2014 exactly?\u201d  \u201cI don\u2019t think you should dump all your other friends for your boyfriend, Bella,\u201d he said in a stern voice.  \u201cIt\u2019s not nice, and I think your life would be better balanced if you kept some other people in it. What happened last September . . .\u201d  I flinched.      \u201cWell,\u201d he said defensively. \u201cIf you\u2019d had more of a life outside of Edward Cullen, it might not have been like that.\u201d  \u201cIt would have been exactly like that,\u201d I muttered.  \u201cMaybe, maybe not.\u201d  \u201cThe point?\u201d I reminded him.  \u201cUse your new freedom to see your other friends, too. Keep it balanced.\u201d  I nodded slowly. \u201cBalance is good. Do I have specific time quotas to fill, though?\u201d  He made a face, but shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make this complicated. Just don\u2019t forget your friends . . .\u201d      It was a dilemma I was already struggling with. My friends. People who, for their own safety, I would never be able to see again after graduation.  So what was the better course of action? Spend time with them while I could? Or start the separation now to make it more gradual? I quailed at the idea of the second option.  \u201c. . . particularly Jacob,\u201d Charlie added before I could think things through more than that. A greater dilemma than the first. It took me a moment to find the right words. \u201cJacob might be . . . difficult.\u201d  \u201cThe Blacks are practically family, Bella,\u201d he said, stern and fatherly again. \u201cAnd Jacob has been a very, very good friend to you.\u201d  \u201cI know that.\u201d  \u201cDon\u2019t you miss him at all?\u201d Charlie asked, frustrated.    My throat suddenly felt swollen; I had to clear it twice before I answered. \u201cYes, I do miss him,\u201d I admitted, still looking down. \u201cI miss him a lot.\u201d  \u201cThen why is it difficult?\u201d It wasn\u2019t something I was at liberty to explain. It was against the rules for normal people \u2014human people like me and Charlie \u2014 to know about the clandestine world full of myths and monsters that existed secretly around us. I knew all about that world \u2014 and I was in no small amount of trouble as a result. I wasn\u2019t about to get Charlie in the same trouble. \u201cWith Jacob there is a . . . conflict,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cA conflict about the friendship thing, I mean. Friendship doesn\u2019t always seem to be enough for Jake.\u201d      I wound my excuse out of details that were true but insignificant, hardly crucial compared to the fact that Jacob\u2019s werewolf pack bitterly hated Edward\u2019s vampire family \u2014 and therefore me, too, as I fully intended to join that family. It just wasn\u2019t something I could work out with him in a note, and he wouldn\u2019t answer my calls. But my plan to deal with the werewolf in person had definitely not gone over well with the vampires.    \u201cIsn\u2019t Edward up for a little healthy competition?\u201d Charlie\u2019s voice was sarcastic now.  I leveled a dark look at him. \u201cThere\u2019s no competition.\u201d  \u201cYou\u2019re hurting Jake\u2019s feelings, avoiding him like this. He\u2019d rather be just friends than nothing.\u201d  Oh, now I was avoiding him?  \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Jake doesn\u2019t want to be friends at all.\u201d The words burned in my mouth. \u201cWhere\u2019d you get that idea, anyway?\u201d  Charlie looked embarrassed now. \u201cThe subject might have come up today with Billy. . . .\u201d  \u201cYou and Billy gossip like old women,\u201d I complained, stabbing my fork viciously into the congealed spaghetti on my plate.     \u201cBilly\u2019s worried about Jacob,\u201d Charlie said. \u201cJake\u2019s having a hard time right now. . . . He\u2019s depressed.\u201d  I winced, but kept my eyes on the blob.  \u201cAnd then you were always so happy after spending the day with Jake.\u201d Charlie sighed.  \u201cI\u2019m happy now,\u201d I growled fiercely through my teeth.  The contrast between my words and tone broke through the tension. Charlie burst into laughter, and I had to join in.  \u201cOkay, okay,\u201d I agreed. \u201cBalance.\u201d  \u201cAnd Jacob,\u201d he insisted.  \u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d      \u201cGood. Find that balance, Bella. And, oh, yeah, you\u2019ve got some mail,\u201d Charlie said, closing the subject with no attempt at subtlety. \u201cIt\u2019s by the stove.\u201d  I didn\u2019t move, my thoughts twisting into snarls around Jacob\u2019s name. It was most likely junk mail; I\u2019d just gotten a package from my mom yesterday and I wasn\u2019t expecting anything else.  Charlie shoved his chair away from the table and stretched as he got to his feet. He took his plate to the sink, but before he turned the water on to rinse it, he paused to toss a thick envelope at me. The letter skidded across the table and thunked into my elbow.      \u201cEr, thanks,\u201d I muttered, puzzled by his pushiness. Then I saw the return address \u2014 the letter was from the University of Alaska Southeast. \u201cThat was quick. I guess I missed the deadline on that one, too.\u201d  Charlie chuckled.  I flipped the envelope over and then glared up at him. \u201cIt\u2019s open.\u201d  \u201cI was curious.\u201d  \u201cI\u2019m shocked, Sheriff. That\u2019s a federal crime.\u201d  \u201cOh, just read it.\u201d  I pulled out the letter, and a folded schedule of courses.  \u201cCongratulations,\u201d he said before I could read anything. \u201cYour first acceptance.\u201d  \u201cThanks, Dad.\u201d     \u201cWe should talk about tuition. I\u2019ve got some money saved up \u2014\u201d  \u201cHey, hey, none of that. I\u2019m not touching your retirement, Dad. I\u2019ve got my college fund.\u201d What was left of it \u2014 and there hadn\u2019t been much to begin with.  Charlie frowned. \u201cSome of these places are pretty pricey, Bells. I want to help. You don\u2019t have to go to all the way to Alaska just because it\u2019s cheaper.\u201d     It wasn\u2019t cheaper, not at all. But it was far away, and Juneau had an average of three hundred twenty-one overcast days per year. The first was my prerequisite, the second was Edward\u2019s.  \u201cI\u2019ve got it covered. Besides, there\u2019s lots of financial aid out there. It\u2019s easy to get loans.\u201d I hoped my bluff wasn\u2019t too obvious. I hadn\u2019t actually done a lot of research on the subject.     \u201cSo . . . ,\u201d Charlie began, and then he pursed his lips and looked away.  \u201cSo what?\u201d  \u201cNothing. I was just . . .\u201d He frowned. \u201cJust wondering what . . . Edward\u2019s plans are for next year?\u201d  \u201cOh.\u201d  \u201cWell?\u201d  Three quick raps on the door saved me. Charlie rolled his eyes and I jumped up.  \u201cComing!\u201d I called while Charlie mumbled something that sounded like, \u201cGo away.\u201d I ignored him and went to let Edward in.     I wrenched the door out of my way \u2014 ridiculously eager \u2014 and there he was, my personal miracle. Time had not made me immune to the perfection of his face, and I was sure that I would never take any aspect of him for granted. My eyes traced over his pale white features: the hard square of his jaw, the softer curve of his full lips \u2014 twisted up into a smile now, the straight line of his nose, the sharp angle of his cheekbones, the smooth marble span of his forehead \u2014 partially obscured by a tangle of rain-darkened bronze hair. . . .     I saved his eyes for last, knowing that when I looked into them I was likely to lose my train of thought. They were wide, warm with liquid gold, and framed by a thick fringe of black lashes. Staring into his eyes always made me feel extraordinary \u2014 sort of like my bones were turning spongy. I was also a little lightheaded, but that could have been because I\u2019d forgotten to keep breathing. Again.  It was a face any male model in the world would trade his soul for. Of course, that might be exactly the asking price: one soul.  No. I didn\u2019t believe that. I felt guilty for even thinking it, and was glad \u2014 as I was often glad \u2014 that I was the one person whose thoughts were a mystery to Edward.     I reached for his hand, and sighed when his cold fingers found mine. His touch brought with it the strangest sense of relief \u2014 as if I\u2019d been in pain and that pain had suddenly ceased.  \u201cHey.\u201d I smiled a little at my anticlimactic greeting.  He raised our interlaced fingers to brush my cheek with the back of his hand. \u201cHow was your afternoon?\u201d  \u201cSlow.\u201d  \u201cFor me, as well.\u201d  He pulled my wrist up to his face, our hands still twisted together. His eyes closed as his nose skimmed along the skin there, and he smiled gently without opening them. Enjoying the bouquet while resisting the wine, as he\u2019d once put it.    I knew that the scent of my blood \u2014 so much sweeter to him than any other person\u2019s blood, truly like wine beside water to an alcoholic \u2014 caused him actual pain from the burning thirst it engendered. But he didn\u2019t seem to shy away from it as much as he once had. I could only dimly imagine the Herculean effort behind this simple gesture.",

            "en": "5         5. IMPRINT \u201cAre you okay, Jake?\u00a0 Charlie said you were having a hard time. . . . Isn\u2019t it getting any better?\u201d His warm hand curled around mine. \u201cIt\u2019s not so bad,\u201d he said, but he wouldn\u2019t meet my eyes. He walked slowly back to the driftwood bench, staring at the rainbow-colored pebbles, and pulling me along at his side. I sat back down on our tree, but he sat on the wet, rocky ground rather than next to me. I wondered if it was so that he could hide his face more easily. He kept my hand. I started babbling to fill the silence. \u201cIt\u2019s been so long since I was here. I\u2019ve probably missed a ton of things. How are Sam and Emily? And Embry? Did Quil \u2014?\u201d I broke off mid-sentence, remembering that Jacob\u2019s friend Quil had been a sensitive subject. \u201cAh, Quil,\u201d Jacob sighed. So then it must have happened \u2014 Quil must have joined the pack. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I mumbled. To my surprise, Jacob snorted. \u201cDon\u2019t say that to him.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cQuil\u2019s not looking for pity. Just the opposite \u2014 he\u2019s jazzed. Totally thrilled.\u201d This made no sense to me. All the other wolves had been so depressed at the idea of their friend sharing their fate. \u201cHuh?\u201d Jacob tilted his head back to look at me. He smiled and rolled his eyes.    \u201cQuil thinks it\u2019s the coolest thing that\u2019s ever happened to him. Part of it is finally knowing what\u2019s going on. And he\u2019s excited to have his friends back \u2014 to be part of the \u2018in crowd.\u2019\u201d Jacob snorted again. \u201cShouldn\u2019t be surprised, I guess. It\u2019s so Quil.\u201d \u201cHe likes it?\u201d \u201cHonestly . . . most of them do,\u201d Jacob admitted slowly. \u201cThere are definitely good sides to this \u2014 the speed, the freedom, the strength . . . the sense of \u2014 of family . . . . Sam and I are the only ones who ever felt really bitter. And Sam got past that a long time ago. So I\u2019m the crybaby now.\u201d Jacob laughed at himself. There were so many things I wanted to know. \u201cWhy are you and Sam different? What happened to Sam anyway? What\u2019s his problem?\u201d The questions tumbled out without room to answer them, and Jacob laughed again. \u201cThat\u2019s a long story.\u201d \u201cI told you a long story. Besides, I\u2019m not in any hurry to get back,\u201d I said, and then I grimaced as I thought of the trouble I would be in. He looked up at me swiftly, hearing the double edge in my words. \u201cWill he be mad at you?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d I admitted. \u201cHe really hates it when I do things he considers . . . risky.\u201d \u201cLike hanging out with werewolves.\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d Jacob shrugged. \u201cSo don\u2019t go back. I\u2019ll sleep on the couch.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a great idea,\u201d I grumbled. \u201cBecause then he would come looking for me.\u201d Jacob stiffened, and then smiled bleakly. \u201cWould he?\u201d \u201cIf he was afraid I was hurt or something \u2014 probably.\u201d \u201cMy idea\u2019s sounding better all the time.\u201d \u201cPlease, Jake. That really bugs me.\u201d \u00a0\u201cWhat does?\u201d \u201cThat you two are so ready to kill each other!\u201d I complained. \u201cIt makes me crazy. Why can\u2019t you both just be civilized?\u201d \u201cIs he ready to kill me?\u201d Jacob asked with a grim smile, unconcerned by my anger. \u201cNot like you seem to be!\u201d I realized I was yelling. \u201cAt least he can be a grown-up about this. He knows that hurting you would hurt me \u2014 and so he never would. You don\u2019t seem to care about that at all!\u201d \u201cYeah, right,\u201d Jacob muttered. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s quite the pacifist.\u201d \u201cUgh!\u201d I ripped my hand out of his and shoved his head away. Then I pulled my knees up to my chest and wrapped my arms tightly around them. I glared out toward the horizon, fuming. Jacob was quiet for a few minutes. Finally, he got up off the ground and sat beside me, putting his arm around my shoulders. I shook it off. \u201cSorry,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI\u2019ll try to behave myself.\u201d I didn\u2019t answer. \u201cDo you still want to hear about Sam?\u201d he offered. I shrugged. \u00a0\u201cLike I said, it\u2019s a long story. And very . . . strange. There\u2019re so many strange things about this new life. I haven\u2019t had time to tell you the half of it. And this thing with Sam \u2014 well, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll even be able to explain it right.\u201d His words pricked my curiosity in spite of my irritation. \u201cI\u2019m listening,\u201d I said stiffly. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the side of his face pull up in a smile. \u201cSam had it so much harder than the rest of us. Because he was the first, and he was alone, and he didn\u2019t have anyone to tell him what was happening. Sam\u2019s grandfather died before he was born, and his father has never been around. There was no one there to recognize the signs. The first time it happened \u2014 the first time he phased \u2014 he thought he\u2019d gone insane. It took him two weeks to calm down enough to change back. \u00a0\u201cThis was before you came to Forks, so you wouldn\u2019t remember. Sam\u2019s mother and Leah Clearwater had the forest rangers searching for him, the police. People thought there had been an accident or something. . . .\u201d \u201cLeah?\u201d I asked, surprised. Leah was Harry\u2019s daughter. Hearing her name sent an automatic surge of pity through me. Harry Clearwater, Charlie\u2019s life-long friend, had died of a heart attack this past spring. His voice changed, became heavier. \u201cYeah. Leah and Sam were high school sweethearts. They started dating when she was just a freshman. She was frantic when he disappeared.\u201d \u201cBut he and Emily \u2014\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll get to that \u2014 it\u2019s part of the story,\u201d he said. He inhaled slowly, and then exhaled in a gust. I supposed it was silly for me to imagine that Sam had never loved anyone before Emily. Most people fall in and out of love many times in their lives. It was just that I\u2019d seen Sam with Emily, and I couldn\u2019t imagine him with someone else. The way he looked at her . . . well, it reminded me of a look I\u2019d seen sometimes in Edward\u2019s eyes \u2014 when he was looking at me. \u00a0\u201cSam came back,\u201d Jacob said, \u201cbut he wouldn\u2019t talk to anyone about where he\u2019d been. Rumors flew \u2014 that he was up to no good, mostly. And then Sam happened to run in to Quil\u2019s grandfather one afternoon when Old Quil Ateara came to visit Mrs. Uley. Sam shook his hand. Old Quil just about had a stroke.\u201d Jacob paused to laugh. \u201cWhy?\u201d Jacob put his hand on my cheek and pulled my face around to look at him \u2014 he was leaning toward me, his face was just a few inches away. His palm burned my skin, like he had a fever. \u00a0\u201cOh, right,\u201d I said. It was uncomfortable, having my face so close to his with his hand hot against my skin. \u201cSam was running a temperature.\u201d Jacob laughed again. \u201cSam\u2019s hand felt like he\u2019d left it sitting on a hot stovetop.\u201d He was so close, I could feel his warm breath. I reached up casually, to take his hand away and free my face, but wound my fingers through his so that I wouldn\u2019t hurt his feelings. He smiled and leaned back, undeceived by my attempt at nonchalance. \u201cSo Mr. Ateara went straight to the other elders,\u201d Jacob went on. \u201cThey were the only ones left who still knew, who remembered. Mr. Ateara, Billy, and Harry had actually seen their grandfathers make the change. When Old Quil told them, they met with Sam secretly and explained. \u201cIt was easier when he understood \u2014 when he wasn\u2019t alone anymore. They knew he wouldn\u2019t be the only one affected by the Cullens\u2019 return\u201d \u2014 he pronounced the name with unconscious bitterness \u2014 \u201cbut no one else was old enough. So Sam waited for the rest of us to join him. . . .\u201d  \u201cThe Cullens had no idea,\u201d I said in a whisper. \u201cThey didn\u2019t think that werewolves still existed here. They didn\u2019t know that coming here would change you.\u201d \u201cIt doesn\u2019t change the fact that it did.\u201d \u201cRemind me not to get on your bad side.\u201d \u201cYou think I should be as forgiving as you are? We can\u2019t all be saints and martyrs.\u201d \u201cGrow up, Jacob.\u201d \u00a0\u201cI wish I could,\u201d he murmured quietly. I stared at him, trying to make sense of his response. \u201cWhat?\u201d Jacob chuckled. \u201cOne of those many strange things I mentioned.\u201d \u201cYou . . . can\u2019t . . . grow up?\u201d I said blankly. \u201cYou\u2019re what? Not . . .aging? Is that a joke?\u201d \u201cNope.\u201d He popped his lips on the P. I felt blood flood my face. Tears \u2014 tears of rage \u2014 filled my eyes. My teeth mashed together with an audible grinding sound. \u201cBella? What did I say?\u201d I was on my feet again, my hands balled up into fists, my whole frame shaking. \u201cYou. Are. Not. Aging,\u201d I growled through my teeth. Jacob tugged my arm gently, trying to make me sit. \u201cNone of us are. What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d \u201cAm I the only one who has to get old? I get older every stinking day!\u201d I nearly shrieked, throwing my hands in the air. Some little part of me recognized that I was throwing a Charlie-esque fit, but that rational part was greatly overshadowed by the irrational part. \u201cDamn it! What kind of world is this? Where\u2019s the justice?\u201d \u201cTake it easy, Bella.\u201d \u201cShut up, Jacob. Just shut up! This is so unfair!\u201d \u201cDid you seriously just stamp your foot? I thought girls only did that on TV.\u201d I growled unimpressively. \u201cIt\u2019s not as bad as you seem to think it is. Sit down and I\u2019ll explain.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll stand.\u201d He rolled his eyes. \u201cOkay. Whatever you want. But listen, Iwill get older . . . someday.\u201d \u201cExplain.\u201d He patted the tree. I glowered for a second, but then sat; my temper had burned out as suddenly as it had flared and I\u2019d calmed down enough to realize that I was making a fool of myself. \u201cWhen we get enough control to quit . . . ,\u201d Jacob said. \u201cWhen we stop phasing for a solid length of time, we age again. It\u2019s not easy.\u201d He shook his head, abruptly doubtful. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna take a really long time to learn that kind of restraint, I think. Even Sam\u2019s not there yet. \u2019Course it doesn\u2019t help that there\u2019s a huge coven of vampires right down the road. We can\u2019t even think about quitting when the tribe needs protectors. But you shouldn\u2019t get all bent out of shape about it, anyway, because I\u2019m already older than you, physically at least.\u201d \u00a0\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d \u201cLook at me, Bells. Do I look sixteen?\u201d I glanced up and down his mammoth frame, trying to be unbiased. \u201cNot exactly, I guess.\u201d \u201cNot at all. Because we reach full growth inside of a few months when the werewolf gene gets triggered. It\u2019s one hell of a growth spurt.\u201d He made a face. \u201cPhysically, I\u2019m probably twenty-five or something. So there\u2019s no need for you to freak out about being too old for me for at least another seven years.\u201d Twenty-five or something.The idea messed with my head. But I remembered that growth spurt \u2014 I remembered watching him shoot up and fill out right before my eyes. I remembered how he would look different from one day to the next. . . . I shook my head, feeling dizzy. \u201cSo, did you want to hear about Sam, or did you want to scream at me some more for things that are out of my control?\u201d I took a deep breath. \u201cSorry. Age is a touchy subject for me. That hit a nerve.\u201d Jacob\u2019s eyes tightened, and he looked as if he were trying to decide how to word something. Since I didn\u2019t want to talk about the truly touchy stuff \u2014 my plans for the future, or treaties that might be broken by said plans, I prompted him. \u201cSo once Sam understood what was going on, once he had Billy and Harry and Mr. Ateara, you said it wasn\u2019t so hard anymore. And, like you also said, there are the cool parts. . . .\u201d I hesitated briefly. \u201cWhy does Sam hate them so much? Why does he wish I would hate them?\u201d Jacob sighed. \u201cThis is the really weird part.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a pro at weird.\u201d \u201cYeah, I know.\u201d He grinned before he continued. \u201cSo, you\u2019re right. Sam knew what was going on, and everything was almost okay. In most ways, his life was back to, well, not normal. But better.\u201d Then Jacob\u2019s expression tightened, like something painful was coming. \u201cSam couldn\u2019t tell Leah. We aren\u2019t supposed to tell anyone who doesn\u2019t have to know. And it wasn\u2019t really safe for him to be around her \u2014 but he cheated, just like I did with you. Leah was furious that he wouldn\u2019t tell her what was going on \u2014 where he\u2019d been, where he went at night, why he was always so exhausted \u2014 but they were working it out. They were trying. They really loved each other.\u201d \u201cDid she find out? Is that what happened?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cNo, that wasn\u2019t the problem. Her cousin, Emily Young, came down from the Makah reservation to visit her one weekend.\u201d I gasped. \u201cEmily is Leah\u2019s cousin?\u201d \u201cSecond cousins. They\u2019re close, though. They were like sisters when they were kids.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s . . . horrible. How could Sam . . . ?\u201d I trailed off, shaking my head. \u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t judge him just yet. Did anyone ever tell you . . . Have you ever heard of imprinting ?\u201d \u201cImprinting?\u201d I repeated the unfamiliar word. \u201cNo. What\u2019s that mean?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s one of those bizarre things we have to deal with. It doesn\u2019t happen to everyone. In fact, it\u2019s the rare exception, not the rule. Sam had heard all the stories by then, the stories we all used to think were legends. He\u2019d heard of imprinting, but he never dreamed . . .\u201d \u201cWhat is it?\u201d I prodded. Jacob\u2019s eyes strayed to the ocean. \u201cSam did love Leah. But when he saw Emily, that didn\u2019t matter anymore. Sometimes . . . we don\u2019t exactly know why . . . we find our mates that way.\u201d His eyes flashed back to me, his face reddening. \u201cI mean . . . our soul mates.\u201d \u00a0\u201cWhat way? Love at first sight?\u201d I snickered. Jacob wasn\u2019t smiling. His dark eyes were critical of my reaction. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit more powerful than that. More absolute.\u201d \u201cSorry,\u201d I muttered. \u201cYou\u2019re serious, aren\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cYeah, I am.\u201d \u201cLove at first sight? But more powerful?\u201d My voice still sounded dubious, and he could hear that. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to explain. It doesn\u2019t matter, anyway.\u201d He shrugged indifferently.  \u00a0\u201cYou wanted to know what happened to Sam to make him hate the vampires for changing him, to make him hate himself. And that\u2019s what happened. He broke Leah\u2019s heart. He went back on every promise he\u2019d ever made her. Every day he has to see the accusation in her eyes, and know that she\u2019s right.\u201d He stopped talking abruptly, as if he\u2019d said something he hadn\u2019t meant to. \u201cHow did Emily deal with this? If she was so close to Leah . . . ?\u201d Sam and Emily were utterly right together, two puzzle pieces, shaped for each other exactly. Still . . . how had Emily gotten past the fact that he\u2019d belonged to someone else? Her sister, almost. \u00a0\u201cShe was real angry, in the beginning. But it\u2019s hard to resist that level of commitment and adoration.\u201d Jacob sighed. \u201cAnd then, Sam could tell her everything. There are no rules that can bind you when you find your other half. You know how she got hurt?\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d The story in Forks was that she was mauled by a bear, but I was in on the secret. Werewolves are unstable, Edward had said.The people near them get hurt. \u201cWell, weirdly enough, that was sort of how they resolved things. Sam was so horrified, so sickened by himself, so full of hate for what he\u2019d done. . . . He would have thrown himself under a bus if it would have made her feel better. He might have anyway, just to escape what he\u2019d done. He was shattered. . . . Then, somehow, she was the one comforting him , and after that. . . .\u201d Jacob didn\u2019t finish his thought, and I sensed the story had gotten too personal to share. \u00a0\u201cPoor Emily,\u201d I whispered. \u201cPoor Sam. Poor Leah. . . .\u201d \u201cYeah, Leah got the worst end of the stick,\u201d he agreed. \u201cShe puts on a brave face. She\u2019s going to be a bridesmaid.\u201d I gazed away, toward the jagged rocks that rose from the ocean like stubby broken-off fingers on the south rim of the harbor, while I tried to make sense of it all. I could feel his eyes on my face, waiting for me to say something.   \u201cDid it happen to you?\u201d I finally asked, still looking away. \u201cThis love-at-first-sight thing?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d he answered briskly. \u201cSam and Jared are the only ones.\u201d \u201cHmm,\u201d I said, trying to sound only politely interested. I was relieved, and I tried to explain my reaction to myself. I decided I was just glad he didn\u2019t claim there was some mystical, wolfy connection between the two of us. Our relationship was confusing enough as it was. I didn\u2019t need any more of the supernatural than I already had to deal with. He was quiet, too, and the silence felt a little awkward. My intuition told me that I didn\u2019t want to hear what he was thinking.   \u00a0\u201cHow did that work out for Jared?\u201d I asked to break the silence. \u201cNo drama there. It was just a girl he\u2019d sat next to in school every day for a year and never looked at twice. And then, after he changed, he saw her again and never looked away. Kim was thrilled. She\u2019d had a huge crush on him. She\u2019d had his last name tacked on to the end of hers all over in her diary.\u201d He laughed mockingly. I frowned. \u201cDid Jared tell you that? He shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d  Jacob bit his lip. \u201cI guess I shouldn\u2019t laugh. It was funny, though.\u201d \u201cSome soul mate.\u201d He sighed. \u201cJared didn\u2019t tell us anything on purpose. I already told you this part, remember?\u201d \u201cOh, yeah. You can hear each other\u2019s thoughts, but only when you\u2019re wolves, right?\u201d \u201cRight. Just like your bloodsucker.\u201d He glowered. \u201cEdward,\u201d I corrected. \u00a0\u201cSure, sure. That\u2019s how come I know so much about how Sam felt. It\u2019s not like he would have told us all that if he\u2019d had a choice. Actually, that\u2019s something we all hate.\u201d The bitterness was abruptly harsh in his voice. \u201cIt\u2019s awful. No privacy, no secrets. Everything you\u2019re ashamed of, laid out for everyone to see.\u201d He shuddered. \u201cIt sounds horrible,\u201d I whispered. \u201cIt is sometimes helpful when we need to coordinate,\u201d he said grudgingly. \u201cOnce in a blue moon, when some bloodsucker crosses into our territory. Laurent was fun. And if the Cullens hadn\u2019t gotten in our way last Saturday . . . ugh!\u201d he groaned. \u201cWe could have had her!\u201d His fists clenched into angry balls. I flinched. As much as I worried about Jasper or Emmett getting hurt, it was nothing like the panic I felt at the idea of Jacob going up against Victoria. Emmett and Jasper were the closest thing to indestructible I could imagine. Jacob was still warm, still comparatively human. Mortal. I thought of Jacob facing Victoria, her brilliant hair blowing around her oddly feline face . . . and shuddered. Jacob looked up at me with a curious expression. \u201cBut isn\u2019t it like that for you all the time? Having him in your head?\u201d  \u201cOh, no. Edward\u2019s never in my head. He only wishes.\u201d Jacob\u2019s expression became confused. \u201cHe can\u2019t hear me,\u201d I explained, my voice a tiny bit smug from old habit. \u201cI\u2019m the only one like that, for him. We don\u2019t know why he can\u2019t.\u201d \u201cWeird,\u201d Jacob said. \u201cYeah.\u201d The smugness faded. \u201cIt probably means there\u2019s something wrong with my brain,\u201d I admitted. \u201cI already knew there was something wrong with your brain,\u201d Jacob muttered. \u201cThanks.\u201d The sun broke through the clouds suddenly, a surprise I hadn\u2019t been expecting, and I had to narrow my eyes against the glare off the water. Everything changed color \u2014 the waves turned from gray to blue, the trees from dull olive to brilliant jade, and the rainbow-hued pebbles glittered like jewels. We squinted for a moment, letting our eyes adjust. There were no sounds besides the hollow roar of the waves that echoed from every side of the sheltered harbor, the soft grinding of the stones against each other under the water\u2019s movement, and the cry of gulls high overhead. It was very peaceful. He settled closer to me, so that he was leaning against my arm. He was so warm. After a minute of this, I shrugged out of my rain jacket. He made a little sound of contentment in the back of his throat, and rested his cheek on the top of my head. I could feel the sun heat my skin \u2014 thought it was not quite as warm as Jacob \u2014 and I wondered idly how long it would take me to burn. Absentmindedly, I twisted my right hand to the side, and watched the sunlight glitter subtly off the scar James had left there. \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d he murmured. \u201cThe sun.\u201d \u201cMmm. It\u2019s nice.\u201d \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d I asked. He chuckled to himself. \u201cI was remembering that moronic movie you took me to. And Mike Newton puking all over everything.\u201d I laughed, too, surprised by how time had changed the memory. It used to be one of stress, of confusion. So much had changed that night. . . . And now I could laugh. It was the last night Jacob and I had had before he\u2019d learned the truth about his heritage. The last human memory. An oddly pleasant memory now. \u201cI miss that,\u201d Jacob said. \u201cThe way it used to be so easy . . . uncomplicated. I\u2019m glad I\u2019ve got a good memory.\u201d He sighed. He felt the sudden tension in my body as his words triggered a memory of my own. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked. \u201cAbout that good memory of yours . . .\u201d I pulled away from him so that I could read his face. At the moment, it was confused. \u201cDo you mind telling me what you were doing Monday morning? You were thinking something that bothered Edward.\u201d Bothered wasn\u2019t quite the word for it, but I wanted an answer, so I thought it was best not to start out too severely. Jacob\u2019s face brightened with understanding, and he laughed. \u201cI was just thinking about you. Didn\u2019t like that much, did he?\u201d \u201cMe? What about me?\u201d Jacob laughed, with a harder edge this time. \u201cI was remembering the way you looked that night Sam found you \u2014 I\u2019ve seen it in his head, and it\u2019s like I was there; that memory has always haunted Sam, you know. And then I remembered how you looked the first time you came to my place. I bet you don\u2019t even realize what a mess you were then, Bella. It was weeks before you started to look human again. And I remembered how you always used to have your arms wrapped around yourself, trying to hold yourself together. . . .\u201d Jacob winced, and then shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to remember how sad you were, and it wasn\u2019t my fault. So I figured it would be harder for him. And I thought he ought to get a look at what he\u2019d done.\u201d I smacked his shoulder. It hurt my hand. \u201cJacob Black, don\u2019t you ever do that again! Promise me you won\u2019t.\u201d \u201cNo way. I haven\u2019t had that much fun in months.\u201d \u201cSo help me, Jake \u2014\u201d \u201cOh, get a grip, Bella. When am I ever going to see him again? Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d I got to my feet, and he caught my hand as I started to walk away. I tried to tug free. \u201cI\u2019m leaving, Jacob.\u201d \u201cNo, don\u2019t go yet,\u201d he protested, his hand tightening around mine. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. And . . . okay, I won\u2019t do it again. Promise.\u201d I sighed. \u201cThanks, Jake.\u201d \u201cCome on, we\u2019ll go back to my house,\u201d he said eagerly. \u00a0\u201cActually, I think I really do need to go. Angela <em>Weber</em> is expecting me, and I know Alice is worried. I don\u2019t want to upset her too much.\u201d \u201cBut you just got here!\u201d \u201cIt feels that way,\u201d I agreed. I glared up at the sun, somehow already directly overhead. How had the time passed so quickly? His eyebrows pulled down over his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll see you again,\u201d he said in a hurt voice. \u201cI\u2019ll come back the next time he\u2019s away,\u201d I promised impulsively. \u201cAway?\u201d Jacob rolled his eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s a nice way to describe what he\u2019s doing. Disgusting parasites.\u201d \u201cIf you can\u2019t be nice, I won\u2019t come back at all!\u201d I threatened, trying to pull my hand free. He refused to let go. \u201cAw, don\u2019t be mad,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cKnee-jerk reaction.\u201d \u201cIf I\u2019m going to try to come back again, you\u2019re going to have to get something straight, okay?\u201d He waited. \u201cSee,\u201d I explained. \u201cI don\u2019t care who\u2019s a vampire and who\u2019s a werewolf. That\u2019s irrelevant. You are Jacob, and he is Edward, and I am Bella. And nothing else matters.\u201d His eyes narrowed slightly. \u201cBut I am a werewolf,\u201d he said unwillingly. \u201cAnd he is a vampire,\u201d he added with obvious revulsion. \u201cAnd I\u2019m a Virgo!\u201d I shouted, exasperated. He raised his eyebrows, measuring my expression with curious eyes. Finally, he shrugged. \u201cIf you can really see it that way . . .\u201d \u201cI can. I do.\u201d   \u201cOkay. Just Bella and Jacob. None of those freaky Virgos here.\u201d He smiled at me, the warm, familiar smile that I had missed so much. I felt the answering smile spread across my face. \u201cI\u2019ve really missed you, Jake,\u201d I admitted impulsively. \u201cMe, too,\u201d his smile widened. His eyes were happy and clear, free for once of the angry bitterness. \u201cMore than you know. Will you come back soon?\u201d \u201cAs soon as I can,\u201d I promised.",

            "en": "7          7. NIGHTMARE I told Charlie I had a lot of homework to do, and that I didn't want anything to eat. There was a basketball game on that he was excited about, though of course I had no idea what was special about it, so he wasn't aware of anything unusual in my face or tone. Once in my room, I locked the door. I dug through my desk until I found my old headphones, and I plugged them into my little CD player. I picked up a CD that Phil had given to me for Christmas. It was one of his favorite bands, but they used a little too much bass and shrieking for my tastes. I popped it into place and lay down on my bed. I put on the headphones, hit Play, and turned up the volume until it hurt my ears. I closed my eyes, but the light still intruded, so I added a pillow over the top half of my face. I concentrated very carefully on the music, trying to understand the lyrics, to unravel the complicated drum patterns. By the third time I'd listened through the CD, I knew all the words to the choruses, at least.  I was surprised to find that I really did like the band after all, once I got past the blaring noise. I'd have to thank Phil again.  And it worked. The shattering beats made it impossible for me to think \u2014 which was the whole purpose of the exercise. I listened to the CD again and again, until I was singing along with all the songs, until, finally, I fell asleep. I opened my eyes to a familiar place. Aware in some corner of my consciousness that I was dreaming, I recognized the green light of the forest. I could hear the waves crashing against the rocks somewhere nearby. And I knew that if I found the ocean, I'd be able to see the sun.  I was trying to follow the sound, but then Jacob Black was there, tugging on my hand, pulling me back toward the blackest part of the forest. \"Jacob? What's wrong?\" I asked. His face was frightened as he yanked with all his strength against my resistance; I didn't want to go into the dark. \"Run, Bella, you have to run!\" he whispered, terrified. \"This way, Bella!\" I recognized Mike's voice calling out of the gloomy heart of the trees, but I couldn't see him. \"Why?\" I asked, still pulling against Jacob's grasp, desperate now to find the sun. But Jacob let go of my hand and yelped, suddenly shaking, falling to the dim forest floor. He twitched on the ground as I watched in horror.  \"Jacob!\" I screamed. But he was gone. In his place was a large red-brown wolf with black eyes. The wolf faced away from me, pointing toward the shore, the hair on the back of his shoulders bristling, low growls issuing from between his exposed fangs. \"Bella, run!\" Mike cried out again from behind me. But I didn't turn. I was watching a light coming toward me from the beach. And then Edward stepped out from the trees, his skin faintly glowing, his eyes black and dangerous. He held up one hand and beckoned me to come to him. The wolf growled at my feet. I took a step forward, toward Edward. He smiled then, and his teeth were sharp, pointed. \"Trust me,\" he purred. I took another step. The wolf launched himself across the space between me and the vampire, fangs aiming for the jugular. \"No!\" I screamed, wrenching upright out of my bed. My sudden movement caused the headphones to pull the CD player off the bedside table, and it clattered to the wooden floor. My light was still on, and I was sitting fully dressed on the bed, with my shoes on. I glanced, disoriented, at the clock on my dresser. It was five-thirty in the morning. I groaned, fell back, and rolled over onto my face, kicking off my boots. I was too uncomfortable to get anywhere near sleep, though. I rolled back over and unbuttoned my jeans, yanking them off awkwardly as I tried to stay horizontal. I could feel the braid in my hair, an uncomfortable ridge along the back of my skull. I turned onto my side and ripped the rubber band out, quickly combing through the plaits with my fingers. I pulled the pillow back over my eyes.  It was all no use, of course. My subconscious had dredged up exactly the images I'd been trying so desperately to avoid. I was going to have to face them now. I sat up, and my head spun for a minute as the blood flowed downward. First things first, I thought to myself, happy to put it off as long as possible. I grabbed my bathroom bag. The shower didn't last nearly as long as I hoped it would, though. Even taking the time to blow-dry my hair, I was soon out of things to do in the bathroom. Wrapped in a towel, I crossed back to my room. I couldn't tell if Charlie was still asleep, or if he had already left. I went to look out my window, and the cruiser was gone. Fishing again. I dressed slowly in my most comfy sweats and then made my bed \u2014 something I never did. I couldn't put it off any longer. I went to my desk and switched on my old computer. I hated using the Internet here. My modem was sadly outdated, my free service substandard; just dialing up took so long that I decided to go get myself a bowl of cereal while I waited. I ate slowly, chewing each bite with care. When I was done, I washed the bowl and spoon, dried them, and put them away. My feet dragged as I climbed the stairs. I went to my CD player first, picking it up off the floor and placing it precisely in the center of the table. I pulled out the headphones, and put them away in the desk drawer. Then I turned the same CD on, turning it down to the point where it was background noise.  With another sigh, I turned to my computer. Naturally, the screen was covered in pop-up ads. I sat in my hard folding chair and began closing all the little windows. Eventually I made it to my favorite search engine. I shot down a few more pop-ups and then typed in one word. Vampire. It took an infuriatingly long time, of course. When the results came up, there was a lot to sift through \u2014 everything from movies and TV shows to role-playing games, underground metal, and gothic cosmetic companies. Then I found a promising site \u2014 Vampires A\u2014Z. I waited impatiently for it to load, quickly clicking closed each ad that flashed across the screen. Finally the screen was finished \u2014 simple white background with black text, academic-looking. Two quotes greeted me on the home page: Throughout the vast shadowy world of ghosts and demons there is no figure so terrible, no figure so dreaded and abhorred, yet dight with such fearful fascination, as the vampire, who is himself neither ghost nor demon, but yet who partakes the dark natures and possesses the mysterious and terrible qualities of both. \u2014 Rev. Montague Summers If there is in this world a well-attested account, it is that of the vampires. Nothing is lacking: official reports, affidavits of well-known people, of surgeons, of priests, of magistrates; the judicial proof is most complete. And with all that, who is there who believes in vampires? \u2014 Rousseau The rest of the site was an alphabetized listing of all the different myths of vampires held throughout the world. The first I clicked on, the Danag, was a Filipino vampire supposedly responsible for planting taro on the islands long ago. The myth continued that the Danag worked with humans for many years, but the partnership ended one day when a woman cut her finger and a Danag sucked her wound, enjoying the taste so much that it drained her body completely of blood. I read carefully through the descriptions, looking for anything that sounded familiar, let alone plausible. It seemed that most vampire myths centered around beautiful women as demons and children as victims; they also seemed like constructs created to explain away the high mortality rates for young children, and to give men an excuse for infidelity. Many of the stories involved bodiless spirits and warnings against improper burials. There wasn't much that sounded like the movies I'd seen, and only a very few, like the Hebrew Estrie and the Polish Upier, who were even preoccupied with drinking blood. Only three entries really caught my attention: the Romanian Varacolaci, a powerful undead being who could appear as a beautiful, pale-skinned human, the Slovak Nelapsi, a creature so strong and fast it could massacre an entire village in the single hour after midnight, and one other, the Stregoni benefici. About this last there was only one brief sentence.  Stregoni benefici: An Italian vampire, said to be on the side of goodness, and a mortal enemy of all evil vampires. It was a relief, that one small entry, the one myth among hundreds that claimed the existence of good vampires. Overall, though, there was little that coincided with Jacob's stories or my own observations. I'd made a little catalogue in my mind as I'd read and carefully compared it with each myth. Speed, strength, beauty, pale skin, eyes that shift color; and then Jacob's criteria: blood drinkers, enemies of the werewolf, cold-skinned, and immortal. There were very few myths that matched even one factor. And then another problem, one that I'd remembered from the small number of scary movies that I'd seen and was backed up by today's reading \u2014 vampires couldn't come out in the daytime, the sun would burn them to a cinder. They slept in coffins all day and came out only at night. Aggravated, I snapped off the computer's main power switch, not waiting to shut things down properly. Through my irritation, I felt overwhelming embarrassment. It was all so stupid. I was sitting in my room, researching vampires. What was wrong with me? I decided that most of the blame belonged on the doorstep of the town of Forks \u2014 and the entire sodden Olympic Peninsula, for that matter. I had to get out of the house, but there was nowhere I wanted to go that didn't involve a three-day drive. I pulled on my boots anyway, unclear where I was headed, and went downstairs. I shrugged into my raincoat without checking the weather and stomped out the door.  It was overcast, but not raining yet. I ignored my truck and started east on foot, angling across Charlie's yard toward the ever-encroaching forest. It didn't take long till I was deep enough for the house and the road to be invisible, for the only sound to be the squish of the damp earth under my feet and the sudden cries of the jays. There was a thin ribbon of a trail that led through the forest here, or I wouldn't risk wandering on my own like this. My sense of direction was hopeless; I could get lost in much less helpful surroundings. The trail wound deeper and deeper into the forest, mostly east as far as I could tell. It snaked around the Sitka spruces and the hemlocks, the yews and the maples. I only vaguely knew the names of the trees around me, and all I knew was due to Charlie pointing them out to me from the cruiser window in earlier days. There were many I didn't know, and others I couldn't be sure about because they were so covered in green parasites. I followed the trail as long as my anger at myself pushed me forward. As that started to ebb, I slowed. A few drops of moisture trickled down from the canopy above me, but I couldn't be certain if it was beginning to rain or if it was simply pools left over from yesterday, held high in the leaves above me, slowly dripping their way back to the earth. A recently fallen tree \u2014 I knew it was recent because it wasn't entirely carpeted in moss \u2014 rested against the trunk of one of her sisters, creating a sheltered little bench just a few safe feet off the trail. I stepped over the ferns and sat carefully, making sure my jacket was between the damp seat and my clothes wherever they\u00a0 touched, and leaned my hooded head back against the living tree. This was the wrong place to have come. I should have known, but where else was there to go? The forest was deep green and far too much like the scene in last night's dream to allow for peace of mind. Now that there was no longer the sound of my soggy footsteps, the silence was piercing.  The birds were quiet, too, the drops increasing in frequency, so it must be raining above. The ferns stood higher than my head, now that I was seated, and I knew someone could walk by on the path, three feet away, and not see me. Here in the trees it was much easier to believe the absurdities that embarrassed me indoors. Nothing had changed in this forest for thousands of years, and all the myths and legends of a hundred different lands seemed much more likely in this green haze than they had in my clear-cut bedroom. I forced myself to focus on the two most vital questions I had to answer, but I did so unwillingly.  First, I had to decide if it was possible that what Jacob had said about the Cullens could be true. Immediately my mind responded with a resounding negative. It was silly and morbid to entertain such ridiculous notions. But what, then? I asked myself. There was no rational explanation for how I was alive at this moment. I listed again in my head the things I'd observed myself: the impossible speed and strength, the eye color shifting from black to gold and back again, the inhuman beauty, the pale, frigid skin. And more \u2014 small things that registered slowly \u2014 how they never seemed to eat, the disturbing grace with which they moved. And the way be sometimes spoke, with unfamiliar cadences and phrases that better fit the style of a turn-of-the-century novel than that of a twenty-first-century classroom. He had skipped class the day we'd done blood typing. He hadn't said no to the beach trip till he heard where we were going. He seemed to know what everyone around him was thinking\u2026 except me. He had told me he was the villain, dangerous\u2026 Could the Cullens be vampires? Well, they were something. Something outside the possibility of rational justification was taking place in front of my incredulous eyes. Whether it be Jacob's cold ones or my own superhero theory, Edward Cullen was not\u2026 human. He was something more.  So then \u2014 maybe. That would have to be my answer for now.  And then the most important question of all. What was I going to do if it was true? If Edward was a vampire \u2014 I could hardly make myself think the words \u2014 then what should I do? Involving someone else was definitely out. I couldn't even believe myself; anyone I told would have me committed.  Only two options seemed practical. The first was to take his advice: to be smart, to avoid him as much as possible. To cancel our plans, to go back to ignoring him as far as I was able. To pretend there was an impenetrably thick glass wall between us in the one class where we were forced together. To tell him to leave me alone \u2014 and mean it this time.  I was gripped in a sudden agony of despair as I considered that alternative. My mind rejected the pain, quickly skipping on to the next option. I could do nothing different. After all, if he was something\u2026 sinister, he'd done nothing to hurt me so far. In fact, I would be a dent in Tyler's fender if he hadn't acted so quickly. So quickly, I argued with myself, that it might have been sheer reflexes. But if it was a reflex to save lives, how bad could he be? I retorted. My head spun around in answerless circles. There was one thing I was sure of, if I was sure of anything. The dark Edward in my dream last night was a reflection only of my fear of the word Jacob had spoken, and not Edward himself. Even so, when I'd screamed out in terror at the werewolf's lunge, it wasn't fear for the wolf that brought the cry of \"no\" to my lips. It was fear that he would be harmed \u2014 even as he called to me with sharp-edged fangs, I feared for him. And I knew in that I had my answer. I didn't know if there ever was a choice, really. I was already in too deep. Now that I knew \u2014 if I knew \u2014 I could do nothing about my frightening secret. Because when I thought of him, of his voice, his hypnotic eyes, the magnetic force of his personality, I wanted nothing more than to be with him right now. Even if\u2026 but I couldn't think it. Not here, alone in the darkening forest. Not while the rain made it dim as twilight under the canopy and pattered like footsteps across the matted earthen floor. I shivered and rose quickly from my place of concealment, worried that somehow the path would have disappeared with the rain. But it was there, safe and clear, winding its way out of the dripping green maze. I followed it hastily, my hood pulled close around my face, becoming surprised, as I nearly ran through the trees, at how far I had come. I started to wonder if I was heading out at all, or following the path farther into the confines of the forest. Before I could get too panicky, though, I began to glimpse some open spaces through the webbed branches. And then I could hear a car passing on the street, and I was free, Charlie's lawn stretched out in front of me, the house beckoning me, promising warmth and dry socks. It was just noon when I got back inside. I went upstairs and got dressed for the day, jeans and a t-shirt, since I was staying indoors. It didn't take too much effort to concentrate on my task for the day, a paper on Macbeth that was due Wednesday. I settled into outlining a rough draft contentedly, more serene than I'd felt since\u2026 well, since Thursday afternoon, if I was being honest.  That had always been my way, though. Making decisions was the painful part for me, the part I agonized over. But once the decision was made, I simply followed through \u2014 usually with relief that the choice was made. Sometimes the relief was tainted by despair, like my decision to come to Forks. But it was still better than wrestling with the alternatives.  This decision was ridiculously easy to live with. Dangerously easy.  And so the day was quiet, productive \u2014 I finished my paper before eight. Charlie came home with a large catch, and I made a mental note to pick up a book of recipes for fish while I was in Seattle next week. The chills that flashed up my spine whenever I thought of that trip were no different than the ones I'd felt before I'd taken my walk with Jacob Black. They should be different, I thought. I should be afraid \u2014 I knew I should be, but I couldn't feel the right kind of fear. I slept dreamlessly that night, exhausted from beginning my day so early, and sleeping so poorly the night before. I woke, for the second time since arriving in Forks, to the bright yellow light of a sunny day. I skipped to the window, stunned to see that there was hardly a cloud in the sky, and those there were just fleecy little white puffs that couldn't possibly be carrying any rain. I opened the window \u2014 surprised when it opened silently, without sticking, not having opened it in who knows how many years \u2014 and sucked in the relatively dry air. It was nearly warm and hardly windy at all. My blood was electric in my veins.  Charlie was finishing breakfast when I came downstairs, and he picked up on my mood immediately. \"Nice day out,\" he commented. \"Yes,\" I agreed with a grin. He smiled back, his brown eyes crinkling around the edges. When Charlie smiled, it was easier to see why he and my mother had jumped too quickly into an early marriage. Most of the young romantic he'd been in those days had faded before I'd known him, as the curly brown hair \u2014 the same color, if not the same texture, as mine \u2014 had dwindled, slowly revealing more and more of the shiny skin of his forehead. But when he smiled I could see a little of the man who had run away with Ren\u00e9e when she was just two years older than I was now. I ate breakfast cheerily, watching the dust moats stirring in the sunlight that streamed in the back window. Charlie called out a goodbye, and I heard the cruiser pull away from the house. I hesitated on my way out the door, hand on my rain jacket. It would be tempting fate to leave it home. With a sigh, I folded it over my arm and stepped out into the brightest light I'd seen in months. By dint of much elbow grease, I was able to get both windows in the truck almost completely rolled down. I was one of the first ones to school; I hadn't even checked the clock in my hurry to get outside. I parked and headed toward the seldom-used picnic benches on the south side of the cafeteria. The benches were still a little damp, so I sat on my jacket, glad to have a use for it. My homework was done \u2014 the product of a slow social life \u2014 but there were a few Trig problems I wasn't sure I had right. I took out my book industriously, but halfway through rechecking the first problem I was daydreaming, watching the sunlight play on the red-barked trees. I sketched inattentively along the margins of my homework. After a few minutes, I suddenly realized I'd drawn five pairs of dark eyes staring out of the page at me. I scrubbed them out with the eraser. \"Bella!\" I heard someone call, and it sounded like Mike. I looked around to realize that the school had become populated while I'd been sitting there, absentminded. Everyone was in t-shirts, some even in shorts though the temperature couldn't be over sixty. Mike was coming toward me in khaki shorts and a striped Rugby shirt, waving.  \"Hey, Mike,\" I called, waving back, unable to be halfhearted on a morning like this. He came to sit by me, the tidy spikes of his hair shining golden in the light, his grin stretching across his face. He was so delighted to see me, I couldn't help but feel gratified. \"I never noticed before \u2014 your hair has red in it,\" he commented, catching between his fingers a strand that was fluttering in the light breeze. \"Only in the sun.\" I became just a little uncomfortable as he tucked the lock behind my ear. \"Great day, isn't it?\" \"My kind of day,\" I agreed.  \"What did you do yesterday?\" His tone was just a bit too proprietary. \"I mostly worked on my essay.\" I didn't add that I was finished with it \u2014 no need to sound smug. He hit his forehead with the heel of his hand. \"Oh yeah \u2014 that's due Thursday, right?\" \"Um, Wednesday, I think.\" \"Wednesday?\" He frowned. \"That's not good\u2026 What are you writing yours on?\" \"Whether Shakespeare's treatment of the female characters is misogynistic.\" He stared at me like I'd just spoken in pig Latin. \"I guess I'll have to get to work on that tonight,\" he said, deflated. \"I was going to ask if you wanted to go out.\" \"Oh.\" I was taken off guard. Why couldn't I ever have a pleasant\u00a0 conversation with Mike anymore without it getting awkward? \"Well, we could go to dinner or something\u2026 and I could work on it later.\" He smiled at me hopefully. \"Mike\u2026\" I hated being put on the spot. \"I don't think that would be the best idea.\" His face fell. \"Why?\" he asked, his eyes guarded. My thoughts flickered to Edward, wondering if that's where his thoughts were as well. \"I think\u2026 and if you ever repeat what I'm saying right now I will cheerfully beat you to death,\" I threatened, \"but I think that would hurt Jessica's feelings.\" He was bewildered, obviously not thinking in that direction at all.  \"Jessica?\" \"Really, Mike, are you blind?\" \"Oh,\" he exhaled \u2014 clearly dazed. I took advantage of that to make my escape. \"It's time for class, and I can't be late again.\" I gathered my books up and stuffed them in my bag. We walked in silence to building three, and his expression was distracted. I hoped whatever thoughts he was immersed in were leading him in the right direction. When I saw Jessica in Trig, she was bubbling with enthusiasm. She, Angela, and Lauren were going to Port Angeles tonight to go dress shopping for the dance, and she wanted me to come, too, even though I didn't need one. I was indecisive. It would be nice to get out of town with some girlfriends, but Lauren would be there. And who knew what I could be doing tonight\u2026 But that was definitely the wrong path to let my mind wander down. Of course I was happy about the sunlight. But that wasn't completely responsible for the euphoric mood I was in, not even close. So I gave her a maybe, telling her I'd have to talk with Charlie first. She talked of nothing but the dance on the way to Spanish, continuing as if without an interruption when class finally ended, five minutes late, and we were on our way to lunch. I was far too lost in my own frenzy of anticipation to notice much of what she said. I was painfully eager to see not just him but all the Cullens \u2014 to compare them with the new suspicions that plagued my mind. As I crossed the threshold of the cafeteria, I felt the first true tingle of fear slither down my spine and settle in my stomach. Would they be able to know what I was thinking? And then a different feeling jolted through me \u2014 would Edward be waiting to sit with me again? As was my routine, I glanced first toward the Cullens' table. A shiver of panic trembled in my stomach as I realized it was empty. With dwindling hope, my eyes scoured the rest of the cafeteria, hoping to find him alone, waiting for me. The place was nearly filled \u2014 Spanish had made us late \u2014 but there was no sign of Edward or any of his family. Desolation hit me with crippling strength. I shambled along behind Jessica, not bothering to pretend to listen anymore. We were late enough that everyone was already at our table. I avoided the empty chair next to Mike in favor of one by Angela. I vaguely noticed that Mike held the chair out politely for Jessica, and that her face lit up in response. Angela asked a few quiet questions about the Macbeth paper, which I answered as naturally as I could while spiraling downward in misery. She, too, invited me to go with them tonight, and I agreed now, grasping at anything to distract myself. I realized I'd been holding on to a last shred of hope when I entered Biology, saw his empty seat, and felt a new wave of disappointment. The rest of the day passed slowly, dismally. In Gym, we had a lecture on the rules of badminton, the next torture they had lined up for me. But at least it meant I got to sit and listen instead of stumbling around on the court. The best part was the coach didn't finish, so I got another day off tomorrow. Never mind that the day after they would arm me with a racket before unleashing me on the rest of the class. I was glad to leave campus, so I would be free to pout and mope before I went out tonight with Jessica and company. But right after I walked in the door of Charlie's house, Jessica called to cancel our plans. I tried to be happy that Mike had asked her out to dinner \u2014 I really was relieved that he finally seemed to be catching on \u2014 but my enthusiasm sounded false in my own ears. She rescheduled our shopping trip for tomorrow night. Which left me with little in the way of distractions. I had fish marinating for dinner, with a salad and bread left over from the night before, so there was nothing to do there. I spent a focused half hour on homework, but then I was through with that, too. I checked my e-mail, reading the backlog of letters from my mother, getting snippier as they progressed to the present. I sighed and typed a quick response.  Mom, Sorry. I've been out. I went to the beach with some friends. And I had to write a paper. My excuses were fairly pathetic, so I gave up on that. It's sunny outside today - I know, I'm shocked, too - so I'm going to go outside and soak up as much vitamin D as I can. I love you, Bella. I decided to kill an hour with non-school-related reading. I had a small collection of books that came with me to Forks, the shabbiest volume being a compilation of the works of Jane Austen. I selected that one and headed to the backyard, grabbing a ragged old quilt from the linen cupboard at the top of the stairs on my way down. Outside in Charlie's small, square yard, I folded the quilt in half and laid it out of the reach of the trees' shadows on the thick lawn that would always be slightly wet, no matter how long the sun shone. I lay on my stomach, crossing my ankles in the air, flipping through the different novels in the book, trying to decide which would occupy my mind the most thoroughly. My favorites were Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility. I'd read the first most recently, so I started into Sense and Sensibility, only to remember after I began three that the hero of the story happened to be named Edward. Angrily, I turned to Mansfield Park, but the hero of that piece was named Edmund, and that was just too close. Weren't there any other names available in the late eighteenth century? I snapped the book shut, annoyed, and rolled over onto my back.  I pushed my sleeves up as high as they would go, and closed my eyes. I would think of nothing but the warmth on my skin, I told myself severely. The breeze was still light, but it blew tendrils of my hair around my face, and that tickled a bit. I pulled all my hair over my head, letting it fan out on the quilt above me, and focused again on the heat that touched my eyelids, my cheekbones, my nose, my lips, my forearms, my neck, soaked through my light shirt\u2026 The next thing I was conscious of was the sound of Charlie's cruiser turning onto the bricks of the driveway. I sat up in surprise, realizing the light was gone, behind the trees, and I had fallen asleep. I looked around, muddled, with the sudden feeling that I wasn't alone.  \"Charlie?\" I asked. But I could hear his door slamming in front of the house. I jumped up, foolishly edgy, gathering the now-damp quilt and my book. I ran inside to get some oil heating on the stove, realizing that dinner would be late. Charlie was hanging up his gun belt and stepping out of his boots when I came in. \"Sorry, Dad, dinner's not ready yet \u2014 I fell asleep outside.\" I stifled a yawn. \"Don't worry about it,\" he said. \"I wanted to catch the score on the game, anyway.\" I watched TV with Charlie after dinner, for something to do. There wasn't anything on I wanted to watch, but he knew I didn't like baseball, so he turned it to some mindless sitcom that neither of us enjoyed. He seemed happy, though, to be doing something together. And it felt good, despite my depression, to make him happy. \"Dad,\" I said during a commercial, \"Jessica and Angela are going to look at dresses for the dance tomorrow night in Port Angeles, and they wanted me to help them choose\u2026 do you mind if I go with them?\" \"Jessica Stanley?\" he asked. \"And Angela <em>Weber</em>.\" I sighed as I gave him the details. He was confused. \"But you're not going to the dance, right?\" \"No, Dad, but I'm helping them find dresses \u2014 you know, giving them constructive criticism.\" I wouldn't have to explain this to a woman. \"Well, okay.\" He seemed to realize that he was out of his depth with the girlie stuff. \"It's a school night, though.\" \"We'll leave right after school, so we can get back early. You'll be okay for dinner, right?\" \"Bells, I fed myself for seventeen years before you got here,\" he reminded me. \"I don't know how you survived,\" I muttered, then added more clearly, \"I'll leave some things for cold-cut sandwiches in the fridge, okay? Right on top.\" It was sunny again in the morning. I awakened with renewed hope that I grimly tried to suppress. I dressed for the warmer weather in a deep blue V-neck blouse \u2014 something I'd worn in the dead of winter in Phoenix.  I had planned my arrival at school so that I barely had time to make it to class. With a sinking heart, I circled the full lot looking for a space, while also searching for the silver Volvo that was clearly not there. I parked in the last row and hurried to English, arriving breathless, but subdued, before the final bell.  It was the same as yesterday \u2014 I just couldn't keep little sprouts of hope from budding in my mind, only to have them squashed painfully as I searched the lunchroom in vain and sat at my empty Biology table. The Port Angeles scheme was back on again for tonight and made all the more attractive by the fact that Lauren had other obligations. I was anxious to get out of town so I could stop glancing over my shoulder, hoping to see him appearing out of the blue the way he always did. I vowed to myself that I would be in a good mood tonight and not ruin Angela's or Jessica's enjoyment in the dress hunting. Maybe I could do a little clothes shopping as well. I refused to think that I might be shopping alone in Seattle this weekend, no longer interested in the earlier arrangement. Surely he wouldn't cancel without at least telling me. After school, Jessica followed me home in her old white Mercury so that I could ditch my books and truck. I brushed through my hair quickly when I was inside, feeling a slight lift of excitement as I contemplated getting out of Forks. I left a note for Charlie on the table, explaining again where to find dinner, switched my scruffy wallet from my school bag to a purse I rarely used, and ran out to join Jessica. We went to Angela's house next, and she was waiting for us. My excitement increased exponentially as we actually drove out of the town limits.",

            "en": "3          3. THE END I FELT ABSOLUTELY HIDEOUS IN THE MORNING. I HADN'T slept well; my arm burned and my head ached. It didn't help my outlook that Edward's face was smooth and remote as he kissed my forehead quickly and ducked out my window. I was afraid of the time I'd spent unconscious, afraid that he might have been thinking about right and wrong again while he watched me sleep. The anxiety seemed to ratchet up the intensity of the pounding in my head. Edward was waiting for me at school, as usual, but his face was still wrong. There was something buried in his eyes that I couldn't be sure of\u2014and it scared me. I didn't want to bring up last night, but I wasn't sure if avoiding the subject would be worse. He opened my door for me. \"How do you feel?\u00a0 \" \"Perfect,\" I lied, cringing as the sound of the slamming door echoed in my head. We walked in silence, he shortening his stride to match mine. There were so many questions I wanted to ask, but most of those questions would have to wait, because they were for Alice: How was Jasper this morning?\u00a0 \u00a0What had they said when I was gone?\u00a0 \u00a0What had Rosalie said?\u00a0 \u00a0And most importantly, what could she see happening now in her strange, imperfect visions of the future?\u00a0 \u00a0Could she guess what Edward was thinking, why he was so gloomy?\u00a0 \u00a0Was there a foundation for the tenuous, instinctive fears that I couldn't seem to shake?\u00a0  The morning passed slowly. I was impatient to see Alice, though I wouldn't be able to really talk to her with Edward there. Edward remained aloof. Occasionally he would ask about my arm, and I would lie. Alice usually beat us to lunch; she didn't have to keep pace with a sloth like me. But she wasn't at the table, waiting with a tray of food she wouldn't eat. Edward didn't say anything about her absence. I wondered to myself if her class was running late\u2014until I saw Conner and Ben, who were in her fourth hour French class. \"Where's Alice?\u00a0 \" I asked Edward anxiously. He looked at the granola bar he was slowly pulverizing between his fingertips while he answered. \"She's with Jasper.\" \"Is he okay?\u00a0 \" \"He's gone away for a while.\" \"What?\u00a0 \u00a0Where?\u00a0 \" Edward shrugged. \"Nowhere in particular.\" \"And Alice, too,\" I said with quiet desperation. Of course, if Jasper needed her, she would go.  \"Yes. She'll be gone for a while. She was trying to convince him to go to Denali.\" Denali was where the one other band of unique vampires\u2014good ones like the Cullens\u2014lived. Tanya and her family. I'd heard of them now and again. Edward had run to them last winter when my arrival had made Forks difficult for him. Laurent, the most civilized member of James's little coven, had gone there rather than siding with James against the Cullens. It made sense for Alice to encourage Jasper to go there. I swallowed, trying to dislodge the sudden lump in my throat. The guilt made my head bow and my shoulders slump. I'd run them out of their home, just like Rosalie and Emmett. I was a plague. \"Is your arm bothering you?\u00a0 \" he asked solicitously. \"Who cares about my stupid arm?\u00a0 \" I muttered in disgust. He didn't answer, and I put my head down on the table. By the end of the day, the silence was becoming ridiculous. I didn't want to be the one to break it, but apparently that was my only choice if I ever wanted him to talk to me again. \"You'll come over later tonight?\u00a0 \" I asked as he walked me\u2014silently\u2014to my truck. He always came over. \"Later?\u00a0 \" It pleased me that he seemed surprised. \"I have to work. I had to trade with Mrs. Newton to get yesterday off.\" \"Oh,\" he murmured. \"So you'll come over when I'm home, though, right?\u00a0 \" I hated that I felt suddenly unsure about this. \"If you want me to.\" \"I always want you,\" I reminded him, with perhaps a little more intensity than the conversation required. I expected he would laugh, or smile, or react somehow to my words. \"All right, then,\" he said indifferently. He kissed my forehead again before he shut the door on me. Then he turned his back and loped gracefully toward his car. I was able to drive out of the parking lot before the panic really hit, but I was hyperventilating by the time I got to Newton's. He just needed time, I told myself. He would get over this. Maybe he was sad because his family was disappearing. But Alice and Jasper would come back soon, and Rosalie and Emmett, too. If it would help, I would stay away from the big white house on the river\u2014I'd never set foot there again. That didn't matter. I'd still see Alice at school. She would have to come back for school, right?\u00a0 \u00a0And she was at my place all the time anyway. She wouldn't want to hurt Charlie's feelings by staying away. No doubt I would also run into Carlisle with regularity\u2014in the emergency room. After all, what had happened last night was nothing. Nothing had happened. So I fell down\u2014that was the story of my life. Compared to last spring, it seemed especially unimportant. James had left me broken and nearly dead from loss of blood\u2014and yet Edward had handled the interminable weeks in the hospital much better than this. Was it because, this time, it wasn't an enemy he'd had to protect me from?\u00a0  Because it was his brother?\u00a0  Maybe it would be better if he took me away, rather than his family being scattered. I grew slightly less depressed as I considered all the uninterrupted alone time. If he could just last through the school year, Charlie wouldn't be able to object. We could go away to college, or pretend that's what we were doing, like Rosalie and Emmett this year. Surely Edward could wait a year. What was a year to an immortal?\u00a0 \u00a0It didn't even seem like that much to me. I was able to talk myself into enough composure to handle getting out of the truck and walking to the store. Mike Newton had beaten me here today, and he smiled and waved when I came in. I grabbed my vest, nodding vaguely in his direction. I was still imagining pleasant scenarios that consisted of me running away with Edward to various exotic locales. Mike interrupted my fantasy. \"How was your birthday?\u00a0 \" \"Ugh,\" I mumbled. \"I'm glad it's over.\" Mike looked at me from the corners of his eyes like I was crazy. Work dragged. I wanted to see Edward again, praying that he would be past the worst of this, whatever it was exactly, by the time I saw him again. It's nothing, I told myself over and over again. Everything will go back to normal. The relief I felt when I turned onto my street and saw Edward's silver car parked in front of my house was an overwhelming, heady thing. And it bothered me deeply that it should be that way. I hurried through the front door, calling out before I was completely inside. \"Dad?\u00a0 \u00a0Edward?\u00a0 \" As I spoke, I could hear the distinctive theme music from ESPN's Sports Center coming from the living room. \"In here,\" Charlie called. I hung my raincoat on its peg and hurried around the corner. Edward was in the armchair, my father on the sofa. Both had their eyes trained on the TV. The focus was normal for my father. Not so much for Edward. \"Hi,\" I said weakly. \"Hey, Bella,\" my father answered, eyes never moving. \"We just had cold pizza. I think it's still on the table.\" \"Okay.\" I waited in the doorway. Finally, Edward looked over at me with a polite smile. \"I'll be right behind you,\" he promised. His eyes strayed back to the TV. I stared for another minute, shocked. Neither one seemed to notice. I could feel something, panic maybe, building up in my chest. I escaped to the kitchen. The pizza held no interest for me. I sat in my chair, pulled my knees up, and wrapped my arms around them. Something was very wrong, maybe more wrong than I'd realized. The sounds of male bonding and banter continued from the TV set. I tried to get control of myself, to reason with myself. What's the worst that can happen?\u00a0 \u00a0I flinched. That was definitely the wrong question to ask. I was having a hard time breathing right. Okay, I thought again, what's the worst I can live through?\u00a0 \u00a0I didn't like that question so much, either. But I thought through the possibilities I'd considered today. Staying away from Edward's family. Of course, he wouldn't expect Alice to be part of that. But if Jasper was off limits, that would lessen the time I could have with her. I nodded to myself\u2014I could live with that. Or going away. Maybe he wouldn't want to wait till the end of the school year, maybe it would have to be now. In front of me, on the table, my presents from Charlie and Renee were where I had left them, the camera I hadn't had the chance to use at the Cullens' sitting beside the album. I touched the pretty cover of the scrapbook my mother had given me, and sighed, thinking of Renee. Somehow, living without her for as long as I had did not make the idea of a more permanent separation easier. And Charlie would be left all alone here, abandoned. They would both be so hurt\u2026 But we'd come back, right?\u00a0 \u00a0We'd visit, of course, wouldn't we?\u00a0  I couldn't be certain about the answer to that. I leaned my cheek against my knee, staring at the physical tokens of my parents' love. I'd known this path I'd chosen was going to be hard. And, after all, I was thinking about the worst-case scenario\u2014the very worst I could live through. I touched the scrapbook again, flipping the front cover over. Little metal corners were already in place to hold the first picture. It wasn't a half-bad idea, to make some record of my life here. I felt a strange urge to get started. Maybe I didn't have that long left in Forks. I toyed with the wrist strap on the camera, wondering about the first picture on the roll. Could it possibly turn out anything close to the original?\u00a0 \u00a0I doubted it. But he didn't seem worried that it would be blank. I chuckled to myself, thinking of his carefree laughter last night. The chuckle died away. So much had changed, and so abruptly. It made me feel a little bit dizzy, like I was standing on an edge, a precipice somewhere much too high. I didn't want to think about that anymore. I grabbed the camera and headed up the stairs. My room hadn't really changed all that much in the seventeen years since my mother had been here. The walls were still light blue, the same yellowed lace curtains hung in front of the window. There was a bed, rather than a crib, but she would recognize the quilt draped untidily over the top\u2014it had been a gift from Gran. Regardless, I snapped a picture of my room. There wasn't much else I could do tonight\u2014it was too dark outside\u2014and the feeling was growing stronger, it was almost a\u00a0 compulsion now. I would record everything about Forks before I had to leave it. Change was coming. I could feel it. It wasn't a pleasant prospect, not when life was perfect the way it was. I took my time coming back down the stairs, camera in hand, trying to ignore the butterflies in my stomach as I thought of the strange distance I didn't want to see in Edward's eyes. He would get over this. Probably he was worried that I would be upset when he asked me to leave. I would let him work through it without meddling. And I would be prepared when he asked. I had the camera ready as I leaned around the corner, being sneaky. I was sure there was no chance that I had caught Edward by surprise, but he didn't look up. I felt a brief shiver as something icy twisted in my stomach; I ignored that and took the picture. They both looked at me then. Charlie frowned. Edward's face was empty, expressionless. \"What are you doing, Bella?\u00a0 \" Charlie complained. \"Oh, come on.\" I pretended to smile as I went to sit on the floor in front of the sofa where Charlie lounged. \"You know Mom will be calling soon to ask if I'm using my presents. I have to get to work before she can get her feelings hurt.\" \"Why are you taking pictures of me, though?\u00a0 \" he grumbled. \"Because you're so handsome,\" I replied, keeping it light. \"And because, since you\u00a0 bought the camera, you're obligated to be one of my subjects.\" He mumbled something unintelligible. \"Hey, Edward,\" I said with admirable indifference. \"Take one of me and my dad together.\"  I threw the camera toward him, carefully avoiding his eyes, and knelt beside the arm of the sofa where Charlie's face was. Charlie sighed. \"You need to smile, Bella,\" Edward murmured. I did my best, and the camera flashed. \"Let me take one of you kids,\" Charlie suggested. I knew he was just trying to shift the camera's focus from himself. Edward stood and lightly tossed him the camera. I went to stand beside Edward, and the arrangement felt formal and strange to me. He put one hand lightly on my shoulder, and I wrapped my arm more securely around his waist. I wanted to look at his face, but I was afraid to. \"Smile, Bella,\" Charlie reminded me again. I took a deep breath and smiled. The flash blinded me. \"Enough pictures for tonight,\" Charlie said then, shoving the camera into a crevice of the sofa cushions and rolling over it. \"You don't have to use the whole roll now.\" Edward dropped his hand from my shoulder and twisted casually out of my arm. He sat back down in the armchair. I hesitated, and then went to sit against the sofa again. I was suddenly so frightened that my hands were shaking. I pressed them into my stomach to hide them, put my chin on my knees and stared at the TV screen in front of me, seeing nothing. When the show ended, I hadn't moved an inch. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Edward stand. \"I'd better get home,\" he said. Charlie didn't look up from the commercial. \"See ya.\" I got awkwardly to my feet\u2014I was stiff from sitting so still\u2014and followed Edward out the front door. He went straight to his car. \"Will you stay?\u00a0 \" I asked, no hope in my voice. I expected his answer, so it didn't hurt as much. \"Not tonight.\" I didn't ask for a reason. He got in his car and drove away while I stood there, unmoving. I barely noticed that it was raining. I waited, without knowing what I waited for, until the door opened behind me. \"Bella, what are you doing?\u00a0 \" Charlie asked, surprised to see me standing there alone and dripping. \"Nothing.\" I turned and trudged back to the house. It was a long night, with little in the way of rest. I got up as soon as there was a faint light outside my window. I dressed for school mechanically, waiting for the clouds to brighten. When I had eaten a bowl of cereal, I decided that it was light enough for pictures. I took one of my truck, and then the front of the house. I turned and snapped a few of the forest by Charlie's house. Funny how it didn't seem sinister like it used to. I realized I would miss this\u2014the green, the timelessness, the mystery of the woods. All of it. I put the camera in my school bag before I left. I tried to concentrate on my new project rather than the fact that Edward apparently hadn't gotten over things during the night. Along with the fear, I was beginning to feel impatience. How long could this last?\u00a0  It lasted through the morning. He walked silently beside me, never seeming to actually look at me. I tried to concentrate on my classes, but not even English could hold my attention. Mr. Berty had to repeat his question about Lady Capulet twice before I realized he was talking to me. Edward whispered the correct answer under his breath and then went back to ignoring me. At lunch, the silence continued. I felt like I was going to start screaming at any moment, so, to distract myself, I leaned across the table's invisible line and spoke to Jessica. \"Hey, Jess?\u00a0 \" \"What's up, Bella?\u00a0 \" \"Could you do me a favor?\u00a0 \" I asked, reaching into my bag. \"My mom wants me to get some pictures of my friends for a scrapbook. So, take some pictures of everybody, okay?\u00a0 \" I handed her the camera. \"Sure,\" she said, grinning, and turned to snap a candid shot of Mike with his mouth full. A predictable picture war ensued. I watched them hand the camera around the table, giggling and flirting and complaining about being on film. It seemed strangely childish. Maybe I just wasn't in the mood for normal human behavior today. \"Uh-oh,\" Jessica said apologetically as she returned the camera. \"I think we used all your film.\" \"That's okay. I think I already got pictures of everything else I needed.\" After school, Edward walked me back to the parking lot in silence. I had to work again, and for once, I was glad. Time with me obviously wasn't helping things. Maybe time alone would be better. I dropped my film off at the Thriftway on my way to Newton's, and then picked up the developed pictures after work. At home, I said a brief hi to Charlie, grabbed a granola bar from the kitchen, and hurried up to my room with the envelope of photographs tucked under my arm. I sat in the middle of my bed and opened the envelope with wary curiosity. Ridiculously, I still half expected the first print to be a blank. When I pulled it out, I gasped aloud. Edward looked just as beautiful as he did in real life, staring at me out of the picture with the warm eyes I'd missed for the past few days. It was almost uncanny that anyone could look so\u2026 so\u2026 beyond description. No thousand words could equal this picture. I flipped through the rest of the stack quickly once, and then laid three of them out on the bed side by side. The first was the picture of Edward in the kitchen, his warm eyes touched with tolerant amusement. The second was Edward and Charlie, watching ESPN. The difference in Edward's expression was severe. His eyes were careful here, reserved. Still breathtakingly beautiful, but his face was colder, more like a sculpture, less alive. The last was the picture of Edward and me standing awkwardly side by side. Edward's face was the same as the last, cold and statue-like. But that wasn't the most troubling part of this photograph. The contrast between the two of us was painful. He looked like a god. I looked very average, even for a human, almost shamefully plain. I flipped the picture over with a feeling of disgust. Instead of doing my homework, I stayed up to put my pictures into the album. With a ballpoint pen I scrawled captions under all the pictures, the names and the dates. I got to the picture of Edward and me, and, without looking at it too long, I folded it in half and stuck it under the metal tab, Edward-side up. When I was done, I stuffed the second set of prints in a fresh envelope and penned a long thank-you letter to Renee. Edward still hadn't come over. I didn't want to admit that he was the reason I'd stayed up so late, but of course he was. I tried to remember the last time he'd stayed away like this, without an excuse, a phone call\u2026 He never had. Again, I didn't sleep well. School followed the silent, frustrating, terrifying pattern of the last two days. I felt relief when I saw Edward waiting for me in the parking lot, but it faded quickly. He was no different, unless maybe more remote. It was hard to even remember the reason for all this mess. My birthday already felt like the distant past. If only Alice would come back. Soon. Before this got any more out of hand.  But I couldn't count on that. I decided that, if I couldn't talk to him today, really talk, then I was going to see Carlisle tomorrow. I had to do something. After school, Edward and I were going to talk it out, I promised myself. I wasn't accepting any excuses. He walked me to my truck, and I steeled myself to make my demands. \"Do you mind if I come over today?\u00a0 \" he asked before we got to the truck, beating me to the punch. \"Of course not.\" \"Now?\u00a0 \" he asked again, opening my door for me. \"Sure,\" I kept my voice even, though I didn't like the urgency in his tone. \"I was just going to drop a letter for Renee in the mailbox on the way. I'll meet you there.\" He looked at the fat envelope on the passenger seat. Suddenly, he reached over me and snagged it. \"I'll do it,\" he said quietly. \"And I'll still beat you there.\" He smiled my favorite crooked smile, but it was wrong. It didn't reach his eyes. \"Okay,\" I agreed, unable to smile back. He shut the door, and headed toward his car. He did beat me home. He was parked in Charlie's spot when I pulled up in front of the house. That was a bad sign. He didn't plan to stay, then. I shook my head and took a deep breath, trying to locate some courage. He got out of his car when I stepped out of the truck, and came to meet me. He reached to take my book bag from me. That was normal. But he shoved it back onto the seat. That was not normal. \"Come for a walk with me,\" he suggested in an unemotional voice, taking my hand. I didn't answer. I couldn't think of a way to protest, but I instantly knew that I wanted to. I didn't like this. This is bad, this is very bad, the voice in my head repeated again and again. But he didn't wait for an answer. He pulled me along toward the east side of the yard, where the forest encroached. I followed unwillingly, trying to think through the panic. It was what I wanted, I reminded myself. The chance to talk it all through. So why was the panic choking me?\u00a0  We'd gone only a few steps into the trees when he stopped. We were barely on the trail\u2014I could still see the house. Some walk. Edward leaned against a tree and stared at me, his expression unreadable. \"Okay, let's talk,\" I said. It sounded braver than it felt. He took a deep breath. \"Bella, we're leaving.\" I took a deep breath, too. This was an acceptable option. I thought I was prepared. But I still had to ask. \"Why now?\u00a0 \u00a0Another year\u2014\" \"Bella, it's time. How much longer could we stay in Forks, after all?\u00a0 \u00a0Carlisle can barely pass for thirty, and he's claiming thirty-three now. We'd have to start over soon regardless.\" His answer confused me. I thought the point of leaving was to let his family live in peace. Why did we have to leave if they were going?\u00a0 \u00a0I stared at him, trying to understand what he meant. He stared back coldly. With a roll of nausea, I realized I'd misunderstood. \"When you say we\u2014,\" I whispered. \"I mean my family and myself.\" Each word separate and distinct. I shook my head back and forth mechanically, trying to clear it. He waited without any sign of impatience. It took a few minutes before I could speak. \"Okay,\" I said. \"I'll come with you.\" \"You can't, Bella. Where we're going\u2026 It's not the right place for you.\" \"Where you are is the right place for me.\" \"I'm no good for you, Bella.\" \"Don't be ridiculous.\" I wanted to sound angry, but it just sounded like I was begging. \"You're the very best part of my life.\" \"My world is not for you,\" he said grimly. \"What happened with Jasper\u2014that was nothing, Edward! Nothing!\" \"You're right,\" he agreed. \"It was exactly what was to be expected.\" \"You promised! In Phoenix, you promised that you would stay\u2014\" \"As long as that was best for you,\" he interrupted to correct me. \"No! This is about my soul, isn't it?\u00a0 \" I shouted, furious, the words exploding out of me\u2014somehow it still sounded like a plea. \"Carlisle told me about that, and I don't care,\u00a0 Edward. I don't care! You can have my soul. I don't want it without you\u2014it's yours already!\" He took a deep breath and stared, unseeingly, at the ground for a long moment. His mouth twisted the tiniest bit. When he finally looked up, his eyes were different, harder\u2014like the liquid gold had frozen solid. \"Bella, I don't want you to come with me.\" He spoke the words slowly and precisely, his cold eyes on my face, watching as I absorbed what he was really saying. There was a pause as I repeated the words in my head a few times, sifting through them for their real intent. \"You\u2026 don't\u2026 want me?\u00a0 \" I tried out the words, confused by the way they sounded, placed in that order. \"No.\" I stared, uncomprehending, into his eyes. He stared back without apology. His eyes were like topaz\u2014hard and clear and very deep. I felt like I could see into them for miles and miles, yet nowhere in their bottomless depths could I see a contradiction to the word he'd spoken. \"Well, that changes things.\" I was surprised by how calm and reasonable my voice sounded. It must be because I was so numb. I couldn't realize what he was telling me. It still didn't make any sense. He looked away into the trees as he spoke again. \"Of course, I'll always love you\u2026 in a way. But what happened the other night made me realize that it's time for a change. Because I'm\u2026 tired of pretending to be something I'm not, Bella. I am not human.\" He looked back, and the icy planes of his perfect face were not human. \"I've let this go on much too long, and I'm sorry for that.\" \"Don't.\" My voice was just a whisper now; awareness was beginning to seep through me, trickling like acid through my veins. \"Don't do this.\" He just stared at me, and I could see from his eyes that my words were far too late. He already had.  \"You're not good for me, Bella.\" He turned his earlier words around, and so I had no argument. How well I knew that I wasn't good enough for him. I opened my mouth to say something, and then closed it again. He waited patiently, his face wiped clean of all emotion. I tried again. \"If\u2026 that's what you want.\" He nodded once. My whole body went numb. I couldn't feel anything below the neck. \"I would like to ask one favor, though, if that's not too much,\" he said. I wonder what he saw on my face, because something flickered across his own face in response. But, before I could identify it, he'd composed his features into the same serene mask. \"Anything,\" I vowed, my voice faintly stronger. As I watched, his frozen eyes melted. The gold became liquid again, molten, burning down into mine with an intensity that was overwhelming. \"Don't do anything reckless or stupid,\" he ordered, no longer detached. \"Do you understand what I'm saying?\u00a0 \" I nodded helplessly. His eyes cooled, the distance returned. \"I'm thinking of Charlie, of course. He needs you. Take care of yourself\u2014for him.\" I nodded again. \"I will,\" I whispered. He seemed to relax just a little. \"And I'll make you a promise in return,\" he said. \"I promise that this will be the last time you'll see me. I won't come back. I won't put you through anything like this again. You can go on with your life without any more interference from me. It will be as if I'd never existed.\" My knees must have started to shake, because the trees were suddenly wobbling. I could hear the blood pounding faster than normal behind my ears. His voice sounded farther away. He smiled gently. \"Don't worry. You're human\u2014your memory is no more than a sieve. Time heals all wounds for your kind.\" \"And your memories?\u00a0 \" I asked. It sounded like there was something stuck in my throat, like I was choking. \"Well\"\u2014he hesitated for a short second\u2014\"I won't forget. But my kind\u2026 we're very easily distracted.\" He smiled; the smile was tranquil and it did not touch his eyes. He took a step away from me. \"That's everything, I suppose. We won't bother you again.\" The plural caught my attention. That surprised me; I would have thought I was beyond noticing anything. \"Alice isn't coming back,\" I realized. I don't know how he heard me\u2014the words made no sound\u2014but he seemed to understand. He shook his head slowly, always watching my face. \"No. They're all gone. I stayed behind to tell you goodbye.\" \"Alice is gone?\u00a0 \" My voice was blank with disbelief. \"She wanted to say goodbye, but I convinced her that a clean break would be better for you.\" I was dizzy; it was hard to concentrate. His words swirled around in my head, and I heard the doctor at the hospital in Phoenix, last spring, as he showed me the X-rays. You can see it's a clean break, his finger traced along the picture of my severed bone. That's good. It will heal more easily, more quickly. I tried to breathe normally. I needed to concentrate, to find a way out of this nightmare. \"Goodbye, Bella,\" he said in the same quiet, peaceful voice. \"Wait!\" I choked out the word, reaching for him, willing my deadened legs to carry me forward. I thought he was reaching for me, too. But his cold hands locked around my wrists and pinned them to my sides. He leaned down, and pressed his lips very lightly to my forehead for the briefest instant. My eyes closed. \"Take care of yourself,\" he breathed, cool against my skin. There was a light, unnatural breeze. My eyes flashed open. The leaves on a small vine maple shuddered with the gentle wind of his passage. He was gone. With shaky legs, ignoring the fact that my action was useless, I followed him into the forest. The evidence of his path had disappeared instantly. There were no footprints, the leaves were still again, but I walked forward without thinking. I could not do anything else. I had to keep moving. If I stopped looking for him, it was over. Love, life, meaning\u2026 over. I walked and walked. Time made no sense as I pushed slowly through the thick undergrowth. It was hours passing, but also only seconds. Maybe it felt like time had frozen because the forest looked the same no matter how far I went. I started to worry that I was traveling in a circle, a very small circle at that, but I kept going. I stumbled often, and, as it grew darker and darker, I fell often, too. Finally, I tripped over something\u2014it was black now, I had no idea what caught my foot\u2014and I stayed down. I rolled onto my side, so that I could breathe, and curled up on the wet bracken. As I lay there, I had a feeling that more time was passing than I realized. I couldn't remember how long it had been since nightfall. Was it always so dark here at night?\u00a0 \u00a0Surely, as a rule, some little bit of moonlight would filter down through the clouds, through the chinks in the canopy of trees, and find the ground. Not tonight. Tonight the sky was utterly black. Perhaps there was no moon tonight\u2014a lunar eclipse, a new moon. A new moon. I shivered, though I wasn't cold. It was black for a long time before I heard them calling. Someone was shouting my name. It was muted, muffled by the wet growth that surrounded me, but it was definitely my name. I didn't recognize the voice. I thought about answering, but I was dazed, and it took a long time to come to the conclusion that I should answer. By then, the calling had stopped. Sometime later, the rain woke me up. I don't think I'd really fallen asleep; I was just lost in an unthinking stupor, holding with all my strength to the numbness that kept me from realizing what I didn't want to know. The rain bothered me a little. It was cold. I unwrapped my arms from around my legs to cover my face.  It was then that I heard the calling again. It was farther away this time, and sometimes it sounded like several voices were calling at once. I tried to breathe deeply. I remembered that I should answer, but I didn't think they would be able to hear me. Would I be able to shout loud enough?\u00a0  Suddenly, there was another sound, startlingly close. A kind of snuffling, an animal sound. It sounded big. I wondered if I should feel afraid. I didn't\u2014just numb. It didn't matter. The snuffling went away. The rain continued, and I could feel the water pooling up against my cheek. I was trying to gather the strength to turn my head when I saw the light. At first it was just a dim glow reflecting off the bushes in the distance. It grew brighter and brighter, illuminating a large space unlike the focused beam of a flashlight. The light broke through the closest brush, and I could see that it was a propane lantern, but that was all I could see\u2014the brightness blinded me for a moment. \"Bella.\" The voice was deep and unfamiliar, but full of recognition. He wasn't calling my name to search, he was acknowledging that I was found. I stared up\u2014impossibly high it seemed\u2014at the dark face that I could now see above me. I was vaguely aware that the stranger probably only looked so tall because my head was still on the ground. \"Have you been hurt?\u00a0 \" I knew the words meant something, but I could only stare, bewildered. How could the meaning matter at this point?\u00a0  \"Bella, my name is Sam Uley.\" There was nothing familiar about his name. \"Charlie sent me to look for you.\" Charlie?\u00a0 \u00a0That struck a chord, and I tried to pay more attention to what he was saying. Charlie mattered, if nothing else did. The tall man held out a hand. I gazed at it, not sure what I was supposed to do. His black eyes appraised me for a second, and then he shrugged. In a quick and supple notion, he pulled me up from the ground and into his arms. I hung there, limp, as he loped swiftly through the wet forest. Some part of me knew this should upset me\u2014being carried away by a stranger. But there was nothing left in me to upset. It didn't seem like too much time passed before there were lights and the deep babble of many male voices. Sam Uley slowed as he approached the commotion. \"I've got her!\" he called in a booming voice. The babble ceased, and then picked up again with more intensity. A confusing swirl of faces moved over me. Sam's voice was the only one that made sense in the chaos, perhaps because my ear was against his chest. \"No, I don't think she's hurt,\" he told someone. \"She just keeps saying 'He's gone.' \" \u00a0Was I saying that out loud?\u00a0 \u00a0I bit down on my lip. \"Bella, honey, are you all right?\u00a0 \" That was one voice I would know anywhere\u2014even distorted, as it was now, with worry. \"Charlie?\u00a0 \" My voice sounded strange and small. \"I'm right here, baby.\" There was a shifting under me, followed by the leathery smell of my dad's sheriff jacket. Charlie staggered under my weight. \"Maybe I should hold on to her,\" Sam Uley suggested. \"I've got her,\" Charlie said, a little breathless. He walked slowly, struggling. I wished I could tell him to put me down and let me walk, but I couldn't find my voice. There were lights everywhere, held by the crowd walking with him. It felt like a parade. Or a funeral procession. I closed my eyes. \"We're almost home now, honey,\" Charlie mumbled now and then. I opened my eyes again when I heard the door unlock. We were on the porch of our house, and the tall dark man named Sam was holding the door for Charlie, one arm extended toward us, as if he was preparing to catch me when Charlie's arms failed. But Charlie managed to get me through the door and to the couch in the living room. \"Dad, I'm all wet,\" I objected feebly. \"That doesn't matter.\" His voice was gruff. And then he was talking to someone else. \"Blankets are in the cupboard at the top of the stairs.\" \"Bella?\u00a0 \" a new voice asked. I looked at the gray-haired man leaning over me, and recognition came after a few slow seconds. \"Dr. Gerandy?\u00a0 \" I mumbled. \"That's right, dear,\" he said. \"Are you hurt, Bella?\u00a0 \" It took me a minute to think that through. I was confused by the memory of Sam Uley's similar question in the woods. Only Sam had asked something else: Have you been hurt?\u00a0 \u00a0he'd said. The difference seemed significant somehow. Dr. Gerandy was waiting. One grizzled eyebrow rose, and the wrinkles on his forehead deepened.  \"I'm not hurt,\" I lied. The words, were true enough for what he'd asked. His warm hand touched my forehead, and his fingers pressed against the inside of my wrist. I watched his lips as he counted to himself, his eyes on his watch. \"What happened to you?\u00a0 \" he asked casually. I froze under his hand, tasting panic in the back of my throat. \"Did you get lost in the woods?\u00a0 \" he prodded. I was aware of several other people listening. Three tall men with dark faces\u2014from La Push, the Quileute Indian reservation down on the coastline, I guessed\u2014Sam Uley among them, were standing very close together and staring at me. Mr. Newton was there with Mike and Mr. <em>Weber</em>, Angela's father; they all were watching me more surreptitiously than the strangers. Other deep voices rumbled from the kitchen and outside the front door. Half the town must have been looking for me. Charlie was the closest. He leaned in to hear my answer. \"Yes,\" I whispered. \"I got lost.\" The doctor nodded, thoughtful, his fingers probing gently against the glands under my jaw. Charlie's face hardened. \"Do you feel tired?\u00a0 \" Dr. Gerandy asked. I nodded and closed my eyes obediently. \"I don't think there's anything wrong with her,\" I heard the doctor mutter to Charlie after a moment. \"Just exhaustion. Let her sleep it off, and I'll come check on her tomorrow,\" he paused. He must have looked at his watch, because he added, \"Well, later today actually.\" There was a creaking sound as they both pushed off from the couch to get to their feet. \"Is it true?\u00a0 \" Charlie whispered. Their voices were farther away now. I strained to hear. \"Did they leave?\u00a0 \" \"Dr. Cullen asked us not to say anything,\" Dr. Gerandy answered. \"The offer was very sudden; they had to choose immediately. Carlisle didn't want to make a big production out of leaving.\" \"A little warning might have been nice,\" Charlie grumbled. Dr. Gerandy sounded uncomfortable when he replied. \"Yes, well, in this situation, some warning might have been called for.\" I didn't want to listen anymore. I felt around for the edge of the quilt someone had laid on top of me, and pulled it over my ear. I drifted in and out of alertness. I heard Charlie whisper thanks to the volunteers as, one by one, they left. I felt his fingers on my forehead, and then the weight of another blanket. The phone rang a few times, and he hurried to catch it before it could wake me. He muttered reassurances in a low voice to the callers. \"Yeah, we found her. She's okay. She got lost. She's fine now,\" he said again and again. I heard the springs in the armchair groan when he settled himself in for the night. A few minutes later, the phone rang again. Charlie moaned as he struggled to his feet, and then he rushed, stumbling, to the kitchen I pulled my head deeper under the blankets, not wanting to listen to the same conversation again. \"Yeah,\" Charlie said, and yawned. His voice changed, it was much more alert when he spoke again. \"Where?\u00a0 '\" There was a pause. \"You're sure it's outside the reservation?\u00a0 \" Another short pause. \"But what could be burning out there?\u00a0 \" He sounded both worried and mystified. \"Look, I'll call down there and check it out.\" I listened with more interest as he punched in a number. \"Hey, Billy, it's Charlie\u2014sorry I'm calling so early\u2026 no, she's fine. She's sleeping\u2026 Thanks, but that's not why I called. I just got a call from Mrs. Stanley, and she says that from her second-story window she can see fires out on the sea cliffs, but I didn't really\u2026 Oh!\" Suddenly there was an edge in his voice\u2014irritation\u2026 or anger. \"And why are they doing that?\u00a0 \u00a0Uh huh. Really?\u00a0 \" He said it sarcastically. \"Well, don't apologize to me. Yeah, yeah. Just make sure the flames don't spread\u2026 I know, I know, I'm surprised they got them lit at all in this weather.\" Charlie hesitated, and then added grudgingly. \"Thanks for sending Sam and the other boys up. You were right\u2014they do know the forest better than we do. It was Sam who found her, so I owe you one\u2026 Yeah, I'll talk to you later,\" he agreed, still sour, before hanging up. Charlie muttered something incoherent as he shuffled back to the living room. \"What's wrong?\u00a0 \" I asked. He hurried to my side. \"I'm sorry I woke you, honey.\" \"Is something burning?\u00a0 \" \"It's nothing,\" he assured me. \"Just some bonfires out on the cliffs.\" \"Bonfires?\u00a0 \" I asked. My voice didn't sound curious. It sounded dead. Charlie frowned. \"Some of the kids from the reservation being rowdy,\" he explained. \"Why?\u00a0 \" I wondered dully. I could tell he didn't want to answer. He looked at the floor under his knees. \"They're celebrating the news.\" His tone was bitter. There was only one piece of news I could think of, try as I might not to. And then the pieces snapped together. \"Because the Cullens left,\" I whispered. \"They don't like the Cullens in La Push\u2014I'd forgotten about that.\" The Quileutes had their superstitions about the \"cold ones,\" the blood-drinkers that were enemies to their tribe, just like they had their legends of the great flood and wolf-men ancestors. Just stories, folklore, to most of them. Then there were the few that believed. Charlie's good friend Billy Black believed, though even Jacob, his own son, thought he was full of stupid superstitions. Billy had warned me to stay away from the Cullens\u2026 The name stirred something inside me, something that began to claw its way toward the surface, something I knew I didn't want to face. \"It's ridiculous,\" Charlie spluttered. We sat in silence for a moment. The sky was no longer black outside the window. Somewhere behind the rain, the sun was beginning to rise. \"Bella?\u00a0 \" Charlie asked. I looked at him uneasily. \"He left you alone in the woods?\u00a0 \" Charlie guessed. I deflected his question. \"How did you know where to find me?\u00a0 \" My mind shied away from the inevitable awareness that was coming, coming quickly now. \"Your note,\" Charlie answered, surprised. He reached into the back pocket of his jeans and pulled out a much-abused piece of paper. It was dirty and damp, with multiple creases from being opened and refolded many times. He unfolded it again, and held it up as evidence. The messy handwriting was remarkably close to my own. Going for a walk with Edward, up the path, it said. Back soon, B. \"When you didn't come back, I called the Cullens, and no one answered,\" Charlie said in a low voice. \"Then I called the hospital, and Dr. Gerandy told me that Carlisle was gone.\" \"Where did they go?\u00a0 \" I mumbled. He stared at me. \"Didn't Edward tell you?\u00a0 \" I shook my head, recoiling. The sound of his name unleashed the thing that was clawing inside of me\u2014a pain that knocked me breathless, astonished me with its force. Charlie eyed me doubtfully as he answered. \"Carlisle took a job with a big hospital in Los Angeles. I guess they threw a lot of money at him.\" Sunny L.A. The last place they would really go. I remembered my nightmare with the mirror\u2026 the bright sunlight shimmering off of his skin\u2014 Agony ripped through me with the memory of his face. \"I want to know if Edward left you alone out there in the middle of the woods,\" Charlie insisted. His name sent another wave of torture through me. I shook my head, frantic, desperate to escape the pain. \"It was my fault. He left me right here on the trail, in sight of the house\u2026 but I tried to follow him.\" Charlie started to say something; childishly, I covered my ears. \"I can't talk about this anymore, Dad. I want to go to my room.\" Before he could answer, I scrambled up from the couch and lurched my way up the stairs. Someone had been in the house to leave a note for Charlie, a note that would lead him to find me. From the minute that I'd realized this, a horrible suspicion began to grow in my head. I rushed to my room, shutting and locking the door behind me before I ran to the CD player by my bed. Everything looked exactly the same as I'd left it. I pressed down on the top of the CD player. The latch unhooked, and the lid slowly swung open. It was empty. The album Renee had given me sat on the floor beside the bed, just where I'd put it last. I lifted the cover with a shaking hand. I didn't have to flip any farther than the first page. The little metal corners no longer held a picture in place. The page was blank except for my own handwriting scrawled across the bottom: Edward Cullen, Charlie's kitchen, Sept. 13th. I stopped there. I was sure that he would have been very thorough. It will be as if I'd never existed, he'd promised me. I felt the smooth wooden floor beneath my knees, and then the palms of my hands, and then it was pressed against the skin of my cheek. I hoped that I was fainting, but, to my disappointment, I didn't lose consciousness. The waves of pain that had only lapped at me before now reared high up and washed over my head, pulling me under. I did not resurface.  OCTOBER NOVEMBER DECEMBER JANUARY",
