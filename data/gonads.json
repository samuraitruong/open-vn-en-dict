Though they\u2019re the second most poisonous vertebrate on the planet (after the golden arrow dart frog), they\u2019re arguably more dangerous as their neurotoxin, called tetrodoxin, is found in the fish\u2019s skin, muscle tissue, liver, kidneys, and <em>gonads</em>, all of which must be avoided\u2026when preparing the creature for human consumption. Indeed, while wild encounters are certainly dangerous, the risk of death from a puffer fish increases when eating it in countries like Japan, where it is considered a delicacy known as\u00a0fugu\u00a0and can only be prepared by trained, licensed chefs\u2014even then, accidental deaths from ingestion occur\u00a0several times each year. The tetrodoxin is up to 1,200 times more poisonous than that of cyanide, and can cause deadening of the tongue and lips, dizziness, vomiting, arrhythmia, difficulty breathing, muscle paralysis and, if left untreated, death.",
