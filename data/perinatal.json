One in 10 new fathers may have the baby blues, US researchers believe - based on their trawl of medical literature While this rate is lower than in new mothers, it is more than currently recognised, they told the Journal of the American Medical Association . Lack of sleep and new responsibilities, or supporting a wife with post-natal depression can be triggers, they say. The Eastern Virginia Medical School team based their findings on 43 studies involving 28,004 parents from 16 different countries including the UK and the US. They found new fathers were generally happiest in the early weeks after the birth of their baby, with depression kicking in after three to six months By this time, at least 10% and up to 25% had post-natal depression. \u00a0And depression appeared to be shared - men were far more likely to be depressed if their partner also had post-natal depression. Dr James Paulson and Sharnail Bazemore, who carried out the study, said more efforts should be made to improve screening and referral of at-risk fathers, particularly as mounting evidence suggests that early paternal depression may have substantial emotional, behavioural and developmental effects on children \"Depression in one parent should prompt clinical attention to the other. \"Likewise, prevention and intervention efforts for depression in parents might be focused on the couple and family rather than the individual,\" they said. Paternal pressures. Bridget O'Connell, from the mental health charity Mind, said: \"Becoming a parent is one of the biggest changes that both men and women can go through, yet there is still very little understood about how it impacts on mental health, and how many people will experience a <em>perinatal</em> mental health problem\u201d. \"New parents can be faced with sleep deprivation, changes in lifestyle, changes in their relationship and new responsibilities all at once, and we don't always remember that this is going to be an issue for men as well as for women.\" But Ellie Lee, a lecturer in social policy at Kent University, said it was important not to medicalise normal emotions. \"It is, of course, essential to diagnose and treat serious clinical depression. But there is a tendency to overuse medical labels. \"What is interesting is that saying men have post-natal depression severs the link with biology. Men have not been pregnant, had the hormonal surges or given birth.\" She said modern men were put under other strains. \"It is no longer good enough to just be the bread-winner. They have to be engaged and involved. They are expected to abstain from alcohol, attend every scan and 'feel the pain' of birth. \"This can be a stressful experience.\"",

            "en": "Drinking during pregnancy increases risk of premature birth      Drinking alcohol during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage, premature birth, and low birth weight. But there are conflicting reports about how much alcohol, if any, it is safe for a pregnant woman to drink. New research published in Biomed Central's open access journal BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth looked at the amounts of alcohol women drank during their early pregnancy and showed the effect this had on their babies.   Researchers in Dublin questioned more than 60,000 pregnant women during their hospital booking interview, which usually occurred 10-12 weeks after conception. The women were asked about their home life, whether they worked, what their nationality was, as well as their drinking habits prior to their antenatal booking visit. This data was compared to data from the birth record and to records from the special care baby unit.   While about a fifth of these women said that they never drank, 71% claimed to be occasional drinkers (0-5 units a week). Within this low-alcohol group there was one case of fetal alcohol syndrome, so it is likely that some of the women were underestimating (or under reporting) the amount they drank. In general, fetal alcohol syndrome occurred less frequently than expected in this study, suggesting that it is either not recognized by medical staff or only becomes apparent after the mother and baby have left the hospital.     10% of the pregnant women drank a moderate amount of alcohol (6-20 units a week). These women were more likely to smoke, be in work and to have private health care compared to those who never drank. Only 2 in 1000 admitted to being heavy drinkers (greater than 20 units per week). These women were most likely to be young and to have used illegal drugs.   The moderate and heavy drinkers were often first time mums (not surprisingly, unplanned pregnancy was associated with heavy drinking). Heavy drinking was also related to very premature birth, and hence all the problems premature babies have including the increased risk of disease as an adult. However, there was no difference in occurrence of congenital or other birth defects regardless of the amount of alcohol drunk.     Prof Murphy said, \"This study emphasizes the need for improved detection of alcohol misuse in pregnancy and for early intervention in order to minimize the risks to the developing fetus. We would recommend that further research is required before even low amounts of alcohol can be considered safe.\"   Citation \"Prevalence, predictors and <em>perinatal</em> outcomes of peri-conceptional alcohol exposure - retrospective cohort study in an urban obstetric population in Ireland\"  Aoife Mullally, Brian J Cleary, Joe Barry, Tom P Fahey and Deirdre J Murphy  BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth",
