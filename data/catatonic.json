            "en": "7 REPETITION         17. VISITOR UNNATURALLY STILL AND WHITE, WITH LARGE BLACK EYES intent on my face, my visitor waited perfectly motionless in the center of the hall, beautiful beyond imagining. My knees trembled for a second, and I nearly fell. Then I hurled myself at her. \"Alice, oh, Alice!\" I cried, as I slammed into her. I'd forgotten how hard she was; it was like running headlong into a wall of cement. \"Bella?\" There was a strange mingling of relief and confusion in her voice. I locked my arms around her, gasping to inhale as much of the scent of her skin as possible. It wasn't like anything else\u2014not floral or spice, citrus or musk. No perfume in the world could compare. My memory hadn't done it justice. I didn't notice when the gasping turned into something else\u2014I only realized I was sobbing when Alice dragged me to the living room couch and pulled me into her lap. It was like curling up into a cool stone, but a stone that was contoured comfortingly to the shape of my body. She rubbed my back in a gentle rhythm, waiting for me to get control of myself. \"I'm\u2026 sorry,\" I blubbered. \"I'm just\u2026 so happy\u2026 to see you!\" \"It's okay, Bella. Everything's okay.\" \"Yes,\" I bawled. And, for once, it seemed that way. Alice sighed. \"I'd forgotten how exuberant you are,\" she said, and her tone was disapproving. I looked up at her through my streaming eyes. Alice's neck was tight, straining away from me, her lips pressed together firmly. Her eyes were black as pitch. \"Oh,\" I puffed, as I realized the problem. She was thirsty. And I smelled appetizing. It had been a while since I'd had to think about that kind of thing. \"Sorry.\" \"It's my own fault. It's been too long since I hunted. I shouldn't let myself get so thirsty. But I was in a hurry today.\" The look she directed at me then was a glare. \"Speaking of which, would you like to explain to me how you're alive?\" That brought me up short and stopped the sobs. I realized what must have happened immediately, and why Alice was here. I swallowed loudly. \"You saw me fall.\" \"No,\" she disagreed, her eyes narrowing. \"I saw you jump.\" I pursed my lips as I tried to think of an explanation that wouldn't sound nuts. Alice shook her head. \"I told him this would happen, but he didn't believe me. 'Bella promised,'\" her voice imitated his so perfectly that I froze in shock while the pain ripped through my torso. \"'Don't be looking for her future, either,'\" she continued to quote him. '\"We've done enough damage.\" \"But just because I'm not looking, doesn't mean I don't see\" she went on. \"I wasn't \u00a0keeping tabs on you,\u00a0 I swear, Bella. It's just that I'm already attuned to you\u2026 when I saw you jumping, I didn't think, I just got on a plane. I knew I would be too late, but I couldn't do nothing. And then I get here, thinking maybe I could help Charlie somehow, and you drive up.\" She shook her head, this time in confusion. Her voice was strained. \"I saw you go into the water and I waited and waited for you to come up, but you didn't. \u00a0\u00a0What happened? And how could you do that to Charlie? Did you stop to think what this would do to him? And my brother? Do you have any idea what Edward\u2014\" I cut her off then, as soon as she said his name. I'd let her go on, even after I realized the misunderstanding she was under, just to hear the perfect bell tone of her voice. But it was time to interrupt. \"Alice, I wasn't committing suicide.\" She eyed me dubiously. \"Are you saying you didn't jump off a cliff?\" \"No, but\u2026\" I grimaced. \"It was for recreational purposes only.\" Her expression hardened. \"I'd seen some of Jacob's friends cliff diving,\" I insisted. \"It looked like\u2026 fun, and I was bored\u2026\" She waited. \"I didn't think about how the storm would affect the currents. Actually, I didn't think about the water much at all.\" Alice didn't buy it. I could see that she still thought I had been trying to kill myself. I decided to redirect. \"So if you saw me go in, why didn't you see Jacob?\" She cocked her head to the side, distracted. I continued. \"It's true that I probably would have drowned if Jacob hadn't jumped in after me. Well, okay, there's no probably about it. But he did, and he pulled me out, and I guess he towed me back to shore, though I was kind of out for that part. It couldn't have been more than a minute that I was under before he grabbed me. How come you didn't see that?\" She frowned in perplexity. \"Someone pulled you out?\" \"Yes. Jacob saved me.\" I watched curiously as an enigmatic range of emotions flitted across her face. Something was bothering her\u2014her imperfect vision? But I wasn't sure. Then she deliberately leaned in and sniffed my shoulder. I froze. \"Don't be ridiculous,\" she muttered, sniffing at me some more. \"What are you doing?\" She ignored my question. \"Who was with you out there just now? It sounded like you were arguing.\" \"Jacob Black. He's\u2026 sort of my best friend, I guess. At least, he was\u2026\" I thought of Jacob's angry, betrayed face, and wondered what he was to me now. Alice nodded, seeming preoccupied. \"What?\" \"I don't know,\" she said. \"I'm not sure what it means.\" \"Well, I'm not dead, at least.\" She rolled her eyes. \"He was a fool to think you could survive alone. I've never seen anyone so prone to life-threatening idiocy.\" \"I survived,\" I pointed out. She was thinking of something else. \"So, if the currents were too much for you, how did this Jacob manage?\" \"Jacob is\u2026 strong.\" She heard the reluctance in my voice, and her eyebrows rose. I gnawed on my lip for a second. Was this a secret, or not? And if it was, then who was my greatest allegiance to? Jacob, or Alice? It was too hard to keep secrets, I decided. Jacob knew everything, why not Alice, too? \"See, well, he's\u2026 sort of a werewolf,\" I admitted in a rush. \"The Quileutes turn into \u00a0wolves when there are vampires around. They know Carlisle from a long time ago. Were you with Carlisle back then?\" Alice gawked at me for a moment, and then recovered herself, blinking rapidly. \"Well, I guess that explains the smell,\" she muttered. \"But does it explain what I didn't see?\" She frowned, her porcelain forehead creasing. \"The smell?\" I repeated. \"You smell awful,\" she said absently, still frowning. \"A werewolf? Are you sure about that?\"  \"Very sure,\" I promised, wincing as I remembered Paul and Jacob fighting in the road. \"I guess you weren't with Carlisle the last time there were werewolves here in Forks?\" \"No. I hadn't found him yet.\" Alice was still lost in thought. Suddenly, her eyes widened, and she turned to stare at me with a shocked expression. \"Your best friend is a \u00a0werewolf?\" I nodded sheepishly. \"How long has this been going on?\" \"Not long,\" I said, my voice sounding defensive. \"He's only been a werewolf for just a few weeks.\" She glowered at me. \"A young werewolf? Even worse! Edward was right\u2014you're a magnet for danger. Weren't you supposed to be staying out of trouble?\" \"There's nothing wrong with werewolves,\" I grumbled, stung by her critical tone. \"Until they lose their tempers.\" She shook her head sharply from side to side. \"Leave it to you, Bella.  Anyone else would be better off when the vampires left town. But you have to start hanging out with the first monsters you can find.\" I didn't want to argue with Alice\u2014I was still trembling with joy that she was really, truly here, that I could touch her marble skin and hear her wind-chime voice\u2014but she had it all wrong. \"No, Alice, the vampires didn't really leave\u2014not all of them, anyway. That's the whole trouble. If it weren't for the werewolves, Victoria would have gotten me by now. Well, if it weren't for Jake and his friends, Laurent would have gotten me before she could, I guess, so\u2014\" \"Victoria?\" she hissed. \"Laurent?\" I nodded, a teensy bit alarmed by the expression in her black eyes. I pointed at my chest. \"Danger magnet, remember?\" She shook her head again. \"Tell me everything\u2014start at the beginning.\" I glossed over the beginning, skipping the motorcycles and the voices, but telling her everything else right up to today's misadventure. Alice didn't like my thin explanation about boredom and the cliffs, so I hurried on to the strange flame I'd seen on the water and what I thought it meant. Her eyes narrowed almost to slits at that part. It was strange to see her look so\u2026 so dangerous\u2014like a vampire. I swallowed hard and went on with the rest about Harry. She listened to my story without interrupting. Occasionally, she would shake her head, and the crease in her forehead deepened until it looked like it was carved permanently into the marble of her skin. She didn't speak and, finally, I fell quiet, struck again by the borrowed grief at Harry's passing. I thought of Charlie; he would be home soon. What condition would he be in? \"Our leaving didn't do you any good at all, did it?\" Alice murmured. I laughed once\u2014it was a slightly hysterical sound. \"That was never the point, though, was it? It's not like you left for my benefit.\" Alice scowled at the floor for a moment. \"Well\u2026 I guess I acted impulsively today. I probably shouldn't have intruded.\" I could feel the blood draining from my face. My stomach dropped. \"Don't go, Alice,\" I whispered. My fingers locked around the collar of her white shirt and I began to hyperventilate. \"Please don't leave me.\" Her eyes opened wider. \"All right,\" she said, enunciating each word with slow precision. \"I'm not going anywhere tonight. Take a deep breath.\" I tried to obey, though I couldn't quite locate my lungs. She watched my face while I concentrated on my breathing. She waited till I was calmer to comment.  \"You look like hell, Bella.\" \"I drowned today,\" I reminded her. \"It goes deeper than that. You're a mess.\" I flinched. \"Look, I'm doing my best.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"It hasn't been easy. I'm working on it.\" She frowned. \"I told him,\" she said to herself. \"Alice,\" I sighed. \"What did you think you were going to find? I mean, besides me dead? Did you expect to find me skipping around and whistling show tunes? You know me better than that.\" \"I do. But I hoped.\" \"Then I guess I don't have the corner on the idiocy market.\" The phone rang. \"That has to be Charlie,\" I said, staggering to my feet. I grabbed Alice's stone hand and dragged her with me to the kitchen. I wasn't about to let her out of my sight. \"Charlie?\" I answered the phone. \"No, it's me,\" Jacob said. \"Jake!\" Alice scrutinized my expression. \"Just making sure you were still alive,\" Jacob said sourly. \"I'm fine. I told you that it wasn't\u2014\" \"Yeah. I got it. 'Bye.\" Jacob hung up on me. I sighed and let my head hang back, staring at the ceiling. \"That's going to be a problem.\" Alice squeezed my hand. \"They aren't excited I'm here.\" \"Not especially. But it's none of their business anyway.\" Alice put her arm around me. \"So what do we do now?\" she mused. She seemed to talk to herself for a moment. \"Things to do. Loose ends to tie.\" \"What things to do?\" Her face was suddenly careful. \"I don't know for sure\u2026 I need to see Carlisle.\" Would she leave so soon? My stomach dropped. \"Could you stay?\" I begged. \"Please? For just a little while. I've missed you so much.\" My voice broke. \"If you think that's a good idea.\" Her eyes were unhappy. \"I do. You can stay here\u2014Charlie would love that.\" \"I have a house, Bella.\" I nodded, disappointed but resigned. She hesitated, studying me. \"Well, I need to go get a suitcase of clothes, at the very least.\" I threw my arms around her. \"Alice, you're the best!\" \"And I think I'll need to hunt. Immediately,\" she added in a strained voice. \"Oops.\" I took a step back. \"Can you stay out of trouble for one hour?\" she asked skeptically. Then, before I could \u00a0answer, she held up one finger and closed her eyes. Her face went smooth and blank for a few seconds. And then her eyes opened and she answered her own question. \"Yes, you'll be fine. For tonight, anyway.\" She grimaced. Even making faces, she looked like an angel. \"You'll come back?\" I asked in a small voice. \"I promise\u2014one hour.\" I glanced at the clock over the kitchen table. She laughed and leaned in quickly to kiss me on the cheek. Then she was gone. I took a deep breath. Alice would be back. I suddenly felt so much better. I had plenty to do to keep myself busy while I waited. A shower was definitely first on the agenda. I sniffed my shoulders as I undressed, but I couldn't smell anything but the brine and seaweed scent of the ocean. I wondered what Alice had meant about me smelling bad. When I was cleaned up, I went back to the kitchen. I couldn't see any signs that Charlie had eaten recently, and he would probably be hungry when he got back. I hummed tunelessly to myself as I moved around the kitchen. While Thursday's casserole rotated in the microwave, I made up the couch with sheets and an old pillow. Alice wouldn't need it, but Charlie would need to see it. I was careful not to watch the clock. There was no reason to start myself panicking; Alice had promised. I hurried through my dinner, not tasting it\u2014just feeling the ache as it slid down my raw throat. Mostly I was thirsty; I must have drunk a half gallon of water by the time I was finished. All the salt in my system had dehydrated me. I went to go try to watch TV while I waited. Alice was already there, sitting on her improvised bed. Her eyes were a liquid butterscotch. She smiled and patted the pillow. \"Thanks.\" \"You're early,\" I said, elated. I sat down next to her and leaned my head on her shoulder. She put her cold arms around me and sighed. \"Bella. What are we going to do with you?\" \"I don't know,\" I admitted. \"I really have been trying my hardest.\" \"I believe you.\" It was silent. \"Does\u2014does he\u2026\" I took a deep breath. It was harder to say his name out loud, even though I was able to think it now. \"Does Edward know you're here?\" I couldn't help asking. It was my pain, after all. I'd deal with it when she was gone, I promised myself, and felt sick at the thought. \"No.\" There was only one way that could be true. \"He's not with Carlisle and Esme?\" \"He checks in every few months.\" \"Oh.\" He must still be out enjoying his distractions. I focused my curiosity on a safer topic. \"You said you flew here\u2026 Where did you come from?\" \"I was in Denali. Visiting Tanya's family.\" \"Is Jasper here? Did he come with your'\" She shook her head. \"He didn't approve of my interfering. We promised\u2026\" she trailed off, and then her tone changed. \"And you think Charlie won't mind my being here?\" she asked, sounding worried. \"Charlie thinks you're wonderful, Alice.\" \"Well, we're about to find out.\" Sure enough, a few seconds later I heard the cruiser pull into the driveway. I jumped up and hurried to open the door. Charlie trudged slowly up the walk, his eyes on the ground and his shoulders slumped. I walked forward to meet him; he didn't even see me until I hugged him around the waist. He embraced me back fiercely. \"I'm so sorry about Harry, Dad.\" \"I'm really going to miss him,\" Charlie mumbled. \"How's Sue doing?\" \"She seems dazed, like she hasn't grasped it yet. Sam's staying with her\u2026\" The volume of his voice faded in and out. \"Those poor kids. Leah's just a year older than you, and Seth is only fourteen\u2026\" He shook his head. He kept his arms tight around me as he started toward the door again. \"Um, Dad?\" I figured I'd better warn him. \"You'll never guess who's here.\" He looked at me blankly. His head swiveled around, and he spied the Mercedes across the street, the porch light reflecting off the glossy black paint. Before he could react, Alice was in the doorway. \"Hi, Charlie,\" she said in a subdued voice. \"I'm sorry I came at such a bad time.\" \"Alice Cullen?\" he peered at the slight figure in front of him as if he doubted what his eyes were telling him. \"Alice, is that you?\" \"It's me,\" she confirmed. \"I was in the neighborhood.\" \"Is Carlisle\u2026?\" \"No, I'm alone.\" Both Alice and I knew he wasn't really asking about Carlisle. His arm tightened over my shoulder. \"She can stay here, can't she?\" I pleaded. \"I already asked her.\" \"Of course,\" Charlie said mechanically. \"We'd love to have you, Alice.\" \"Thank you, Charlie. I know it's horrid timing.\" \"No, it's fine, really. I'm going to be really busy doing what I can for Harry's family; it will be nice for Bella to have some company.\" \"There's dinner for you on the table, Dad,\" I told him. \"Thanks, Bell.\" He gave me one more squeeze before he shuffled toward the kitchen. Alice went back to the couch, and I followed her. This time, she was the one to pull me against her shoulder. \"You look tired.\" \"Yeah,\" I agreed, and shrugged. \"Near-death experiences do that to me\u2026 So, what does Carlisle think of you being here?\" \"He doesn't know. He and Esme were on a hunting trip. I'll hear from him in a few days, when he gets back.\" \"You won't tell him, though\u2026 when he checks in again?\" I asked. She knew I didn't mean Carlisle now. \"No. He'd bite my head off,\" Alice said grimly. I laughed once, and then sighed. I didn't want to sleep. I wanted to stay up all night talking to Alice. And it didn't make sense for me to be tired, what with crashing on Jacob's couch all day. But drowning really had taken a lot out of me, and my eyes wouldn't stay open. I rested my head on her stone shoulder, and drifted into a more peaceful oblivion than I had any hope of. I woke early, from a deep and dreamless sleep, feeling well-rested, but stiff. I was on the couch tucked under the blankets I'd laid out for Alice, and I could hear her and Charlie talking in the kitchen. It sounded like Charlie was fixing her breakfast. \"How bad was it, Charlie?\" Alice asked softly, and at first I thought they were talking about the Clear waters. Charlie sighed. \"Real bad.\" \"Tell me about it. I want to know exactly what happened when we left.\" There was a pause while a cupboard door was closed and a dial on the stove was clicked off. I waited, cringing. \"I've never felt so helpless,\" Charlie began slowly. \"I didn't know what to do. That first week\u2014I thought I was going to have to hospitalize her. She wouldn't eat or drink, she wouldn't move. Dr. Gerandy was throwing around words like '<em>catatonic</em>,' but I didn't let him up to see her. I was afraid it would scare her.\" \"She snapped out of it though?\" \"I had Renee come to take her to Florida. I just didn't want to be the one\u2026 if she had to go to a hospital or something. I hoped being with her mother would help. But when we started packing her clothes, she woke up with a vengeance. I've never seen Bella throw a fit like that. She was never one for the tantrums, but, boy, did she fly into a fury. She threw her clothes everywhere and screamed that we couldn't make her leave\u2014and then she finally started crying. I thought that would be the turning point. I didn't argue when she insisted on staying here\u2026 and she did seem to get better at first\u2026\" Charlie trailed off. It was hard listening to this, knowing how much pain I'd caused him. \"But?\" Alice prompted. \"She went back to school and work, she ate and slept and did her homework. She answered when someone asked her a direct question. But she was\u2026 empty. Her eyes were blank. There were lots of little things\u2014she wouldn't listen to music anymore; I found a bunch of CDs broken in the trash. She didn't read; she wouldn't be in the same room when the TV was on, not that she watched it so much before. I finally figured it out\u2014she was avoiding everything that might remind her of\u2026 him. \"We could hardly talk; I was so worried about saying something that would upset her\u2014the littlest things would make her flinch\u2014and she never volunteered anything. She would just answer if I asked her something. \"She was alone all the time. She didn't call her friends back, and after a while, they stopped calling. \"It was night of the living dead around here. I still hear her screaming in her sleep\u2026\" I could almost see him shuddering. I shuddered, too, remembering. And then I sighed. I hadn't fooled him at all, not for one second. \"I'm so sorry, Charlie,\" Alice said, voice glum. \"It's not your fault.\" The way he said it made it perfectly clear that he was holding someone responsible. \"You were always a good friend to her.\" \"She seems better now, though.\" \"Yeah. Ever since she started hanging out with Jacob Black, I've noticed a real improvement. She has some color in her cheeks when she comes home, some light in her eyes. She's happier.\" He paused, and his voice was different when he spoke again. \"He's a year or so younger than her, and I know she used to think of him as a friend, but I think maybe it's something more now, or headed that direction, anyway.\" Charlie said this in a tone that was almost belligerent. It was a warning, not for Alice, but for her to pass along. \"Jake's old for his years,\" he continued, still sounding defensive. \"He's taken care of his father physically the way Bella took care of her mother \u00a0emotionally. It matured him. He's a good-looking kid, too\u2014takes after his mom's side. He's good for Bella, you know,\" Charlie insisted.  \"Then it's good she has him,\" Alice agreed. Charlie sighed out a big gust of air, folding quickly to the lack of opposition. \"Okay, so I guess that's overstating things. I don't know\u2026 even with Jacob, now and then I see something in her eyes, and I wonder if I've ever grasped how much pain she's really in It's not normal, Alice, and it\u2026 it frightens me. Not normal at all. Not like someone\u2026 left her, but like someone died.\" His voice cracked. It was like someone had died\u2014like I had died. Because it had been more than just losing the truest of true loves, as if that were not enough to kill anyone. It was also losing a whole future, a whole family\u2014the whole life that I'd chosen\u2026 Charlie went on in a hopeless tone. \"I don't know if she's going to get over it\u2014I'm not sure if it's in her nature to heal from something like this. She's always been such a constant little thing. She doesn't get past things, change her mind.\" \"She's one of a kind,\" Alice agreed in a dry voice. \"And Alice\u2026\" Charlie hesitated. \"Now, you know how fond I am of you, and I can tell that she's happy to see you, but\u2026 I'm a little worried about what your visit will do to her.\" \"So am I, Charlie, so am I. I wouldn't have come if I'd had any idea. I'm sorry.\" \"Don't apologize, honey. Who knows? Maybe it will be good for her.\" \"I hope you're right.\" There was a long break while forks scraped plates and Charlie chewed. I wondered where Alice was hiding the food. \"Alice, I have to ask you something,\" Charlie said awkwardly. Alice was calm. \"Go ahead.\" \"He's not coming back to visit, too, is he?\" I could hear the suppressed anger in Charlie's voice. Alice answered in a soft, reassuring tone. \"He doesn't even know I'm here. The last time I spoke with him, he was in South America.\" I stiffened as I heard this new information, and listened harder. \"That's something, at least.\" Charlie snorted. \"Well, I hope he's enjoying himself.\" For the first time, Alice's voice had a bit of steel in it. \"I wouldn't make assumptions, Charlie.\" I knew how her eyes would flash when she used that tone. A chair scooted from the table, scraping loudly across the floor. I pictured Charlie getting up; there was no way Alice would make that kind of noise. The faucet ran, splashing against a dish. It didn't sound like they were going to say anything more about Edward, so I decided it was time to wake up. I turned over, bouncing against the springs to make them squeak. Then I yawned loudly. All was quiet in the kitchen. I stretched and groaned. \"Alice?\" I asked innocently; the soreness rasping in my throat added nicely to the charade. \"I'm in the kitchen, Bella,\" Alice called, no hint in her voice that she suspected my eavesdropping. But she was good at hiding things like that. Charlie had to leave then\u2014he was helping Sue Clearwater with the funeral arrangements. It would have been a very long day without Alice. She never spoke about leaving, and I didn't ask her. I knew it was inevitable, but I put it out of my mind. Instead, we talked about her family\u2014all but one. Carlisle was working nights in Ithaca and teaching part time at Cornell. Esme was restoring a seventeenth century house, a historical monument, in the forest north of the city. Emmett and Rosalie had gone to Europe for a few months on another honeymoon, but they were back now. Jasper was at Cornell, too, studying philosophy this time. And Alice had been doing some personal research, concerning the information I'd accidentally uncovered for her last spring. She'd successfully tracked down the asylum where she'd spent the last years of her human life. The life she had no memory of. \"My name was Mary Alice Brandon,\" she told me quietly. \"I had a little sister named Cynthia. Her daughter\u2014my niece\u2014is still alive in Biloxi.\" \"Did you find out why they put you in\u2026 that place?\" What would drive parents to that extreme? Even if their daughter saw visions of the future\u2026 She just shook her head, her topaz eyes thoughtful. \"I couldn't find much about them. I went through all the old newspapers on microfiche. My family wasn't mentioned often; they weren't part of the social circle that made the papers. My parents' engagement was there, and Cynthia's.\" The name fell uncertainly from her tongue. \"My birth was announced\u2026 and my death. I found my grave. I also filched my admissions sheet from the old asylum archives. The date on the admission and the date on my tombstone are the same.\" I didn't know what to say, and, after a short pause, Alice moved on to lighter topics. The Cullens were reassembled now, with the one exception, spending Cornell's spring break in Denali with Tanya and her family. I listened too eagerly to even the most trivial news. She never mentioned the one I was most interested in, and for that I was grateful. It was enough to listen to the stories of the family I'd once dreamed of belonging to. Charlie didn't get back until after dark, and he looked more worn than he had the night before. He would be headed back to the reservation first thing in the morning for Harry's funeral, so he turned in early. I stayed on the couch with Alice again. Charlie was almost a stranger when he came down the stairs before the sun was up, wearing an old suit I'd never seen him in before. The jacket hung open; I guessed it was too tight to fasten the buttons. His tie was a bit wide for the current style. He tiptoed to the door, trying not to wake us up. I let him go, pretending to sleep, as Alice did on the recliner. As soon as he was out the door, Alice sat up. Under the quilt, she was fully dressed. \"So, what are we doing today?\" she asked. \"I don't know\u2014do you see anything interesting happening?\" She smiled and shook her head. \"But it's still early.\" All the time I'd been spending in La Push meant a pile of things I'd been neglecting at home, and I decided to catch up on my chores. I wanted to do something, anything that might make life easier for Charlie\u2014maybe it would make him feel just a little better to come home to a clean, organized house. I started with the bathroom\u2014it showed the most signs of neglect. While I worked, Alice leaned against the doorjamb and asked nonchalant questions about my, well, our high school friends and what they been up to since she'd left. Her face stayed casual and emotionless, but I sensed her disapproval when she realized how little I could tell her. Or maybe I just had a guilty conscience after eavesdropping on her conversation with Charlie yesterday morning. I was literally up to my elbows in Comet, scrubbing the floor of the bathtub, when the doorbell rang. I looked to Alice at once, and her expression was perplexed, almost worried, which was strange; Alice was never taken by surprise. \"Hold on!\" I shouted in the general direction of the front door, getting up and hurrying to the sink to rinse my arms off. \"Bella,\" Alice said with a trace of frustration in her voice, \"I have a fairly good guess who that might be, and I think I'd better step out.\" \"Guess?\" I echoed. Since when did Alice have to guess anything? \"If this is a repeat of my egregious lapse in foresight yesterday, then it's most likely Jacob Black or one of his\u2026 friends.\" I stared at her, putting it together. \"You can't see werewolves?\" She grimaced. \"So it would seem.\" She was obviously annoyed by this fact\u2014very annoyed. The doorbell rang again\u2014buzzing twice quickly and impatiently. \"You don't have go anywhere, Alice. You were here first.\" She laughed her silvery little laugh\u2014it had a dark edge. \"Trust me\u2014it wouldn't be a good idea to have me and Jacob Black in a room together.\" She kissed my cheek swiftly before she vanished through Charlie's door\u2014and out his back window, no doubt. The doorbell rang again.",

            "en": "2      2. EVASION I felt oddly buoyant as I walked from Spanish toward the cafeteria, and it wasn\u2019t just because I was holding hands with the most perfect person on the planet, though that was certainly part of it. Maybe it was the knowledge that my sentence was served and I was a free woman again. Or maybe it wasn\u2019t anything to do with me specifically. Maybe it was the atmosphere of freedom that hung over the entire campus. School was winding down, and, for the senior class especially, there was a perceptible thrill in the air. Freedom was so close it was touchable, taste-able. Signs of it were everywhere. Posters crowded together on the cafeteria walls, and the trashcans wore a colorful skirt of spilled-over fliers: reminders to buy yearbooks, class rings, and announcements; deadlines to order graduation gowns, hats, and tassels; neon-bright sales pitches \u2014 the juniors campaigning for class office; ominous, rose-wreathed advertisements for this year\u2019s prom.  The big dance was this coming weekend, but I had an ironclad promise from Edward that I would not be subjected to that again. After all, I\u2019d already had that human experience. No, it must be my personal freedom that lightened me today. The ending of the school year did not give me the pleasure it seemed to give the other students. Actually, I felt nervous to the point of nausea whenever I thought of it. I tried to not think of it. But it was hard to escape such an omnipresent topic as graduation. \u201cHave you sent your announcements, yet?\u201d Angela asked when Edward and I sat down at our table. She had her light brown hair pulled back into a sloppy ponytail instead of her usual smooth hairdo, and there was a slightly frantic look about her eyes. Alice and Ben were already there, too, on either side of Angela. Ben was intent over a comic book, his glasses sliding down his narrow nose.  Alice was scrutinizing my boring jeans-and-a-t-shirt outfit in a way that made me self-conscious. Probably plotting another makeover. I sighed. My indifferent attitude to fashion was a constant thorn in her side. If I\u2019d allow it, she\u2019d love to dress me every day \u2014 perhaps several times a day \u2014 like some oversized three-dimensional paper doll. \u00a0\u201cNo,\u201d I answered Angela. \u201cThere\u2019s no point, really. Ren\u00e9e knows when I\u2019m graduating. Who else is there?\u201d \u201cHow about you, Alice?\u201d Alice smiled. \u201cAll done.\u201d \u201cLucky you.\u201d Angela sighed. \u201cMy mother has a thousand cousins and she expects me to hand-address one to everybody. I\u2019m going to get carpal tunnel. I can\u2019t put it off any longer and I\u2019m just dreading it.\u201d \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll help you,\u201d I volunteered. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind my awful handwriting.\u201d Charlie would like that. From the corner of my eye, I saw Edward smile. He must like that, too \u2014 me fulfilling Charlie\u2019s conditions without involving werewolves. Angela looked relieved. \u201cThat\u2019s so nice of you. I\u2019ll come over any time you want.\u201d \u201cActually, I\u2019d rather go to your house if that\u2019s okay \u2014 I\u2019m sick of mine. Charlie un-grounded me last night.\u201d I grinned as I announced my good news. \u201cReally?\u201d Angela asked, mild excitement lighting her always-gentle brown eyes. \u201cI thought you said you were in for life.\u201d \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m more surprised than you are. I was sure I would at least have finished high school before he set me free.\u201d \u201cWell, this is great, Bella! We\u2019ll have to go out to celebrate.\u201d \u00a0\u201cYou have no idea how good that sounds.\u201d \u201cWhat should we do?\u201d Alice mused, her face lighting up at the possibilities. Alice\u2019s ideas were usually a little grandiose for me, and I could see it in her eyes now \u2014 the tendency to take things too far kicking into action. \u201cWhatever you\u2019re thinking, Alice, I doubt I\u2019m that free.\u201d \u201cFree is free, right?\u201d she insisted. \u201cI\u2019m sure I still have boundaries \u2014 like the continental U.S., for example.\u201d Angela and Ben laughed, but Alice grimaced in real disappointment. \u201cSo what are we doing tonight?\u201d she persisted. \u201cNothing. Look, let\u2019s give it a couple of days to make sure he wasn\u2019t joking. It\u2019s a school night, anyway.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll celebrate this weekend, then.\u201d Alice\u2019s enthusiasm was impossible to repress. \u00a0\u201cSure,\u201d I said, hoping to placate her. I knew I wasn\u2019t going to do anything too outlandish; it would be safer to take it slow with Charlie. Give him a chance to appreciate how trustworthy and mature I was before I asked for any favors. Angela and Alice started talking about options; Ben joined the conversation, setting his comics aside. My attention drifted. I was surprised to find that the subject of my freedom was suddenly not as gratifying as it had been just a moment ago. While they discussed things to do in Port Angeles or maybe Hoquiam, I began to feel disgruntled. It didn\u2019t take long to determine where my restlessness stemmed from. Ever since I\u2019d said goodbye to Jacob Black in the forest outside my home, I\u2019d been plagued by a persistent, uncomfortable intrusion of a specific mental picture. It popped into my thoughts at regular intervals like some annoying alarm clock set to sound every half hour, filling my head with the image of Jacob\u2019s face crumpled in pain. This was the last memory I had of him. As the disturbing vision struck again, I knew exactly why I was dissatisfied with my liberty. Because it was incomplete. Sure, I was free to go to anywhere I wanted \u2014 except La Push; free to do anything I wanted \u2014 except see Jacob. I frowned at the table. There had to be some kind of middle ground. \u201cAlice? Alice!\u201d  Angela\u2019s voice yanked me from my reverie. She was waving her hand back and forth in front of Alice\u2019s blank, staring face. Alice\u2019s expression was something I recognized \u2014 an expression that sent an automatic shock of panic through my body. The vacant look in her eyes told me that she was seeing something very different from the mundane lunchroom scene that surrounded us, but something that was every bit as real in its own way. Something that was coming, something that would happen soon. I felt the blood slither from my face. Then Edward laughed, a very natural, relaxed sound. Angela and Ben looked toward him, but my eyes were locked on Alice. She jumped suddenly, as if someone had kicked her under the table. \u201cIs it naptime already, Alice?\u201d Edward teased. Alice was herself again. \u201cSorry, I was daydreaming, I guess.\u201d \u201cDaydreaming\u2019s better than facing two more hours of school,\u201d Ben said. Alice threw herself back into the conversation with more animation than before \u2014 just a little bit too much. Once I saw her eyes lock with Edward\u2019s, only for a moment, and then she looked back to Angela before anyone else noticed. Edward was quiet, playing absentmindedly with a strand of my hair. I waited anxiously for a chance to ask Edward what Alice had seen in her vision, but the afternoon passed without one minute of alone time. It felt odd to me, almost deliberate. After lunch, Edward slowed his pace to match Ben\u2019s, talking about some assignment I knew he\u2019d already finished. Then there was always someone else there between classes, though we usually had a few minutes to ourselves. When the final bell rang, Edward struck up a conversation with Mike Newton of all people, falling into step beside him as Mike headed for the parking lot. I trailed behind, letting Edward tow me along. I listened, confused, while Mike answered Edward\u2019s unusually friendly queries. It seemed Mike was having car troubles. \u00a0\u201c. . . but I just replaced the battery,\u201d Mike was saying. His eyes darted ahead and then back to Edward warily. Mystified, just like I was. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s the cables?\u201d Edward offered. \u201cMaybe. I really don\u2019t know anything about cars,\u201d Mike admitted. \u201cI need to have someone look at it, but I can\u2019t afford to take it to Dowling\u2019s.\u201d I opened my mouth to suggest my mechanic, and then snapped it shut again. My mechanic was busy these days \u2014 busy running around as a giant wolf. \u201cI know a few things \u2014 I could take a look, if you like,\u201d Edward offered. \u201cJust let me drop Alice and Bella at home.\u201d Mike and I both stared at Edward with our mouths hanging open. \u201cEr . . . thanks,\u201d Mike mumbled when he recovered. \u201cBut I have to get to work. Maybe some other time.\u201d \u00a0\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d \u201cSee ya.\u201d Mike climbed into his car, shaking his head in disbelief. Edward\u2019s Volvo, with Alice already inside, was just two cars away. \u201cWhat was that about ?\u201d I muttered as Edward held the passenger door for me. \u201cJust being helpful,\u201d Edward answered. And then Alice, waiting in the backseat, was babbling at top speed. \u201cYou\u2019re really not that good a mechanic, Edward. Maybe you should have Rosalie take a look at it tonight, just so you look good if Mike decides to let you help, you know. \u00a0\u00a0Not that it wouldn\u2019t be fun to watch his face if Rosalie showed up to help. But since Rosalie is supposed to be across the country attending college, I guess that\u2019s not the best idea. Too bad. Though I suppose, for Mike\u2019s car, you\u2019ll do. It\u2019s only within the finer tunings of a good Italian sports car that you\u2019re out of your depth. And speaking of Italy and sports cars that I stole there, you still owe me a yellow Porsche. I don\u2019t know that I want to wait for Christmas. . . .\u201d I stopped listening after a minute, letting her quick voice become just a hum in the background as I settled into my patient mode. It looked to me like Edward was trying to avoid my questions. Fine. He would have to be alone with me soon enough. It was only a matter of time. Edward seemed to realize that, too. He dropped Alice at the mouth of the Cullens\u2019 drive as usual, though by this point I half expected him to drive her to the door and walk her in. As she got out, Alice threw a sharp look at his face. Edward seemed completely at ease. \u201cSee you later,\u201d he said. And then, ever so slightly, he nodded. Alice turned to disappear into the trees. He was quiet as he turned the car around and headed back to Forks. I waited, wondering if he would bring it up himself. He didn\u2019t, and this made me tense. What had Alice seen today at lunch? Something he didn\u2019t want to tell me, and I tried to think of a reason why he would keep secrets. Maybe it would be better to prepare myself before I asked. I didn\u2019t want to freak out and have him think I couldn\u2019t handle it, whatever it was. So we were both silent until we got to back to Charlie\u2019s house. \u00a0\u201cLight homework load tonight,\u201d he commented. \u201cMmm,\u201d I assented. \u201cDo you suppose I\u2019m allowed inside again?\u201d \u201cCharlie didn\u2019t throw a fit when you picked me up for school.\u201d But I was sure Charlie was going to turn sulky fast when he got home and found Edward here. Maybe I should make something extra-special for dinner. Inside, I headed up the stairs, and Edward followed. He lounged on my bed and gazed out the window, seeming oblivious to my edginess. I stowed my bag and turned the computer on. There was an unanswered e-mail from my mom to attend to, and she got panicky when I took too long. I drummed my fingers as I waited for my decrepit computer to wheeze awake; they snapped against the desk, staccato and anxious. And then his fingers were on mine, holding them still. \u201cAre we a little impatient today?\u201d he murmured. I looked up, intending to make a sarcastic remark, but his face was closer than I\u2019d expected. His golden eyes were smoldering, just inches away, and his breath was cool against my open lips. I could taste his scent on my tongue. I couldn\u2019t remember the witty response I\u2019d been about to make. I couldn\u2019t remember my name. He didn\u2019t give me a chance to recover. If I had my way, I would spend the majority of my time kissing Edward. There wasn\u2019t anything I\u2019d experienced in my life that compared to the feeling of his cool lips, marble hard but always so gentle, moving with mine. I didn\u2019t often get my way. So it surprised me a little when his fingers braided themselves into my hair, securing my face to his. My arms locked behind his neck, and I wished I was stronger \u2014 strong enough to keep him prisoner here. One hand slid down my back, pressing me tighter against his stone chest. Even through his sweater, his skin was cold enough to make me shiver \u2014 it was a shiver of pleasure, of happiness, but his hands began to loosen in response. I knew I had about three seconds before he would sigh and slide me deftly away, saying something about how we\u2019d risked my life enough for one afternoon. Making the most of my last seconds, I crushed myself closer, molding myself to the shape of him. The tip of my tongue traced the curve of his lower lip; it was as flawlessly smooth as if it had been polished, and the taste \u2014 He pulled my face away from his, breaking my hold with ease \u2014 he probably didn\u2019t even realize that I was using all my strength. He chuckled once, a low, throaty sound. His eyes were bright with the excitement he so rigidly disciplined. \u00a0\u201cAh, Bella.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI\u2019d say I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m not.\u201d \u201cAnd I should feel sorry that you\u2019re not sorry, but I don\u2019t. Maybe I should go sit on the bed.\u201d I exhaled a little dizzily. \u201cIf you think that\u2019s necessary. . . .\u201d  He smiled crookedly and disentangled himself. I shook my head a few times, trying to clear it, and turned back to my computer. It was all warmed up and humming now. Well, not as much humming as groaning. \u201cTell Ren\u00e9e I said hello.\u201d \u201cSure thing.\u201d I scanned through Ren\u00e9e\u2019s e-mail, shaking my head now and then at some of the dippier things she\u2019d done. I was just as entertained and horrified as the first time I\u2019d read this. It was so like my mother to forget exactly how paralyzed she was by heights until she was already strapped to a parachute and a dive instructor. I felt a little frustrated with Phil, her husband of almost two years, for allowing that one. I would have taken better care of her. I knew her so much better. You have to let them go their own way eventually, I reminded myself. You have to let them have their own life. . . . I\u2019d spent most of my life taking care of Ren\u00e9e, patiently guiding her away from her craziest plans, good-naturedly enduring the ones I couldn\u2019t talk her out of. I\u2019d always been indulgent with my mom, amused by her, even a little condescending to her. I saw her cornucopia of mistakes and laughed privately to myself. Scatterbrained Ren\u00e9e. I was a very different person from my mother. Someone thoughtful and cautious. The responsible one, the grown-up. That\u2019s how I saw myself. That was the person I knew. With the blood still pounding in my head from Edward\u2019s kiss, I couldn\u2019t help but think of my mother\u2019s most life-altering mistake. Silly and romantic, getting married fresh out of high school to a man she barely knew, then producing me a year later. She\u2019d always promised me that she had no regrets, that I was the best gift her life had ever given her. And yet she\u2019d drilled it into me over and over \u2014 smart people took marriage seriously. Mature people went to college and started careers before they got deeply involved in a relationship. She knew I would never be as thoughtless and goofy and small-town as she\u2019d been. . . . I gritted my teeth and tried to concentrate as I answered her letter. Then I hit her parting line and remembered why I\u2019d neglected to write sooner. You haven\u2019t said anything about Jacob in a long time, she\u2019d written. What\u2019s he up to these days? Charlie was prompting her, I was sure. I sighed and typed quickly, tucking the answer to her question between two less sensitive paragraphs. Jacob is fine, I guess. I don\u2019t see him much; he spends most of his time with a pack of his friends down at La Push these days. Smiling wryly to myself, I added Edward\u2019s greeting and hit \u201csend.\u201d I didn\u2019t realize that Edward was standing silently behind me again until after I\u2019d turned off the computer and shoved away from the desk. I was about to scold him for reading over my shoulder when I realized that he wasn\u2019t paying any attention to me. He was examining a flat black box with wires curling crookedly away from the main square in a way that didn\u2019t look healthy for whatever it was. After a second, I recognized the car stereo Emmett, Rosalie, and Jasper had given me for my last birthday. I\u2019d forgotten about the birthday presents hiding under a growing pile of dust on the floor of my closet. \u00a0\u201cWhat did you do to this?\u201d he asked in a horrorstruck voice. \u201cIt didn\u2019t want to come out of the dashboard.\u201d \u201cSo you felt the need to torture it?\u201d \u201cYou know how I am with tools. No pain was inflicted intentionally.\u201d He shook his head, his face a mask of faux tragedy. \u201cYou killed it.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cOh, well.\u201d \u201cIt would hurt their feelings if they saw this,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess it\u2019s a good thing that you\u2019ve been on house arrest. I\u2019ll have to get another one in place before they notice.\u201d \u201cThanks, but I don\u2019t need a fancy stereo.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not for your sake that I\u2019m going to replace it.\u201d I sighed. \u201cYou didn\u2019t get much good out of your birthday presents last year,\u201d he said in a disgruntled voice. Suddenly, he was fanning himself with a stiff rectangle of paper. I didn\u2019t answer, for fear my voice would shake. My disastrous eighteenth birthday \u2014 with all its far-reaching consequences \u2014 wasn\u2019t something I cared to remember, and I was surprised that he would bring it up. He was even more sensitive about it than I was. \u201cDo you realize these are about to expire?\u201d he asked, holding the paper out to me. It was another present \u2014 the voucher for airplane tickets that Esme and Carlisle had given me so that I could visit Ren\u00e9e in Florida. I took a deep breath and answered in a flat voice. \u201cNo. I\u2019d forgotten all about them, actually.\u201d His expression was carefully bright and positive; there was no trace of any deep emotion as he continued. \u201cWell, we still have a little time. You\u2019ve been liberated . . . and we have no plans this weekend, as you refuse to go to the prom with me.\u201d He grinned. \u201cWhy not celebrate your freedom this way?\u201d I gasped. \u201cBy going to Florida?\u201d \u201cYou did say something about the continental U.S. being allowable.\u201d I glared at him, suspicious, trying to understand where this had come from. \u201cWell?\u201d he demanded. \u201cAre we going to see Ren\u00e9e or not?\u201d \u201cCharlie will never allow it.\u201d \u201cCharlie can\u2019t keep you from visiting your mother. She still has primary custody.\u201d \u201cNobody has custody of me. I\u2019m an adult.\u201d He flashed a brilliant smile. \u201cExactly.\u201d I thought it over for a short minute before deciding that it wasn\u2019t worth the fight. Charlie would be furious \u2014 not that I was going to see Ren\u00e9e, but that Edward was going with me. Charlie wouldn\u2019t speak to me for months, and I\u2019d probably end up grounded again. It was definitely smarter not to even bring it up. Maybe in a few weeks, as a graduation favor or something. But the idea of seeing my mother now , not weeks from now, was hard to resist. It had been so long since I\u2019d seen Ren\u00e9e. And even longer since I\u2019d seen her under pleasant circumstances. The last time I\u2019d been with her in Phoenix, I\u2019d spent the whole time in a hospital bed. The last time she\u2019d come here, I\u2019d been more or less <em>catatonic</em>. Not exactly the best memories to leave her with. And maybe, if she saw how happy I was with Edward, she would tell Charlie to ease up. Edward scrutinized my face while I deliberated. I sighed. \u201cNot this weekend.\u201d \u201cWhy not?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to fight with Charlie. Not so soon after he\u2019s forgiven me.\u201d His eyebrows pulled together. \u201cI think this weekend is perfect,\u201d he muttered. I shook my head. \u201cAnother time.\u201d \u00a0\u201cYou aren\u2019t the only one who\u2019s been trapped in this house, you know.\u201d He frowned at me. Suspicion returned. This kind of behavior was unlike him. He was always so impossibly selfless; I knew it was making me spoiled. \u201cYou can go anywhere you want,\u201d I pointed out. \u201cThe outside world holds no interest for me without you.\u201d I rolled my eyes at the hyperbole. \u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s take the outside world slowly, all right? For example, we could start with a movie in Port Angeles. . . .\u201d He groaned. \u201cNever mind. We\u2019ll talk about it later.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s nothing left to talk about.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cOkay, then, new subject,\u201d I said. I\u2019d almost forgotten my worries about this afternoon \u2014 had that been his intention? \u201cWhat did Alice see today at lunch?\u201d My eyes were fixed on his face as I spoke, measuring his reaction. His expression was composed; there was only the slightest hardening of his topaz eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s been seeing Jasper in a strange place, somewhere in the southwest, she thinks, near his former . . . family. But he has no conscious intentions to go back.\u201d He sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s got her worried.\u201d \u00a0\u201cOh.\u201d That was nothing close to what I\u2019d been expecting. But of course it made sense that Alice would be watching out for Jasper\u2019s future. He was her soul mate, her true other half, though they weren\u2019t as flamboyant about their relationship as Rosalie and Emmett were. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me before?\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t realize you\u2019d noticed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably nothing important, in any case.\u201d My imagination was sadly out of control. I\u2019d taken a perfectly normal afternoon and twisted it until it looked like Edward was going out of his way to keep things from me. I needed therapy. We went downstairs to work on our homework, just in case Charlie showed up early. Edward finished in minutes; I slogged laboriously through my calculus until I decided it was time to fix Charlie\u2019s dinner. Edward helped, making faces every so often at the raw ingredients \u2014 human food was mildly repulsive to him. I made stroganoff from Grandma Swan\u2019s recipe, because I was sucking up. It wasn\u2019t one of my favorites, but it would please Charlie. Charlie seemed to already be in a good mood when he got home. He didn\u2019t even go out of his way to be rude to Edward. Edward excused himself from eating with us, as usual. The sound of the nightly news drifted from the front room, but I doubted Edward was really watching. After forcing down three helpings, Charlie kicked his feet up on the spare chair and folded his hands contentedly across his distended stomach. \u00a0\u201cThat was great, Bells.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m glad you liked it. How was work?\u201d He\u2019d been eating with too much concentration for me to make conversation before. \u201cSort of slow. Well, dead slow really. Mark and I played cards for a good part of the afternoon,\u201d he admitted with a grin. \u201cI won, nineteen hands to seven. And then I was on the phone with Billy for a while.\u201d I tried to keep my expression the same. \u201cHow is he?\u201d \u201cGood, good. His joints are bothering him a little.\u201d \u00a0\u201cOh. That\u2019s too bad.\u201d \u201cYeah. He invited us down to visit this weekend. He was thinking of having the Clearwaters and the Uleys over too. Sort of a playoff party. . . .\u201d \u201cHuh,\u201d was my genius response. But what could I say? I knew I wouldn\u2019t be allowed to hit a werewolf party, even with parental supervision. I wondered if Edward would have a problem with Charlie hanging out in La Push. Or would he suppose that, since Charlie was mostly spending time with Billy, who was only human, my father wouldn\u2019t be in danger? I got up and piled the dishes together without looking at Charlie. I dumped them into the sink and started the water. Edward appeared silently and grabbed a dishtowel. Charlie sighed and gave up for the moment, though I imagined he would revisit the subject when we were alone again. He heaved himself to his feet and headed for the TV, just like every other night. \u201cCharlie,\u201d Edward said in a conversational tone. Charlie stopped in the middle of his little kitchen. \u201cYeah?\u201d \u201cDid Bella ever tell you that my parents gave her airplane tickets on her last birthday, so that she could visit Ren\u00e9e?\u201d I dropped the plate I was scrubbing. It glanced off the counter and clattered noisily to the floor. It didn\u2019t break, but it spattered the room, and all three of us, with soapy water. Charlie didn\u2019t even seem to notice. \u201cBella?\u201d he asked in a stunned voice.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  I kept my eyes on the plate as I retrieved it. \u201cYeah, they did.\u201d Charlie swallowed loudly, and then his eyes narrowed as he turned back to Edward. \u201cNo, she never mentioned it.\u201d \u201cHmm,\u201d Edward murmured. \u201cWas there a reason you brought it up?\u201d Charlie asked in a hard voice. Edward shrugged. \u201cThey\u2019re about to expire. I think it might hurt Esme\u2019s feelings if Bella doesn\u2019t use her gift. Not that she\u2019d say anything.\u201d I stared at Edward in disbelief. Charlie thought for a minute. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a good idea for you to visit your mom, Bella. She\u2019d love that. I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t say anything about this, though.\u201d \u201cI forgot,\u201d I admitted. He frowned. \u201cYou forgot that someone gave you plane tickets?\u201d \u201cMmm,\u201d I murmured vaguely, and turned back to the sink. \u201cI noticed that you said they\u2019re about to expire, Edward,\u201d Charlie went on. \u201cHow many tickets did your\u00a0 parents give her?\u201d \u201cJust one for her . . . and one for me.\u201d The plate I dropped this time landed in the sink, so it didn\u2019t make as much noise. I could easily hear the sharp huff as my father exhaled. The blood rushed into my face, fueled by irritation and chagrin. Why was Edward doing this? I glared at the bubbles in the sink, panicking. \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s out of the question!\u201d Charlie was abruptly in a rage, shouting the words. \u201cWhy?\u201d Edward asked, his voice saturated with innocent surprise. \u201cYou just said it was a good idea for her to see her mother.\u201d Charlie ignored him. \u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere with him, young lady!\u201d he yelled. I spun around and he was jabbing a finger at me. Anger pulsed through me automatically, an instinctive reaction to his tone.  \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not a child, Dad. And I\u2019m not grounded anymore, remember?\u201d \u201cOh yes, you are. Starting now.\u201d \u201cFor what?!\u201d \u201cBecause I said so.\u201d \u201cDo I need to remind you that I\u2019m a legal adult, Charlie?\u201d \u201cThis is my house \u2014 you follow my rules!\u201d My glare turned icy. \u201cIf that\u2019s how you want it. Do you want me to move out tonight? Or can I have a few days to pack?\u201d Charlie\u2019s face went bright red. I instantly felt horrible for playing the move-out card. I took a deep breath and tried to make my tone more reasonable. \u201cI\u2019ll do my time without complaining when I\u2019ve done something wrong, Dad, but I\u2019m not going to put up with your prejudices.\u201d He sputtered, but managed nothing coherent. \u201cNow, I know that you know that I have every right to see Mom for the weekend. You can\u2019t honestly tell me you\u2019d object to the plan if I was going with Alice or Angela.\u201d \u201cGirls,\u201d he grunted, with a nod. \u201cWould it bother you if I took Jacob?\u201d I\u2019d only picked the name because I knew of my father\u2019s preference for Jacob, but I quickly wished I hadn\u2019t; Edward\u2019s teeth clenched together with an audible snap. My father struggled to compose himself before he answered. \u201cYes,\u201d he said in an unconvincing voice. \u201cThat would bother me.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re a rotten liar, Dad.\u201d \u201cBella \u2014\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m headed off to Vegas to be a showgirl or anything. I\u2019m going to see Mom ,\u201d I reminded him. \u201cShe\u2019s just as much my parental authority as you are.\u201d He threw me a withering look. \u201cAre you implying something about Mom\u2019s ability to look after me?\u201d Charlie flinched at the threat implicit in my question. \u201cYou\u2019d better hope I don\u2019t mention this to her,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019d better not,\u201d he warned. \u201cI\u2019m not happy about this, Bella.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for you to be upset.\u201d He rolled his eyes, but I could tell the storm was over. I turned to pull the plug out of the sink. \u201cSo my homework is done, your dinner is done, the dishes are done, and I\u2019m not grounded. I\u2019m going out. I\u2019ll be back before ten-thirty.\u201d \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d His face, almost back to normal, flushed light red again. \u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d I admitted. \u201cI\u2019ll keep it within a ten-mile radius, though. Okay?\u201d He grunted something that did not sound like approval, and stalked out of the room. Naturally, as soon as I\u2019d won the fight, I began to feel guilty. \u201cWe\u2019re going out?\u201d Edward asked, his voice low but enthusiastic. I turned to glower at him. \u201cYes. I think I\u2019d like to speak to you alone .\u201d He didn\u2019t look as apprehensive as I thought he should. I waited to begin until we were safely in his car. \u201cWhat was that ?\u201d I demanded. \u201cI know you want to see your mother, Bella \u2014 you\u2019ve been talking about her in your sleep. Worrying actually.\u201d \u201cI have?\u201d He nodded. \u201cBut, clearly, you were too much of a coward to deal with Charlie, so I interceded on your behalf.\u201d \u201cInterceded? You threw me to the sharks!\u201d He rolled his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t think you were in any danger.\u201d \u201cI told you I didn\u2019t want to fight with Charlie.\u201d \u201cNobody said that you had to.\u201d I glowered at him. \u201cI can\u2019t help myself when he gets all bossy like that \u2014 my natural teenage instincts overpower me.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cWell, that\u2019s not my fault.\u201d I stared at him, speculating. He didn\u2019t seem to notice. His face was serene as he gazed out the windshield. Something was off, but I couldn\u2019t put my finger on it. Or maybe it was just my imagination again, running wild like it had this afternoon. \u00a0\u201cDoes this sudden urge to see Florida have anything to do with the party at Billy\u2019s place?\u201d His jaw flexed. \u201cNothing at all. It wouldn\u2019t matter if you were here or on the other side of the world, you still wouldn\u2019t be going.\u201d It was just like with Charlie before \u2014 just like being treated as a misbehaving child. I gritted my teeth together so I wouldn\u2019t start shouting. I didn\u2019t want to fight with Edward, too. Edward sighed, and when he spoke his voice was warm and velvet again. \u201cSo what do you want to do tonight?\u201d he asked. \u201cCan we go to your house? I haven\u2019t seen Esme in so long.\u201d He smiled. \u201cShe\u2019ll like that. Especially when she hears what we\u2019re doing this weekend.\u201d I groaned in defeat. We didn\u2019t stay out late, as I\u2019d promised. I was not surprised to see the lights still on when we pulled up in front of the house \u2014 I knew Charlie would be waiting to yell at me some more. \u201cYou\u2019d better not come inside,\u201d I said. \u201cIt will only make things worse.\u201d \u201cHis thoughts are relatively calm,\u201d Edward teased. His expression made me wonder if there was some additional joke I was missing. The corners of his mouth twitched, fighting a smile. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later,\u201d I muttered glumly. He laughed and kissed the top of my head. \u201cI\u2019ll be back when Charlie\u2019s snoring.\u201d The TV was loud when I got inside. I briefly considered trying to sneak past him. \u201cCould you come in here, Bella?\u201d Charlie called, sinking that plan. My feet dragged as I took the five necessary steps. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Dad?\u201d \u201cDid you have a nice time tonight?\u201d he asked. He seemed ill at ease. I looked for hidden meanings in his words before I answered. \u201cYes,\u201d I said hesitantly. \u00a0\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d I shrugged. \u201cHung out with Alice and Jasper. Edward beat Alice at chess, and then I played Jasper. He buried me.\u201d I smiled. Edward and Alice playing chess was one of the funniest things I\u2019d ever seen. They\u2019d sat there nearly motionless, staring at the board, while Alice foresaw the moves he would make and he picked the moves she would make in return out of her head. They played most of the game in their minds; I think they\u2019d each moved two pawns when Alice suddenly flicked her king over and surrendered. It took all of three minutes. Charlie hit the mute button \u2014 an unusual action. \u201cLook, there\u2019s something I need to say.\u201d He frowned, looking very uncomfortable. I sat still, waiting. He met my gaze for a second before shifting his eyes to the floor. He didn\u2019t say anything more. \u201cWhat is it, Dad?\u201d He sighed. \u201cI\u2019m not good at this kind of thing. I don\u2019t know how to start. . . .\u201d I waited again. \u201cOkay, Bella. Here\u2019s the thing.\u201d He got up from the couch and started pacing back and forth across the room, looking as his feet all the time. \u201cYou and Edward seem pretty serious, and there are some things that you need to be careful about. I know you\u2019re an adult now, but you\u2019re still young, Bella, and there are a lot of important things you need to know when you . . . well, when you\u2019re physically involved with \u2014\u201d \u201cOh, please, please no!\u201d I begged, jumping to my feet. \u201cPlease tell me you are not trying to have a sex talk with me, Charlie.\u201d He glared at the floor. \u201cI am your father. I have responsibilities. Remember, I\u2019m just as embarrassed as you are.\u201d \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s humanly possible. Anyway, Mom beat you to the punch about ten years ago.\u00a0 You\u2019re off the hook.\u201d \u201cTen years ago you didn\u2019t have a boyfriend,\u201d he muttered unwillingly. I could tell he was battling with his desire to drop the subject. We were both standing up, looking at the floor, and facing away from each other. \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t think the essentials have changed that much,\u201d I mumbled, and my face had to be as red as his. This was beyond the seventh circle of Hades; even worse was realizing that Edward had known this was coming. No wonder he\u2019d seemed so smug in the car. \u00a0\u201cJust tell me that you two are being responsible,\u201d Charlie pled, obviously wishing a pit would open in the floor so that he could fall in. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Dad, it\u2019s not like that.\u201d \u201cNot that I don\u2019t trust you, Bella, but I know you don\u2019t want to tell me anything about this, and you know I don\u2019t really want to hear it. I will try to be open-minded, though. I know the times have changed.\u201d I laughed awkwardly. \u201cMaybe the times have, but Edward is very old-fashioned. You have nothing to worry about.\u201d Charlie sighed. \u201cSure he is,\u201d he muttered. \u201cUgh!\u201d I groaned. \u201cI really wish you were not forcing me to say this out loud, Dad. Really. But . . . I am a . . . virgin, and I have no immediate plans to change that status.\u201d We both cringed, but then Charlie\u2019s face smoothed out. He seemed to believe me. \u201cCan I go to bed, now? Please. \u201d \u201cIn a minute,\u201d he said. \u201cAw, please, Dad? I\u2019m begging you.\u201d \u201cThe embarrassing part\u2019s over, I promise,\u201d he assured me. I shot a glance at him, and was grateful to see that he looked more relaxed, that his face was back to its regular color. He sank down onto the sofa, sighing with relief that he was past the sex speech. \u201cWhat now?\u201d \u201cI just wanted to know how the balance thing is coming along.\u201d \u201cOh. Good, I guess. I made plans with Angela today. I\u2019m going to help her with her graduation announcements. Just us girls.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s nice. And what about Jake?\u201d I sighed. \u201cI haven\u2019t figured that one out yet, Dad.\u201d \u201cKeep trying, Bella. I know you\u2019ll do the right thing. You\u2019re a good person.\u201d Nice. So if I didn\u2019t figure out some way to make things right with Jacob, then I was a bad person? That was below the belt. \u00a0\u201cSure, sure,\u201d I agreed. The automatic response almost made me smile \u2014 it was something I\u2019d picked up from Jacob. I even said it in the same patronizing tone he used with his own father. Charlie grinned and turned the sound back on. He slumped lower into the cushions, pleased with his night\u2019s work. I could tell he would be up with the game for a while. \u201c\u2019Night, Bells.\u201d \u201cSee you in the morning!\u201d I sprinted for the stairs. Edward was long gone and he wouldn\u2019t be back until Charlie was asleep \u2014 he was probably out hunting or something to pass the time \u2014 so I was in no hurry to undress for bed. I wasn\u2019t in the mood to be alone, but I certainly wasn\u2019t going to go back downstairs to hang out with my Dad, just in case he thought of some topic of sex education that he hadn\u2019t touched on before; I shuddered. So, thanks to Charlie, I was wound up and anxious.  My homework was done and I didn\u2019t feel mellow enough for reading or just listening to music. I considered calling Ren\u00e9e with the news of my visit, but then I realized that it was three hours later in Florida, and she would be asleep.  I could call Angela, I supposed. But suddenly I knew that it wasn\u2019t Angela that I wanted to talk to. That I needed to talk to. I stared at the blank black window, biting my lip. I don\u2019t know how long I stood there weighing the pros against the cons \u2014 doing the right thing by Jacob, seeing my closest friend again, being a good person, versus making Edward furious with me. Ten minutes maybe. Long enough to decide that the pros were valid while the cons were not. Edward was only concerned about my safety, and I knew that there was really no problem on that count. The phone wasn\u2019t any help; Jacob had refused to answer my phone calls since Edward\u2019s return. Besides, I needed to see him \u2014 see him smiling again the way he used to. I needed to replace that awful last memory of his face warped and twisted by pain if I was ever going to have any peace of mind. I had an hour probably. I could make a quick run down to La Push and be back before Edward realized I had gone. It was past my curfew, but would Charlie really care about that when Edward wasn\u2019t involved? One way to find out. I grabbed my jacket and shoved my arms through the sleeves as I ran down the stairs. Charlie looked up from the game, instantly suspicious. \u201cYou care if I go see Jake tonight?\u201d I asked breathlessly. \u201cI won\u2019t stay long.\u201d As soon as I said Jake\u2019s name, Charlie\u2019s expression relaxed into a smug smile. He didn\u2019t seem surprised at all that his lecture had taken effect so quickly. \u201cSure, kid. No problem. Stay as long as you like.\u201d \u201cThanks, Dad,\u201d I said as I darted out the door. Like any fugitive, I couldn\u2019t help looking over my shoulder a few times while I jogged to my truck, but the night was so black that there really was no point. I had to feel my way along the side of the truck to the handle. My eyes were just beginning to adjust as I shoved my keys in the ignition. I twisted them hard to the left, but instead of roaring deafeningly to life, the engine just clicked. I tried it again with the same results. And then a small motion in my peripheral vision made me jump. \u201cGah!\u201d I gasped in shock when I saw that I was not alone in the cab. Edward sat very still, a faint bright spot in the darkness, only his hands moving as he turned a mysterious black object around and around. He stared at the object as he spoke. \u201cAlice called,\u201d he murmured. Alice! Damn. I\u2019d forgotten to account for her in my plans. He must have her watching me. \u201cShe got nervous when your future rather abruptly disappeared five minutes ago.\u201d My eyes, already wide with surprise, popped wider. \u201cBecause she can\u2019t see the wolves, you know,\u201d he explained in the same low murmur. \u201cHad you forgotten that? When you decide to mingle your fate with theirs, you disappear, too. You couldn\u2019t know that part, I realize that. But can you understand why that might make me a little . . . anxious? Alice saw you disappear, and she couldn\u2019t even tell if you\u2019d come home or not. Your future got lost, just like theirs. \u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re not sure why this is. Some natural defense they\u2019re born with?\u201d He spoke as if he were talking to himself now, still looking at the piece of my truck\u2019s engine as he twirled it in his hands. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t seem entirely likely, since I haven\u2019t had any trouble reading their thoughts. The Blacks\u2019 at least. Carlisle theorizes that it\u2019s because their lives are so ruled by their transformations. It\u2019s more an involuntary reaction than a decision. Utterly unpredictable, and it changes everything about them. In that instant when they shift from one form to the other, they don\u2019t really even exist. The future can\u2019t hold them. . . .\u201d I listened to his musing in stony silence. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll put your car back together in time for school, in case you\u2019d like to drive yourself,\u201d he assured me after a minute. With my lips mashed together, I retrieved my keys and stiffly climbed out of the truck. \u201cShut your window if you want me to stay away tonight. I\u2019ll understand,\u201d he whispered just before I slammed the door. I stomped into the house, slamming that door, too. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Charlie demanded from the couch. \u201cTruck won\u2019t start,\u201d I growled. \u00a0\u201cWant me to look at it?\u201d \u201cNo. I\u2019ll try it in the morning.\u201d \u00a0\u201cWant to use my car?\u201d I wasn\u2019t supposed to drive his police cruiser. Charlie must be really desperate to get me to La Push. Nearly as desperate as I was. \u201cNo. I\u2019m tired,\u201d I grumbled. \u201c\u2019Night.\u201d I stamped my way up the stairs, and went straight to my window. I shoved the metal frame roughly \u2014 it crashed shut and the glass trembled. I stared at the shivering black glass for a long moment, until it was still. Then I sighed, and opened the window as wide as it would go.",
