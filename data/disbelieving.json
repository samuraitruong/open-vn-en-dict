            "en": "17         17. THE GAME It was just beginning to drizzle when Edward turned onto my street. Up until that moment, I'd had no doubt that he'd be staying with me while I spent a few interim hours in the real world. And then I saw the black car, a weathered Ford, parked in Charlie's driveway \u2014 and heard Edward mutter something unintelligible in a low, harsh voice. Leaning away from the rain under the shallow front porch, Jacob Black stood behind his father's wheelchair. Billy's face was impassive as stone as Edward parked my truck against the curb. Jacob stared down, his expression mortified. Edward's low voice was furious. \"This is crossing the line.\" \"He came to warn Charlie?\" I guessed, more horrified than angry. Edward just nodded, answering Billy's gaze through the rain with narrowed eyes. I felt weak with relief that Charlie wasn't home yet. \"Let me deal with this,\" I suggested. Edward's black glare made me anxious. To my surprise, he agreed. \"That's probably best. Be careful, though. The child has no idea.\" I bridled a little at the word child. \"Jacob is not that much younger than I am,\" I reminded him. He looked at me then, his anger abruptly fading. \"Oh, I know,\" he assured me with a grin. I sighed and put my hand on the door handle. \"Get them inside,\" he instructed, \"so I can leave. I'll be back around dusk.\" \"Do you want my truck?\" I offered, meanwhile wondering how I would explain its absence to Charlie. He rolled his eyes. \"I could walk home faster than this truck moves.\" \"You don't have to leave,\" I said wistfully. He smiled at my glum expression. \"Actually, I do. After you get rid of them\" \u2014 he threw a dark glance in the Blacks' direction \u2014 \"you still have to prepare Charlie to meet your new boyfriend.\" He grinned widely, showing all of his teeth. I groaned. \"Thanks a lot.\" He smiled the crooked smile that I loved. \"I'll be back soon,\" he promised. His eyes flickered back to the porch, and then he leaned in to swiftly kiss me just under the edge of my jaw. My heart lurched frantically, and I, too, glanced toward the porch. Billy's face was no longer impassive, and his hands clutched at the armrests of his chair. \"Soon,\" I stressed as I opened the door and stepped out into the rain. I could feel his eyes on my back as I half-ran through the light sprinkle toward the porch. \"Hey, Billy. Hi, Jacob.\" I greeted them as cheerfully as I could manage. \"Charlie's gone for the day \u2014 I hope you haven't been waiting long.\" \"Not long,\" Billy said in a subdued tone. His black eyes were piercing. \"I just wanted to bring this up.\" He indicated a brown paper sack resting in his lap. \"Thanks,\" I said, though I had no idea what it could be. \"Why don't you come in for a minute and dry off?\" I pretended to be oblivious to his intense scrutiny as I unlocked the door, and waved them in ahead of me. \"Here, let me take that,\" I offered, turning to shut the door. I allowed myself one last glance at Edward. He was waiting, perfectly still, his eyes solemn. \"You'll want to put it in the fridge,\" Billy noted as he handed me the package. \"It's some of Harry Clearwater's homemade fish fry \u2014 Charlie's favorite. The fridge keeps it drier.\" He shrugged. \"Thanks,\" I repeated, but with feeling this time. \"I was running out of new ways to fix fish, and he's bound to bring home more tonight.\" \"Fishing again?\" Billy asked with a subtle gleam in his eye. \"Down at the usual spot? Maybe I'll run by and see him.\" \"No,\" I quickly lied, my face going hard. \"He was headed someplace new\u2026 but I have no idea where.\" He took in my changed expression, and it made him thoughtful. \"Jake,\" he said, still appraising me. \"Why don't you go get that new picture of Rebecca out of the car? I'll leave that for Charlie, too.\" \"Where is it?\" Jacob asked, his voice morose. I glanced at him, but he was staring at the floor, his eyebrows pulling together. \"I think I saw it in the trunk,\" Billy said. \"You may have to dig for it.\" Jacob slouched back out into the rain. Billy and I faced each other in silence. After a few seconds, the quiet started to feel awkward, so I turned and headed to the kitchen. I could hear his wet wheels squeak against the linoleum as he followed. I shoved the bag onto the crowded top shelf of the fridge, and spun around to confront him. His deeply lined face was unreadable. \"Charlie won't be back for a long time.\" My voice was almost rude. He nodded in agreement, but said nothing. \"Thanks again for the fish fry,\" I hinted. He continued nodding. I sighed and folded my arms across my chest. He seemed to sense that I had given up on small talk. \"Bella,\" he said, and then he hesitated. I waited. \"Bella,\" he said again, \"Charlie is one of my best friends.\" \"Yes.\" He spoke each word carefully in his rumbling voice. \"I noticed you've been spending time with one of the Cullens.\" \"Yes,\" I repeated curtly. His eyes narrowed. \"Maybe it's none of my business, but I don't think that is such a good idea.\" \"You're right,\" I agreed. \"It is none of your business.\" He raised his graying eyebrows at my tone. \"You probably don't know this, but the Cullen family has an unpleasant reputation on the reservation.\" \"Actually, I did know that,\" I informed him in a hard voice. This surprised him. \"But that reputation couldn't be deserved, could it?\u00a0 Because the Cullens never set foot on the reservation, do they?\" I could see that my less than subtle reminder of the agreement that both bound and protected his tribe pulled him up short. \"That's true,\" he acceded, his eyes guarded. \"You seem\u2026 well informed about the Cullens. More informed than I expected.\" I stared him down. \"Maybe even better informed than you are.\" He pursed his thick lips as he considered that. \"Maybe.\" he allowed, but his eyes were shrewd. \"Is Charlie as well informed?\" He had found the weak chink in my armor. \"Charlie likes the Cullens a lot,\" I hedged. He clearly understood my evasion. His expression was unhappy, but unsurprised. \"It's not my business,\" he said. \"But it may be Charlie's.\" \"Though it would be my business, again, whether or not I think that it's Charlie's business, right?\" I wondered if he even understood my confused question as I struggled not to say anything compromising. But he seemed to. He thought about it while the rain picked up against the roof, the only sound breaking the silence. \"Yes,\" he finally surrendered. \"I guess that's your business, too.\" I sighed with relief. \"Thanks, Billy.\" \"Just think about what you're doing, Bella,\" he urged. \"Okay,\" I agreed quickly. He frowned. \"What I meant to say was, don't do what you're doing.\" I looked into his eyes, filled with nothing but concern for me, and there was nothing I could say. Just then the front door banged loudly, and I jumped at the sound. \"There's no picture anywhere in that car.\" Jacob's complaining voice reached us before he did. The shoulders of his shirt were stained with the rain, his hair dripping, when he rounded the corner. \"Hmm,\" Billy grunted, suddenly detached, spinning his chair around to face his son. \"I guess I left it at home.\" Jacob rolled his eyes dramatically. \"Great.\" \"Well, Bella, tell Charlie\" \u2014 Billy paused before continuing \u2014 \"that we stopped by, I mean.\" \"I will,\" I muttered. Jacob was surprised. \"Are we leaving already?\" \"Charlie's gonna be out late,\" Billy explained as he rolled himself past Jacob. \"Oh.\" Jacob looked disappointed. \"Well, I guess I'll see you later, then, Bella.\" \"Sure,\" I agreed. \"Take care,\" Billy warned me. I didn't answer. Jacob helped his father out the door. I waved briefly, glancing swiftly toward my now-empty truck, and then shut the door before they were gone. I stood in the hallway for a minute, listening to the sound of their car as it backed out and drove away. I stayed where I was, waiting for the irritation and anxiety to subside. When the tension eventually faded a bit, I headed upstairs to change out of my dressy clothes. I tried on a couple of different tops, not sure what to expect tonight. As I concentrated on what was coming, what had just passed became insignificant. Now that I was removed from Jasper's and Edward's influence, I began to make up for not being terrified before. I gave up quickly on choosing an outfit \u2014 throwing on an old flannel shirt and jeans \u2014 knowing I would be in my raincoat all night anyway. The phone rang and I sprinted downstairs to get it. There was only one voice I wanted to hear; anything else would be a disappointment. But I knew that if he wanted to talk to me, he'd probably just materialize in my room. \"Hello?\" I asked, breathless. \"Bella? It's me,\" Jessica said. \"Oh, hey, Jess.\" I scrambled for a moment to come back down to reality. It felt like months rather than days since I'd spoken to Jess. \"How was the dance?\" \"It was so much fun!\" Jessica gushed. Needing no more invitation than that, she launched into a minute-by-minute account of the previous night. I mmm'd and ahh'd at the right places, but it wasn't easy to concentrate. Jessica, Mike, the dance, the school \u2014 they all seemed strangely irrelevant at the moment. My eyes kept flashing to the window, trying to judge the degree of light behind the heavy clouds. \"Did you hear what I said, Bella?\" Jess asked, irritated. \"I'm sorry, what?\" \"I said, Mike kissed me! Can you believe it?\" \"That's wonderful, Jess,\" I said. \"So what did you do yesterday?\" Jessica challenged, still sounding bothered by my lack of attention. Or maybe she was upset because I hadn't asked for details. \"Nothing, really. I just hung around outside to enjoy the sun.\" I heard Charlie's car in the garage. \"Did you ever hear anything more from Edward Cullen?\" The front door slammed and I could hear Charlie banging around under the stairs, putting his tackle away. \"Um.\" I hesitated, not sure what my story was anymore. \"Hi there, kiddo!\" Charlie called as he walked into the kitchen. I waved at him. Jess heard his voice. \"Oh, your dad's there. Never mind \u2014 we'll talk tomorrow. See you in Trig.\" \"See ya, Jess.\" I hung up the phone. \"Hey, Dad,\" I said. He was scrubbing his hands in the sink. \"Where's the fish?\" \"I put it out in the freezer.\" \"I'll go grab a few pieces before they freeze \u2014 Billy dropped off some of Harry Clearwater's fish fry this afternoon.\" I worked to sound enthusiastic. \"He did?\" Charlie's eyes lit up. \"That's my favorite.\" Charlie cleaned up while I got dinner ready. It didn't take long till we were sitting at the table, eating in silence. Charlie was enjoying his food. I was wondering desperately how to fulfill my assignment, struggling to think of a way to broach the subject. \"What did you do with yourself today?\" he asked, snapping me out of my reverie. \"Well, this afternoon I just hung out around the house\u2026\" Only the very recent part of this afternoon, actually. I tried to keep my voice upbeat, but my stomach was hollow. \"And this morning I was over at the Cullens'.\" Charlie dropped his fork. \"Dr. Cullen's place?\" he asked in astonishment. I pretended not to notice his reaction. \"Yeah.\" \"What were you doing there?\" He hadn't picked his fork back up. \"Well, I sort of have a date with Edward Cullen tonight, and he wanted to introduce me to his parents\u2026 Dad?\" It appeared that Charlie was having an aneurysm. \"Dad, are you all right?\" \"You are going out with Edward Cullen?\" he thundered. Uh-oh. \"I thought you liked the Cullens.\" \"He's too old for you,\" he ranted. \"We're both juniors,\" I corrected, though he was more right than he dreamed. \"Wait\u2026\" He paused. \"Which one is Edwin?\" \"Edward is the youngest, the one with the reddish brown hair.\" The beautiful one, the godlike one\u2026 \"Oh, well, that's\" \u2014 he struggled \u2014 \"better, I guess. I don't like the look of that big one. I'm sure he's a nice boy and all, but he looks too\u2026 mature for you. Is this Edwin your boyfriend?\" \"It's Edward, Dad.\" \"Is he?\" \"Sort of, I guess.\" \"You said last night that you weren't interested in any of the boys in town.\" But he picked up his fork again, so I could see the worst was over. \"Well, Edward doesn't live in town, Dad.\" He gave me a disparaging look as he chewed. \"And, anyways,\" I continued, \"it's kind of at an early stage, you know.\u00a0 Don't embarrass me with all the boyfriend talk, okay?\" \"When is he coming over?\" \"He'll be here in a few minutes.\" \"Where is he taking you?\" I groaned loudly. \"I hope you're getting the Spanish Inquisition out of your system now. We're going to play baseball with his family.\" His face puckered, and then he finally chuckled. \"You're playing baseball?\" \"Well, I'll probably watch most of the time.\" \"You must really like this guy,\" he observed suspiciously. I sighed and rolled my eyes for his benefit. I heard the roar of an engine pull up in front of the house. I jumped up and started cleaning my dishes. \"Leave the dishes, I can do them tonight. You baby me too much.\" The doorbell rang, and Charlie stalked off to answer it. I was half a step behind him. I hadn't realized how hard it was pouring outside. Edward stood in the halo of the porch light, looking like a male model in an advertisement for raincoats. \"Come on in, Edward.\" I breathed a sigh of relief when Charlie got his name right. \"Thanks, Chief Swan,\" Edward said in a respectful voice. \"Go ahead and call me Charlie. Here, I'll take your jacket.\" \"Thanks, sir.\" \"Have a seat there, Edward.\" I grimaced. Edward sat down fluidly in the only chair, forcing me to sit next to Chief Swan on the sofa. I quickly shot him a dirty look. He winked behind Charlie's back. \"So I hear you're getting my girl to watch baseball.\" Only in Washington would the fact that it was raining buckets have no bearing at all on the playing of outdoor sports. \"Yes, sir, that's the plan.\" He didn't look surprised that I'd told my father the truth. He might have been listening, though. \"Well, more power to you, I guess.\" Charlie laughed, and Edward joined in. \"Okay.\" I stood up. \"Enough humor at my expense. Let's go.\" I walked back to the hall and pulled on my jacket. They followed. \"Not too late, Bell.\" \"Don't worry, Charlie, I'll have her home early,\" Edward promised. \"You take care of my girl, all right?\" I groaned, but they ignored me. \"She'll be safe with me, I promise, sir.\" Charlie couldn't doubt Edward's sincerity, it rang in every word. I stalked out. They both laughed, and Edward followed me. I stopped dead on the porch. There, behind my truck, was a monster Jeep. Its tires were higher than my waist. There were metal guards over the headlights and tail-lights, and four large spotlights attached to the crash bar. The hardtop was shiny red. Charlie let out a low whistle. \"Wear your seat belts,\" he choked out. Edward followed me around to my side and opened the door. I gauged the distance to the seat and prepared to jump for it. He sighed, and then lifted me in with one hand. I hoped Charlie didn't notice. As he went around to the driver's side, at a normal, human pace, I tried to put on my seat belt. But there were too many buckles. \"What's all this?\" I asked when he opened the door. \"It's an off-roading harness.\" \"Uh-oh.\" I tried to find the right places for all the buckles to fit, but it wasn't going too quickly. He sighed again and reached over to help me. I was glad that the rain was too heavy to see Charlie clearly on the porch. That meant he couldn't see how Edward's hands lingered at my neck, brushed along my collarbones. I gave up trying to help him and focused on not hyperventilating. Edward turned the key and the engine roared to life. We pulled away from the house. \"This is a\u2026 um\u2026 big Jeep you have.\" \"It's Emmett's. I didn't think you'd want to run the whole way.\" \"Where do you keep this thing?\" \"We remodeled one of the outbuildings into a garage.\" \"Aren't you going to put on your seat belt?\" He threw me a <em>disbelieving</em> look. Then something sunk in. \"Run the whole way? As in, we're still going to run part of the way?\" My voice edged up a few octaves. He grinned tightly. \"You're not going to run.\" \"I'm going to be sick.\" \"Keep your eyes closed, you'll be fine.\" I bit my lip, fighting the panic. He leaned over to kiss the top of my head, and then groaned. I looked at him, puzzled. \"You smell so good in the rain,\" he explained. \"In a good way, or in a bad way?\" I asked cautiously. He sighed. \"Both, always both.\" I don't know how he found his way in the gloom and downpour, but he somehow found a side road that was less of a road and more of a mountain path. For a long while conversation was impossible, because I was bouncing up and down on the seat like a jackhammer. He seemed to enjoy the ride, though, smiling hugely the whole way. And then we came to the end of the road; the trees formed green walls on three sides of the Jeep. The rain was a mere drizzle, slowing every second, the sky brighter through the clouds. \"Sorry, Bella, we have to go on foot from here.\" \"You know what? I'll just wait here.\" \"What happened to all your courage? You were extraordinary this morning.\" \"I haven't forgotten the last time yet.\" Could it have been only yesterday? He was around to my side of the car in a blur. He started unbuckling me. \"I'll get those, you go on ahead,\" I protested. \"Hmmm\u2026\" he mused as he quickly finished. \"It seems I'm going to have to tamper with your memory.\" Before I could react, he pulled me from the Jeep and set my feet on the ground. It was barely misting now; Alice was going to be right. \"Tamper with my memory?\" I asked nervously. \"Something like that.\" He was watching me intently, carefully, but there was humor deep in his eyes. He placed his hands against the Jeep on either side of my head and leaned forward, forcing me to press back against the door. He leaned in even closer, his face inches from mine. I had no room to escape. \"Now,\" he breathed, and just his smell disturbed my thought processes, \"what exactly are you worrying about?\" \"Well, um, hitting a tree \u2014\" I gulped \"\u2014 and dying. And then getting sick.\" He fought back a smile. Then he bent his head down and touched his cold lips softly to the hollow at the base of my throat. \"Are you still worried now?\" he murmured against my skin. \"Yes.\" I struggled to concentrate. \"About hitting trees and getting sick.\" His nose drew a line up the skin of my throat to the point of my chin. His cold breath tickled my skin. \"And now?\" His lips whispered against my jaw. \"Trees,\" I gasped. \"Motion sickness.\" He lifted his face to kiss my eyelids. \"Bella, you don't really think I would hit a tree, do you?\" \"No, but I might.\" There was no confidence in my voice. He smelled an easy victory. He kissed slowly down my cheek, stopping just at the corner of my mouth. \"Would I let a tree hurt you?\" His lips barely brushed against my trembling lower lip. \"No,\" I breathed. I knew there was a second part to my brilliant defense, but I couldn't quite call it back. \"You see,\" he said, his lips moving against mine. \"There's nothing to be afraid of, is there?\" \"No,\" I sighed, giving up. Then he took my face in his hands almost roughly, and kissed me in earnest, his unyielding lips moving against mine. There really was no excuse for my behavior. Obviously I knew better by now. And yet I couldn't seem to stop from reacting exactly as I had the first time. Instead of keeping safely motionless, my arms reached up to twine tightly around his neck, and I was suddenly welded to his stone figure. I sighed, and my lips parted. He staggered back, breaking my grip effortlessly. \"Damn it, Bella!\" he broke off, gasping. \"You'll be the death of me, I swear you will.\" I leaned over, bracing my hands against my knees for support. \"You're indestructible,\" I mumbled, trying to catch my breath. \"I might have believed that before I met you. Now let's get out of here before I do something really stupid,\" he growled. He threw me across his back as he had before, and I could see the extra effort it took for him to be as gentle as he was. I locked my legs around his waist and secured my arms in a choke hold around his neck. \"Don't forget to close your eyes,\" he warned severely. I quickly tucked my face into his shoulder blade, under my own arm, and squeezed my eyes shut. And I could hardly tell we were moving. I could feel him gliding along beneath me, but he could have been strolling down the sidewalk, the movement was so smooth. I was tempted to peek, just to see if he was really flying through the forest like before, but I resisted. It wasn't worth that awful dizziness. I contented myself with listening to his breath come and go evenly. I wasn't quite sure we had stopped until he reached back and touched my hair. \"It's over, Bella.\" I dared to open my eyes, and, sure enough, we were at a standstill. I stiffly unlocked my stranglehold on his body and slipped to the ground, landing on my backside. \"Oh!\" I huffed as I hit the wet ground. He stared at me incredulously, evidently not sure whether he was still too mad to find me funny. But my bewildered expression pushed him over the edge, and he broke into a roar of laughter. I picked myself up, ignoring him as I brushed the mud and bracken off the back of my jacket. That only made him laugh harder. Annoyed, I began to stride off into the forest. I felt his arm around my waist. \"Where are you going, Bella?\" \"To watch a baseball game. You don't seem to be interested in playing anymore, but I'm sure the others will have fun without you.\" \"You're going the wrong way.\" I turned around without looking at him, and stalked off in the opposite direction. He caught me again. \"Don't be mad, I couldn't help myself. You should have seen your face.\" He chuckled before he could stop himself. \"Oh, you're the only one who's allowed to get mad?\" I asked, raising my eyebrows. \"I wasn't mad at you.\" \"'Bella, you'll be the death of me'?\" I quoted sourly. \"That was simply a statement of fact.\" I tried to turn away from him again, but he held me fast. \"You were mad,\" I insisted. \"Yes.\" \"But you just said \u2014\" \"That I wasn't mad at you. Can't you see that, Bella?\" He was suddenly intense, all trace of teasing gone. \"Don't you understand?\" \"See what?\" I demanded, confused by his sudden mood swing as much as his words. \"I'm never angry with you \u2014 how could I be? Brave, trusting\u2026 warm as you are.\" \"Then why?\" I whispered, remembering the black moods that pulled him away from me, that I'd always interpreted as well-justified frustration \u2014 frustration at my weakness, my slowness, my unruly human reactions\u2026 He put his hands carefully on both sides of my face. \"I infuriate myself,\" he said gently. \"The way I can't seem to keep from putting you in danger. My very existence puts you at risk. Sometimes I truly hate myself. I should be stronger, I should be able to \u2014\"  I placed my hand over his mouth. \"Don't.\" He took my hand, moving it from his lips, but holding it to his face. \"I love you,\" he said. \"It's a poor excuse for what I'm doing, but it's still true.\" It was the first time he'd said he loved me \u2014 in so many words. He might not realize it, but I certainly did. \"Now, please try to behave yourself,\" he continued, and he bent to softly brush his lips against mine. I held properly still. Then I sighed. \"You promised Chief Swan that you would have me home early, remember? We'd better get going.\" \"Yes, ma'am.\" He smiled wistfully and released all of me but one hand. He led me a few feet through the tall, wet ferns and draping moss, around a massive hemlock tree, and we were there, on the edge of an enormous open field in the lap of the Olympic peaks. It was twice the size of any baseball stadium. I could see the others all there; Esme, Emmett, and Rosalie, sitting on a bare outcropping of rock, were the closest to us, maybe a hundred yards away. Much farther out I could see Jasper and Alice, at least a quarter of a mile apart, appearing to throw something back and forth, but I never saw any ball. It looked like Carlisle was marking bases, but could they really be that far apart? When we came into view, the three on the rocks rose. Esme started toward us. Emmett followed after a long look at Rosalie's back; Rosalie had risen gracefully and strode off toward the field without a glance in our direction. My stomach quivered uneasily in response. \"Was that you we heard, Edward?\" Esme asked as she approached. \"It sounded like a bear choking,\" Emmett clarified. I smiled hesitantly at Esme. \"That was him.\" \"Bella was being unintentionally funny,\" Edward explained, quickly settling the score. Alice had left her position and was running, or dancing, toward us. She hurtled to a fluid stop at our feet. \"It's time,\" she announced. As soon as she spoke, a deep rumble of thunder shook the forest beyond us, and then crashed westward toward town. \"Eerie, isn't it?\" Emmett said with easy familiarity, winking at me. \"Let's go.\" Alice reached for Emmett's hand and they darted toward the oversized field; she ran like a gazelle. He was nearly as graceful and just as fast \u2014 yet Emmett could never be compared to a gazelle. \"Are you ready for some ball?\" Edward asked, his eyes eager, bright. I tried to sound appropriately enthusiastic. \"Go team!\" He snickered and, after mussing my hair, bounded off after the other two. His run was more aggressive, a cheetah rather than a gazelle, and he quickly overtook them. The grace and power took my breath away. \"Shall we go down?\" Esme asked in her soft, melodic voice, and I realized I was staring openmouthed after him. I quickly reassembled my expression and nodded. Esme kept a few feet between us, and I wondered if she was still being careful not to frighten me. She matched her stride to mine without seeming impatient at the pace.  \"You don't play with them?\" I asked shyly. \"No, I prefer to referee \u2014 I like keeping them honest,\" she explained. \"Do they like to cheat, then?\" \"Oh yes \u2014 you should hear the arguments they get into! Actually, I hope you don't, you would think they were raised by a pack of wolves.\" \"You sound like my mom,\" I laughed, surprised. She laughed, too. \"Well, I do think of them as my children in most ways. I never could get over my mothering instincts \u2014 did Edward tell you I had lost a child?\" \"No,\" I murmured, stunned, scrambling to understand what lifetime she was remembering. \"Yes, my first and only baby. He died just a few days after he was born, the poor tiny thing,\" she sighed. \"It broke my heart \u2014 that's why I jumped off the cliff, you know,\" she added matter-of-factly. \"Edward just said you f-fell,\" I stammered. \"Always the gentleman.\" She smiled. \"Edward was the first of my new sons. I've always thought of him that way, even though he's older than I, in one way at least.\" She smiled at me warmly. \"That's why I'm so happy that he's found you, dear.\" The endearment sounded very natural on her lips. \"He's been the odd man out for far too long; it's hurt me to see him alone.\" \"You don't mind, then?\" I asked, hesitant again. \"That I'm\u2026 all wrong for him?\" \"No.\" She was thoughtful. \"You're what he wants. It will work out, somehow,\" she said, though her forehead creased with worry. Another peal of thunder began. Esme stopped then; apparently, we'd reached the edge of the field. It looked as if they had formed teams. Edward was far out in left field, Carlisle stood between the first and second bases, and Alice held the ball, positioned on the spot that must be the pitcher's mound. Emmett was swinging an aluminum bat; it whistled almost untraceably through the air. I waited for him to approach home plate, but then I realized, as he took his stance, that he was already there \u2014 farther from the pitcher's mound than I would have thought possible. Jasper stood several feet behind him, catching for the other team. Of course, none of them had gloves. \"All right,\" Esme called in a clear voice, which I knew even Edward would hear, as far out as he was. \"Batter up.\" Alice stood straight, deceptively motionless. Her style seemed to be stealth rather than an intimidating windup. She held the ball in both hands at her waist, and then, like the strike of a cobra, her right hand flicked out and the ball smacked into Jasper's hand. \"Was that a strike?\" I whispered to Esme. \"If they don't hit it, it's a strike,\" she told me. Jasper hurled the ball back to Alice's waiting hand. She permitted herself a brief grin. And then her hand spun out again. This time the bat somehow made it around in time to smash into the invisible ball. The crack of impact was shattering, thunderous; it echoed off the mountains \u2014 I immediately understood the necessity of the thunderstorm. The ball shot like a meteor above the field, flying deep into the surrounding forest. \"Home run,\" I murmured. \"Wait,\" Esme cautioned, listening intently, one hand raised. Emmett was a blur around the bases, Carlisle shadowing him. I realized Edward was missing. \"Out!\" Esme cried in a clear voice. I stared in disbelief as Edward sprang from the fringe of the trees, ball in his upraised hand, his wide grin visible even to me. \"Emmett hits the hardest,\" Esme explained, \"but Edward runs the fastest.\" The inning continued before my incredulous eyes. It was impossible to keep up with the speed at which the ball flew, the rate at which their bodies raced around the field. I learned the other reason they waited for a thunderstorm to play when Jasper, trying to avoid Edward's infallible fielding, hit a ground ball toward Carlisle. Carlisle ran into the ball, and then raced Jasper to first base. When they collided, the sound was like the crash of two massive falling boulders. I jumped up in concern, but they were somehow unscathed. \"Safe,\" Esme called in a calm voice. Emmett's team was up by one \u2014 Rosalie managed to flit around the bases after tagging up on one of Emmett's long flies \u2014 when Edward caught the third out. He sprinted to my side, sparkling with excitement. \"What do you think?\" he asked. \"One thing's for sure, I'll never be able to sit through dull old Major League Baseball again.\" \"And it sounds like you did so much of that before,\" he laughed. \"I am a little disappointed,\" I teased. \"Why?\" he asked, puzzled. \"Well, it would be nice if I could find just one thing you didn't do better than everyone else on the planet.\" He flashed his special crooked smile, leaving me breathless. \"I'm up,\" he said, heading for the plate. He played intelligently, keeping the ball low, out of the reach of Rosalie's always-ready hand in the outfield, gaining two bases like lightning before Emmett could get the ball back in play. Carlisle knocked one so far out of the field \u2014 with a boom that hurt my ears \u2014 that he and Edward both made it in. Alice slapped them dainty high fives. The score constantly changed as the game continued, and they razzed each other like any street ballplayers as they took turns with the lead. Occasionally Esme would call them to order. The thunder rumbled on, but we stayed dry, as Alice had predicted. Carlisle was up to bat, Edward catching, when Alice suddenly gasped. My eyes were on Edward, as usual, and I saw his head snap up to look at her. Their eyes met and something flowed between them in an instant. He was at my side before the others could ask Alice what was wrong. \"Alice?\" Esme's voice was tense. \"I didn't see \u2014 I couldn't tell,\" she whispered. All the others were gathered by this time. \"What is it, Alice?\" Carlisle asked with the calm voice of authority. \"They were traveling much quicker than I thought. I can see I had the perspective wrong before,\" she murmured. Jasper leaned over her, his posture protective. \"What changed?\" he asked. \"They heard us playing, and it changed their path,\" she said, contrite, as if she felt responsible for whatever had frightened her. Seven pairs of quick eyes flashed to my face and away. \"How soon?\" Carlisle said, turning toward Edward. A look of intense concentration crossed his face. \"Less than five minutes. They're running \u2014 they want to play.\" He scowled. \"Can you make it?\" Carlisle asked him, his eyes flicking toward me again. \"No, not carrying \u2014\" He cut short. \"Besides, the last thing we need is for them to catch the scent and start hunting.\" \"How many?\" Emmett asked Alice. \"Three,\" she answered tersely. \"Three!\" he scoffed. \"Let them come.\" The steel bands of muscle flexed along his massive arms. For a split second that seemed much longer than it really was, Carlisle deliberated. Only Emmett seemed unperturbed; the rest stared at Carlisle's face with anxious eyes. \"Let's just continue the game,\" Carlisle finally decided. His voice was cool and level. \"Alice said they were simply curious.\" All this was said in a flurry of words that lasted only a few seconds. I had listened carefully and caught most of it, though I couldn't hear what Esme now asked Edward with a silent vibration of her lips. I only saw the slight shake of his head and the look of relief on her face. \"You catch, Esme,\" he said. \"I'll call it now.\" And he planted himself in front of me. The others returned to the field, warily sweeping the dark forest with their sharp eyes. Alice and Esme seemed to orient themselves around where I stood. \"Take your hair down,\" Edward said in a low, even voice. I obediently slid the rubber band out of my hair and shook it out around me. I stated the obvious. \"The others are coming now.\" \"Yes, stay very still, keep quiet, and don't move from my side, please.\" He hid the stress in his voice well, but I could hear it. He pulled my long hair forward, around my face. \"That won't help,\" Alice said softly. \"I could smell her across the field.\" \"I know.\" A hint of frustration colored his tone. Carlisle stood at the plate, and the others joined the game halfheartedly. \"What did Esme ask you?\" I whispered. He hesitated for a second before he answered. \"Whether they were thirsty,\" he muttered unwillingly. The seconds ticked by; the game progressed with apathy now. No one dared to hit harder than a bunt, and Emmett, Rosalie, and Jasper hovered in the infield.  Now and again, despite the fear that numbed my brain, I was aware of Rosalie's eyes on me. They were expressionless, but something about the way she held her mouth made me think she was angry. Edward paid no attention to the game at all, eyes and mind ranging the forest. \"I'm sorry, Bella,\" he muttered fiercely. \"It was stupid, irresponsible, to expose you like this. I'm so sorry.\" I heard his breath stop, and his eyes zeroed in on right field. He took a half step, angling himself between me and what was coming. Carlisle, Emmett, and the others turned in the same direction, hearing sounds of passage much too faint for my ears.",

            "en": "8          8. PORT ANGELES Jess drove faster than the Chief, so we made it to Port Angeles by four. It had been a while since I'd had a girls' night out, and the estrogen rush was invigorating. We listened to whiny rock songs while Jessica jabbered on about the boys we hung out with. Jessica's dinner with Mike had gone very well, and she was hoping that by Saturday night they would have progressed to the first-kiss stage. I smiled to myself, pleased. Angela was passively happy to be going to the dance, but not really interested in Eric. Jess tried to get her to confess who her type was, but I interrupted with a question about dresses after a bit, to spare her. Angela threw a grateful glance my way.  Port Angeles was a beautiful little tourist trap, much more polished and quaint than Forks. But Jessica and Angela knew it well, so they didn't plan to waste time on the picturesque boardwalk by the bay. Jess drove straight to the one big department store in town, which was a few streets in from the bay area's visitor-friendly face. The dance was billed as semiformal, and we weren't exactly sure what that meant. Both Jessica and Angela seemed surprised and almost <em>disbelieving</em> when I told them I'd never been to a dance in Phoenix. \"Didn't you ever go with a boyfriend or something?\" Jess asked dubiously as we walked through the front doors of the store. \"Really,\" I tried to convince her, not wanting to confess my dancing problems. \"I've never had a boyfriend or anything close. I didn't go out much.\" \"Why not?\" Jessica demanded. \"No one asked me,\" I answered honestly. She looked skeptical. \"People ask you out here,\" she reminded me, \"and you tell them no.\" We were in the juniors' section now, scanning the racks for dress-up clothes. \"Well, except for Tyler,\" Angela amended quietly. \"Excuse me?\" I gasped. \"What did you say?\" \"Tyler told everyone he's taking you to prom,\" Jessica informed me with suspicious eyes. \"He said what?\" I sounded like I was choking. \"I told you it wasn't true,\" Angela murmured to Jessica. I was silent, still lost in shock that was quickly turning to irritation. But we had found the dress racks, and now we had work to do. \"That's why Lauren doesn't like you,\" Jessica giggled while we pawed through the clothes. I ground my teeth. \"Do you think that if I ran him over with my truck he would stop feeling guilty about the accident? That he might give up on making amends and call it even?\" \"Maybe,\" Jess snickered. '\"If that's why he's doing this.\" The dress selection wasn't large, but both of them found a few things to try on. I sat on a low chair just inside the dressing room, by the three-way mirror, trying to control my fuming.  Jess was torn between two \u2014 one a long, strapless, basic black number, the other a knee-length electric blue with spaghetti straps. I encouraged her to go with the blue; why not play up the eyes? Angela chose a pale pink dress that draped around her tall frame nicely and brought out honey tints in her light brown hair. I complimented them both generously and helped by returning the rejects to their racks. The whole process was much shorter and easier than similar trips I'd taken with Ren\u00e9e at home. I guess there was something to be said for limited choices. We headed over to shoes and accessories. While they tried things on I merely watched and critiqued, not in the mood to shop for myself, though I did need new shoes. The girls'-night high was wearing off in the wake of my annoyance at Tyler, leaving room for the gloom to move back in.  \"Angela?\" I began, hesitant, while she was trying on a pair of pink strappy heels \u2014 she was overjoyed to have a date tall enough that she could wear high heels at all. Jessica had drifted to the jewelry counter and we were alone. \"Yes?\" She held her leg out, twisting her ankle to get a better view of the shoe. I chickened out. \"I like those.\" \"I think I'll get them \u2014 though they'll never match anything but the one dress,\" she mused. \"Oh, go ahead \u2014 they're on sale,\" I encouraged. She smiled, putting the lid back on a box that contained more practical-looking off-white shoes. I tried again. \"Um, Angela\u2026\" She looked up curiously. \"Is it normal for the\u2026 Cullens\" \u2014 I kept my eyes on the shoes \u2014 \"to be out of school a lot?\" I failed miserably in my attempt to sound nonchalant. \"Yes, when the weather is good they go backpacking all the time \u2014 even the doctor. They're all real outdoorsy,\" she told me quietly, examining her shoes, too. She didn't ask one question, let alone the hundreds that Jessica would have unleashed. I was beginning to really like Angela.  \"Oh.\" I let the subject drop as Jessica returned to show us the rhinestone jewelry she'd found to match her silver shoes. We planned to go to dinner at a little Italian restaurant on the boardwalk, but the dress shopping hadn't taken as long as we'd expected. Jess and Angela were going to take their clothes back to the car and then walk down to the bay. I told them I would meet them at the restaurant in an hour \u2014 I wanted to look for a bookstore. They were both willing to come with me, but I encouraged them to go have fun \u2014 they didn't know how preoccupied I could get when surrounded by books; it was something I preferred to do alone. They walked off to the car chattering happily, and I headed in the direction Jess pointed out. I had no trouble finding the bookstore, but it wasn't what I was looking for. The windows were full of crystals, dream-catchers, and books about spiritual healing. I didn't even go inside. Through the glass I could see a fifty-year-old woman with long, gray hair worn straight down her back, clad in a dress right out of the sixties, smiling welcomingly from behind the counter. I decided that was one conversation I could skip. There had to be a normal bookstore in town. I meandered through the streets, which were filling up with end-of-the-workday traffic, and hoped I was headed toward downtown. I wasn't paying as much attention as I should to where I was going; I was wrestling with despair. I was trying so hard not to think about him, and what Angela had said\u2026 and more than anything trying to beat down my hopes for Saturday, fearing a disappointment more painful than the rest, when I looked up to see someone's silver Volvo parked along the street and it all came crashing down on me. Stupid, unreliable vampire, I thought to myself. I stomped along in a southerly direction, toward some glass-fronted shops that looked promising. But when I got to them, they were just a repair shop and a vacant space. I still had too much time to go looking for Jess and Angela yet, and I definitely needed to get my mood in hand before I met back up with them. I ran my fingers through my hair a couple of times and took some deep breaths before I continued around the corner. I started to realize, as I crossed another road, that I was going the wrong direction. The little foot traffic I had seen was going north, and it looked like the buildings here were mostly warehouses. I decided to turn east at the next corner, and then loop around after a few blocks and try my luck on a different street on my way back to the boardwalk.  A group of four men turned around the corner I was heading for, dressed too casually to be heading home from the office, but they were too grimy to be tourists. As they approached me, I realized they weren't too many years older than I was. They were joking loudly among themselves, laughing raucously and punching each other's arms. I scooted as far to the inside of the sidewalk as I could to give them room, walking swiftly, looking past them to the corner. \"Hey, there!\" one of them called as they passed, and he had to be talking to me since no one else was around. I glanced up automatically. Two of them had paused, the other two were slowing. The closest, a heavyset, dark-haired man in his early twenties, seemed to be the one who had spoken. He was wearing a flannel shirt open over a dirty t-shirt, cut-off jeans, and sandals. He took half a step toward me.  \"Hello,\" I mumbled, a knee-jerk reaction. Then I quickly looked away and walked faster toward the corner. I could hear them laughing at full volume behind me. \"Hey, wait!\" one of them called after me again, but I kept my head down and rounded the corner with a sigh of relief. I could still hear them chortling behind me. I found myself on a sidewalk leading past the backs of several somber-colored warehouses, each with large bay doors for unloading trucks, padlocked for the night. The south side of the street had no sidewalk, only a chain-link fence topped with barbed wire protecting some kind of engine parts storage yard. I'd wandered far past the part of Port Angeles that I, as a guest, was intended to see. It was getting dark, I realized, the clouds finally returning, piling up on the western horizon, creating an early sunset. The eastern sky was still clear, but graying, shot through with streaks of pink and orange. I'd left my jacket in the car, and a sudden shiver made me cross my arms tightly across my chest. A single van passed me, and then the road was empty.  The sky suddenly darkened further, and, as I looked over my shoulder to glare at the offending cloud, I realized with a shock that two men were walking quietly twenty feet behind me.  They were from the same group I'd passed at the corner, though neither was the dark one who'd spoken to me. I turned my head forward at once, quickening my pace. A chill that had nothing to do with the weather made me shiver again. My purse was on a shoulder strap and I had it slung across my body, the way you were supposed to wear it so it wouldn't get snatched. I knew exactly where my pepper spray was \u2014 still in my duffle bag under the bed, never unpacked. I didn't have much money with me, just a twenty and some ones, and I thought about \"accidentally\" dropping my bag and walking away. But a small, frightened voice in the back of my mind warned me that they might be something worse than thieves. I listened intently to their quiet footsteps, which were much too quiet when compared to the boisterous noise they'd been making earlier, and it didn't sound like they were speeding up, or getting any closer to me.  Breathe, I had to remind myself. You don't know they're following you. I continued to walk as quickly as I could without actually running, focusing on the right-hand turn that was only a few yards away from me now. I could hear them, staying as far back as they'd been before. A blue car turned onto the street from the south and drove \u00a0quickly past me. I thought of jumping out in front of it, but I hesitated, inhibited, unsure that I was really being pursued, and then it was too late. I reached the corner, but a swift glance revealed that it was only a blind drive to the back of another building. I was half-turned in anticipation; I had to hurriedly correct and dash across the narrow drive, back to the sidewalk. The street ended at the next corner, where there was a stop sign. I concentrated on the faint footsteps behind me, deciding whether or not to run. They sounded farther back, though, and I knew they could outrun me in any case. I was sure to trip and go sprawling if I tried to go any faster. The footfalls were definitely farther back. I risked a quick glance over my shoulder, and they were maybe forty feet back now, I saw with relief. But they were both staring at me. It seemed to take forever for me to get to the corner. I kept my pace steady, the men behind me falling ever so slightly farther behind with every step. Maybe they realized they had scared me and were sorry. I saw two cars going north pass the intersection I was heading for, and I exhaled in relief. There would be more people around once I got off this deserted street. I skipped around the corner with a grateful sigh.  And skidded to a stop. The street was lined on both sides by blank, doorless, windowless walls.  I could see in the distance, two intersections down, streetlamps, cars, and more pedestrians, but they were all too far away. Because lounging against the western building, midway down the street, were the other two men from the group, both watching with excited smiles as I froze dead on the sidewalk. I realized then that I wasn't being followed. I was being herded. I paused for only a second, but it felt like a very long time. I turned then and darted to the other side of the road. I had a sinking feeling that it was a wasted attempt. The footsteps behind me were louder now.  \"There you are!\" The booming voice of the stocky, dark-haired man shattered the intense quiet and made me jump. In the gathering darkness, it seemed like he was looking past me. \"Yeah,\" a voice called loudly from behind me, making me jump again as I tried to hurry down the street. \"We just took a little detour.\"  My steps had to slow now. I was closing the distance between myself and the lounging pair too quickly. I had a good loud scream, and I sucked in air, preparing to use it, but my throat was so dry I wasn't sure how much volume I could manage. With a quick movement I slipped my purse over my head, gripping the strap with one hand, ready to surrender it or use it as weapon as need demanded. The thickset man shrugged away from the wall as I warily came to a stop, and walked slowly into the street.  \"Stay away from me,\" I warned in a voice that was supposed to sound strong and fearless. But I was right about the dry throat \u2014 no volume.  \"Don't be like that, sugar,\" he called, and the raucous laughter started again behind me. I braced myself, feet apart, trying to remember through my panic what little self-defense I knew. Heel of the hand thrust upward, hopefully breaking the nose or shoving it into the brain. Finger through the eye socket \u2014 try to hook around and pop the eye out. And the standard knee to the groin, of course. That same pessimistic voice in my mind spoke up then, reminding me that I probably wouldn't have a chance against one of them, and there were four. Shut up! I commanded the voice before terror could incapacitate me. I wasn't going out without taking someone with me.  I tried to swallow so I could build up a decent scream.  Headlights suddenly flew around the corner, the car almost hitting the stocky one, forcing him to jump back toward the sidewalk. I dove into the road \u2014 this car was going to stop, or have to hit me. But the silver car unexpectedly fishtailed around, skidding to a stop with the passenger door open just a few feet from me. \"Get in,\" a furious voice commanded. It was amazing how instantaneously the choking fear vanished, amazing how suddenly the feeling of security washed over me \u2014 even before I was off the street \u2014 as soon as I heard his voice. I jumped into the seat, slamming the door shut behind me. It was dark in the car, no light had come on with the opening of the door, and I could barely see his face in the glow from the dashboard. The tires squealed as he spun around to face north, accelerating too quickly, swerving toward the stunned men on the street. I caught a glimpse of them diving for the sidewalk as we straightened out and sped toward the harbor. \"Put on your seat belt,\" he commanded, and I realized I was clutching the seat with both hands. I quickly obeyed; the snap as the belt connected was loud in the darkness. He took a sharp left, racing forward, blowing through several stop signs without a pause. But I felt utterly safe and, for the moment, totally unconcerned about where we were going. I stared at his face in profound relief, relief that went beyond my sudden deliverance. I studied his flawless features in the limited light, waiting for my breath to return to normal, until it occurred to me that his expression was murderously angry. \"Are you okay?\" I asked, surprised at how hoarse my voice sounded. \"No,\" he said curtly, and his tone was livid. I sat in silence, watching his face while his blazing eyes stared straight ahead, until the car came to a sudden stop. I glanced around, but it was too dark to see anything beside the vague outline of dark trees crowding the roadside. We weren't in town anymore.  \"Bella?\" he asked, his voice tight, controlled. \"Yes?\" My voice was still rough. I tried to clear my throat quietly. \"Are you all right?\" He still didn't look at me, but the fury was plain on his face. \"Yes,\" I croaked softly. \"Distract me, please,\" he ordered. \"I'm sorry, what?\" He exhaled sharply. \"Just prattle about something unimportant until I calm down,\" he clarified, closing his eyes and pinching the bridge of his nose with his thumb and forefinger. \"Um.\" I wracked my brain for something trivial. \"I'm going to run over Tyler Crowley tomorrow before school?\" He was still squeezing his eyes closed, but the corner of his mouth twitched. \"Why?\" \"He's telling everyone that he's taking me to prom \u2014 either he's insane or he's still trying to make up for almost killing me last\u2026 well, you remember it, and he thinks prom is somehow the correct way to do this. So I figure if I endanger his life, then we're even, and he can't keep trying to make amends. I don't need enemies and maybe Lauren would back off if he left me alone. I might have to total his Sentra, though. If he doesn't have a ride he can't take anyone to prom\u2026\" I babbled on. \"I heard about that.\" He sounded a bit more composed. \"You did?\" I asked in disbelief, my previous irritation flaring. \"If he's paralyzed from the neck down, he can't go to the prom, either,\" I muttered, refining my plan. Edward sighed, and finally opened his eyes.  \"Better?\" \"Not really.\" I waited, but he didn't speak again. He leaned his head back against the seat, staring at the ceiling of the car. His face was rigid.  \"What's wrong?\" My voice came out in a whisper. \"Sometimes I have a problem with my temper, Bella.\" He was whispering, too, and as he stared out the window, his eyes narrowed into slits. \"But it wouldn't be helpful for me to turn around and hunt down those\u2026\" He didn't finish his sentence, looking away, struggling for a moment to control his anger again. \"At least,\" he continued, \"that's what I'm trying to convince myself.\" \"Oh.\" The word seemed inadequate, but I couldn't think of a better response. We sat in silence again. I glanced at the clock on the dashboard. It was past six-thirty.  \"Jessica and Angela will be worried,\" I murmured. \"I was supposed to meet them.\" He started the engine without another word, turning around smoothly and speeding back toward town. We were under the streetlights in no time at all, still going too fast, weaving with ease through the cars slowly cruising the boardwalk. He parallel-parked against the curb in a space I would have thought much too small for the Volvo, but he slid in effortlessly in one try. I looked out the window to see the lights of La Bella Italia, and Jess and Angela just leaving, pacing anxiously away from us. \"How did you know where\u2026 ?\" I began, but then I just shook my head. I heard the door open and turned to see him getting out. \"What are you doing?\" I asked. \"I'm taking you to dinner.\" He smiled slightly, but his eyes were hard.  He stepped out of the car and slammed the door. I fumbled with my seat belt, and then hurried to get out of the car as well. He was waiting for me on the sidewalk. He spoke before I could. \"Go stop Jessica and Angela before I have to track them down, too. I don't think I could restrain myself if I ran into your other friends again.\" I shivered at the threat in his voice. \"Jess! Angela!\" I yelled after them, waving when they turned. They rushed back to me, the pronounced relief on both their faces simultaneously changing to surprise as they saw who I was standing next to. They hesitated a few feet from us. \"Where have you been?\" Jessica's voice was suspicious. \"I got lost,\" I admitted sheepishly. \"And then I ran into Edward.\" I gestured toward him. \"Would it be all right if I joined you?\" he asked in his silken, irresistible voice. I could see from their staggered expressions that he had never unleashed his talents on them before. \"Er\u2026 sure,\" Jessica breathed. \"Um, actually, Bella, we already ate while we were waiting \u2014 sorry,\" Angela confessed. \"That's fine \u2014 I'm not hungry.\" I shrugged. \"I think you should eat something.\" Edward's voice was low, but full of authority. He looked up at Jessica and spoke slightly louder. \"Do you mind if I drive Bella home tonight? That way you won't have to wait while she eats.\" \"Uh, no problem, I guess\u2026\" She bit her lip, trying to figure out from my expression whether that was what I wanted. I winked at her. I wanted nothing more than to be alone with my perpetual savior. There were so many questions that I couldn't bombard him with till we were by ourselves.  \"Okay.\" Angela was quicker than Jessica. \"See you tomorrow, Bella\u2026 Edward.\" She grabbed Jessica's hand and pulled her toward the car, which I could see a little ways away, parked across First Street. As they got in, Jess turned and waved, her face eager with curiosity. I waved back, waiting for them to drive away before I turned to face him. \"Honestly, I'm not hungry,\" I insisted, looking up to scrutinize his face. His expression was unreadable. \"Humor me.\" He walked to the door of the restaurant and held it open with an obstinate expression. Obviously, there would be no further discussion. I walked past him into the restaurant with a resigned sigh. The restaurant wasn't crowded \u2014 it was the off-season in Port Angeles. The host was female, and I understood the look in her eyes as she assessed Edward. She welcomed him a little more warmly than necessary. I was surprised by how much that bothered me. She was several inches taller than I was, and unnaturally blond. \"A table for two?\" His voice was alluring, whether he was aiming for that or not. I saw her eyes flicker to me and then away, satisfied by my obvious ordinariness, and by the cautious, no-contact space Edward kept between us. She led us to a table big enough for four in the center of the most crowded area of the dining floor. I was about to sit, but Edward shook his head at me. \"Perhaps something more private?\" he insisted quietly to the host. I wasn't sure, but it looked like he smoothly handed her a tip. I'd never seen anyone refuse a table except in old movies. \"Sure.\" She sounded as surprised as I was. She turned and led us around a partition to a small ring of booths \u2014 all of them empty. \"How's this?\" \"Perfect.\" He flashed his gleaming smile, dazing her momentarily. \"Um\" \u2014 she shook her head, blinking \u2014 \"your server will be right out.\" She walked away unsteadily. \"You really shouldn't do that to people,\" I criticized. \"It's hardly fair.\" \"Do what?\" \"Dazzle them like that \u2014 she's probably hyperventilating in the kitchen right now.\" He seemed confused. \"Oh, come on,\" I said dubiously. \"You have to know the effect you have on people.\" He tilted his head to one side, and his eyes were curious. \"I dazzle people?\" \"You haven't noticed? Do you think everybody gets their way so easily?\" He ignored my questions. \"Do I dazzle you?\" \"Frequently,\" I admitted. And then our server arrived, her face expectant. The hostess had definitely dished behind the scenes, and this new girl didn't look disappointed. She flipped a strand of short black hair behind one ear and smiled with unnecessary warmth. \"Hello. My name is Amber, and I'll be your server tonight. What can I get you to drink?\" I didn't miss that she was speaking only to him. He looked at me. \"I'll have a Coke.\" It sounded like a question. \"Two Cokes,\" he said. \"I'll be right back with that,\" she assured him with another unnecessary smile. But he didn't see it. He was watching me. \"What?\" I asked when she left. His eyes stayed fixed on my face. \"How are you feeling?\" \"I'm fine,\" I replied, surprised by his intensity. \"You don't feel dizzy, sick, cold\u2026 ?\" \"Should I?\" He chuckled at my puzzled tone. \"Well, I'm actually waiting for you to go into shock.\" His face twisted up into that perfect crooked smile. \"I don't think that will happen,\" I said after I could breathe again. \"I've always been very good at repressing unpleasant things.\" \"Just the same, I'll feel better when you have some sugar and food in you.\" Right on cue, the waitress appeared with our drinks and a basket of breadsticks. She stood with her back to me as she placed them on the table. \"Are you ready to order?\" she asked Edward. \"Bella?\" he asked. She turned unwillingly toward me. I picked the first thing I saw on the menu. \"Um\u2026 I'll have the mushroom ravioli.\" \"And you?\" She turned back to him with a smile. \"Nothing for me,\" he said. Of course not. \"Let me know if you change your mind.\" The coy smile was still in place, but he wasn't looking at her, and she left dissatisfied. \"Drink,\" he ordered. I sipped at my soda obediently, and then drank more deeply, surprised by how thirsty I was. I realized I had finished the whole thing when he pushed his glass toward me. \"Thanks,\" I muttered, still thirsty. The cold from the icy soda was radiating through my chest, and I shivered. \"Are you cold?\" \"It's just the Coke,\" I explained, shivering again. \"Don't you have a jacket?\" His voice was disapproving. \"Yes.\" I looked at the empty bench next to me. \"Oh \u2014 I left it in Jessica's car,\" I realized. Edward was shrugging out of his jacket. I suddenly realized that I had never once noticed what he was wearing \u2014 not just tonight, but ever. I just couldn't seem to look away from his face. I made myself look now, focusing. He was removing a light beige leather jacket now; underneath he wore an ivory turtleneck sweater. It fit him snugly, emphasizing how muscular his chest was. He handed me the jacket, interrupting my ogling. \"Thanks,\" I said again, sliding my arms into his jacket. It was cold \u2014 the way my jacket felt when I first picked it up in the morning, hanging in the drafty hallway. I shivered again. It smelled amazing. I inhaled, trying to identify the delicious scent. It didn't smell like cologne. The sleeves were much too long; I shoved them back so I could free my hands. \"That color blue looks lovely with your skin,\" he said, watching me. I was surprised; I looked down, flushing, of course. He pushed the bread basket toward me. \"Really, I'm not going into shock,\" I protested. \"You should be \u2014 a normal person would be. You don't even look shaken.\" He seemed unsettled. He stared into my eyes, and I saw how light his eyes were, lighter than I'd ever seen them, golden butterscotch. \"I feel very safe with you,\" I confessed, mesmerized into telling the truth again. That displeased him; his alabaster brow furrowed. He shook his head, frowning. \"This is more complicated than I'd planned,\" he murmured to himself. I picked up a breadstick and began nibbling on the end, measuring his expression. I wondered when it would be okay to start questioning him. \"Usually you're in a better mood when your eyes are so light,\" I commented, trying to distract him from whatever thought had left him frowning and somber. He stared at me, stunned. \"What?\" \"You're always crabbier when your eyes are black \u2014 I expect it then,\" I went on. \"I have a theory about that.\" His eyes narrowed. \"More theories?\" \"Mm-hm.\" I chewed on a small bite of the bread, trying to look indifferent. \"I hope you were more creative this time\u2026 or are you still stealing from comic books?\" His faint smile was mocking; his eyes were still tight. \"Well, no, I didn't get it from a comic book, but I didn't come up with it on my own, either,\" I confessed. \"And?\" he prompted. But then the waitress strode around the partition with my food. I realized we'd been unconsciously leaning toward each other across the table, because we both straightened up as she approached. She set the dish in front of me \u2014 it looked pretty good \u2014 and turned quickly to Edward. \"Did you change your mind?\" she asked. \"Isn't there anything I can get you?\" I may have been imagining the double meaning in her words. \"No, thank you, but some more soda would be nice.\" He gestured with a long white hand to the empty cups in front of me. \"Sure.\" She removed the empty glasses and walked away. \"You were saying?\" he asked. \"I'll tell you about it in the car. If\u2026\" I paused. \"There are conditions?\" He raised one eyebrow, his voice ominous. \"I do have a few questions, of course.\" \"Of course.\" The waitress was back with two more Cokes. She sat them down without a word this time, and left again. I took a sip. \"Well, go ahead,\" he pushed, his voice still hard. I started with the most undemanding. Or so I thought. \"Why are you in Port Angeles?\" He looked down, folding his large hands together slowly on the table. His eyes flickered up at me from under his lashes, the hint of a smirk on his face. \"Next.\" \"But that's the easiest one,\" I objected. \"Next,\" he repeated. I looked down, frustrated. I unrolled my silverware, picked up my fork, and carefully speared a ravioli. I put it in my mouth slowly, still looking down, chewing while I thought. The mushrooms were good. I swallowed and took another sip of Coke before I looked up. \"Okay, then.\" I glared at him, and continued slowly. \"Let's say, hypothetically of course, that\u2026 someone\u2026 could know what people are thinking, read minds, you know \u2014 with a few exceptions.\" \"Just one exception,\" he corrected, \"hypothetically.\" \"All right, with one exception, then.\" I was thrilled that he was playing along, but I tried to seem casual. \"How does that work? What are the limitations? How would\u2026 that someone\u2026 find someone else at exactly the right time? How would he know she was in trouble?\" I wondered if my convoluted questions even made sense. \"Hypothetically?\" he asked. \"Sure.\" \"Well, if\u2026 that someone\u2026\" \"Let's call him 'Joe,'\" I suggested. He smiled wryly. \"Joe, then. If Joe had been paying attention, the timing wouldn't have needed to be quite so exact.\" He shook his head, rolling his eyes. \"Only you could get into trouble in a town this small. You would have devastated their crime rate statistics for a decade, you know.\" \"We were speaking of a hypothetical case,\" I reminded him frostily. He laughed at me, his eyes warm. \"Yes, we were,\" he agreed. \"Shall we call you 'Jane'?\" \"How did you know?\" I asked, unable to curb my intensity. I realized I was leaning toward him again. He seemed to be wavering, torn by some internal dilemma. His eyes locked with mine, and I guessed he was making the decision right then whether or not to simply tell me the truth. \"You can trust me, you know,\" I murmured. I reached forward, without thinking, to touch his folded hands, but he slid them away minutely, and I pulled my hand back. \"I don't know if I have a choice anymore.\" His voice was almost a whisper. \"I was wrong \u2014 you're much more observant than I gave you credit for.\" \"I thought you were always right.\" \"I used to be.\" He shook his head again. \"I was wrong about you on one other thing, as well. You're not a magnet for accidents \u2014 that's not a broad enough classification. You are a magnet for trouble. If there is anything dangerous within a ten-mile radius, it will invariably find you.\"  \"And you put yourself into that category?\" I guessed. His face turned cold, expressionless. \"Unequivocally.\" I stretched my hand across the table again \u2014 ignoring him when he pulled back slightly once more \u2014 to touch the back of his hand shyly with my fingertips. His skin was cold and hard, like a stone.  \"Thank you.\" My voice was fervent with gratitude. \"That's twice now.\" His face softened. \"Let's not try for three, agreed?\" I scowled, but nodded. He moved his hand out from under mine, placing both of his under the table. But he leaned toward me.  \"I followed you to Port Angeles,\" he admitted, speaking in a rush. \"I've never tried to keep a specific person alive before, and it's much more troublesome than I would have believed. But that's probably just because it's you. Ordinary people seem to make it through the day without so many catastrophes.\" He paused. I wondered if it should bother me that he was following me; instead I felt a strange surge of pleasure. He stared, maybe wondering why my lips were curving into an involuntary smile. \"Did you ever think that maybe my number was up the first time, with the van, and that you've been interfering with fate?\" I speculated, distracting myself. \"That wasn't the first time,\" he said, and his voice was hard to hear. I stared at him in amazement, but he was looking down. \"Your number was up the first time I met you.\" I felt a spasm of fear at his words, and the abrupt memory of his violent black glare that first day\u2026 but the overwhelming sense of safety I felt in his presence stifled it. By the time he looked up to read my eyes, there was no trace of fear in them. \"You remember?\" he asked, his angel's face grave. \"Yes.\" I was calm. \"And yet here you sit.\" There was a trace of disbelief in his voice; he raised one eyebrow. \"Yes, here I sit\u2026 because of you.\" I paused. \"Because somehow you knew how to find me today\u2026 ?\" I prompted. He pressed his lips together, staring at me through narrowed eyes, deciding again. His eyes flashed down to my full plate, and then back to me. \"You eat, I'll talk,\" he bargained. I quickly scooped up another ravioli and popped it in my mouth.  \"It's harder than it should be \u2014 keeping track of you. Usually I can find someone very easily, once I've heard their mind before.\" He looked at me anxiously, and I realized I had frozen. I made myself swallow, then stabbed another ravioli and tossed it in. \"I was keeping tabs on Jessica, not carefully \u2014 like I said, only you could find trouble in Port Angeles \u2014 and at first I didn't notice when you took off on your own. Then, when I realized that you weren't with her anymore, I went looking for you at the bookstore I saw in her head. I could tell that you hadn't gone in, and that you'd gone south\u2026 and I knew you would have to turn around soon. So I was just waiting for you, randomly searching through the thoughts of people on the street \u2014 to see if anyone had noticed you so I would know where you were. I had no reason to be worried\u2026 but I was strangely anxious\u2026\" He was lost in thought, staring past me, seeing things I couldn't imagine. \"I started to drive in circles, still\u2026 listening. The sun was finally setting, and I was about to get out and follow you on foot. And then \u2014\"  He stopped, clenching his teeth together in sudden fury. He made an effort to calm himself. \"Then what?\" I whispered. He continued to stare over my head. \"I heard what they were thinking,\" he growled, his upper lip curling slightly back over his teeth. \"I saw your face in his mind.\" He suddenly leaned forward, one elbow appearing on the table, his hand covering his eyes. The movement was so swift it startled me. \"It was very\u2026 hard \u2014 you can't imagine how hard \u2014 for me to simply take you away, and leave them\u2026 alive.\" His voice was muffled by his arm. \"I could have let you go with Jessica and Angela, but I was afraid if you left me alone, I would go looking for them,\" he admitted in a whisper.  I sat quietly, dazed, my thoughts incoherent. My hands were folded in my lap, and I was leaning weakly against the back of the seat. He still had his face in his hand, and he was as still as if he'd been carved from the stone his skin resembled. Finally he looked up, his eyes seeking mine, full of his own questions. \"Are you ready to go home?\" he asked. \"I'm ready to leave,\" I qualified, overly grateful that we had the hour-long ride home together. I wasn't ready to say goodbye to him. The waitress appeared as if she'd been called. Or watching. \"How are we doing?\" she asked Edward. \"We're ready for the check, thank you.\" His voice was quiet, rougher, still reflecting the strain of our conversation. It seemed to muddle her. He looked up, waiting. \"S-sure,\" she stuttered. \"Here you go.\" She pulled a small leather folder from the front pocket of her black apron and handed it to him. There was a bill in his hand already. He slipped it into the folder and handed it right back to her. \"No change.\" He smiled. Then he stood up, and I scrambled awkwardly to my feet. She smiled invitingly at him again. \"You have a nice evening.\" He didn't look away from me as he thanked her. I suppressed a smile. He walked close beside me to the door, still careful not to touch me. I remembered what Jessica had said about her relationship with Mike, how they were almost to the first-kiss stage. I sighed. Edward seemed to hear me, and he looked down curiously. I looked at the sidewalk, grateful that he didn't seem to be able to know what I was thinking. He opened the passenger door, holding it for me as I stepped in, shutting it softly behind me. I watched him walk around the front of the car, amazed, yet again, by how graceful he was. I probably should have been used to that by now \u2014 but I wasn't. I had a feeling Edward wasn't the kind of person anyone got used to. Once inside the car, he started the engine and turned the heater on high. It had gotten very cold, and I guessed the good weather was at an end. I was warm in his jacket, though, breathing in the scent of it when I thought he couldn't see. Edward pulled out through the traffic, apparently without a glance, flipping around to head toward the freeway. \"Now,\" he said significantly, \"it's your turn.\"",

            "en": "7 REPETITION        24. VOTE HE WAS NOT PLEASED, THAT MUCH WAS EASY TO READ in his face. But, without further argument, he took me in his arms and sprang lithely from my window, landing without the slightest jolt, like a cat. It was a little bit farther down than I'd imagined. \"All right then,\" he said, his voice seething with disapproval. \"Up you go.\" He helped me onto his back, and took off running. Even after all this time, it felt routine. Easy. Evidently this was something you never forgot, like riding a bicycle. It was so very quiet and dark as he ran through the forest, his breathing slow and even\u2014dark enough that the trees flying past us were nearly invisible, and only the rush of air in my face truly gave away our speed. The air was damp; it didn't burn my eyes the way the wind in the big plaza had, and that was comforting. As was the night, too, after that terrifying brightness. Like the thick quilt I'd played under as a child, the dark felt familiar and protecting. I remembered that running through the forest like this used to frighten me, that I used to have to close my eyes. It seemed a silly reaction to me now. I kept my eyes wide, my chin resting on his shoulder, my cheek against his neck. The speed was exhilarating. A hundred times better than the motorcycle. I turned my face toward him and pressed my lips into the cold stone skin of his neck. \"Thank you,\" he said, as the vague, black shapes of trees raced past us. \"Does that mean you've decided you're awake?\" I laughed. The sound was easy, natural, effortless. It sounded right. \"Not really. More that, either way, I'm not trying to wake up. Not tonight.\" \"I'll earn your trust back somehow,\" he murmured, mostly to himself. \"If it's my final act.\" \"I trust you,\" I assured him. \"It's me I don't trust.\" \"Explain that, please.\" He'd slowed to a walk\u2014I could only tell because the wind ceased\u2014and I guessed that we weren't far from the house. In fact, I thought I could make out the sound of the river rushing somewhere close by in the darkness. \"Well\u2014\" I struggled to find the right way to phrase it. \"I don't trust myself to be\u2026 enough. To deserve you. There's nothing about me that could hold you.\" He stopped and reached around to pull me from his back. His gentle hands did not release me; after he'd set me on my feet again, he wrapped his arms tightly around me, hugging me to his chest. \"Your hold is permanent and unbreakable,\" he whispered. \"Never doubt that.\" \u201cBut how could I not? \"You never did tell me\u2026\" he murmured. \"What?\" \"What your greatest problem is.\" \"I'll give you one guess.\" I sighed, and reached up to touch the tip of his nose with my index finger. He nodded. \"I'm worse than the Volturi,\" he said grimly. \"I guess I've earned that.\" I rolled my eyes. \"The worst the Volturi can do is kill me.\" He waited with tense eyes. \"You can leave me,\" I explained. \"The Volturi, Victoria\u2026 they're nothing compared to that.\" Even in the darkness, I could see the anguish twist his face\u2014it reminded me of his expression under Jane's torturing gaze; I felt sick, and regretted speaking the truth. \"Don't,\" I whispered, touching his face. \"Don't be sad.\" He pulled one corner of his mouth up halfheartedly, but the expression didn't touch his eyes. \"If there was only some way to make you see that I can't leave you,\" he whispered. \"Time, I suppose, will be the way to convince you.\" I liked the idea of time. \"Okay,\" I agreed. His face was still tormented. I tried to distract him with inconsequentials. \"So\u2014since you're staying. Can I have my stuff back?\" I asked, making my tone as light as I could manage. My attempt worked, to an extent: he laughed. But his eyes retained the misery. \"Your things were never gone,\" he told me. \"I knew it was wrong, since I promised you peace without reminders. It was stupid and childish, but I wanted to leave something of myself with you. The CD, the pictures, the tickets\u2014they're all under your floorboards.\" \"Really?\" He nodded, seeming slightly cheered by my obvious pleasure in this trivial fact. It wasn't enough to heal the pain in his face completely. \"I think,\" I said slowly, \"I'm not sure, but I wonder\u2026 I think maybe I knew it the whole time.\" \"What did you know?\" I only wanted to take away the agony in his eyes, but as I spoke the words, they sounded truer than I expected they would. \"Some part of me, my subconscious maybe, never stopped believing that you still cared whether I lived or died. That's probably why I was hearing the voices.\" There was a very deep silence for a moment. \"Voices?\" he asked flatly. \"Well, just one voice. Yours. It's a long story.\" The wary look on his face made me wish that I hadn't brought that up. Would he think I was crazy, like everyone else? Was everyone else right about that? But at least that expression\u2014the one that made him look like something was burning him\u2014faded. \"I've got time.\" His voice was unnaturally even. \"It's pretty pathetic.\" He waited. I wasn't sure how to explain. \"Do you remember what Alice said about extreme sports?\" He spoke the words without inflection or emphasis. \"You jumped off a cliff for fun.\" \"Er, right. And before that, with the motorcycle\u2014\" \"Motorcycle?\" he asked. I knew his voice well enough to hear something brewing behind the calm.  \"I guess I didn't tell Alice about that part.\" \"No.\" \"Well, about that\u2026 See, I found that\u2026 when I was doing something dangerous or stupid\u2026 I could remember you more clearly,\" I confessed, feeling completely mental. \"I could remember how your voice sounded when you were angry. I could hear it, like you were standing right there next to me. Mostly I tried not to think about you, but this didn't hurt so much\u2014it was like you were protecting me again. Like you didn't want me to be hurt. \"And, well, I wonder if the reason I could hear you so clearly was because, underneath it all. I always knew that you hadn't stopped loving me.\" Again, as I spoke, the words brought with them a sense of conviction. Of rightness. Some deep place inside me recognized truth. His words came out half-strangled. \"You\u2026 were\u2026 risking your life\u2026 to hear\u2014\" \"Shh,\" I interrupted him. \"Hold on a second. I think I'm having an epiphany here.\" I thought of that night in Port Angeles when I'd had my first delusion. I'd come up with two options. Insanity or wish fulfillment. I'd seen no third option. But what if\u2026 What if you sincerely believed something was true, but you were dead wrong? What if you were so stubbornly sure that you were right, that you wouldn't even consider the truth? Would the truth be silenced, or would it try to break through? Option three: Edward loved me. The bond forged between us was not one that could be broken by absence, distance, or time. And no matter how much more special or beautiful or brilliant or perfect than me he might be, he was as irreversibly altered as I was. As I would always belong to him, so would he always be mine. Was that what I'd been trying to tell myself? \"Oh!\" \"Bella?\" \"Oh. Okay. I see.\" \"Your epiphany?\" he asked, his voice uneven and strained. \"You love me,\" I marveled. The sense of conviction and Tightness washed through me again. Though his eyes were still anxious, the crooked smile I loved best flashed across his face. \"Truly, I do.\" My heart inflated like it was going to crack right through my ribs. It filled my chest and blocked my throat so that I could not speak. He really did want me the way I wanted him\u2014forever. It was only fear for my soul, for the human things he didn't want to take from me, that made him so desperate to leave me mortal. Compared to the fear that he didn't want me, this hurdle\u2014my soul\u2014seemed almost insignificant. He took my face tightly between his cool hands and kissed me until I was so dizzy the forest was spinning. Then he leaned his forehead against mine, and I was not the only one breathing harder than usual. \"You were better at it than I was, you know,\" he told me. \"Better at what?\" \"Surviving. You, at least, made an effort. You got up in the morning, tried to be normal for Charlie, followed the pattern of your life. When I wasn't actively tracking, I was\u2026 totally useless. I couldn't be around my family\u2014I couldn't be around anyone. I'm embarrassed to admit that I more or less curled up into a ball and let the misery have me.\" He grinned, sheepish. \"It was much more pathetic than hearing voices. And, of course, you know I do that, too.\" I was deeply relieved that he really seemed to understand\u2014comforted that this all made sense to him. At any rate, he wasn't looking at me like I was crazy. He was looking at me like\u2026 he loved me. \"I only heard one voice,\" I corrected him. He laughed and then pulled me tight against his right side and started to lead me forward. \"I'm just humoring you with this.\" He motioned broadly with his hand toward the \u00a0darkness in front of us as we walked. There was something pale and immense there\u2014the house, I realized. \"It doesn't matter in the slightest what they say.\" \"This affects them now, too.\" He shrugged indifferently. He led me through the open front door into the dark house and flipped the lights on. The room was just as I'd remembered it\u2014the piano and the white couches and the pale, massive staircase. No dust, no white sheets. Edward called out the names with no more volume than I'd use in regular conversation. \"Carlisle? Esme?\u00a0 Rosalie? Emmett? Jasper? Alice?\" They would hear. Carlisle was suddenly standing beside me, as if he'd been there all along. \"Welcome back, Bella.\" He smiled. \"What can we do for you this morning? I imagine, due to the hour, that this is not a purely social visit?\" I nodded. \"I'd like to talk to everyone at once, if that's okay. About something important.\" I couldn't help glancing up at Edward's face as I spoke. His expression was critical, but resigned. When I looked back to Carlisle, he was looking at Edward, too. \"Of course,\" Carlisle said. \"Why don't we talk in the other room?\" Carlisle led the way through the bright living room, around the corner to the dining room, turning on lights as he went. The walls were white, the ceilings high, like the living room. In the center of the room, under the low-hanging chandelier, was a large, polished oval table surrounded by eight chairs. Carlisle held out a chair for me at the head. I'd never seen the Cullens use the dining room table before\u2014it was just a prop. They didn't eat in the house. As soon as I turned to sit in the chair, I saw that we were not alone. Esme had followed Edward, and behind her the rest of the family filed in. Carlisle sat down on my right, and Edward on my left. Everyone else took their seats in silence. Alice was grinning at me, already in on the plot. Emmett and Jasper looked curious, and Rosalie smiled at me tentatively. My answering smile was just as timid. That was going to take some getting used to. Carlisle nodded toward me. \"The floor is yours.\" I swallowed. Their gazing eyes made me nervous. Edward took my hand under the table. I peeked at him, but he was watching the others, his face suddenly fierce. \"Well,\" I paused. \"I'm hoping Alice has already told you everything that happened in Volterra?\" \"Everything,\" Alice assured me. I threw her a meaningful look. \"And on the way?\" \"That, too,\" she nodded. \"Good,\" I sighed with relief. \"Then we're all on the same page.\" They waited patiently while I tried to order my thoughts. \"So, I have a problem,\" I began. \"Alice promised the Volturi that I would become one of you. They're going to send someone to check, and I'm sure that's a bad thing\u2014something to avoid. \"And so, now, this involves you all. I'm sorry about that.\" I looked at each one of their beautiful faces, saving the most beautiful for last. Edward's mouth was turned down into a grimace. \"But, if you don't want me, then I'm not going to force myself on you, whether Alice is willing or not.\" Esme opened her mouth to speak, but I held up one finger to stop her. \"Please, let me finish. You all know what I want. And I'm sure you know what Edward thinks, too. I think the only fair way to decide is for everyone to have a vote. If you decide you don't want me, then\u2026\u00a0 I guess I'll go back to Italy alone. I can't have them coming here.\" My forehead creased as I considered that. There was the faint rumble of a growl in Edward's chest. I ignored him. \"Taking into account, then, that I won't put any of you in danger either way, I want you to vote yes or no on the issue of me becoming a vampire.\" I half-smiled on the last word, and gestured toward Carlisle to begin. \"Just a minute,\" Edward interrupted. I glared at him through narrowed eyes. He raised his eyebrows at me, squeezing my hand. \"I have something to add before we vote.\" I sighed. \"About the danger Bella's referring to,\" he continued. \"I don't think we need to be overly anxious.\" His expression became more animated. He put his free hand on the shining table and leaned forward. \"You see,\" he explained, looking around the table while he spoke, \"there was more than one reason why I didn't want to shake Aro's hand there at the end. There's something they didn't think of, and I didn't want to cine them in.\" He grinned. \"Which was?\" Alice prodded. I was sure my expression was just as skeptical as hers. \"The Volturi are overconfident, and with good reason. When they decide to find someone, it's not really a problem. Do you remember Demetri?\" He glanced down at me. I shuddered. He took that as a yes. \"He finds people\u2014that's his talent, why they keep him. \"Now, the whole time we were with any of them, I was picking their brains for anything that might save us, getting as much information as possible. So I saw how Demetri's talent works. He's a tracker\u2014a tracker a thousand times more gifted than James was. His ability is loosely related to what I do, or what Aro does. He catches the\u2026 flavor? I don't know how to describe it\u2026 the tenor\u2026 of someone's mind, and then he follows that. It works over immense distances. \"But after Aro's little experiments, well\u2026\" Edward shrugged. \"You think he won't be able to find me,\" I said flatly. He was smug. \"I'm sure of it. He relies totally on that other sense. When it doesn't work with you, they'll all be blind.\" \"And how does that solve anything?\" \"Quite obviously, Alice will be able to tell when they're planning a visit, and I'll hide you. They'll be helpless,\" he said with fierce enjoyment. \"It will be like looking for a piece of straw in a haystack!\" He and Emmett exchanged a glance and a smirk. This made no sense. \"But they can find you,\" I reminded him. \"And I can take care of myself.\" Emmett laughed, and reached across the table toward his brother, extending a fist. \"Excellent plan, my brother,\" he said with enthusiasm. Edward stretched out his arm to smack Emmett's fist with his own. \"No,\" Rosalie hissed. \"Absolutely not,\" I agreed. \"Nice.\" Jasper's voice was appreciative. \"Idiots,\" Alice muttered. Esme just glared at Edward. I straightened up in my chair, focusing. This was my meeting. \"All right, then. Edward has offered an alternative for you to consider,\" I said coolly. \"Let's vote.\" I looked toward Edward this time; it would be better to get his opinion out of the way. \"Do you want me to join your family?\" His eyes were hard and black as flint. \"Not that way. You're staying human.\" I nodded once, keeping my face businesslike, and then moved on. \"Alice?\" \"Yes.\" \"Jasper?\" \"Yes,\" he said, voice grave. I was a little surprised\u2014I hadn't been at all sure of his vote\u2014but I suppressed my reaction and moved on. \"Rosalie?\" She hesitated, biting down on her full, perfect bottom lip. \"No.\" I kept my face blank and turned my head slightly to move on, but she held up both her hands, palms forward. \"Let me explain,\" she pleaded. \"I don't mean that I have any aversion to you as a sister. It's just that\u2026 this is not the life I would have chosen for myself. I wish there had been someone there to vote no for me.\" I nodded slowly, and then turned to Emmett. \"Hell, yes!\" He grinned. \"We can find some other way to pick a fight with this Demetri.\" I was still grimacing at that when I looked at Esme. \"Yes, of course, Bella. I already think of you as part of my family.\" \"Thank you, Esme,\" I murmured as I turned toward Carlisle. I was suddenly nervous, wishing I had asked for his vote first. I was sure that this was the vote that mattered most, the vote that counted more than any majority. Carlisle wasn't looking at me. \"Edward,\" he said. \"No,\" Edward growled. His jaw was strained tight, his lips curled back from his teeth. \"It's the only way that makes sense,\" Carlisle insisted. \"You've chosen not to live without her, and that doesn't leave me a choice.\" Edward dropped my hand, shoving away from the table. He stalked out of the room, snarling under his breath. \"I guess you know my vote.\" Carlisle sighed. I was still staring after Edward. \"Thanks,\" I mumbled. An earsplitting crash echoed from the other room. I flinched, and spoke quickly. \"That's all I needed. Thank you. For wanting to keep me. I feel exactly the same way about all of you, too.\" My voice was jagged with emotion by the end. Esme was at my side in a flash, her cold arms around me. \"Dearest Bella,\" she breathed. I hugged her back. Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed Rosalie looking down at the table, and I realized that my words could be construed in two ways. \"Well, Alice,\" I said when Esme released me. \"Where do you want to do this?\" Alice stared at me, her eyes widening with terror. \"No! No! NO!\" Edward roared, charging back into the room. He was in my face before I had time to blink, bending over me, his expression twisted in rage. \"Are you insane?\" he shouted. \"Have you utterly lost your mind?\" I cringed away, my hands over my ears. \"Um, Bella,\" Alice interjected in an anxious voice. \"I don't think I'm ready for that. I'll need to prepare\u2026\" \"You promised,\" I reminded her, glaring under Edward's arm. \"I know, but\u2026 Seriously, Bella! I don't have any idea how to not kill you.\" \"You can do it,\" I encouraged. \"I trust you.\" Edward snarled in fury. Alice shook her head quickly, looking panicked. \"Carlisle?\" I turned to look at him. Edward grabbed my face in his hand, forcing me to look at him. His other hand was out, palm toward Carlisle. Carlisle ignored that. \"I'm able to do it,\" he answered my question. I wished I could see his expression. \"You would be in no danger of me losing control.\" \"Sounds good.\" I hoped he could understand; it was hard to talk clearly the way Edward held my jaw. \"Hold on,\" Edward said between his teeth. \"It doesn't have to be now.\" \"There's no reason for it not to be now,\" I said, the words coming out distorted. \"I can think of a few.\" \"Of course you can,\" I said sourly. \"Now let go of me.\" He freed my face, and folded his arms across his chest. \"In about two hours, Charlie will be here looking for you. I wouldn't put it past him to involve the police.\" \"All three of them.\" But I frowned. This was always the hardest part. Charlie, Renee. Now Jacob, too. The people I would lose, the people I would hurt. I wished there was some way that I could be the only one to suffer, but I knew that was impossible. At the same time, I was hurting them more by staying human. Putting Charlie in constant danger through my proximity. Putting Jake in worse danger still by drawing his enemies across the land he felt bound to protect. And Renee\u2014I couldn't even risk a visit to see my own mother for fear of bringing my deadly problems along with me! I was a danger magnet; I'd accepted that about myself. Accepting this, I knew I needed to be able to take care of myself and protect the ones I loved, even if that meant that I couldn't be with them. I needed to be strong. \"In the interest of remaining inconspicuous,\" Edward said, still talking through his gritted teeth, but looking at Carlisle now, \"I suggest that we put this conversation off, at the very least until Bella finishes high school, and moves out of Charlie's house.\" \"That's a reasonable request, Bella,\" Carlisle pointed out. I thought about Charlie's reaction when he woke up this morning, if\u2014after all that life had put him through in the last week with Harry's loss, and then I had put him through with my unexplained disappearance\u2014he were to find my bed empty. Charlie deserved better than that. It was just a little more time; graduation wasn't so far away\u2026 I pursed my lips. \"I'll consider it.\" Edward relaxed. His jaw unclenched. \"I should probably take you home,\" he said, more calm now, but clearly in a hurry to get me out of here.  \"Just in case Charlie wakes up early.\" I looked at Carlisle. \"After graduation?\" \"You have my word.\" I took a deep breath, smiled, and turned back to Edward. \"Okay. You can take me home.\" Edward rushed me out of the house before Carlisle could promise me anything else. He took me out the back, so I didn't get to see what was broken in the living room. It was a quiet trip home. I was feeling triumphant, and a little smug. Scared stiff, too, of course, but I tried not to think about that part. It did me no good to worry about the \u00a0\u00a0pain\u2014the physical or the emotional\u2014so I wouldn't. Not until I absolutely had to. When we got to my house, Edward didn't pause. He dashed up the wall and through my window in half a second. Then he pulled my arms from around his neck and set me on the bed. I thought I had a pretty good idea of what he was thinking, but his expression surprised me. Instead of furious, it was calculating. He paced silently back and forth across my dark room while I watched with growing suspicion. \"Whatever you're planning, it's not going to work,\" I told him. \"Shh. I'm thinking.\" \"Ugh,\" I groaned, throwing myself back on the bed and pulling the quilt over my head. There was no sound, but suddenly he was there. He flipped the cover back so he could see me. He was lying next to me. His hand reached up to brush my hair from my cheek. \"If you don't mind, I'd much rather you didn't hide your face. I've lived without it for as long as I can stand. Now\u2026 tell me something.\" \"What?\" I asked, unwilling. \"If you could have anything in the world, anything at all, what would it be?\" I could feel the skepticism in my eyes. \"You.\" He shook his head impatiently. \"Something you don't already have.\" I wasn't sure where he was trying to lead me, so I thought carefully before I answered. I came up with something that was both true, and also probably impossible. \"I would want\u2026 Carlisle not to have to do it. I would want you to change me.\" I watched his reaction warily, expecting more of the fury I'd seen at his house. I was surprised that his expression didn't change. It was still calculating, thoughtful. \"What would you be willing to trade for that?\" I couldn't believe my ears. I gawked at his composed face and blurted out the answer before I could think about it. \"Anything.\" He smiled faintly, and then pursed his lips. \"Five years?\" My face twisted into an expression somewhere between chagrin and horror. \"You said anything,\" he reminded me. \"Yes, but\u2026 you'll use the time to find a way out of it. I have to strike while the iron is hot. Besides, it's just too dangerous to be human\u2014for me, at least. So, anything but that.\" He frowned. \"Three years?\" \"No!\" \"Isn't it worth anything to you at all? \" I thought about how much I wanted this. Better to keep a poker face, I decided, and not let him know how very much that was. It would give me more leverage. \"Six months?\" He rolled his eyes. \"Not good enough.\" \"One year, then,\" I said. \"That's my limit.\" \"At least give me two.\" \"No way. Nineteen I'll do. But I'm not going anywhere near twenty. If you're staying in your teens forever, then so am I.\" He thought for a minute. \"All right. Forget time limits. If you want me to be the one\u2014then you'll just have to meet one condition.\" \"Condition?\" My voice went flat. \"What condition?\" His eyes were cautious\u2014he spoke slowly. \"Marry me first.\" I stared at him, waiting\u2026 \"Okay. What's the punch line?\" He sighed. \"You're wounding my ego, Bella. I just proposed to you, and you think it's a joke.\" \"Edward, please be serious.\" \"I am one hundred percent serious.\" He gazed at me with no hint of humor in his face. \"Oh, c'mon,\" I said, an edge of hysteria in my voice. \"I'm only eighteen.\" \"Well, I'm nearly a hundred and ten. It's time I settled down.\" I looked away, out the dark window, trying to control the panic before it gave me away. \"Look, marriage isn't exactly that high on my list of priorities, you know? It was sort of the kiss of death for Renee and Charlie.\" \"Interesting choice of words.\" \"You know what I mean.\" He inhaled deeply. \"Please don't tell me that you're afraid of the commitment,\" his voice was <em>disbelieving</em>, and I understood what he meant. \"That's not it exactly,\" I hedged. \"I'm\u2026 afraid of Renee. She has some really intense opinions on getting married before you're thirty.\" \"Because she'd rather you became one of the eternal damned than get married.\" He laughed darkly. \"You think you're joking.\" \"Bella, if you compare the level of commitment between a marital union as opposed to bartering your soul in exchange for an eternity as a vampire\u2026\" He shook his head. \"If you're not brave enough to marry me, then\u2014\" \"Well,\" I interrupted. \"What if I did? What if I told you to take me to Vegas now? Would I be a vampire in three days?\" He smiled, his teeth flashing in the dark. \"Sure,\" he said, calling my bluff. \"I'll get my car.\" \"Dammit.\" I muttered. \"I'll give you eighteen months.\" \"No deal,\" he said, grinning. \"I like this condition.\" \"Fine. I'll have Carlisle do it when I graduate.\" \"If that's what you really want.\" He shrugged, and his smile became absolutely angelic. \"You're impossible,\" I groaned. \"A monster.\" He chuckled. \"Is that why you won't marry me?\" I groaned again. He leaned toward me; his night-dark eyes melted and smoldered and shattered my concentration. \" Please, Bella?\" he breathed. I forgot how to breathe for a moment. When I recovered, I shook my head quickly, trying to clear my suddenly clouded mind. \"Would this have gone better if I d had time to get a ring.'\" \"No! No rings!\" I very nearly shouted. \"Now you've done it,\" he whispered. \"Oops.\" \"Charlie's getting up; I'd better leave,\" Edward said with resignation. My heart stopped beating. He gauged my expression for a second. \"Would it be childish of me to hide in your closet, then?\" \"No,\" I whispered eagerly. \"Stay. Please.\" Edward smiled and disappeared. I seethed in the darkness as I waited for Charlie to check on me. Edward knew exactly what he was doing, and I was willing to bet that all the injured surprise was part of the ploy. Of course, I still had the Carlisle option, but now that I knew there was a chance that Edward would change me himself, I wanted it bad. He was such a cheater. My door cracked open. \"Morning, Dad.\" \"Oh, hey, Bella.\" He sounded embarrassed at getting caught. \"I didn't know you were awake.\" \"Yeah. I've just been waiting for you to wake up so I could take a shower.\" I started to get up. \"Hold on,\" Charlie said, flipping the light on. I blinked in the sudden brightness, and carefully kept my eyes away from the closet. \"Let's talk for a minute first.\" I couldn't control my grimace. I'd forgotten to ask Alice for a good excuse. \"You know you're in trouble.\" \"Yeah, I know.\" \"I just about went crazy these last three days. I come home from Harry's funeral, and you're gone.\u00a0 Jacob could only tell me that you'd run off with Alice Cullen, and that he thought you were in trouble.\u00a0 You didn't leave me a number, and you didn't call. I didn't know where you were or when\u2014or if\u2014you were coming back. Do you have any idea how\u2026 how\u2026\" He couldn't finish the sentence. He sucked in a sharp breath and moved on. \"Can you give me one reason why I shouldn't ship you off to Jacksonville this second?\" My eyes narrowed. So it was going to be threats, was it? Two could play at that game. I sat up, pulling the quilt around me. \"Because I won't go.\" \"Now just one minute, young lady\u2014\" \"Look, Dad, I accept complete responsibility for my actions, and you have the right to ground me for as long as you want. I will also do all the chores and laundry and dishes until you think I've learned my lesson. And I guess you're within your rights if you want to kick me out, too\u2014but that won't make me to go to Florida.\" His face turned bright red. He took a few deep breaths before he answered. \"Would you like to explain where you've been?\" Oh, crap. \"There was\u2026 an emergency.\" He raised his eyebrows in expectation of my brilliant explanation. I filled my cheeks with air and then blew it out noisily. \"I don't know what to tell you, Dad. It was mostly a misunderstanding. He said, she said. It got out of hand.\" He waited with a distrustful expression. \"See, Alice told Rosalie about me jumping off the cliff\u2026\" I was scrambling frantically to make this work, to keep it as close to the truth as possible so that my inability to lie convincingly would not undermine the excuse, but before I could go on, Charlie's expression reminded me that he didn't know anything about the cliff. Major oops. As if I wasn't already toast. \"I guess I didn't tell you about that,\" I choked out. \"It was nothing. Just messing around, swimming with Jake. Anyway, Rosalie told Edward, and he was upset. She sort of accidentally made it sound like I was trying to kill myself or something. He wouldn't answer his phone, so Alice dragged me to\u2026 L.A., to explain in person.\" I shrugged, desperately hoping that he would not be so distracted by my slip that he'd miss the brilliant explanation I'd provided. Charlie's face was frozen. \"Were you trying to kill yourself, Bella?\" \"No, of course not. Just having fun with Jake. Cliff diving. The La Push kids do it all the time. Like I said, nothing.\" Charlie's face heated up\u2014from frozen to hot with fury. \"What's it to Edward Cullen anyway?\" he barked. \"All this time, he's just left you dangling without a word\u2014\" I interrupted him. \"Another misunderstanding.\" His face flushed again. \"So is he back then?\" \"I'm not sure what the exact plan is. I think they all are.\" He shook his head, the vein in his forehead pulsing. \"I want you to stay away from him, Bella. I don't trust him. He's rotten for you. I won't let him mess you up like that again.\" \"Fine,\" I said curtly. Charlie rocked back onto his heels. \"Oh.\" He scrambled for a second, exhaling loudly in surprise. \"I thought you were going to be difficult.\" \"I am.\" I stared straight into his eyes. \"I meant, 'Fine, I'll move out.'\" His eyes bulged; his face turned puce. My resolve wavered as I started to worry about his health. He was no younger than Harry\u2026 \"Dad, I don't want to move out,\" I said in a softer tone. \"I love you. I know you're worried, but you need to trust me on this. And you're going to have to ease up on Edward if you want me to stay. Do you want me to live here or not?\" \"That's not fair, Bella. You know I want you to stay.\" \"Then be nice to Edward, because he's going to be where I am.\" I said it with confidence. The conviction of my epiphany was still strong. \"Not under my roof,\" Charlie stormed. I sighed a heavy sigh. \"Look, I'm not going to give you any more ultimatums tonight\u2014or I guess it's this morning. Just think about it for a few days, okay? But keep in mind that Edward and I are sort of a package deal.\" \"Bella\u2014\" \"Think it over,\" I insisted. \"And while you're doing that, could you give me some privacy? I really need a shower.\" Charlie's face was a strange shade of purple, but he left, slamming the door behind him. I heard him stomp furiously down the stairs. I threw off my quilt, and Edward was already there, sitting in the rocking chair as if he d been present through the whole conversation. \"Sorry about that,\" I whispered. \"It's not as if I don't deserve far worse,\" he murmured. \"Don't start anything with Charlie over me, please.\" \"Don't worry about it,\" I breathed as I gathered up my bathroom things and a set of clean clothes. \"I will start exactly as much as is necessary, and no more than that. Or are you trying to tell me I have nowhere to go?\" I widened my eyes with false alarm. \"You'd move in with a house full of vampires?\" \"That's probably the safest place for someone like me. Besides\u2026\" I grinned. \"If Charlie kicks me out, then there's no need for a graduation deadline, is there?\" His jaw tightened. \"So eager for eternal damnation,\" he muttered. \"You know you don't really believe that.\" \"Oh, don't I?\" he fumed. \"No. You don't.\" He glowered at me and started to speak, but I cut him off. \"If you really believed that you'd lost your soul, then when I found you in Volterra, you would have realized immediately what was happening, instead of thinking we were both dead together. But you didn't\u2014you said 'Amazing. Carlisle was right,'\" I reminded him, triumphant. \"There's hope in you, after all.\" For once, Edward was speechless. \"So let's both just be hopeful, all right?\" I suggested. \"Not that it matters. If you stay, I don't need heaven.\" He got up slowly, and came to put his hands on either side of my face as he stared into my eyes. \"Forever,\" he vowed, still a little staggered. \"That's all I'm asking for,\" I said, and stretched up on my toes so that I could press my lips to his.",
