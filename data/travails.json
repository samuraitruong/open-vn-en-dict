The move came as prosecutors cited doubts over the credibility of his accuser, 32-year-old hotel maid Nafissatou Diallo.  \u00a0 Mr Strauss-Kahn, 62, was accused in May of attacking the African immigrant as she entered his hotel room to clean it. \u00a0 The ruling means he is a free man, though he still faces a civil suit Ms Diallo filed this month. \u00a0 \"Our inability to believe the complainant beyond a reasonable doubt means, in good faith, that we could not ask a jury to do that,\" Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi-Orbon told Judge Michael Obus. \u00a0   \u00a0\u201cHurried sexual encounter\u201d  \u00a0 The dismissal of criminal charges at the New York State Supreme Court will take effect once the judge rules on an appeal against the move. \u00a0  Mr Strauss-Kahn, considered a French presidential contender before the case, arrived for the hearing in lower Manhattan on Tuesday in a six-car motorcade with his wife Anne Sinclair.  \u00a0 Outside, about two dozen placard-waving protesters denounced the result, their cries audible from the packed courtroom on the 13th floor. \u00a0 Ms Diallo claimed Mr Strauss-Kahn had confronted her in his luxury hotel suite in the city on 14 May and forced her to perform oral sex.  \u00a0 Prosecutors said DNA evidence had found that a \"hurried\" sexual encounter did occur between the two, but it did not establish Ms Diallo's claim that it was non-consensual. \u00a0 In a statement released by his legal team on Tuesday, Mr Strauss-Kahn said: \"These past two-and-a-half months have been a nightmare for me and my family.  \u00a0 \"I want to thank all the friends in France and in the United States who have believed in my innocence, and to the thousands of people who sent us their support personally and in writing.  \u00a0 \"I am most deeply grateful to my wife and family who have gone through this ordeal with me.\" \u00a0 He added: \"We will have nothing further to say about this matter and we look forward to returning to our home and resuming something of a more normal life.\" \u00a0 'Rush to judgment'  \u00a0 Outside the court on Tuesday, Mr Strauss-Kahn's lawyer, William Taylor, accused the media, police and prosecutors of a \"collective rush to judgment\". \u00a0 \"I want to remind you how uncritically the media examined this case from the beginning without even looking at the improbability of the story on its face,\" he said. \u00a0 In court papers filed on Monday, Manhattan prosecutors said they did not feel at ease pursuing the case, citing deep concerns over Ms Diallo's credibility.\u00a0  \u00a0 She \"has not been truthful on matters great and small\" and has an ability to present \"fiction as fact with complete conviction,\" they wrote. \u00a0 Medical and DNA evidence, meanwhile, was \"simply inconclusive\" as proof of a forced sexual encounter, they added. \u00a0 Mr Strauss-Kahn was forced from his job as director of the International Monetary Fund after his arrest on board an Air France jet in May. \u00a0 But within weeks, prosecutors said there were inconsistencies in Ms Diallo's accounts of the alleged assault and of her background. \u00a0 It was revealed that she had been recorded discussing the case with a jailed friend and appeared to refer to Mr Strauss-Kahn's wealth, which his supporters said pointed to a financial motive. \u00a0 Prosecutors also said Ms Diallo had not been truthful in tax documents, nor on an asylum application form in her account of a gang rape she said she suffered back in Guinea. \u00a0 Mr Strauss-Kahn was later freed from his restrictive bail conditions. \u00a0 Ms Diallo then took the unusual step of giving media interviews, defending her allegations against him, and on 8 August, she filed a civil suit against Mr Strauss-Kahn. \u00a0 The Frenchman's legal <em>travails</em> are not yet over: authorities in Paris are still considering whether to press charges against him over a claim by French writer Tristane Banon that he tried to rape her during a 2003 interview.  \u00a0 Ms Banon made the allegation after the Diallo case, saying that she feared no-one would have believed her beforehand. \u00a0",
