            "en": "Green tea    Overview: Archeological evidence suggests that people consumed tea leaves steeped in boiling water as many as 5,000 years ago. Botanical evidence indicates that India and China were among the first countries to cultivate tea. Today, tea is the most widely consumed beverage in the world, second only to water. Hundreds of millions of people drink tea around the world, and studies suggest that green tea (Camellia sinesis) in particular has many health benefits.  There are three main varieties of tea -- green, black, and oolong. The difference between the teas is in their processing. Green tea is made from unfermented leaves and reportedly contains the highest concentration of powerful antioxidants called polyphenols. Antioxidants are substances that <em>scavenge</em> free radicals -- damaging compounds in the body that alter cells, tamper with DNA (genetic material), and even cause cell death. Free radicals occur naturally in the body, but environmental toxins (including ultraviolet rays from the sun, radiation, cigarette smoke, and air pollution) also give rise to these damaging particles. Many scientists believe that free radicals contribute to the aging process as well as the development of a number of health problems, including cancer and heart disease. Antioxidants such as polyphenols in green tea can neutralize free radicals and may reduce or even help prevent some of the damage they cause. Green tea has been consumed throughout the ages in India, China, Japan, and Thailand. In traditional Chinese and Indian medicine, practitioners used green tea as a stimulant, diuretic (to promote the excretion of urine), astringent (to control bleeding and help heal wounds), and to improve heart health. Other traditional uses of green tea include treating flatulence (gas), regulating body temperature and blood sugar, promoting digestion, and improving mental processes. Green tea has been extensively studied in people, animals, and laboratory experiments. Results from these studies suggest that green tea may be useful for the following health conditions: Atherosclerosis Population-based clinical studies indicate that the antioxidant properties of green tea may help prevent atherosclerosis, particularly coronary artery disease. (Population-based studies means studies that follow large groups of people over time or studies that are comparing groups of people living in different cultures or with different dietary habits.) Researchers aren't sure why green tea reduces the risk of heart disease by lowering cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Studies show that black tea has similar beneficial effects. In fact, researchers estimate that the rate of heart attack decreases by 11% with consumption of 3 cups of tea per day. In May 2006, however, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rejected a petition from teamakers to allow tea labels to claim that green tea reduces the risk of heart disease. The FDA concluded that there is no credible evidence to support qualified health claims for green tea or green tea extract reducing the risk of heart disease.  High cholesterol Research shows that green tea lowers total cholesterol and raises HDL (\"good\") cholesterol in both animals and people. One population-based clinical study found that men who drink green tea are more likely to have lower total cholesterol than those who do not drink green tea. Results from one animal study suggest that polyphenols in green tea may block the intestinal absorption of cholesterol and promote its excretion from the body. In another small study of male smokers, researchers found that green tea significantly reduced blood levels of harmful LDL cholesterol. Cancer Several population-based clinical studies have shown that both green and black teas help protect against cancer. For example, cancer rates tend to be low in countries such as Japan where people regularly consume green tea. However, it is not possible to determine from these population-based studies whether green tea actually prevents cancer in people. Emerging clinical studies suggest that the polyphenols in tea, especially green tea, may play an important role in the prevention of cancer. Researchers also believe that polyphenols help kill cancerous cells and stop their progression. Bladder cancer. Only a few clinical studies have examined the relationship between bladder cancer and tea consumption. In one study that compared people with and without bladder cancer, researchers found that women who drank black tea and powdered green tea were less likely to develop bladder cancer. A follow-up clinical study by the same group of researchers revealed that bladder cancer patients (particularly men) who drank green tea had a substantially better 5-year survival rate than those who did not. Breast cancer. Clinical studies in animals and test tubes suggest that polyphenols in green tea inhibit the growth of breast cancer cells. In one study of 472 women with various stages of breast cancer, researchers found that women who consumed the most green tea experienced the least spread of cancer (particularly premenopausal women in the early stages of breast cancer). They also found that women with early stages of the disease who drank at least 5 cups of tea every day before being diagnosed with cancer were less likely to suffer recurrences of the disease after completion of treatment. However, women with late stages of breast cancer experienced little or no improvement from drinking green tea. In terms of breast cancer prevention, the studies are inconclusive. In one very large study, researchers found that drinking tea, green or any other type, was not associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer. However, when the researchers broke down the sample by age, among women under the age of 50, those who consumed 3 or more cups of tea per day were 37% less likely to develop breast cancer compared to women who didn't drink tea. Ovarian cancer. In a clinical study conducted on ovarian cancer patients in China, researchers found that women who drank at least one cup of green tea per day survived longer with the disease than those who didn' t drink green tea. In fact, those who drank the most tea, lived the longest. Other studies found no beneficial effects. Colorectal cancer. Clinical studies on the effects of green tea on colon or rectal cancer have produced conflicting results. Some clinical studies show decreased risk in those who drink the tea, while others show increased risk. In one study, women who drank 5 or more cups of green tea per day had a significantly lower risk of colorectal cancer compared to non-tea-drinkers. There was no effect in men, however. Other studies show that regular tea consumption may reduce the risk of colorectal cancer in women. Further research is needed before researchers can recommend green tea for the prevention of colorectal cancer. Esophageal cancer. Studies in laboratory animals have found that green tea polyphenols inhibit the growth of esophageal cancer cells. However, clinical studies in people have produced conflicting findings. For example, one large-scale population-based clinical study found that green tea offered significant protection against the development of esophageal cancer (particularly among women). Another population-based clinical study revealed just the opposite -- green tea consumption was associated with an increased risk of esophageal cancer. In fact, the stronger and hotter the tea, the greater the risk. Given these conflicting results, further research is needed before scientists can recommend green tea for the prevention of esophageal cancer. Lung cancer. While green tea polyphenols have been shown to inhibit the growth of human lung cancer cells in test tubes, few clinical studies have investigated the link between green tea consumption and lung cancer in people and even these studies have been conflicting. One population-based clinical study found that Okinawan tea (similar to green tea but partially fermented) was associated with decreased lung cancer risk, particularly among women. A second clinical study revealed that green tea and black tea significantly increased the risk of lung cancer. As with colon and esophageal cancers, further clinical studies are needed before researchers can draw any conclusions about green tea and lung cancer.\u00a0  Pancreatic cancer. In one large-scale clinical study researchers compared green tea drinkers with non-drinkers and found that those who drank the most tea were significantly less likely to develop pancreatic cancer. This was particularly true for women -- those who drank the most green tea were half as likely to develop pancreatic cancer as those who drank less tea. Men who drank tea were 37% less likely to develop pancreatic cancer. However, it is not clear from this population-based study whether green tea is solely responsible for reducing pancreatic cancer risk. Further studies in animals and people are needed before researchers can recommend green tea for the prevention of pancreatic cancer.\u00a0  Prostate cancer. Laboratory studies have found that green tea extracts prevent the growth of prostate cancer cells in test tubes. In a large clinical study conducted in Southeast China researchers found that the risk of prostate cancer declined with increasing frequency, duration and quantity of green tea consumption. However, both green and black tea extracts also stimulated genes that cause cells to be less sensitive to chemotherapy drugs. Given this potential interaction, people should not drink black and green tea (as well as extracts of these teas) while receiving chemotherapy.  Skin cancer. The main polyphenol in green tea is epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). Scientific studies suggest that EGCG and green tea polyphenols have anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties that may help prevent the onset and growth of skin tumors. Stomach cancer. Laboratory studies have found that green tea polyphenols inhibit the growth of stomach cancer cells in test tubes, but clinical studies in people have been less conclusive. In two studies that compared green tea drinkers with non-drinkers, researchers found that people who drank tea were about half as likely to develop stomach cancer and gastritis (inflammation of the stomach) as those who did not drink green tea. However, a clinicial study including more than 26,000 men and women in Japan found no association between green tea consumption and stomach cancer risk. Some clinicial studies even suggest that green tea may increase the risk of stomach cancer. Further clinicial studies are underway to determine whether green tea helps reduce the risk of stomach cancer. Although green tea is considered safe for people at risk for stomach cancer, it is difficult to tell whether green tea reduces the likelihood of developing this disease. Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Green tea may help reduce inflammation associated with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, the two types of IBD. If green tea proves to be helpful for preventing colon cancer, this would be an added benefit for those with IBD because they are at risk for colon cancer. Diabetes Green tea has been used traditionally to control blood sugar in the body. Animal studies suggest that green tea may help prevent the development of type 1 diabetes and slow the progression once it has developed. People with type 1 diabetes produce little or no insulin, a hormone that converts glucose (sugar), starches, and other foods into energy needed for daily life. Green tea may help regulate glucose in the body. A few small clinical studies have found that daily supplementation of the diet with green tea extract powder lowered the hemoglobin A1c level in individuals with borderline diabetes. Liver disease Population-based clinical studies have shown that men who drink more than 10 cups of green tea per day are less likely to develop disorders of the liver. Green tea also seems to protect the liver from the damaging effects of toxic substances such as alcohol. Animal studies have shown that green tea helps protect against the development of liver tumors in mice. Results from several animal and human studies suggest that one of the polyphenols present in green tea, known as catechin, may help treat viral hepatitis (inflammation of the liver from a virus). In these studies, catechin was isolated from green tea and used in very high concentrations. It is not clear whether green tea (which contains a lower concentration of catechins) confers these same benefits to people with hepatitis. Weight loss Clinical studies suggest that green tea extract may boost metabolism and help burn fat. Another study confirmed that the combination of green tea and caffeine improved weight loss. Some researchers speculate that substances in green tea known as polyphenols, specifically the catechins, are responsible for the herb's fat-burning effect.  Other uses Drinking green tea has been found effective in a small clinical study for dental caries, or tooth decay. More studies need to be performed. Green tea may also be useful in inflammatory diseases, such as arthritis. Research indicates that green tea may benefit arthritis by reducing inflammation and slowing cartilage breakdown. Chemicals found in green tea may also be effective in treating genital warts and preventing symptoms of colds and influenza. Studies also show that drinking green tea is associated with reduced risk of mortality. Plant description: Green, black, and oolong tea are all derived from the leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant. Originally cultivated in East Asia, this plant grows as large as a shrub or tree. Today, Camellia sinensis grows throughout Asia and parts of the Middle East and Africa. People in Asian countries more commonly consume green and oolong tea while black tea is most popular in the United States. Green tea is prepared from unfermented leaves, the leaves of oolong tea are partially fermented, and black tea is fully fermented. The more the leaves are fermented, the lower the polyphenol content and the higher the caffeine content. Green tea has the highest polyphenol content while black tea has roughly 2 - 3 times the caffeine content of green tea. What's it made of?: The healthful properties of green tea are largely attributed to polyphenols, chemicals with potent antioxidant properties. In fact, the antioxidant effects of polyphenols appear to be greater than vitamin C. The polyphenols in green tea also give it a somewhat bitter flavor. Polyphenols contained in teas are classified as catechins. Green tea contains six primary catechin compounds: catechin, gallaogatechin, epicatechin, epigallocatechin, epicatechin gallate, and apigallocatechin gallate (also known as EGCG). EGCG is the most studied polyphenol component in green tea and the most active. Green tea also contains alkaloids including caffeine, theobromine, and theophylline. These alkaloids provide green tea's stimulant effects. L-theanine, an amino acid compound found in green tea, has been studied for its calming effects on the nervous system. Dosage Pediatric There are no known scientific reports on the pediatric use of green tea, so it is not recommended for children. Adult Depending on the brand, 2 - 3 cups of green tea per day (for a total of 240 - 320 mg polyphenols) or 100 - 750 mg per day of green tea extract is recommended. Caffeine-free products are available and recommended. Precautions: The use of herbs is a time-honored approach to strengthening the body and treating disease. However, herbs contain active substances that can trigger side effects and interact with other herbs, supplements, or medications. For these reasons, people should take herbs with care, under the supervision of a practitioner knowledgeable in the field of botanical medicine. People with heart problems, kidney disorders, stomach ulcers, and psychological disorders (particularly anxiety) should not take green tea. Pregnant and breastfeeding women should also avoid green tea. People who drink excessive amounts of caffeine (including caffeine from green tea) for prolonged periods of time may experience irritability, insomnia, heart palpitations, and dizziness. Caffeine overdose can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, and loss of appetite. If you are drinking a lot of tea and start to vomit or have abdominal spasms, you may have caffeine poisoning. If your symptoms are severe, lower your caffeine intake and see your health care provider. Possible Interactions: If you are being treated with any of the following medications, you should not drink green tea or take green tea extract without first talking to your health care provider: Adenosine -- Green tea may inhibit the actions of adenosine, a medication given in the hospital for an irregular (and usually unstable) heart rhythm. Antibiotics, Beta-lactam -- Green tea may increase the effectiveness of beta-lactam antibiotics by reducing bacterial resistance to treatment. Benzodiazepines -- Caffeine (including caffeine from green tea) has been shown to reduce the sedative effects of benzodiazepines (medications commonly used to treat anxiety, such as diazepam and lorazepam). Beta-blockers, Propranolol, and Metoprolol -- Caffeine (including caffeine from green tea) may increase blood pressure in people taking propranolol and metoprolol (medications used to treat high blood pressure and heart disease). Blood Thinning Medications (Including Aspirin) -- People who take warfarin, a blood thinning medication, should not drink green tea. Since green tea contains vitamin K, it can make warfarin ineffective. Meanwhile, you should not mix green tea and aspirin because they both prevent platelets from clotting. Using the two together may increase your risk of bleeding.  Chemotherapy -- The combination of green tea and chemotherapy medications, specifically doxorubicin and tamoxifen, increased the effectiveness of these medications in laboratory tests. However, these results have not yet been demonstrated in studies on people. On the other hand, there have been reports of both green and black tea extracts stimulating a gene in prostate cancer cells that may cause them to be less sensitive to chemotherapy drugs. Given this potential interaction, people should not drink black and green tea (as well as extracts of these teas) while receiving chemotherapy for prostate cancer in particular. Clozapine -- The antipsychotic effects of the medication clozapine may be reduced if taken fewer than 40 minutes after drinking green tea. Ephedrine -- When taken together with ephedrine, green tea may cause agitation, tremors, insomnia, and weight loss. Lithium -- Green tea has been shown to reduce blood levels of lithium (a medication used to treat manic/depression). Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) -- Green tea may cause a severe increase in blood pressure (called a \"hypertensive crisis\") when taken together with MAOIs, which are used to treat depression.  Oral Contraceptives -- Oral contraceptives can prolong the amount of time caffeine stays in the body and may increase its stimulating effects. Phenylpropanolamine -- A combination of caffeine (including caffeine from green tea) and phenylpropanolamine (an ingredient used in many over-the-counter and prescription cough and cold medications and weight loss products) can cause mania and a severe increase in blood pressure. The FDA issued a public health advisory book in November 2000 to warn people of the risk of bleeding in the brain from use of this medication and has strongly urged all manufacturers of this drug to remove it from the market.",

            "en": "5          5. CHEATER \"BELLA, WHY DON'T YOU TAKE OFF,\" MIKE SUGGESTED, his eyes focused off to the side, not really looking at me. I wondered how long that had been going on without me noticing. It was a slow afternoon at Newton's. At the moment there were only two patrons in the store, dedicated backpackers from the sound of their conversation. Mike had spent the last hour going through the pros and cons of two brands of lightweight packs with them. But they'd taken a break from serious pricing to indulge in trying to one - up each other with their latest tales from the trail. Their distraction had given Mike a chance to escape. \"I don't mind staying,\" I said. I still hadn't been able to sink back into my protective shell of numbness, and everything seemed oddly close and loud today, like I'd taken cotton out of my ears. I tried to tune out the laughing hikers without success. \"I'm telling you,\" said the thickset man with the orange beard that didn't match his dark brown hair. \"I've seen grizzlies pretty close up in Yellowstone, but they had nothing on this brute.\" His hair was matted, and his clothes looked like they'd been on his back for more than a few days. Fresh from the mountains. \"Not a chance. Black bears don't get that big. The grizzlies you saw were probably cubs.\" The second man was tall and lean, his face tanned and wind-whipped into an impressive leathery crust. \"Seriously, Bella, as soon as these two give up, I'm closing the place down,\" Mike murmured. \"If you want me to go\u2026\" I shrugged. \u00a0\"On all fours it was taller than you,\" the bearded man insisted while I gathered my things together. \"Big as a house and pitch-black. I'm going to report it to the ranger here. People ought to be warned\u2014this wasn't up on the mountain, mind you\u2014this was only a few miles from the trailhead.\" Leather-face laughed and rolled his eyes. \"Let me guess\u2014you were on your way in? Hadn't eaten real food or slept off the ground in a week, right?\" \"Hey, uh, Mike, right?\" the bearded man called, looking toward us. \"See you Monday,\" I mumbled. \"Yes, sir,\" Mike replied, turning away. \"Say, have there been any warnings around here recently\u2014about black bears?\" \"No, sir. But it's always good to keep your distance and store your food correctly. Have you seen the new bear-safe canisters? They only weigh two pounds\u2026\" The doors slid open to let me out into the rain. I hunched over inside my jacket as I\u00a0 dashed for my truck. The rain hammering against my hood sounded unusually loud, too, but soon the roar of the engine drowned out everything else. I didn't want to go back to Charlie's empty house. Last night had been particularly brutal, and I had no desire to revisit the scene of the suffering. Even after the pain had subsided enough for me to sleep, it wasn't over. Like I'd told Jessica after the movie, there was never any doubt that I would have nightmares. I always had nightmares now, every night. Not nightmares really, not in the plural,\u00a0 because it was always the same nightmare. You'd think I'd get bored after so many months, grow immune to it. But the dream never failed to horrify me, and only ended when I woke myself with screaming. Charlie didn't come in to see what was wrong anymore, to make sure there was no intruder strangling me or something like that\u2014he was used to it now. My nightmare probably wouldn't even frighten someone else. Nothing jumped out and screamed, \"Boo!\" There were no zombies, no ghosts, no psychopaths. There was nothing, really. Only nothing. Just the endless maze of moss-covered trees, so quiet that the silence was an uncomfortable pressure against my eardrums. It was dark, like dusk on a cloudy day, with only enough light to see that there was nothing to see. I hurried through the gloom without a path, always searching, searching, searching, getting more frantic as the time stretched on, trying to move faster, though the speed made me clumsy\u2026 Then there would come the point in my dream\u2014and I could feel it coming now, but could never seem to wake myself up before it hit\u2014when I couldn't remember what it was that I was searching for. When I realized that there was nothing to search for, and nothing to find.  That there never had been anything more than just this empty, dreary wood, and there never would be anything more for me\u2026 nothing but nothing\u2026 That was usually about when the screaming started. I wasn't paying attention to where I was driving\u2014just wandering through empty, wet side roads as I avoided the ways that would take me home\u2014because I didn't have anywhere to go.  I wished I could feel numb again, but I couldn't remember how I'd managed it before. The nightmare was nagging at my mind and making me think about things that would cause me pain. I didn't want to remember the forest. Even as I shuddered away from the images, I felt my eyes fill with tears and the aching begin around the edges of the hole in my chest. I took one hand from the steering wheel and wrapped it around my torso to hold it in one piece. It will be as if I'd never existed. The words ran through my head, lacking the perfect clarity of my hallucination last night. They were just words, soundless, like print on a page. Just words, but they ripped the hole wide open, and I stomped on the brake, knowing I should not drive while this incapacitated. I curled over, pressing my face against the steering wheel and trying to breathe without lungs. S\u1ebd nh\u01b0 th\u1ec3 t\u00f4i ch\u01b0a h\u1ec1 t\u1ed3n t\u1ea1i tr\u00ean \u0111\u1eddi n\u00e0y I wondered how long this could last. Maybe someday, years from now\u2014if the pain would just decrease to the point where I could bear it\u2014I would be able to look back on those few short months that would always be the best of my life. And, if it were possible that the pain would ever soften enough to allow me to do that, I was sure that I would feel grateful for as much time as he'd given me. More than I'd asked for, more than I'd deserved. Maybe someday I'd be able to see it that way. But what if this hole never got any better? If the raw edges never healed? If the damage was permanent and irreversible? I held myself tightly together. As if he'd never existed, I thought in despair. What a stupid and impossible promise to make! He could steal my pictures and reclaim his gifts, but that didn't put things back the way they'd been before I'd met him. The physical evidence was the most insignificant part of the equation. I was changed, my insides altered almost past the point of recognition. Even my outsides looked different\u2014my face sallow, white except for the purple circles the nightmares had left under my eyes. My eyes were dark enough against my pallid skin that\u2014if I were beautiful, and seen from a distance\u2014I might even pass for a vampire now. But I was not beautiful, and I probably looked closer to a zombie. Nh\u01b0 th\u1ec3 anh ch\u01b0a t\u1eebng t\u1ed3n t\u1ea1i tr\u00ean \u0111\u1eddi n\u00e0y As if he'd never existed? That was insanity. It was a promise that he could never keep, a promise that was broken as soon as he'd made it. I thumped my head against the steering wheel, trying to distract myself from the sharper pain. It made me feel silly for ever worrying about keeping my promise. Where was the logic in sticking to an agreement that had already been violated by the other party? Who cared if I was reckless and stupid? There was no reason to avoid recklessness, no reason why I shouldn't get to be stupid. I laughed humorlessly to myself, still gasping for air. Reckless in Forks\u2014now there was a hopeless proposition. The dark humor distracted me, and the distraction eased the pain. My breath came easier, and I was able to lean back against the seat. Though it was cold today, my forehead was damp with sweat. I concentrated on my hopeless proposition to keep from sliding back into the excruciating memories. To be reckless in Forks would take a lot of creativity\u2014maybe more than I had. But I wished I could find some way\u2026 I might feel better if I weren't holding fast, all alone, to a broken pact. If I were an oath-breaker, too. But how could I cheat on my side of the deal, here in this harmless little town? Of course, Forks hadn't always been so harmless, but now it was exactly what it had always appeared to be. It was dull, it was safe. I stared out the windshield for a long moment, my thoughts moving sluggishly\u2014I couldn't seem to make those thoughts go anywhere. I cut the engine, which was groaning in a pitiful way after idling for so long, and stepped out into the drizzle. The cold rain dripped through my hair and then trickled across my cheeks like freshwater tears. It helped to clear my head. I blinked the water from my eyes, staring blankly across the road. After a minute of staring, I recognized where I was. I'd parked in the middle of the north lane of Russell Avenue. I was standing in front of the Cheneys' house\u2014my truck was blocking their driveway\u2014and across the road lived the Markses. I knew I needed to move my truck, and that I ought to go home. It was wrong to wander the way I had, distracted and impaired, a menace on the roads of Forks. Besides, someone would notice me soon enough, and report me to Charlie. As I took a deep breath in preparation to move, a sign in the Markses' yard caught my eye\u2014it was just a big piece of cardboard leaning against their mailbox post, with black letters scrawled in caps across it. Sometimes, kismet happens. Coincidence? Or was it meant to be? I didn't know, but it seemed kind of silly to think that it was somehow fated, that the dilapidated motorcycles rusting in the Markses' front yard beside the hand-printed FOR SALE, AS IS sign were serving some higher purpose by existing there, right where I needed them to be. So maybe it wasn't kismet. Maybe there were just all kinds of ways to be reckless, and I only now had my eyes open to them. Reckless and stupid. Those were Charlie's two very favorite words to apply to motorcycles. Charlie's job didn't get a lot of action compared to cops in bigger towns, but he did get called in on traffic accidents. With the long, wet stretches of freeway twisting and turning through the forest, blind corner after blind corner, there was no shortage of that kind of action. But even with all the huge log-haulers barreling around the turns, mostly people walked away. The exceptions to that rule were often on motorcycles, and Charlie had seen one too many victims, almost always kids, smeared on the highway. He'd made me promise before I was ten that I would never accept a ride on a motorcycle. Even at that age, I didn't have to think twice before promising. Who would want to ride a motorcycle here? It would be like taking a sixty-mile-per-hour bath. So many promises I kept\u2026 It clicked together for me then. I wanted to be stupid and reckless, and I wanted to break promises. Why stop at one? That's as far as I thought it through. I sloshed through the rain to the Markses' front door and rang the bell. One of the Marks boys opened the door, the younger one, the freshman. I couldn't remember his name. His sandy hair only came up to my shoulder. He had no trouble remembering my name. \"Bella Swan?\" he asked in surprise. \"How much do you want for the bike?\" I panted, jerking my thumb over my shoulder toward the sales display. \"Are you serious?\" he demanded. \"Of course I am.\" \"They don't work.\" I sighed impatiently\u2014this was something I'd already inferred from the sign. \"How much?\" \"If you really want one, just take it. My mom made my dad move them down to the road so they'd get picked up with the garbage.\" I glanced at the bikes again and saw that they were resting on a pile of yard clippings and dead branches. \"Are you positive about that?\" \"Sure, you want to ask her?\" It was probably better not to involve adults who might mention this to Charlie. \"No, I believe you.\" \"You want me to help you?\" he offered. \"They're not light.\" \"Okay, thanks. I only need one, though.\" \"Might as well take both,\" the boy said. \"Maybe you could <em>scavenge</em> some parts.\" He followed me out into the downpour and helped me load both of the heavy bikes into the back of my truck. He seemed eager to be rid of them, so I didn't argue. \"What are you going to do with them, anyway?\" he asked. \"They haven't worked in years.\" \"I kind of guessed that,\" I said, shrugging. My spur-of-the-moment whim hadn't come with a plan intact. \"Maybe I'll take them to Dowling's.\" He snorted. \"Dowling would charge more to fix them than they'd be worth running.\" I couldn't argue with that. John Dowling had earned a reputation for his pricing; no one went to him except in an emergency. Most people preferred to make the drive up to Port Angeles, if their car was able. I'd been very lucky on that front\u2014I'd been worried, when Charlie first gifted me my ancient truck, that I wouldn't be able to afford to keep it running. But I'd never had a single problem with it, other than the screaming-loud engine and the fifty-five-mile-per-hour maximum speed limit. Jacob Black had kept it in great shape when it had belonged to his father, Billy\u2026 Inspiration hit like a bolt of lightning\u2014not unreasonable, considering the storm. \"You know what? That's okay. I know someone who builds cars.\" \"Oh. That's good.\" He smiled in relief. He waved as I pulled away, still smiling. Friendly kid. I drove quickly and purposefully now, in a hurry to get home before there was the slightest chance of Charlie appearing, even in the highly unlikely event that he might knock off early. I dashed through the house to the phone, keys still in hand. \"Chief Swan, please,\" I said when the deputy answered. \"It's Bella.\" \"Oh, hey, Bella,\" Deputy Steve said affably. \"I'll go get him.\" I waited. \"What's wrong, Bella?\" Charlie demanded as soon as he picked up the phone. \"Can't I call you at work without there being an emergency?\" He was quiet for a minute. \"You never have before. Is there an emergency?\" \"No. I just wanted directions to the Blacks' place\u2014I'm not sure I can remember the way. I want to visit Jacob. I haven't seen him in months.\" When Charlie spoke again, his voice was much happier. \"That's a great idea, Bells. Do you have a pen?\" The directions he gave me were very simple. I assured him that I would be back for dinner, though he tried to tell me not to hurry. He wanted to join me in La Push, and I wasn't having that. So it was with a deadline that I drove too quickly through the storm-darkened streets out of town. I hoped I could get Jacob alone. Billy would probably tell on me if he knew what I was up to. While I drove, I worried a little bit about Billy's reaction to seeing me. He would be too pleased. In Billy's mind, no doubt, this had all worked out better than he had dared to hope. His pleasure and relief would only remind me of the one I couldn't bear to be reminded of. Not again today, I pleaded silently. I was spent. The Blacks' house was vaguely familiar, a small wooden place with narrow windows, the dull red paint making it resemble a tiny barn. Jacob's head peered out of the window before I could even get out of the truck. No doubt the familiar roar of the engine had tipped him off to my approach. Jacob had been very grateful when Charlie bought Billy's truck for me, saving Jacob from having to drive it when he came of age. I liked my truck very much, but Jacob seemed to consider the speed restrictions a shortcoming. He met me halfway to the house. \"Bella!\" His excited grin stretched wide across his face, the bright teeth standing in vivid contrast to the deep russet color of his skin. I'd never seen his hair out of its usual ponytail before. It fell like black satin curtains on either side of his broad face. Jacob had grown into some of his potential in the last eight months. He'd passed that point where the soft muscles of childhood hardened into the solid, lanky build of a teenager; the tendons and veins had become prominent under the red-brown skin of his arms, his hands. His face was still sweet like I remembered it, though it had hardened, too\u2014the planes of his cheekbones sharper, his jaw squared off, all childish roundness gone. \"Hey, Jacob!\" I felt an unfamiliar surge of enthusiasm at his smile. I realized that I was pleased to see him. This knowledge surprised me. I smiled back, and something clicked silently into place, like two corresponding puzzle pieces. I'd forgotten how much I really liked Jacob Black. He stopped a few feet away from me, and I stared up at him in surprise, leaning my head back though the rain pelted my face. \"You grew again!\" I accused in amazement. He laughed, his smile widening impossibly. \"Six five,\" he announced with self-satisfaction. His voice was deeper, but it had the husky tone I remembered. \"Is it ever going to stop?\" I shook my head in disbelief. \"You're huge.\" \"Still a beanpole, though.\" He grimaced. \"Come inside! You're getting all wet.\" He led the way, twisting his hair in his big hands as he walked. He pulled a rubber band from his hip pocket and wound it around the bundle. \"Hey, Dad,\" he called as he ducked to get through the front door. \"Look who stopped by.\" Billy was in the tiny square living room, a book in his hands. He set the book in his lap and wheeled himself forward when he saw me. \"Well, what do you know! It's good to see you, Bella.\" We shook hands. Mine was lost in his wide grasp. \"What brings you out here? Everything okay with Charlie?\" \"Yes, absolutely. I just wanted to see Jacob\u2014I haven't seen him in forever.\" Jacob's eyes brightened at my words. He was smiling so big it looked like it would hurt his cheeks.  \"Can you stay for dinner?\" Billy was eager, too. \"No, I've got to feed Charlie, you know.\" \"I'll call him now,\" Billy suggested. \"He's always invited.\" I laughed to hide my discomfort. \"It's not like you'll never see me again. I promise I'll be back again soon\u2014so much you'll get sick of me.\" After all, if Jacob could fix the bike, someone had to teach me how to ride it. Billy chuckled in response. \"Okay, maybe next time.\" \"So, Bella, what do you want to do?\" Jacob asked. \"Whatever. What were you doing before I interrupted?\" I was strangely comfortable here. It was familiar, but only distantly. There were no painful reminders of the recent past. Jacob hesitated. \"I was just heading out to work on my car, but we can do something else\u2026\" \"No, that's perfect!\" I interrupted. \"I'd love to see your car.\" \"Okay,\" he said, not convinced. \"It's out back, in the garage.\" Even better, I thought to myself. I waved at Billy. \"See you later.\" A thick stand of trees and shrubbery concealed his garage from the house. The garage\u00a0\u00a0 was no more than a couple of big preformed sheds that had been bolted together with their interior walls knocked out.  Under this shelter, raised on cinder blocks, was what looked to me like a completed automobile. I recognized the symbol on the grille, at least. \"What kind of Volkswagen is that?\" I asked. \"It's an old Rabbit\u20141986, a classic.\" \"How's it going?\" \"Almost finished,\" he said cheerfully. And then his voice dropped into a lower key. \"My dad made good on his promise last spring.\" \"Ah,\" I said. He seemed to understand my reluctance to open the subject. I tried not to remember last May at the prom. Jacob had been bribed by his father with money and car parts to deliver a message there. Billy wanted me to stay a safe distance from the most important person in my life. It turned out that his concern was, in the end, unnecessary. I was all too safe now. But I was going to see what I could do to change that. \"Jacob, what do you know about motorcycles?\" I asked. He shrugged. \"Some. My friend Embry has a dirt bike. We work on it together sometimes. Why?\" \"Well\u2026\" I pursed my lips as I considered. I wasn't sure if he could keep his mouth shut, but I didn't have many other options. \"I recently acquired a couple of bikes, and they're not in the greatest condition. I wonder if you could get them running?\" \"Cool.\" He seemed truly pleased by the challenge. His face glowed. \"I'll give it a try.\" I held up one finger in warning. \"The thing is,\" I explained, \"Charlie doesn't approve of motorcycles. \u00a0Honestly, he'd probably bust a vein in his forehead if he knew about this. So you can't tell Billy.\" \"Sure, sure.\" Jacob smiled. \"I understand.\" \"I'll pay you,\" I continued. This offended him. \"No. I want to help. You can't pay me.\" \"Well\u2026 how about a trade, then?\" I was making this up as I went, but it seemed reasonable enough. \"I only need one bike\u2014and I'll need lessons, too. So how about this? I'll give you the other bike, and then you can teach me.\" \"Swee-eet.\" He made the word into two syllables. \"Wait a sec\u2014are you legal yet? When's your birthday?\" \"You missed it,\" he teased, narrowing his eyes in mock resentment. \"I'm sixteen.\" \"Not that your age ever stopped you before,\" I muttered. \"Sorry about your birthday.\" \"Don't worry about it. I missed yours. What are you, forty?\" I sniffed. \"Close.\" \"We'll have a joint party to make up for it.\" \"Sounds like a date.\" His eyes sparkled at the word. I needed to reign in the enthusiasm before I gave him the wrong idea\u2014it was just that it had been a long time since I'd felt so light and buoyant. The rarity of the feeling made it more difficult to manage. \"Maybe when the bikes are finished\u2014our present to ourselves,\" I added. \"Deal. When will you bring them down?\" I bit my lip, embarrassed. \"They're in my truck now,\" I admitted. \"Great.\" He seemed to mean it. \"Will Billy see if we bring them around?\" He winked at me. \"We'll be sneaky.\" We eased around from the east, sticking to the trees when we were in view of the windows, affecting a casual-looking stroll, just in case. Jacob unloaded the bikes swiftly from the truck bed, wheeling them one by one into the shrubbery where I hid. It looked too easy for him\u2014I'd remembered the bikes being much, much heavier than that. \"These aren't half bad,\" Jacob appraised as we pushed them through the cover of the trees. \"This one here will actually be worth something when I'm done\u2014it's an old Harley Sprint.\" \"That one's yours, then.\" \"Are you sure?\" \"Absolutely.\" \"These are going to take some cash, though,\" he said, frowning down at the blackened metal. \"We'll have to save up for parts first.\" \"We nothing,\" I disagreed. \"If you're doing this for free, I'll pay for the parts.\" \"I don't know\u2026\" he muttered. \"I've got some money saved. College fund, you know.\" College, schmollege, I thought to myself. It wasn't like I'd saved up enough to go anywhere special\u2014and besides, I had no desire to leave Forks anyway. What difference would it make if I skimmed a little bit off the top? Jacob just nodded. This all made perfect sense to him. As we skulked back to the makeshift garage, I contemplated my luck. Only a teenage boy would agree to this: deceiving both our parents while repairing dangerous vehicles using money meant for my college education. He didn't see anything wrong with that picture. Jacob was a gift from the gods.",
