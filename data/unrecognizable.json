            "en": "15          15. THE CULLENS The muted light of yet another cloudy day eventually woke me. I lay with my arm across my eyes, groggy and dazed. Something, a dream trying to be remembered, struggled to break into my consciousness. I moaned and rolled on my side, hoping more sleep would come. And then the previous day flooded back into my awareness. \"Oh!\" I sat up so fast it made my head spin. \"Your hair looks like a haystack\u2026 but I like it.\u201dHis unruffled voice came from the rocking chair in the corner. \"Edward! You stayed!\" I rejoiced, and thoughtlessly threw myself across the room and into his lap. In the instant that my thoughts caught up with my actions, I froze, shocked by my own uncontrolled enthusiasm. I stared up at him, afraid that I had crossed the wrong line. But he laughed. \"Of course,\u201dHe answered, startled, but seeming pleased by my reaction. His hands rubbed my back. I laid my head cautiously against his shoulder, breathing in the smell of his skin. \"I was sure it was a dream.\" \"You're not that creative,\u201dHe scoffed. \"Charlie!\" I remembered, thoughtlessly jumping up again and heading to the door. \"He left an hour ago \u2014 after reattaching your battery cables, I might add. I have to admit I was disappointed. Is that really all it would take to stop you, if you were determined to go?\" I deliberated where I stood, wanting to return to him badly, but afraid I might have morning breath. \"You're not usually this confused in the morning,\u201dHe noted. He held his arms open for me to return. A nearly irresistible invitation. \"I need another human minute,\" I admitted. \"I'll wait.\" I skipped to the bathroom, my emotions <em>unrecognizable</em>. I didn't know myself, inside or out. The face in the mirror was practically a stranger \u2014 eyes too bright, hectic spots of red across my cheekbones. After I brushed my teeth, I worked to straighten out the tangled chaos that was my hair. I splashed my face with cold water, and tried to breathe normally, with no noticeable success. I half-ran back to my room.  It seemed like a miracle that he was there, his arms still waiting for me. He reached out to me, and my heart thumped unsteadily. \"Welcome back,\u201dHe murmured, taking me into his arms. He rocked me for a while in silence, until I noticed that his clothes were changed, his hair smooth. \"You left?\" I accused, touching the collar of his fresh shirt. \"I could hardly leave in the clothes I came in \u2014 what would the neighbors think?\"  I pouted. \"You were very deeply asleep; I didn't miss anything.\u201dHis eyes gleamed. \"The talking came earlier.\" I groaned. \"What did you hear?\" His gold eyes grew very soft. \"You said you loved me.\" \"You knew that already,\" I reminded him, ducking my head. \"It was nice to hear, just the same.\" I hid my face against his shoulder. \"I love you,\" I whispered. \"You are my life now,\u201dHe answered simply. There was nothing more to say for the moment. He rocked us back and forth as the room grew lighter. \"Breakfast time,\u201dHe said eventually, casually \u2014 to prove, I'm sure, that he remembered all my human frailties. So I clutched my throat with both hands and stared at him with wide eyes. Shock crossed his face. \"Kidding!\" I snickered. \"And you said I couldn't act!\" He frowned in disgust. \"That wasn't funny.\" \"It was very funny, and you know it.\" But I examined his gold eyes carefully, to make sure that I was forgiven. Apparently, I was. \"Shall I rephrase?\u201dHe asked. \"Breakfast time for the human.\" \"Oh, okay.\" He threw me over his stone shoulder, gently, but with a swiftness that left me breathless. I protested as he carried me easily down the stairs, but he ignored me. He sat me right side up on a chair. The kitchen was bright, happy, seeming to absorb my mood. \"What's for breakfast?\" I asked pleasantly. That threw him for a minute. \"Er, I'm not sure. What would you like?\u201dHis marble brow puckered. I grinned, hopping up. \"That's all right, I fend for myself pretty well. Watch me hunt.\" I found a bowl and a box of cereal. I could feel his eyes on me as I poured the milk and grabbed a spoon. I sat my food on the table, and then paused. \"Can I get you anything?\" I asked, not wanting to be rude. He rolled his eyes. \"Just eat, Bella.\" I sat at the table, watching him as I took a bite. He was gazing at me, studying my every movement. It made me self-conscious. I cleared my mouth to speak, to distract him. \"What's on the agenda for today?\" I asked. \"Hmmm\u2026\" I watched him frame his answer carefully. \"What would you say to meeting my family?\" I gulped. \"Are you afraid now?\u201dHe sounded hopeful. \"Yes,\" I admitted; how could I deny it \u2014 he could see my eyes. \"Don't worry.\u201dHe smirked. \"I'll protect you.\" \"I'm not afraid of them,\" I explained. \"I'm afraid they won't\u2026 like me. Won't they be, well, surprised that you would bring someone\u2026 like me\u2026 home to meet them? Do they know that I know about them?\" \"Oh, they already know everything. They'd taken bets yesterday, you know\" \u2014 he smiled, but his voice was harsh \u2014 \"on whether I'd bring you back, though why anyone would bet against Alice, I can't imagine. At any rate, we don't have secrets in the family. It's not really feasible, what with my mind reading and Alice seeing the future and all that.\" \"And Jasper making you feel all warm and fuzzy about spilling your guts, don't forget that.\" \"You paid attention,\u201dHe smiled approvingly. \"I've been known to do that every now and then.\" I grimaced. \"So did Alice see me coming?\" His reaction was strange. \"Something like that,\u201dHe said uncomfortably, turning away so I couldn't see his eyes. I stared at him curiously. \"Is that any good?\u201dHe asked, turning back to me abruptly and eyeing my breakfast with a teasing look on his face. \"Honestly, it doesn't look very appetizing.\" \"Well, it's no irritable grizzly\u2026\" I murmured, ignoring him when he glowered. I was still wondering why he responded that way when I mentioned Alice. I hurried through my cereal, speculating. He stood in the middle of the kitchen, the statue of Adonis again, staring abstractedly out the back windows. Then his eyes were back on me, and he smiled his heartbreaking smile. \"And you should introduce me to your father, too, I think.\" \"He already knows you,\" I reminded him. \"As your boyfriend, I mean.\" I stared at him with suspicion. \"Why?\" \"Isn't that customary?\u201dHe asked innocently. \"I don't know,\" I admitted. My dating history gave me few reference points to work with. Not that any normal rules of dating applied here. \"That's not necessary, you know. I don't expect you to\u2026 I mean, you don't have to pretend for me.\" His smile was patient. \"I'm not pretending.\" I pushed the remains of my cereal around the edges of the bowl, biting my lip. \"Are you going to tell Charlie I'm your boyfriend or not?\u201dHe demanded. \"Is that what you are?\" I suppressed my internal cringing at the thought of Edward and Charlie and the word boy friend all in the same room at the same time. \"It's a loose interpretation of the word 'boy,' I'll admit.\"  \"I was under the impression that you were something more, actually,\" I confessed, looking at the table. \"Well, I don't know if we need to give him all the gory details.\u201dHe reached across the table to lift my chin with a cold, gentle finger. \"But he will need some explanation for why I'm around here so much. I don't want Chief Swan getting a restraining order put on me.\" \"Will you be?\" I asked, suddenly anxious. \"Will you really be here?\" \"As long as you want me,\u201dHe assured me. \"I'll always want you,\" I warned him. \"Forever.\" He walked slowly around the table, and, pausing a few feet away, he reached out to touch his fingertips to my cheek. His expression was unfathomable. \"Does that make you sad?\" I asked. He didn't answer. He stared into my eyes for an immeasurable period of time. \"Are you finished?\u201dHe finally asked. I jumped up. \"Yes.\" \"Get dressed \u2014 I'll wait here.\" It was hard to decide what to wear. I doubted there were any etiquette books detailing how to dress when your vampire sweetheart takes you home to meet his vampire family. It was a relief to think the word to myself. I knew I shied away from it intentionally. I ended up in my only skirt \u2014 long, khaki-colored, still casual. I put on the dark blue blouse he'd once complimented. A quick glance in the mirror told me my hair was entirely impossible, so I pulled it back into a pony tail. \"Okay.\" I bounced down the stairs. \"I'm decent.\" He was waiting at the foot of the stairs, closer than I'd thought, and I bounded right into him. He steadied me, holding me a careful distance away for a few seconds before suddenly pulling me closer. \"Wrong again,\u201dHe murmured in my ear. \"You are utterly indecent \u2014 no one should look so tempting, it's not fair.\" \"Tempting how?\" I asked. \"I can change\u2026\" He sighed, shaking his head. \"You are so absurd.\u201dHe pressed his cool lips delicately to my forehead, and the room spun. The smell of his breath made it impossible to think.  \"Shall I explain how you are tempting me?\u201dHe said. It was clearly a rhetorical question. His fingers traced slowly down my spine, his breath coming more quickly against my skin. My hands were limp on his chest, and I felt lightheaded again. He tilted his head slowly and touched his cool lips to mine for the second time, very carefully, parting them slightly. And then I collapsed. \"Bella?\u201dHis voice was alarmed as he caught me and held me up. \"You\u2026 made\u2026 me\u2026 faint,\" I accused him dizzily. \"What am I going to do with you?\u201dHe groaned in exasperation. \"Yesterday I kiss you, and you attack me! Today you pass out on me!\" I laughed weakly, letting his arms support me while my head spun. \"So much for being good at everything,\u201dHe sighed. \"That's the problem.\" I was still dizzy. \"You're too good. Far, far too good.\" \"Do you feel sick?\u201dHe asked; he'd seen me like this before. \"No \u2014 that wasn't the same kind of fainting at all. I don't know what happened.\" I shook my head apologetically, \"I think I forgot to breathe.\" \"I can't take you anywhere like this.\" \"I'm fine,\" I insisted. \"Your family is going to think I'm insane anyway, what's the difference?\" He measured my expression for a moment. \"I'm very partial to that color with your skin,\u201dHe offered unexpectedly. I flushed with pleasure, and looked away. \"Look, I'm trying really hard not to think about what I'm about to do, so can we go already?\" I asked. \"And you're worried, not because you're headed to meet a houseful of vampires, but because you think those vampires won't approve of you, correct?\" \"That's right,\" I answered immediately, hiding my surprise at his casual use of the word. He shook his head. \"You're incredible.\" I realized, as he drove my truck out of the main part of town, that I had no idea where he lived. We passed over the bridge at the Calawah River, the road winding northward, the houses flashing past us growing farther apart, getting bigger. And then we were past the other houses altogether, driving through misty forest. I was trying to decide whether to ask or be patient, when he turned abruptly onto an unpaved road. It was unmarked, barely visible among the ferns. The forest encroached on both sides, leaving the road ahead only discernible for a few meters as it twisted, serpentlike, around the ancient trees. And then, after a few miles, there was some thinning of the woods, and we were suddenly in a small meadow, or was it actually a lawn? The gloom of the forest didn't relent, though, for there were six primordial cedars that shaded an entire acre with their vast sweep of branches. The trees held their protecting shadow right up to the walls of the house that rose among them, making obsolete the deep porch that wrapped around the first story. I don't know what I had expected, but it definitely wasn't this. The house was timeless, graceful, and probably a hundred years old. It was painted a soft, faded white, three stories tall, \u00a0\u00a0rectangular and well proportioned. The windows and doors were either part of the original structure or a perfect restoration. My truck was the only car in sight. I could hear the river close by, hidden in the obscurity of the forest. \"Wow.\" \"You like it?\u201dHe smiled. \"It\u2026 has a certain charm.\" He pulled the end of my ponytail and chuckled. \"Ready?\u201dHe asked, opening my door. \"Not even a little bit \u2014 let's go.\" I tried to laugh, but it seemed to get stuck in my throat. I smoothed my hair nervously. \"You look lovely.\u201dHe took my hand easily, without thinking about it. We walked through the deep shade up to the porch. I knew he could feel my tension; his thumb rubbed soothing circles into the back of my hand. He opened the door for me. The inside was even more surprising, less predictable, than the exterior. It was very bright, very open, and very large. This must have originally been several rooms, but the walls had been removed from most of the first floor to create one wide space. The back, south-facing wall had been entirely replaced with glass, and, beyond the shade of the cedars, the lawn stretched bare to the wide river. A massive curving staircase dominated the west side of the room. The walls, the high-beamed ceiling, the wooden floors, and the thick carpets were all varying shades of white. Waiting to greet us, standing just to the left of the door, on a raised portion of the floor by a spectacular grand piano, were Edward's parents. I'd seen Dr. Cullen before, of course, yet I couldn't help but be struck again by his youth, his outrageous perfection. At his side was Esme, I assumed, the only one of the family I'd never seen before. She had the same pale, beautiful features as the rest of them. Something about her heart-shaped face, her billows of soft, caramel-colored hair, reminded me of the ing\u00e9nues of the silent-movie era. She was small, slender, yet less angular, more rounded than the others. They were both dressed casually, in light colors that matched the inside of the house. They smiled in welcome, but made no move to approach us. Trying not to frighten me, I guessed. \"Carlisle, Esme,\u201dEdward's voice broke the short silence, \"this is Bella.\" \"You're very welcome, Bella.\u201dCarlisle's step was measured, careful as he approached me. He raised his hand tentatively, and I stepped forward to shake hands with him. \"It's nice to see you again, Dr. Cullen.\" \"Please, call me Carlisle.\" \"Carlisle.\" I grinned at him, my sudden confidence surprising me. I could feel Edward's relief at my side. Esme smiled and stepped forward as well, reaching for my hand. Her cold, stone grasp was just as I expected. \"It's very nice to know you,\" she said sincerely. \"Thank you. I'm glad to meet you, too.\u201dAnd I was. It was like meeting a fairy tale \u2014 Snow White, in the flesh. \"Where are Alice and Jasper?\u201dEdward asked, but no one answered, as they had just appeared at the top of the wide staircase. \"Hey, Edward!\u201dAlice called enthusiastically. She ran down the stairs, a streak of black hair and white skin, coming to a sudden and graceful stop in front of me. Carlisle and Esme shot warning glances at her, but I liked it. It was natural \u2014 for her, anyway. \"Hi, Bella!\u201dAlice said, and she bounced forward to kiss my cheek. If Carlisle and Esme had looked cautious before, they now looked staggered. There was shock in my eyes, too, but I was also very pleased that she seemed to approve of me so entirely. I was startled to feel Edward stiffen at my side. I glanced at his face, but his expression was unreadable. \"You do smell nice, I never noticed before,\" she commented, to my extreme embarrassment. No one else seemed to know quite what to say, and then Jasper was there \u2014 tall and leonine. A feeling of ease spread through me, and I was suddenly comfortable despite where I was. Edward stared at Jasper, raising one eyebrow, and I remembered what Jasper could do.  \"Hello, Bella,\" Jasper said. He kept his distance, not offering to shake my hand. But it was impossible to feel awkward near him. \"Hello, Jasper.\" I smiled at him shyly, and then at the others. \"It's nice to meet you all \u2014 you have a very beautiful home,\" I added conventionally. \"Thank you,\u201dEsme said. \"We're so glad that you came.\" She spoke with feeling, and I realized that she thought I was brave. I also realized that Rosalie and Emmett were nowhere to be seen, and I remembered Edward's too-innocent denial when I'd asked him if the others didn't like me. Carlisle's expression distracted me from this train of thought; he was gazing meaningfully at Edward with an intense expression. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Edward nod once. I looked away, trying to be polite. My eyes wandered again to the beautiful instrument on the platform by the door. I suddenly remembered my childhood fantasy that, should I ever win a lottery, I would buy a grand piano for my mother. She wasn't really good \u2014 she only played for herself on our secondhand upright \u2014 but I loved to watch her play. She was happy, absorbed \u2014 she seemed like a new, mysterious being to me then, someone outside the \"mom\" persona I took for granted. She'd put me through lessons, of course, but like most kids, I whined until she let me quit. Esme noticed my preoccupation. \"Do you play?\" she asked, inclining her head toward the piano. I shook my head. \"Not at all. But it's so beautiful. Is it yours?\" \"No,\" she laughed. \"Edward didn't tell you he was musical?\" \"No.\" I glared at his suddenly innocent expression with narrowed eyes. \"I should have known, I guess.\" Esme raised her delicate eyebrows in confusion. \"Edward can do everything, right?\" I explained. Jasper snickered and Esme gave Edward a reproving look. \"I hope you haven't been showing off\u2014 it's rude,\" she scolded. \"Just a bit,\u201dHe laughed freely. Her face softened at the sound, and they shared a brief look that I didn't understand, though Esme's face seemed almost smug. \"He's been too modest, actually,\" I corrected. \"Well, play for her,\u201dEsme encouraged. \"You just said showing off was rude,\u201dHe objected. \"There are exceptions to every rule,\" she replied. \"I'd like to hear you play,\" I volunteered. \"It's settled then.\u201dEsme pushed him toward the piano. He pulled me along, sitting me on the bench beside him. He gave me a long, exasperated look before he turned to the keys. And then his fingers flowed swiftly across the ivory, and the room was filled with a composition so complex, so luxuriant, it was impossible to believe only one set of hands played. I felt my chin drop, my mouth open in astonishment, and heard low chuckles behind me at my reaction. Edward looked at me casually, the music still surging around us without a break, and winked. \"Do you like it?\" \"You wrote this?\" I gasped, understanding. He nodded. \"It's Esme's favorite.\" I closed my eyes, shaking my head. \"What's wrong?\" \"I'm feeling extremely insignificant.\" The music slowed, transforming into something softer, and to my surprise I detected the melody of his lullaby weaving through the profusion of notes. \"You inspired this one,\u201dHe said softly. The music grew unbearably sweet. I couldn't speak. \"They like you, you know,\u201dHe said conversationally. \"Esme especially.\" I glanced behind me, but the huge room was empty now. \"Where did they go?\" \"Very subtly giving us some privacy, I suppose.\" I sighed. \"They like me. But Rosalie and Emmett\u2026\" I trailed off, not sure how to express my doubts. He frowned. \"Don't worry about Rosalie,\u201dHe said, his eyes wide and persuasive. \"She'll come around.\" I pursed my lips skeptically. \"Emmett?\" \"Well, he thinks I'm a lunatic, it's true, but he doesn't have a problem with you. He's trying to reason with Rosalie.\" \"What is it that upsets her?\" I wasn't sure if I wanted to know the answer. He sighed deeply. \"Rosalie struggles the most with\u2026 with what we are.\u00a0 It's hard for her to have someone on the outside know the truth. And she's a little jealous.\" \"Rosalie is jealous of me?\" I asked incredulously. I tried to imagine a universe in which someone as breathtaking as Rosalie would have any possible reason to feel jealous of someone like me. \"You're human.\u201dHe shrugged. \"She wishes that she were, too.\" \"Oh,\" I muttered, still stunned. \"Even Jasper, though\u2026\" \"That's really my fault,\u201dHe said. \"I told you he was the most recent to try our way of life. I warned him to keep his distance.\" I thought about the reason for that, and shuddered. \"Esme and Carlisle\u2026 ?\" I continued quickly, to keep him from noticing. \"Are happy to see me happy. Actually, Esme wouldn't care if you had a third eye and webbed feet. All this time she's been worried about me, afraid that there was something missing from my essential makeup, that I was too young when Carlisle changed me\u2026 She's ecstatic. Every time I touch you, she just about chokes with satisfaction.\" \"Alice seems very\u2026 enthusiastic.\" \"Alice has her own way of looking at things,\u201dHe said through tight lips. \"And you're not going to explain that, are you?\" A moment of wordless communication passed between us. He realized that I knew he was keeping something from me. I realized that he wasn't going to give anything away. Not now. \"So what was Carlisle telling you before?\" His eyebrows pulled together. \"You noticed that, did you?\" I shrugged. \"Of course.\" He looked at me thoughtfully for a few seconds before answering. \"He wanted to tell me some news \u2014 he didn't know if it was something I would share with you.\" \"Will you?\" \"I have to, because I'm going to be a little\u2026 overbearingly protective over the next few days \u2014 or weeks \u2014 and I wouldn't want you to think I'm naturally a tyrant.\" \"What's wrong?\" \"Nothing's wrong, exactly. Alice just sees some visitors coming soon. They know we're here, and they're curious.\" \"Visitors?\" \"Yes\u2026 well, they aren't like us, of course \u2014 in their hunting habits, I mean. They probably won't come into town at all, but I'm certainly not going to let you out of my sight till they're gone.\" I shivered. \"Finally, a rational response!\u201dHe murmured. \"I was beginning to think you had no sense of self-preservation at all.\" I let that one pass, looking away, my eyes wandering again around the spacious room. He followed my gaze. \"Not what you expected, is it?\u201dHe asked, his voice smug. \"No,\" I admitted. \"No coffins, no piled skulls in the corners; I don't even think we have cobwebs\u2026 what a disappointment this must be for you,\u201dHe continued slyly. I ignored his teasing. \"It's so light\u2026 so open.\" He was more serious when he answered. \"It's the one place we never have to hide.\" ,  The song he was still playing, my song, drifted to an end, the final chords shifting to a more melancholy key. The last note hovered poignantly in the silence. \"Thank you,\" I murmured. I realized there were tears in my eyes. I dabbed at them, embarrassed. He touched the corner of my eye, trapping one I missed. He lifted his finger, examining the drop of moisture broodingly. Then, so quickly I couldn't be positive that he really did, he put his finger to his mouth to taste it. I looked at him questioningly, and he gazed back for a long moment before he finally smiled. \"Do you want to see the rest of the house?\" \"No coffins?\" I verified, the sarcasm in my voice not entirely masking the slight but genuine anxiety I felt. He laughed, taking my hand, leading me away from the piano. \"No coffins,\u201dHe promised. We walked up the massive staircase, my hand trailing along the satin-smooth rail. The long hall at the top of the stairs was paneled with a honey-colored wood, the same as the floorboards. \"Rosalie and Emmett's room\u2026 Carlisle's office\u2026 Alice's room\u2026\u201dHe gestured as he led me past the doors. He would have continued, but I stopped dead at the end of the hall, staring incredulously at the ornament hanging on the wall above my head. Edward chuckled at my bewildered expression. \"You can laugh,\u201dHe said. \"It is sort of ironic.\" I didn't laugh. My hand raised automatically, one finger extended as if to touch the large wooden cross, its dark patina contrasting with the lighter tone of the wall. I didn't touch it, though I was curious if the aged wood would feel as silky as it looked. \"It must be very old,\" I guessed. He shrugged. \"Early sixteen-thirties, more or less.\" I looked away from the cross to stare at him. \"Why do you keep this here?\" I wondered. \"Nostalgia. It belonged to Carlisle's father.\" \"He collected antiques?\" I suggested doubtfully. \"No. He carved this himself. It hung on the wall above the pulpit in the vicarage where he preached.\" I wasn't sure if my face betrayed my shock, but I returned to gazing at the simple, ancient cross, just in case. I quickly did the mental math; the cross was over three hundred and seventy years old. The silence stretched on as I struggled to wrap my mind around the concept of so many years. \"Are you all right?\u201dHe sounded worried. \"How old is Carlisle?\" I asked quietly, ignoring his question, still staring up. \"He just celebrated his three hundred and sixty-second birthday,\u201dEdward said. I looked back at him, a million questions in my eyes. He watched me carefully as he spoke. \"Carlisle was born in London, in the sixteen-forties, he believes. Time wasn't marked as accurately then, for the common people anyway. It was just before Cromwell's rule, though.\" I kept my face composed, aware of his scrutiny as I listened. It was easier if I didn't try to believe. \"He was the only son of an Anglican pastor. His mother died giving birth to him. His father was an intolerant man. As the Protestants came into power, he was enthusiastic in his persecution of Roman Catholics and other religions. He also believed very strongly in the reality of evil. He led hunts for witches, werewolves\u2026 and vampires.\" I grew very still at the word. I'm sure he noticed, but he went on without pausing. \"They burned a lot of innocent people \u2014 of course the real creatures that he sought were not so easy to catch. \"When the pastor grew old, he placed his obedient son in charge of the raids. At first Carlisle was a disappointment; he was not quick to accuse, to see demons where they did not exist. But he was persistent, and more clever than his father. He actually discovered a coven of true vampires that lived hidden in the sewers of the city, only coming out by night to hunt. In those days, when monsters were not just myths and legends, that was the way many lived. \"The people gathered their pitchforks and torches, of course\" \u2014 his brief laugh was darker now \u2014 \"and waited where Carlisle had seen the monsters exit into the street. Eventually one emerged.\" His voice was very quiet; I strained to catch the words. \"He must have been ancient, and weak with hunger. Carlisle heard him call out in Latin to the others when he caught the scent of the mob. He ran through the streets, and Carlisle \u2014 he was twenty-three and very fast \u2014 was in the lead of the pursuit. The creature could have easily outrun them, but Carlisle thinks he was too hungry, so he turned and attacked. He fell on Carlisle first, but the others were close behind, and he turned to defend himself. He killed two men, and made off with a third, leaving Carlisle bleeding in the street.\" He paused. I could sense he was editing something, keeping something from me. \"Carlisle knew what his father would do. The bodies would be burned \u2014 anything infected by the monster must be destroyed. Carlisle acted instinctively to save his own life. He crawled away from the alley while the mob followed the fiend and his victim. He hid in a cellar, buried himself in rotting potatoes for three days. It's a miracle he was able to keep silent, to stay undiscovered. \"It was over then, and he realized what he had become.\" I'm not sure what my face was revealing, but he suddenly broke off. \"How are you feeling?\u201dHe asked. \"I'm fine,\" I assured him. And, though I bit my lip in hesitation, he must have seen the curiosity burning in my eyes. He smiled. \"I expect you have a few more questions for me.\" \"A few.\" His smile widened over his brilliant teeth. He started back down the hall, pulling me along by the hand. \"Come on, then,\u201dHe encouraged. \"I'll show you.\"",

            "en": "7 REPETITION        11. CULT EACH TIME THAT I OPENED MY EYES TO THE MORNING light and realized I'd lived through another night was a surprise to me. After the surprise wore off, my heart would start to race and my palms would sweat; I couldn't really breathe again until I'd gotten up and ascertained that Charlie had survived as well. I could tell he was worried\u2014watching me jump at any loud sound, or my face suddenly go white for no reason that he could see. From the questions he asked now and then, he seemed to blame the change on Jacob's continued absence. The terror that was always foremost in my thoughts usually distracted me from the fact that another week had passed, and Jacob still hadn't called me. But when I was able to concentrate on my normal life\u2014if my life was really ever normal\u2014this upset me. I missed him horribly. It had been bad enough to be alone before I was scared silly. Now, more than ever, I yearned for his carefree laugh and his infectious grin. I needed the safe sanity of his homemade garage and his warm hand around my cold fingers. I'd half expected him to call on Monday. If there had been some progress with Embry, wouldn't he want to report it? I wanted to believe that it was worry for his friend that was occupying all his time, not that he was just giving up on me. I called him Tuesday, but no one answered. Were the phone lines still having problems? Or had Billy invested in caller I.D.?  On Wednesday I called every half hour until after eleven at night, desperate to hear the warmth of Jacob's voice. Thursday I sat in my truck in front of my house\u2014with the locks pushed down\u2014keys in hand, for a solid hour. I was arguing with myself, trying to justify a quick trip to La Push, but I couldn't do it. I knew that Laurent had gone back to Victoria by now. If I went to La Push, I took the chance of leading one of them there. What if they caught up to me when Jake was nearby? As much as it hurt me, I knew it was better for Jacob that he was avoiding me. Safer for him. It was bad enough that I couldn't figure out a way to keep Charlie safe. Nighttime was the most likely time that they would come looking for me, and what could I say to get Charlie out of the house? If I told him the truth, he'd have me locked up in a rubber room somewhere. I would have endured that\u2014welcomed it, even\u2014if it could have kept him safe. But Victoria would still come to his house first, looking for me. Maybe, if she found me here, that would be enough for her. Maybe she would just leave when she was done with me. So I couldn't run away. Even if I could, where would I go? To Renee? I shuddered at the thought of dragging my lethal shadows into my mother's safe, sunny world. I would never endanger her that way. The worry was eating a hole in my stomach. Soon I would have matching punctures. That night, Charlie did me another favor and called Harry again to see if the Blacks were out of town. Harry reported that Billy had attended the council meeting Wednesday night, and never mentioned anything about leaving. Charlie warned me not to make a nuisance of myself\u2014Jacob would call when he got around to it. Friday afternoon, as I drove home from school, it hit me out of the blue. I wasn't paying attention to the familiar road, letting the sound of the engine deaden my brain and silence the worries, when my subconscious delivered a verdict it must have been working on for some time without my knowledge. As soon as I thought of it, I felt really stupid for not seeing it sooner. Sure. I'd had a lot on my mind\u2014revenge-obsessed vampires, giant mutant wolves, a ragged hole in the center of my chest\u2014but when I laid the evidence out, it was embarrassingly obvious. Jacob avoiding me. Charlie saying he looked strange, upset. . . . Billy's vague, unhelpful answers. Holy crow, I knew exactly what was going on with Jacob. It was Sam Uley. Even my nightmares had been trying to tell me that. Sam had gotten to Jacob. Whatever was happening to the other boys on the reservation had reached out and stolen my friend. He'd been sucked into Sam's cult. He hadn't given up on me at all, I realized with a rush of feeling. I let my truck idle in front of my house. What should I do? I weighed the dangers against each other. If I went looking for Jacob, I risked the chance of Victoria or Laurent finding me with him. If I didn't go after him, Sam would pull him deeper into his frightening, compulsory gang. Maybe it would be too late if I didn't act soon. It had been a week, and no vampires had come for me yet. A week was more than enough time for them to have returned, so I must not be a priority. Most likely, as I'd decided before, they would come for me at night. The chances of them following me to La Push were much lower than the chance of losing Jacob to Sam. It was worth the danger of the secluded forest road. This was no idle visit to see what was going on. I knew what was going on. This was a rescue mission. I was going to talk to Jacob\u2014kidnap him if I had to. I'd once seen a PBS show on deprogramming the brainwashed. There had to be some kind of cure. I decided I'd better call Charlie first. Maybe whatever was going on down in La Push was something the police should be involved in. I dashed inside, in a hurry to be on my way. Charlie answered the phone at the station himself. \"Chief Swan.\" \"Dad, it's Bella.\" \"What's wrong? '\" I couldn't argue with his doomsday assumption this time. My voice was shaking. \"I'm worried about Jacob.\" \"Why? \" he asked, surprised by the unexpected topic. \"I think\u2026 I think something weird is going on down at the reservation. Jacob told me about some strange stuff happening with the other boys his age. Now he's acting the same way and I'm scared.\" \"What kind of stuff? \" He used his professional, police business voice. That was good; he was taking me seriously. \"First he was scared, and then he was avoiding me, and now\u2026 I'm afraid he's part of that bizarre gang down there, Sam's gang. Sam Uley's gang.\" \"Sam Uley? \" Charlie repeated, surprised again. \"Yes.\" Charlie's voice was more relaxed when he answered. \"I think you've got it wrong, Bells. Sam Uley is a great kid. Well, he's a man now. A good son. You should hear Billy talk about him. He's really doing wonders with the youth on the reservation. He's the one who\u2014\" Charlie broke off mid-sentence, and I guessed that he had been about to make a reference to the night I'd gotten lost in the woods. I moved on quickly. \"Dad, it's not like that. Jacob was scared of him.\" \"Did you talk to Billy about this? \" He was trying to soothe me now. I'd lost him as soon as I'd mentioned Sam. \"Billy's not concerned.\" \"Well, Bella, then I'm sure it's okay. Jacob's a kid; he was probably just messing around. I'm sure he's fine. He can't spend every waking minute with you, after all.\" \"This isn't about me,\" I insisted, but the battle was lost. \"I don't think you need to worry about this. Let Billy take care of Jacob.\" \"Charlie\u2026\" My voice was starting to sound whiney. \"Bells, I got a lot on my plate right now. Two tourists have gone missing off a trail outside crescent lake.\" There was an anxious edge to his voice. \"This wolf problem is getting out of hand.\" I was momentarily distracted\u2014stunned, really\u2014by his news. There was no way the wolves could have survived a match-up with Laurent\u2026 \"Are you sure that's what happened to them? \" I asked. \"Afraid so, honey. There was\u2014\" He hesitated. \"There were tracks again, and\u2026 some blood this time.\" \"Oh!\" It must not have come to a confrontation, then. Laurent must have simply outrun the wolves, but why? What I'd seen in the meadow just got stranger and stranger\u2014more impossible to understand. \"Look, I really have to go. Don't worry about Jake, Bella. I'm sure it's nothing.\" \"Fine,\" I said curtly, frustrated as his words reminded me of the more urgent crisis at hand. \"Bye.\" I hang up. I stared at the phone for a long minute. What the hell, I decided. Billy answered after two rings. \"Hello? \" \"Hey, Billy,\" I almost growled. I tried to sound more friendly as I continued. \"Can I talk to Jacob, please? \" \"Jake's not here.\" What a shock. \"Do you know where he is? \" \"He's out with his friends.\" Billy's voice was careful. \"Oh yeah? Anyone I know? Quil? \" I could tell the words didn't come across as casually as I'd meant them to. \"No,\" Billy said slowly. \"I don't think he's with Quil today.\" I knew better than to mention Sam's name. \"Embry? \" I asked. Billy seemed happier to answer this one. \"Yeah, he's with Embry.\" That was enough for me. Embry was one of them. \"Well, have him call me when he gets in, all right? \" \"Sure, sure. No problem.\" Click. \"See you soon, Billy,\" I muttered into the dead phone. I drove to La Push determined to wait. I'd sit out front of his house all night if I had to. I'd miss school. The boy was going to have to come home sometime, and when he did, he was going to have to talk to me. My mind was so preoccupied that the trip I'd been terrified of making seemed to take only a few seconds. Before I was expecting it, the forest began to thin, and I knew I would soon be able to see the first little houses of the reservation. Walking away, along the left side of the road, was a tall boy with a baseball cap. My breath caught for just a moment in my throat, hopeful that luck was with me for once, and I'd stumbled across Jacob without hardly trying. But this boy was too wide, and the hair was short under the hat. Even from behind, I was sure it was Quil, though he looked bigger than the last time I'd seen him. What was with these Quileute boys? Were they feeding them experimental growth hormones?  I crossed over to the wrong side of the road to stop next to him. He looked up when the roar of my truck approached. Quil's expression frightened me more than it surprised me. His face was bleak, brooding, his forehead creased with worry. \"Oh, hey, Bella,\" he greeted me dully. \"Hi, Quil\u2026 Are you okay? \" He stared at me morosely. \"Fine.\" \"Can I give you a ride somewhere? \" I offered. \"Sure, I guess,\" he mumbled. He shuffled around the front of the truck and opened the passenger door to climb in. \"Where to? \" \"My house is on the north side, back behind the store,\" he told me. \"Have you seen Jacob today.\" The question burst from me almost before he'd finished speaking. I looked at Quil eagerly, waiting for his answer. He stared out the windshield for a second before he spoke. \"From a distance,\" he finally said. \"A distance? \" I echoed. \"I tried to follow them\u2014he was with Embry.\" His voice was low, hard to hear over the engine. I leaned closer. \"I know they saw me. But they turned and just disappeared into the trees. I don't think they were alone\u2014I think Sam and his crew might have been with them.\u00a0 \u00a0\"I've been stumbling around in the forest for an hour, yelling for them. I just barely found the road again when you drove up.\" \"So Sam did get to him.\" The words were a little distorted\u2014my teeth were gritted together. Quil stared at me. \"You know about that.? \" I nodded. \"Jake told me\u2026 before.\" \"Before,\" Quil repeated, and sighed. \"Jacob's just as bad as the others now? \" \"Never leaves Sam's side.\" Quil turned his head and spit out the open window. \"And before that\u2014did he avoid everyone? Was he acting upset? \" His voice was low and rough. \"Not for as long as the others. Maybe one day. Then Sam caught up with him.\" \"What do you think it is? Drugs or something? \" \"I can't see Jacob or Embry getting into anything like that\u2026 but what do I know? What else could it be?  And why aren't the old people worried? \" He shook his head, and the fear showed in his eyes now. \"Jacob didn't want to be a part of this\u2026 cult. I don't understand what could change him.\" He stared at me, his face frightened. \"I don't want to be next.\" My eyes mirrored his fear. That was the second time I'd heard it described as a cult. I shivered. \"Are your parents any help? \" He grimaced. \"Right. My grandfather's on the council with Jacob's dad. Sam Uley is the best thing that ever happened to this place, as far as he's concerned.\" We stared at each other for a prolonged moment. We were in La Push now, and my truck was barely crawling along the empty road. I could see the village's only store not too far ahead. \"I'll get out now,\" Quil said. \"My house is right over there.\" He gestured toward the small wooden rectangle behind the store. I pulled over to the shoulder, and he jumped out. \"I'm going to go wait for Jacob,\" I told him in a hard voice. \"Good luck.\" He slammed the door and shuffled forward along the road, his head bent forward, his shoulders slumped. Quil's face haunted me as I made a wide U-turn and headed back toward the Blacks'. He was terrified of being next. What was happening here?  I stopped in front of Jacob's house, killing the motor and rolling down the windows. It was stuffy today, no breeze. I put my feet up on the dashboard and settled in to wait. A movement flashed in my peripheral vision\u2014I turned and spotted Billy looking at me through the front window with a confused expression. I waved once and smiled a tight smile, but stayed where I was.  His eyes narrowed; he let the curtain fall across the glass. I was prepared to stay as long as it took, but I wished I had something to do. I dug up a pen out of the bottom of my backpack, and an old test. I started to doodle on the back of the scrap. I'd only had time to scrawl one row of diamonds when there was a sharp tap against my door. I jumped, looking up, expecting Billy. \"What are you doing here, Bella.'\" Jacob growled. I stared at him in blank astonishment. Jacob had changed radically in the last weeks since I'd seen him. The first thing I noticed was his hair\u2014his beautiful hair was all gone, cropped quite short, covering his head with an inky gloss like black satin. The planes of his face seemed to have hardened subtly, tightened\u2026 aged. His neck and his shoulders were different, too, thicker somehow. His hands, where they gripped the window frame, looked enormous, with the tendons and veins more prominent under the russet skin. But the physical changes were insignificant. It was his expression that made him almost completely <em>unrecognizable</em>. The open,\u00a0 friendly smile was gone like the hair, the warmth in his dark eyes altered to a brooding resentment that was instantly disturbing. There was a darkness in Jacob now. Like my sun had imploded. \"Jacob? \" I whispered. He just stared at me, his eyes tense and angry. I realized we weren't alone. Behind him stood four others; all tall and russet-skinned, black hair chopped short just like Jacob's. They could have been brothers\u2014I couldn't even pick Embry out of the group. The resemblance was only intensified by the strikingly similar hostility in every pair of eyes. Every pair but one. The oldest by several years, Sam stood in the very back, his face serene and sure. I had to swallow back the bile that rose in my throat. I wanted to take a swing at him. No, I wanted to do more than that. More than anything, I wanted to be fierce and deadly, someone no one would dare mess with. Someone who would scare Sam Uley silly. I wanted to be a vampire. The violent desire caught me off guard and knocked the wind out of me. It was the most forbidden of all wishes\u2014even when I only wished it for a malicious reason like this, to gain an advantage over an enemy\u2014because it was the most painful. That future was lost to me forever, had never really been within my grasp. I scrambled to gain control of myself while the hole in my chest ached hollowly. \"What do you want? \" Jacob demanded, his expression growing more resentful as he watched the play of emotion across my face. \"I want to talk to you,\" I said in a weak voice. I tried to focus, but I was still reeling against the escape of my taboo dream. \"Go ahead,\" he hissed through his teeth. His glare was vicious. I'd never seen him look at anyone like that, least of all me. It hurt with a surprising intensity\u2014a physical pain, a stabbing in my head. \"Alone!\" I hissed, and my voice was stronger. He looked behind him, and I knew where his eyes would go. Every one of them was turned for Sam's reaction. Sam nodded once, his face unperturbed. He made a brief comment in an unfamiliar, liquid language\u2014I could only be positive that it wasn't French or Spanish, but I guessed that it was Quileute. He turned and walked into Jacob's house. The others, Paul, Jared, and Embry, I assumed, followed him in. \"Okay.\" Jacob seemed a bit less furious when the others were gone. His face was a little calmer, but also more hopeless. His mouth seemed permanently pulled down at the corners. I took a deep breath. \"You know what I want to know.\" He didn't answer. He just stared at me bitterly. I stared back and the silence stretched on. The pain in his face unnerved me. I felt a lump beginning to build in my throat. \"Can we walk? \" I asked while I could still speak. He didn't respond in any way; his face didn't change. I got out of the car, feeling unseen eyes behind the windows on me, and started walking toward the trees to the north. My feet squished in the damp grass and mud beside the road, and, as that was the only sound, at first I thought he wasn't following me. But when I glanced around, he was right beside me, his feet having somehow found a less noisy path than mine. I felt better in the fringe of trees, where Sam couldn't possibly be watching. As we walked, I struggled for the right thing to say, but nothing came. I just got more and more angry that Jacob had gotten sucked in\u2026 that Billy had allowed this\u2026 that Sam was able to stand there so assured and calm\u2026  Jacob suddenly picked up the pace, striding ahead of me easily with his long legs, and then swinging around to face me, planting himself in my path so I would have to stop too. I was distracted by the overt grace of his movement. Jacob had been nearly as klutzy as me with his never-ending growth spurt. When did that changed?  But Jacob didn't give me time to think about it. \"Let's get this over with,\" he said in a hard, husky voice. I waited. He knew what I wanted. \"It's not what you think.\" His voice was abruptly weary. \"It's not what I thought\u2014I was way off.\" \"So what is it, then? \" He studied my face for a long moment, speculating. The anger never completely left his eyes. \"I can't tell you,\" he finally said. My jaw tightened, and I spoke through my teeth. \"I thought we were friends.\" \"We were.\" There was a slight emphasis on the past tense. \"But you don't need friends anymore,\" I said sourly. \"You have Sam. Isn't that nice\u2014you've always looked up to him so much.\" \"I didn't understand him before.\" \"And now you've seen the light. Hallelujah.\" \"It wasn't like I thought it was. This isn't Sam's fault. He's helping me as much as he can.\" His voice turned brittle and he looked over my head, past me, rage burning out from his eyes. \"He's helping you,\" I repeated dubiously. \"Naturally.\" But Jacob didn't seem to be listening. He was taking deep, deliberate breaths, trying to calm himself. He was so mad that his hands were shaking. \"Jacob, please,\" I whispered \"Won't you tell me what happened? Maybe I can help.\" \"No one can help me now.\" The words were a low moan; his voice broke. \"What did he do to you? \" I demanded, tears collecting in my eyes. I reached out to him, as I had once before, stepping forward with my arms wide. This time he cringed away, holding his hands up defensively. \"Don't touch me,\" he whispered. \"Is Sam catching? \" I mumbled. The stupid tears had escaped the corners of my eyes. I wiped them away with the back of my hand, and folded my arms across my chest. \"Stop blaming Sam.\" The words came out fast, like a reflex. His hands reached up to twist around the hair that was no longer there, and then fell limply at his sides. \"Then who should I blame? \" I retorted. He halfway smiled; it was a bleak, twisted thing. \"You don't want to hear that.\" \"The hell I don't!\" I snapped. \"I want to know, and I want to know now.\" \"You're wrong,\" he snapped back. \"Don't you dare tell me I'm wrong\u2014I'm not the one who got brainwashed! Tell me now whose fault this all is, if it's not your precious Sam!\" \"You asked for it,\" he growled at me, eyes glinting hard. \"If you want to blame someone, why don't you point your finger at those filthy, reeking bloodsuckers that you love so much? \" My mouth fell open and my breath came out with a whooshing sound. I was frozen in place, stabbed through with his double-edged words. The pain twisted in familiar patterns through my body, the jagged hole ripping me open from the inside out, but it was second place, background music to the chaos of my thoughts. I couldn't believe that I'd heard him correctly. There was no trace of indecision in his face. Only fury. My mouth still hung wide. \"I told you that you didn't want to hear it,\" he said. \"I don't understand who you mean,\" I whispered. He raised one eyebrow in disbelief. \"I think you understand exactly who I mean. You're not going to make me say it, are you? I don't like hurting you.\" \"I don't understand who you mean,\" I repeated mechanically. \"The Cullens,\" he said slowly, drawing out the word, scrutinizing my face as he spoke it. \"I saw that\u2014I can see in your eyes what it does to you when I say their name.\" I shook my head back and forth in denial, trying to clear it at the same time. How did he know this? And how did it have anything to do with Sam's cult? Was it a gang of vampire-haters? What was the point of forming such a society when no vampires lived in Forks anymore? Why would Jacob start believing the stories about the Cullens now, when the evidence of them was long gone, never to return?  It took me too long to come up with the correct response. \"Don't tell me you're listening to Billy's superstitious nonsense now,\" I said with a feeble attempt at mockery. \"He knows more than I gave him credit for.\" \"Be serious, Jacob.\" He glared at me, his eyes critical. \"Superstitions aside,\" I said quickly. \"I still don't see what you're accusing the... Cullens\"\u2014wince\u2014\"of. \u00a0They left more than half a year ago. How can you blame them for what Sam is doing now? \" \"Sam isn't doing anything, Bella. And I know they're gone. But sometimes\u2026 things are set in motion, and then it's too late.\" \"What's set in motion? What's too late? What are you blaming them for? \" He was suddenly right in my face, his fury glowing in his eyes. \"For existing,\" he hissed. I was surprised and distracted as the warning words came in Edward's voice again, when I wasn't even scared. \"Quiet now, Bella. Don't push him,\" Edward cautioned in my ear. Ever since Edward's name had broken through the careful walls I'd buried it behind, I'd been unable to lock it up again. It didn't hurt now\u2014not during the precious seconds when I could hear his voice. Jacob was fuming in front of me, quivering with anger. I didn't understand why the Edward delusion was unexpectedly in my mind. Jacob was livid, but he was Jacob. There was no adrenaline, no danger. \"Give him a chance to calm down,\" Edward's voice insisted. I shook my head in confusion. \"You're being ridiculous,\" I told them both. \"Fine,\" Jacob answered, breathing deeply again. \"I won't argue it with you. It doesn't matter anyway, the damage is done.\" \"What damage? \" He didn't flinch as I shouted the words in his face. \"Let's head back. There's nothing more to say.\" I gaped. \"There's everything more to say! You haven't said anything yet!\" He walked past me, striding back toward the house. \"I ran into Quil today,\" I yelled after him. He paused midstep, but didn't turn. \"You remember your friend, Quil? Yeah, he's terrified.\" Jacob whirled to face me. His expression was pained. \"Quil\" was all he said. \"He's worried about you, too. He's freaked out.\" Jacob stared past me with desperate eyes. I goaded him further. \"He's frightened that he's next.\" Jacob clutched at a tree for support, his face turning a strange shade of green under the red-brown surface. \"He won't be next,\" Jacob muttered to himself. \"He can't be. It's over now. This shouldn't still be happening. Why? Why? \" His fist slammed against the tree. It wasn't a big tree, slender and only a few feet taller than Jacob. But it still surprised me when the trunk gave way and snapped off loudly under his blows. Jacob stared at the sharp, broken point with shock that quickly turned to horror. \"I have to get back.\" He whirled and stalked away so swiftly that I had to jog to keep up. \"Back to Sam!\" \"That's one way of looking at it,\" it sounded like he said. He was mumbling and facing away. I chased him back to the truck. \"Wait!\" I called as he turned toward the house. He spun around to face me, and I saw that his hands were shaking again. \"Go home, Bella. I can't hang out with you anymore.\" The silly, inconsequential hurt was incredibly potent. The tears welled up again. \"Are you\u2026 breaking up with me? \" The words were all wrong, but they were the best way I could think to phrase what I was asking. After all, what Jake and I had was more than any schoolyard romance. Stronger. He barked out a bitter laugh. \"Hardly. If that were the case, I'd say 'Let's stay friends.' I can't even say that.\" \"Jacob\u2026 why? Sam won't let you have other friends? Please, Jake. You promised. I need you!\" The blank emptiness of my life before\u2014before Jacob brought some semblance of reason back into it\u2014reared up and confronted me. Loneliness choked in my throat. \"I'm sorry, Bella,\" Jacob said each word distinctly in a cold voice that didn't seem to belong to him. I didn't believe that this was really what Jacob wanted to say. It seemed like there was something else trying to be said through his angry eyes, but I couldn't understand the message. Maybe this wasn't about Sam at all. Maybe this had nothing to do with the Cullens. Maybe he was just trying to pull himself out of a hopeless situation. Maybe I should let him do that, if that's what was best for him. I should do that. It would be right. But I heard my voice escaping in a whisper. \"I'm sorry that I couldn't\u2026 before\u2026 I wish I could change how I feel about you, Jacob.\" I was desperate, reaching, stretching the truth so far that it curved nearly into the shape of a lie. \"Maybe\u2026 maybe I would change,\" I whispered. \"Maybe, if you gave me some time\u2026 just don't quit on me now, Jake. I can't take it.\" His face went from anger to agony in a second. One shaking hand reached out toward me. \"No. Don't think like that, Bella, please. Don't blame yourself, don't think this is your fault. This one is all me. I swear, it's not about you.\" \"It's not you, it's me,\" I whispered. \"There's a new one.\" \"I mean it, Bella. I'm not\u2026\" he struggled, his voice going even huskier as he fought to control his emotion. His eyes were tortured. \"I'm not good enough to be your friend anymore, or anything else. I'm not what I was before. I'm not good.\" \"What? \" I stared at him, confused and appalled. \"What are you saying? You're much better than I am, Jake. You are good! Who told you that you aren't? Sam? It's a vicious lie, Jacob! Don't let him tell you that!\" I was suddenly yelling again. Jacob's face went hard and flat. \"No one had to tell me anything. I know what I am.\" \"You're my friend, that's what you are! Jake\u2014don't!\" He was backing away from me. \"I'm sorry, Bella,\" he said again; this time it was a broken mumble. He turned and almost ran into the house. I was unable to move from where I stood. I stared at the little house; it looked too small to hold four large boys and two larger men. There was no reaction inside. No flutter at the edge of the curtain, no sound of voices or movement. It faced me vacantly. The rain started to drizzle, stinging here and there against my skin. I couldn't take my eyes off the house. Jacob would come back. He had to. The rain picked up, and so did the wind. The drops were no longer falling from above; they slanted at an angle from the west. I could smell the brine from the ocean. My hair whipped in my face, sticking to the wet places and tangling in my lashes. I waited. Finally the door opened, and I took a step forward in relief. Billy rolled his chair into the door frame. I could see no one behind him. \"Charlie just called, Bella. I told him you were on your way home.\" His eyes were full of pity. The pity made it final somehow. I didn't comment. I just turned robotically and climbed in my truck. I'd left the windows open and the seats were slick and wet. It didn't matter. I was already soaked. Not as bad! Not as bad! my mind tried to comfort me. It was true. This wasn't as bad. This wasn't the end of the world, not again. This was just the end of what little peace there was left behind. That was all. Not as bad, I agreed, then added, but bad enough. I'd thought Jake had been healing the hole in me\u2014or at least plugging it up, keeping it from hurting me so much. I'd been wrong. He'd just been carving out his own hole, so that I was now riddled through like Swiss cheese. I wondered why I didn't crumble into pieces. Charlie was waiting on the porch. As I rolled to a stop, he walked out to meet me. \"Billy called. He said you got in fight with Jake\u2014said you were pretty upset,\" he explained as he opened my door for me. Then he looked at my face. A kind of horrified recognition registered in his expression. I tried to feel my face from the inside out, to know what he was seeing. My face felt empty and cold, and I realized what it would remind him of. \"That's not exactly how it happened,\" I muttered. Charlie put his arm around me and helped me out of the car. He didn't comment on my sodden clothes. \"Then what did happen'\" he asked when we were inside. He pulled the afghan off the back of the sofa as he spoke and wrapped it around my shoulders. I realized I was shivering still. My voice was lifeless. \"Sam Uley says Jacob can't be my friend anymore.\" Charlie shot me a strange look. \"Who told you that? \" \"Jacob,\" I stated, though that wasn't exactly what he'd said. It was still true. Charlie's eyebrows pulled together. \"You really think there's something wrong with the Uley kid? \" \"I know there is. Jacob wouldn't tell me what, though.\" I could hear the water from my clothes dripping to the floor and splashing on the linoleum. \"I'm going to go change.\" Charlie was lost in thought. \"Okay,\" he said absently. I decided to take a shower because I was so cold, but the hot water didn't seem to affect the temperature of my skin. I was still freezing when I gave up and shut the water off. In the sudden quiet, I could hear Charlie talking to someone downstairs. I wrapped a towel around me, and cracked the bathroom door. Charlie's voice was angry. \"I'm not buying that. It doesn't make any sense.\" It was quiet then, and I realized he was on the phone. A minute passed. \"Don't you put this on Bella!\" Charlie suddenly shouted. I jumped. When he spoke again, his voice was careful and lower. \"Bella's made it very clear all along that she and Jacob were just friends\u2026 Well, if that was it, then why didn't you say so at first? No, Billy, I think she's right about this\u2026 Because I know my daughter, and if she says Jacob was scared before\u2014\" He was cut off mid-sentence, and when he answered he was almost shouting again. \"What do you mean I don't know my daughter as well as I think I do!\" He listened for a brief second, and his response was almost too low for me to hear. \"If you think I'm going to remind her about that, then you had better think again. She's only just starting to get over it, and mostly because of Jacob, I think. If whatever Jacob has going on with this Sam character sends her back into that depression, then Jacob is going to have to answer to me. You're my friend, Billy, but this is hurting my family.\" There was another break for Billy to respond. \"You got that right\u2014those boys set one toe out of line and I'm going to know about it. We'll be keeping an eye on the situation, you can be sure of that.\" He was no longer Charlie; he was Chief Swan now. \"Fine. Yeah. Goodbye.\" The phone slammed into the cradle. I tiptoed quickly across the hall into my room. Charlie was muttering angrily in the kitchen.  So Billy was going to blame me. I was leading Jacob on and he'd finally had enough. It was strange, for I'd feared that myself, but after the last thing Jacob had said this afternoon, I didn't believe it anymore. There was much more to this than an unrequited crush, and it surprised me that Billy would stoop to claiming that. It made me think that whatever secret they were keeping was bigger than I'd been imagining. At least Charlie was on my side now. I put my pajamas on and crawled into bed. Life seemed dark enough at the moment that I let myself cheat. The hole\u2014holes now\u2014were already aching, so why not? I pulled out the memory\u2014nor a real memory that would hurt too much, but the false memory of Edward's voice in my mind this afternoon\u2014and played it over and over in my head until I fell asleep with the tears still streaming calmly down my empty face. It was a new dream tonight. Rain was falling and Jacob was walking soundlessly beside me, though beneath my feet the ground crunched like dry gravel. But he wasn't my Jacob; he was the new, bitter, graceful Jacob. The smooth suppleness of his walk reminded me of someone else, and, as I watched, his features started to change. The russet color of his skin leached away, leaving his face pale white like bone. His eyes turned gold, and then crimson, and then back to gold again. His short hair twisted in the breeze, turning bronze where the wind touched it. And his face became so beautiful that it shattered my heart. I reached for him, but he took a step away, raising his hands like a shield. And then Edward vanished. I wasn't sure, when I woke in the dark, if I'd just begun crying, or if my tears had run while I slept and simply continued now. I stared at my dark ceiling. I could feel that it was the middle of the night\u2014I was still half-asleep, maybe more than half. I closed my eyes wearily and prayed for a dreamless sleep. That's when I heard the noise that must have wakened me in the first place. Something sharp scraped along the length of my window with a high-pitched squeal, like fingernails against the glass.",
